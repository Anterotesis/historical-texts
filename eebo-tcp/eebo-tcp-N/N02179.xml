            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE receiv'd and read the Book you lately ſent me, entituled, <hi>A Modeſt Proof,</hi>  in which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's profeſs'd Deſign is, <hi>to repreſent to the World what was the Primitive Model or Form of Church-Government; what was ſettled by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, in this point, and that from what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of the Matter in the Books of the New-Teſtament.</hi> Pag. 1.</p>
            <p>I obſerve the Book is ſaid to be <hi>Re printed</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> &amp;c. I don't remember, that I ever ſaw any former Edition, nor had I opportunity to peruſe this, till you were pleaſed to put your Book into my hands, deſiring my Thoughts upon it. And in return to you, I muſt ſay, after an impartial unprejudic'd Peruſal, I am far from thinking, that the Gentleman hath made a juſt Repreſentation of the <hi>Form of Church-Government ſettled by our Saviour and his Apoſtles;</hi> or, that he hath been able in any meaſure to prove <hi>his own Model</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002594_0005_0FDB7DE4B5581508"/>
from <hi>what is recorded in the Books of the New Teſtament.</hi> I can by no means joyn with the <hi>Publiſher,</hi> who in his Preface is pleas'd to call the Author's Arguments <hi>convincing;</hi> and yet I am ſenſible the Book is, for the moſt part, plauſibly written, and ſeems likely enough to draw unwary Perſons into the ſame unhappy Miſtakes, that the Author himſelf labours of. I ſhould therefore have thought it a piece of good Service, if upon the Book's firſt coming forth, any Body had preſently follow'd it with a ſuitable Anſwer. And I ſuppoſe, an Anſwer would have been given to it, with convenient ſpeed, if it had not happen'd in <hi>this,</hi> as it often does in other caſes of the <hi>like</hi> nature, that even thoſe who wiſh the Work done, are loath to be themſelves the doers of it, and wait and hope that ſome other Perſon of better Capacity, or more Leiſure, will undertake it.—But now ſince the Book hath been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (whether for this or for any other Reaſons) to paſs for ſeveral Months without any Anſwer, perhaps ſome may be diſpos'd to queſtion whether it be expedient to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, at this diſtance of Time, and at ſuch a Juncture.</p>
            <p>However, Since (I obſerve) the Book is <hi>recommended as proper to be put into the hands of the Laity;</hi> ſince (you tell me) Numbers of Copies have been induſtriouſly diſpers'd through the Town and Country; and this Author (I hear) is glory'd in as unanſwerable; and ſome unwary Readers (as I ſaid) it's probable enough, may be captivated with the ſpecious ſhew of <hi>Scripture</hi>-Argument he brings: Upon theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I cannot but incline to agree with you in thinking it convenient, and not yet out of ſeaſon, to defend our ſelves, and <hi>put into the hands of the Laity</hi> ſome juſt and proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Treatiſe lately recommended to them. For, it's better to run the hazard of a few ſevere Cenſures, than by a criminal ſilence to betray ſo important an Intereſt as we are engag'd in, and tamely ſuffer any of our too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Children or Neighbours to be ſeduced from what we look upon to be <hi>the Order of the Goſpel.</hi> Therefore, altho' I might very well excuſe my ſelf from the Task you urge me to, by pleading the better ability of others to undertake it, and the preſſure of my own Affairs, which require my utmoſt Diligence and Application; yet being ſenſible that others will be ready to make the ſame Excuſes, I am not willing that the conſideration of any private Inconveniencies ſhou'd diſcourage me from attempting to do a publick Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002594_0006_0FDB7DE861049360"/>In compliance then with your repeated Deſires, I ſhall endeavour now (in the fear of GOD and by His Help) to point out, and confute the moſt conſiderable Errors in the Book you ſent me: I ſay the moſt conſiderable, becauſe I don't intend to waſt my own Time, or exerciſe your Patience with Remarks upon every thing of ſmaller Conſquence, that is liable to exception in our Author; but ſhall only take notice of ſuch Paſſages as ſeem moſt likely to lead his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into wrong Notions, in matters of importance: of which ſort I ſhall mention four or five, before I come to that, which is the great Deſign of the Book.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Firſt</hi> is in <hi>Page</hi> 2d. Where he ſays, <hi>That the Church, however</hi> otherwiſe <hi>diſquieted, — yet heard little or no noiſe made for above</hi> 1400 <hi>Years about this point of Church-Government,</hi> ſave that <hi>one</hi> AERIUS <hi>ſtarted a Debate, but had ſo few to ſecond him, that it died with himſelf and left his Name on Record among</hi> HERETICKS.— Here it's worth while to enquire, <hi>WHO</hi> it was that rank'd him among <hi>Hereticks</hi> for his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about Church Government? Why truly <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was the firſt; who is generally obſerv'd to have been too warm in his Temper, and raſh in his Cenſures, tho' otherwiſe a worthy good Man.— And then was it <hi>only</hi> for this opinion, that he condemn'd <hi>Aerius?</hi> No indeed; but he charg'd him with <hi>Hereſy</hi> in another Point (which may well render that Father's Judgment ſuſpected.)

            <p>AND indeed at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> Prelacy was eſtabliſh'd in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on a very different Foot from that of Scripture Inſtitution.

were to hold their Biſhopricks only during the <hi>King</hi>'s pleaſure, and were impowered in the King's name, <hi>as his Delegates,</hi> to perform all the parts of the Epiſcopal Function: and Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> (that excellent and pious Martyr) ſet an Example to the Reſt in taking out one of them <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>I think theſe Things are ſufficient to ſatisfy any Man, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> never pretended Dioceſan Epiſcopacy to be of Divine Inſtitution, before the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt. And even in that Reign, matters were not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo high, as to deny the Validity of Ordination by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. <q>For when ſome that had been ordain'd by mere Preſbyters, offer'd themſelves (in King <hi>James</hi>'s time) to be conſecrated Biſhops in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> (Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>) moved this Queſtion, <hi>Whether they ſhould not firſt be Epiſcopally Ordain'd Preſbyters, that they might be capable of being admitted into the Order of Biſhops?</hi> But Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> (a moſt rigid Aſſertor of Epiſcopacy) anſwered, <hi>There was no need of it, ſince Ordination by Preſbyters was Valid.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> yielded; and immediately without repeating their Ordination as Preſbyters, they were conſecrated Biſhops <note n="‖" place="bottom">

            <p>I ſhall only add here; I cannot learn whether there has been even in <hi>England,</hi> to this very Day, properly any publick and expreſs <hi>Aſſertion</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> Right of Prelacy, either by Parliament or Convocation. I think no ſuch thing can be found either in the Thirty nine <hi>Articles,</hi> or in the <hi>Homilies,</hi> or in the <hi>Form of Ordination,</hi> or in the <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> &amp;c.— And 'tis memorable, that the lower Houſe of Convocation took occaſion (<hi>Decemb.</hi> 11. 1702) to ſend to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002594_0011_0FDB7DF48633DC30"/>
the upper Houſe a <hi>Declaration</hi> for the Divine Right: but it gave <hi>Offence.</hi> They were accus'd of aſcribing <hi>too much</hi> to Epiſcopacy: and many of their own Body Diſſented, upon this ground, that, however true the Doctrine might be, yet they queſtioned the LEGALITY of <hi>aſſerting</hi> it, being apprehenſive of the <hi>danger</hi> of making any <hi>Declaration</hi> of that Nature, in Convocation, without a <hi>Royal Licence.</hi>— Upon this the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors beg'd the Biſhops to take the Doctrine into their mature Conſideration, and to ſupport it, and diſcourage the contrary. But ſuch was their Lordſhip; wiſe Caution, that they wou'd not comply with their Deſire, and even <hi>refus'd to ſatisfy them, that they did not diſſent from them in this point.</hi>—And I know not whether ſince that time there has been any publick and legal Eſtabliſhment of the foreſaid Doctrine.</p>
            <p>AND now, as to the Judgment of the Proteſtants of <hi>Foreign Churches,</hi> Dr. <hi>John Reynolds</hi> (the Oracle of the Univerſity in his Day) ſhall be my Voucher, who tells us in his Anſwer to <hi>Sir Francis Knowles,</hi> 
               <q>That they who for this <hi>Five Hundred</hi> Years have been induſtrious in Reforming the Church, have tho't <hi>that all Paſtors (whether call'd Biſhops or Preſbyters)</hi> have, according to the Word of GOD, like Power and Authority.

And yet our Author is pleaſed to ſay (Page 3d) That at the Reformation <hi>the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, retained the ancient Order &amp; Government:</hi> which indeed is very true, it rightly underſtood; but if he means (as, if he intends any thing to his purpoſe by it, he muſt mean) to perſwade his Readers, that the greateſt part of the Reformed Churches retained <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as an Order of Men by <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> diſtinct from and ſuperior to Preſbyters. This I think is a great Miſtake, as hath been already (I ſuppoſe) ſufficiently proved.— However it is a Miſtake which I have obſerved (with ſome ſurprize) ſeveral of the Epiſcopal Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters boldly running into; the reaſon of which, I preſume is.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002594_0012_0FDB7DF65C3C0ED0"/>
That in ſome of the Foreign Proteſtant Churches <hi>Titular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> were, and ſtill are retained. I hope therefore, if not to hinder this Miſrepreſentation from being obtruded on the World any more, yet to prevent its being a Snare to ſome, by proving from their <hi>own Authentick</hi> Writings, that thoſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Churches (tho' they keep up the Name; yet) look upon a Biſhop as nothing more than <hi>Primus inter Pares,</hi> a ſort of <hi>ſtanding Moderator</hi> among his Brethren; and that they allow no Power to a Biſhop (as of Divine Inſtitution) which they deny to Presbyters.</p>
            <p>THE Truth of this will be as clear as the Sun to any Body, that will be at the pains to conſult <hi>the Harmony of their Confeſſions.</hi> It would be tedious to cite Paſſages from them all. I ſhall therefore only mention the Words of the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note n="†" place="bottom">Ha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

One did not lift up himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, nor uſurp a greater Power or Authority:— Notwithſtanding for Order's ſake, ſome one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters called the Aſſembly together, propounded the matters to be conſulted upon in the Meeting, alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Sentences <hi>(or Judgments)</hi> of the Reſt: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took Care, as much as in him lay, that there might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe no Diſorder</q>— So that it appears very plainly, that thoſe Churches abroad, which retained the Name of Biſhops after their Reformation, yet acknowledged no Superiority, or Diſtinction of Powers and Orders, among the Miniſters of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only ſubjoyn here a Teſtimony or two. Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Iremcum</hi> (Pag. 411.) having enumerated many Proteſtant Cities and Places, whoſe Church Government is in the hands of <hi>Superintendents,</hi> adds upon it, — <q>All theſe acknowlege no ſuch thing as a Divine Right of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy but ſtifly maintain <hi>Jerom</hi>'s opinion of the primitive Equality of Goſpel-Miniſters.</q>— And in the Account of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002594_0013_0FDB15C06DE77700"/>
               <hi>Denmark</hi> for the Year 1692 (ſaid to be written by the Lord <hi>Moleſworth</hi>) I find theſe Paſſages; There are (ſays he) Six <q>Superintendents in <hi>Denmark,</hi> who take it very kindly to be call'd <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>my Lord.</hi>— There are (he adds) alſo Four in <hi>Norway.</hi> Theſe (he obſerves) have no Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities; keep no Eccleſiaſtical Courts; have no Cathedrals, with Prebends, Canons, Deans, Subdeans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But are only <hi>Primi inter Pares;</hi> having the Rank above the inferior Clergy, and the Inſpection into their Doctrine &amp; Manners.</q>
And the Biſhops in <hi>Sweden</hi> are in the like Condition. Writers ſpeak very diminutively of their Power. The Author of <hi>the Preſent State of Europe</hi> for the Year 1705. obſerves, They retain little more than the Name, and a bare primary ſort of Superiority over the other Superintendents; the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion having deprived them of the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, which they exerciſed before the Reformation <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>IN fine, Let me add a Hint relating to the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is too excellent a Branch of the Reformation to be omitted. Great Pains have been taken by ſome to make the firſt Reformation there look as if it had been <hi>Epiſcopal;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for a while there were <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and becauſe there were <hi>Superintendents</hi> appointed for the Direction of the <hi>Church-Affairs.</hi> But if we look into the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of thoſe Times, we ſhall find that the Biſhops were <hi>obtruded</hi> upon the Church, by the <hi>Court;</hi> and the Superintendents were only a <hi>temporary Expedient,</hi> for the neceſſity of the Day, appointed by ſuch too as were moſt Anti-Epiſcopal in their Judgment. And (what is worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving) the Superintendants and Biſhops were both in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of Miniſters. — So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>them,</hi> it appears that at the Reformation the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was <hi>Anti-Prelatical.</hi> They that would ſee this matter argu'd, may conſult the Learned Mr. <hi>Jameſon</hi>'s <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzeni Querela</hi>

            <p>I have now ſaid enough (I ſuppoſe) to refute our Author's Miſtake, when he inſinuates. That the greateſt Part of the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> retained <hi>Prelacy.</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002594_0014_0FDB7DF7880888A8"/>THE next Paſſage I ſhall take notice of, is in the 5th <hi>Page,</hi> where our Author ſays, <hi>Perhaps at the bottom 'tis none of the leaſt Prejudices againſt Epiſcopacy, that they of that Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion have generally aſſerted the</hi> JUST RIGHTS <hi>and</hi> PRERO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATIVES <hi>of</hi> PRINCES.— <hi>and accordingly have maintained the Doctrines of</hi> NON-RESISTANCE <hi>and</hi> PASSIVE OBEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Now, This is a Conjecture, I believe, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had much better have let ſleep in his own Boſom; for, as he had no occaſion to expoſe it, ſo I think it will be far from doing him or his Cauſe any Service. In ſhort, I know of no judicious Diſſenters, that plead for the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtence,</hi> any further than it muſt be aſſerted by all, who can <hi>heartily</hi> thank God for <hi>our glorious Deliverance from Popery, and arbitrary Power by the late King</hi> WILLIAM <hi>of bleſſed Memory; as well</hi> as for <hi>the preſent happy Settlement of the Britiſh Crown in the illustrious Houſe of</hi> HANOVER: and thus far I am ſure the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath, and <hi>still does</hi> generally concur with us in aſſerting it; unleſs OCCASIONAL PERJURY, is much more practiſed by ſome ſort of Perſons, than ever Occaſional <hi>Conformity</hi> was by others. If therefore our Author ſtrains his beloved Doctrines of <hi>Non-Reſistance</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> ſo far as to ſtrike at the <hi>Revolution</hi> and <hi>preſent Settlement,</hi> I ſuppoſe the <hi>Church of England</hi> will boaſt little of ſuch a Defender, and her <hi>Rival-Government</hi> (as He is pleaſ'd to call it) will leſs envy her ſuch a Champion. But if the Gentleman holds theſe Doctrines in ſuch a <hi>limited</hi> Senſe, as is conſiſtent with his being a <hi>Loyal</hi> Subject to his preſent Majeſty, King <hi>GEORGE;</hi> then the Diſſenters and He are much better agreed in the Point of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> than He ſeems willing to have the World imagin; and there appears no juſt Foundation for the above-mention'd Cenſure. Tho' I muſt confeſs, I cannot but cloſe with another <hi>Remark,</hi> that follows it, viz. <hi>It's certain, there is too much of a</hi> CARNAL <hi>and</hi> WORLDLY <hi>Spirit, that keeps this Debate</hi> (about Church-Government) <hi>ſo long alive: and there is little hope it will die, till Chriſtians be more animated with the true Spirit and Temper of the Goſpel.</hi>— But on which Side the <hi>Fault</hi> lies chiefly, GOD knows. I would humbly ſay, in this Caſe, as <hi>David</hi> to his Father <hi>Saul, Let the LORD be Judge; and judge between Me and Thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall take Notice of one thing more (tho' it comes in here a little out of Place) before I proceed to that which is the <hi>great Point</hi> in Controverſy; becauſe I would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002594_0015_0FDB7DFC6A1A6588"/>
in the conſideration of that, by turning aſide to examin any incidental Paſſages foreign to it. The Thing I refer to is what our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, Page 12. "<hi>That the</hi> DEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONS, whoſe <hi>Ordination</hi> we have an Account of in the 6th Chapter of the <hi>Acts, were inveſted with ſome ſhare of the Apoſtolic Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particularly of Preaching &amp; Baptiſing, as well as managing the Publick Stock of the Church.</hi> Now I might here obſerve the <hi>Limitation</hi> of this Epiſcopal Deacon to <hi>Preaching &amp; Baptizing;</hi> and might ask the Reaſon, Why he mayn't likewiſe be allow'd to adminiſter the <hi>Lord's Supper?</hi> For it ſhou'd ſeem, They whoſe buſineſs it is to diſpenſe one Seal of the Covenant, muſt certainly have Authority to diſpenſe the other too. If not; where's the Rule or Reaſon, for the Diviſion of them? — But not to inſiſt on this.— One wou'd a little wonder how <hi>our Author</hi> ſhou'd fall into this unaccountable Notion, ſince he himſelf tells us (in the foregoing Page) "<hi>That the</hi> OC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CASION, DESIGN and MANNER <hi>of Inſtituting this New Order is</hi> FULLY <hi>ſet down</hi> in the ſame <hi>Chapter;</hi> and there is nothing there concerning either of <hi>theſe,</hi> that can give a Man the leaſt Suſpicion of ſuch a Thing. What then he founds his opinion in this matter upon, ſeems to be what he mentions preſently; That he ſoon after finds <hi>Philip preaching &amp; bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Stephen diſputing</hi> and <hi>doing great Wonders and Miracles among the People.</hi> And becauſe he finds one Deacon <hi>diſputing,</hi> and another <hi>preaching &amp; baptiſing,</hi> He thence unadviſedly concludes, <hi>it cannot be doubted,</hi> but that <hi>they and all the Reſt, of whom we have nothing upon Record,</hi> were inveſted (by virtue of their <hi>Ordination</hi> to the Office of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con) with Authority to preach &amp; baptiſe; notwithſtanding that, from the <hi>full Account</hi> we have of the <hi>occaſion, deſign</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> nothing more evidently appears, than that the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Buſineſs, they were ordained for, was to <hi>ſerve Tables</hi> — Now, if this Reaſoning will ſerve the Turn, it would be the eaſieſt thing in the World, by an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> exactly parallel to deſtroy the foundation of <hi>our Author's</hi> Diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſbyters, and all he hath built upon it, together with it; and ſo diſpatch all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Book in two or three Sentences</p>
            <p>FOR if we may truſt him, page 46, he finds <hi>James the Juſt, who</hi> (ſome <hi>ſuppoſe) might be one of the</hi> 70, <hi>advanced to the</hi> APOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOLIC <hi>Order.</hi> From whence (to imitate <hi>his</hi> way of arguing) it cannot be doubted but that this <hi>James,</hi> &amp; all the Reſt of the 70, were by virtue of their Commiſſion (Luk. 10) inveſted with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002594_0016_0FDB7DFE36A41538"/>
the Apoſtolic Power and Authority; notwithſtanding that from that Chapter in which we have a <hi>full account</hi> of the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, deſign,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of ſending forth the 70. nothing more appears, but that the whole Buſineſs they were commiſſion'd to, was only to <hi>preach the Goſpel, heal the Sick,</hi> and <hi>caſt out Devils.</hi> And ſo, by our Author's own method of reaſoning, the 70 will be of the ſame Office &amp; Order with the Apoſtles; and the whole Deſign of his Treatiſe will be ſuperſeded. — But not to inſiſt on the Deſtructiveneſs of this Argument of our Author's to his whole Book beſides: the plain Truth of the Caſe is this; That, after the Ordination of <hi>Philip</hi> to the Office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> it pleaſed GOD to <hi>advance</hi> him (and he might do ſo by others of his Brethren likewiſe, for ought we know) to an Office of greater Uſefulneſs and Honour, and ſend him to <hi>preach the Word and Baptiſe;</hi> for which he had the <hi>Warrant</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which enabled him to <hi>caſt out Devils</hi> and <hi>heal Diſeaſes,</hi> in teſtimony of his Miſſion from GOD (Act. 8.6, 7.) But ſurely this is no Warrant to <hi>Deacons in our days,</hi> (who are not under the immediate direction of the ſame Spirit) to preſume to do the ſame things.</p>
            <p>THE Office, which <hi>Philip</hi> was promoted to, was that of an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> We read (Act. 21.8.) <hi>of Philip the Evangeliſt, which was one of the seven,</hi> that is, one of the ſeven that were appointed to <hi>ſerve Tables,</hi> Act. 6. <hi>Philip,</hi> who was <hi>originally</hi> a Deacon in proceſs of time, and it's like pretty ſoon became an <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi> Having for ſome time <hi>uſed the Office of a Deacon well, He purchaſed to himſelf a good Degree,</hi> and merited a higher Station in the Church. Our Author owns the <hi>Deacons</hi> to be inferior to Presbyters; to the <hi>ſeventy and others of their Order</hi> (as he ſpeaks) who he ſays go by the name of <hi>Prophets</hi> in a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſenſe, <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Word: <hi>Paſtors,</hi> &amp; <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists</hi> — All theſe he makes to be but various Appellations of the <hi>ſame</hi> Order of Men, that is, <hi>Presbyters;</hi> as will appear to every one that reads his 13th and 14th Pages, however inconſiſtently he may afterwards expreſs himſelf. He makes theſe <hi>Teachers &amp; Evangeliſts</hi> to be a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Office and Order from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and from the <hi>Deacons: inferior</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>ſuperior</hi> to the <hi>Deacons,</hi> as in the Pages refer'd to. Now this Gentleman lays it down for an indiſputable Maxim elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where (pag 13, &amp; 56) That altho' all <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> the ſuperior Office or Order <hi>including</hi> the inferior; yet not <hi>vice verſa.</hi> Every Teacher (he tells us)
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002594_0017_0FDB7DFFB6D7EEA8"/>
was not an Apoſtle: We may add; Nor was every Deacon a Teacher, by the ſame Rule, the inferior Order or Office not including the ſuperior. According to his own Principles then, at the time when <hi>Philip</hi> is ſtyl'd an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> he muſt be a <hi>Presbyter</hi> (or of the Order of the ſeventy; and ſo <hi>ſuperior</hi> to a Deacon. And it is more that probable, that <hi>Philip</hi> received his preferment <hi>before</hi> his going abroad, and diſpenſing the Word and Sacraments in <hi>Samaria.</hi> What tho' there's no mention made of any <hi>ſecond Ordination</hi> he had for this End? Yet ſince he is expreſly <hi>call'd</hi> an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and did the <hi>Work</hi> of an Evangeliſt; our <hi>Author</hi>'s own Principles will oblige him to ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Deacon</hi> did not <hi>of his own Head,</hi> take upon him to execute the higher Office of an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> or Prophet; but was impower'd by ſome <hi>new</hi> Commiſſion from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (who had before ordain'd him a Deacon) or elſe that he had an <hi>extraordinary</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Call from GOD. And let him chuſe which of theſe he will, it is equally deſtructive to the Pretences of his <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Deacon,</hi> who (by virtue of an Ordination to this inferior Office only) preſumes to <hi>Baptiſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Preach:</hi> Works, no ways belonging to his Office, and what truly a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Deacon (However deſpis'd by the Adverſary, and however they ſhould ſcoff at him for any ſuch Pretences) might perform as <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably</hi> as the <hi>Church of England</hi> Deacon. I have ſome where met with this Saying of a High-flying Worthy, That a <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhop</hi> is a <hi>prating Coxcomb.</hi> Methinks this might with much more propriety be apply'd to the preaching <hi>Deacon;</hi> a thing which the Scriptures know nothing of. I am ſure there's no Countenance for it from the Caſe of <hi>Philip.</hi> Much leſs from the Caſe of <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Proto-Martyr; for, ſuppoſe <hi>him</hi> to have done all that <hi>Philip</hi> did, we muſt conclude then he had the like Preferment, and did not act in the Capacity of a <hi>Deacon</hi> (or an Officer inferior to a Presbyter) but of a <hi>Miniſter of the Word,</hi> as well as <hi>Philip.</hi>— Yet ſince <hi>Stephen</hi> did nothing but what (conſidering the extraordinary Gifts and Graces which many other Believers beſides Miniſters, had in thoſe Days; I ſay, ſince he did nothing but what) a common Chriſtian, in the like caſe, might have done, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from him appears ſo much the weaker and more groundleſs.</p>
            <p>I'm ſure the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Primitive <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Deacons, in the 6th Chap. of <hi>Acts,</hi> makes very clearly <hi>against</hi> the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Deacon. The Evidence there againſt him ſhines ſo bright
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002594_0018_0FDB7E01380D1B18"/>
at the very firſt View, that it is a wonder how any who are not Slaves to an Hypotheſis, can ever liſp a Word in his Favour. It is very obvious, The Apoſtles (who had hitherto ſuſtained that Care chiefly) judged the <hi>ſerving of Tables</hi> an intolerable Burden to them, and what they cou'd not attend without neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting too much their better and more proper Work, the Miniſtry of the Word. <hi>It is not Reaſon</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that we ſhould leave the Word of GOD, and ſerve Tables.</hi> And therefore they inſtituted an inferior Order of Men, to attend THIS BUSINESS (of ſerving Tables) that ſo the Preachers of the Goſpel (being diſcharged from this heavy incumbrance) might <hi>give themſelves continually to Prayer and to the Miniſtry of the Word;</hi> which being eſſential parts of the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they durſt not delegate theſe (however difficult) unto others to perform for them. From whence we may very reaſonably conclude, when <hi>Philip</hi> was <hi>ſent by the Spirit to preach &amp; baptiſe,</hi> that he was unloaded of his former cares and labours as a <hi>Deacon,</hi> in order to his more cloſely attending to his new Work: and <hi>ſome other</hi> Perſon, doubtleſs was ordained (if there were occaſion for it) to <hi>ſerve Tables</hi> in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>AND yet further to confirm my point, we may obſerve, that the Apoſtolical <hi>Directions</hi> concerning Deacons, exactly <hi>Harmonize</hi> with the Tenour of the Inſtitution. In 1 Epiſt. to <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 Chap. the Apoſtle gives ſome Rules about Deacons, and ſtates their neceſſary Qualifications (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>ing with <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3.) none of which have any ſpecial or immediate Reference to the Work of <hi>Preaching:</hi> altho' in the ſame Chapter where the Apoſtle is deſcribing the other Order of Men, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> or Presbyters, he ſets it down as one eſſential ſtroke in their Character, that they be <hi>apt to teach (able to teach others, and by ſound Doctrine both to exhort and convince the Gainſavers,</hi> as he elſewhere explains himſelf) which we may well aſſure our ſelves, wou'd have been preſcribed as a neceſſary qualification of a <hi>Deacon</hi> likewiſe, if it had been the Will of GOD, that <hi>Deacons</hi> ſhould ordinarily be <hi>Preachers</hi> of the Word. But in ſtead of that, He only requires that thoſe of this Order ſhould be Men of Piety, Prudence, Gravity, Temperance, Generoſity and the like.— I hope therefore none of our <hi>Deacons,</hi> that are Ordained (as I wiſh they all were when they have <hi>firſt been proved</hi>) will be drawn to doubt, whether they be of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Institution,</hi> only becauſe they are not called upon to Preach; ſince 'tis plain it never was the Will of GOD they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002594_0019_0FDB7E055EE20568"/>
ſhould, but that they give themſelves to the <hi>Miniſtry of Tables,</hi> the <hi>Lord's</hi> Table and the <hi>Poor</hi>'s; as the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Ordination, having reference to this ſpecial Office, explains it; declaring there, <hi>That it appertains to the Deacon</hi>'s <hi>Office to aſſiſt the Presbyter in diſtribution of the Elements, gladly &amp; willingly to ſearch for the Poor the Sick &amp; Impotent, that they may be relieved:</hi> Praying <hi>that they may be modeſt, humble, and conſtant in their Miniſtration</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">See the <hi>Contin.</hi> of <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotat. on Phil. 1.1.</note>.</p>
            <p>But thus much for the <hi>Deacons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to conſider with <hi>our Author,</hi> the <hi>Order and Government ſetled by CHRIST and his Apoſtles in the Church.</hi> In which the Gentleman's principal deſign is to prove, that there were two diſtinct Orders of Goſpel-Miniſters inſtituted by CHRIST himſelf; a <hi>Superior Order</hi> now commonly called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> inveſted with <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> the Church, and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain</hi> proper Officers in it, as well as to preach the <hi>Word</hi> and adminiſter the <hi>Sacraments:</hi> and an <hi>inferior Order,</hi> commonly called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who are inſtituted only to preach the <hi>Word,</hi> and adminiſter the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and had no power of <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> committed to them I ſay this is his principal deſign; for as to the <hi>Order of Deacons,</hi> which was inſtituted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> he well obſerves, pag. 13 <hi>That there is no debate about them;</hi> ſave in the point that hath already been conſidered; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>Deacons</hi> were by their Ordination inveſted with Authority to preach and baptiſe, which (I ſuppoſe) I have ſufficiently proved they have not.</p>
            <p>IN proſecution of what I have ſaid to be our Author's great Deſign, he refers us to the <hi>Miſſion,</hi> firſt of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> Luke 9. and afterwards of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> Luke 10. Upon which he truly obſerves pag. 10. <hi>That they were both ſent forth with the</hi> SAME <hi>Commiſſion, and the</hi> SAME <hi>Power to preach the Goſpel, to caſt out Devils, to heal Diſeaſes, and almoſt in all things with the ſame Inſtructions concerning their Conduct.</hi> And yet he tells us, pag. 11. <hi>That it is moſt certain they were two diſtinct Orders of Goſpel Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT upon what, the pretended Difference of Order between them can be founded, I muſt confeſs it is not eaſy to me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Yet to confirm this Point by Teſtimony, he tells us, page 10. That <hi>Calvin</hi> ſcruples not to call the 70, <hi>in Dignity leſs than the Apoſtles, next in Office to them,</hi> &amp;c. But it muſt be obſerved
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002594_0020_0FDB7E07F7609AF0"/>
here that in this he <hi>impoſes</hi> on his Readers; for <hi>Calvin</hi> is there deſcribing <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> of whom he affirms roundly that they were inferior to the Apoſtles; but he mentions the 70 only <hi>tranſiently</hi> and ſpeaks <hi>doubtfully</hi> of then ſubordination to the Twelve. Per <hi>Evangeliſtas,</hi> eos intelligo, qui quum dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate eſſent Apoſtolis minores, &amp;c. Quales fuerunt <hi>Lucas, Timotheur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ac</hi> FORTASSIS <hi>etiam ſeptuaginta Diſcipuli, quos ſecundo ah Apoſtolis loco Chriſtus deſignavit.</hi> He only ſays of the 70 Diſciples, that they were appointed <hi>after</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, (referring to the <hi>time</hi> of their <hi>Miſſion,</hi> not the <hi>degree</hi> of their <hi>Dignity;</hi> as ſeems evident from the ſcope of the place) and that <hi>perhaps</hi> they were <hi>inferiour</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>AND whereas our <hi>Author</hi> mentions two Inſtances of a difference in the Miſſion of the 12 from that of the 70, <hi>viz.</hi> Their more ſolemn <hi>Inauguration</hi> to their Office, and their being particularly called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. I would obſerve, as to the firſt Article, that it does not appear to me, but that the <hi>Inauguration</hi> of both was <hi>equally ſolemn.</hi> What tho' we do not read of our Saviour's <hi>praying</hi> in ſo ſolemn a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſending out the 70, as before the Miſſion of the 12, yet that argues little; for there were many things that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did (as the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> remarks) which are <hi>not written.</hi> And then having ſent our the 70, as our <hi>Author</hi> owns, upon the <hi>ſame Errand,</hi> and with the <hi>like Powers,</hi> 'tis <hi>highly probable</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> of their Miſſion was <hi>equally ſolemn.</hi> But then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there was <hi>no</hi> ſuch ſolemn Prayer before the Miſſion of the 70, as we read preceded the Miſſion of the 12, that makes no difference; ſince we cannot be <hi>ſure</hi> that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <hi>Prayer</hi> on the night before did <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>peculiarly</hi> refer to <hi>their</hi> Miſſion; becauſe, I ſuppoſe we ſometimes read of our Saviour's making like <hi>ſolemn Prayer,</hi> when <hi>no</hi> remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Events followed, nor <hi>any</hi> known extraordinary occaſion was the Ground thereof.</p>
            <p>AND now as to his other Inſtance, that the 12 were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly honored with the Title of APOSTLES, in Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the 70, this may poſſibly be a miſtake; for when we are told, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.1. <hi>After theſe things the Lord appointed</hi> OTHER 70 ALSO <hi>and ſent</hi> them out, (with the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Powers) it may be very well read, <hi>other</hi> 70 <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> altho' it is not ſo expreſſed. And indeed our <hi>Author</hi> is pleaſed (in <hi>pag.</hi> 19.) to ſay of the 70, that they were CHRIST's <hi>Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors, ſo far as their Commiſſion
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002594_0021_0FDB7E0977CE50E0"/>
extended.</hi> Now he over and over confeſſes their Commiſſion was the <hi>ſame</hi> with that of the 12; and therefore (according to his own Rule) the honorary Title of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> belong'd <hi>equally</hi> to them. And here it's worth while to obſerve, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diminutive he may make the name of <hi>Diſciples</hi> to be, 'tis no other than what the <hi>Eleven</hi> were diſtinguiſhed by, when they received their Commiſſion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16. They are called, <hi>The Eleven Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE offers <hi>two Arguments</hi> further to ſhow that the 12 &amp; the 70 were two diſtinct orders of Goſpel-Miniſters. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>they are never numbered together, but in two diſtinct Claſſes</hi>—.How often (pray) are they numbered ſo? We don't find the 70, ſpoken of above twice, that is, at their <hi>Miſſion,</hi> and upon their <hi>Return:</hi> and this <hi>ſeparately</hi> or by <hi>themſelves;</hi> the 12 not being mentioned in the Story. We don't any where (that I re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>member) find the 12 and the 70. mentioned in the ſame-place, and numbered in two diſtinct Claſſes. And as for the <hi>Apoſtles being ſtill called</hi> 12 <hi>and not</hi> 82; that is eaſily accounted for: inaſmuch as the Miſſion of the 70 was a <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>occaſional</hi> thing; and we never read of any <hi>ſecond</hi> Miſſion, or further imployment of them, as <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Preachers,</hi> after their <hi>Return</hi> from the Miſſion we have an Account of. Whereas the other 12 were <hi>ſtill</hi> employed on every occaſion, and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> were with their Maſter, as his <hi>ſpecial Attendants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now for his <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument, (which he boaſts will put the matter out of all diſpute) <hi>What a ſolemn Work</hi> (ſays he) <hi>was there, at the tranſlation of one from the number of Diſciples, that he might be reckoned with the Eleven, and ſucceed to</hi> Judas <hi>his Apoſtleſhip?</hi> And again, <hi>pa.</hi> 41. he bids us remember, <hi>that the</hi> WHOLE SEVENTY <hi>could not fill up the Chair of</hi> ONE APOSTLE, &amp;c. But there is no weight in this, if we conſider what were the <hi>neceſſary qualifications</hi> of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> viz. an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Call, extraordinary Gifts, having been an Eye witneſs to the Life, Sufferings and Reſurrection of CHRIST, &amp;c. and that CHRIST at his Aſcenſion left <hi>none other</hi> Miniſters in Commiſſion but the <hi>Eleven.</hi> For as to the 70, they were not in Being then, as <hi>Miniſters of the Word;</hi> their Commiſſion having <hi>expired</hi> long before, and <hi>not</hi> being <hi>renewed</hi> as was that of the <hi>Eleven.</hi> And then, I ſuppoſe, it is uncertain, whether <hi>Matthias</hi> was of that number, were they ſtill in Commiſſion. So that, putting theſe things together, it appears, that <hi>Matthias's</hi> ſucceſſion to <hi>Judas</hi> in the Apoſtleſhip (however ſolemn Work
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002594_0022_0FDB7E0D283B1E38"/>
there was about it) affords no manner of Argument for a <hi>Difference of Order</hi> between the 70 and the 12.</p>
            <p>AND truely whatever <hi>Diſtinction</hi> between them may be pretended, ſure I am, it could not be <hi>that</hi> which our Author would fain prove between <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters.</hi> For neither the 70, nor yet the 12, had any power given them at their firſt <hi>Miſſion</hi> to <hi>ordain Officers,</hi> or to govern the Church; nor indeed could they: for at this time there was no <hi>Goſpel Church</hi> to be <hi>governed,</hi> or to have <hi>Officers ſettled</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>TO this purpoſe Mr. <hi>Sage</hi> (a conſiderable Writer, of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) ſaith, <q>It is moſt obviouſly obſervable, in the Evangelical Records, that the Chriſtian Church was not (could not be) founded, till our Lord was riſen, ſeeing it was to be founded upon his Reſurrection. (He goes on) Our Martyr <hi>Cyprian</hi> (as appears from his Reaſonings on diverſe occaſions) ſeems very well to have known, and very diſtinctly to have obſerved, that <hi>the Apoſtles themſelves got not their Commiſſion to be Governours of the Chriſtian Church, till</hi> after <hi>the Reſurrection.</hi> And no wonder, for this their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is moſt obſervably recorded.</q> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21, &amp;c. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Vindic. of the Princ. of the <hi>Cypr.</hi> age. Ch. 6. Sect. 5. Vid. <hi>Anderſ</hi> Def pag. 78.</note>.</p>
            <p>NOR doth it appear that the Commiſſion of the 70 (<hi>Luk.</hi> 10) was any thing more than <hi>temporary;</hi> for tho' our Author is pleaſed to ſpeak of <hi>them</hi> once and again, in ſuch a manner as ſeems to intimate, that they are often mentioned in the New Teſtament: yet I don't remember, nor can I find that we ever read any thing of them, after their <hi>Return</hi> from this Miſſion; as I hinted before.</p>
            <p>AND indeed, I cannot tell whether the <hi>Twelve</hi> would, by virtue of their Commiſſion <hi>at this time,</hi> have had any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity either to <hi>baptiſe</hi> or <hi>preach,</hi> after our Lord's Aſcenſion, if their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> for theſe things had not been renewed. For CHRIST himſelf thought it needful, to give them a <hi>new Charge</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> &amp; <hi>baptiſe,</hi> at the ſame time that he committed to them the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Ordination,</hi> juſt before his Aſcenſion. To this purpoſe Mr. <hi>Sage</hi> adds to what he ſays above, <q>No ſuch thing is any where recorded of the <hi>Seventy</hi> (as the Renewal of their Commiſſion;) nothing more certain than that their Commiſſion which is recorded, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. did conſtitute them only temporary Miſſionarys and that for an Errand which could not poſſibly be more
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002594_0023_0FDB7E0FB1AA6AA0"/>
than temporary. That Commiſſion contains in its own boſom, clear evidences, that it did not inſtall them in any ſtanding Office in the Chriſtian Church, <hi>which was not yet in being,</hi> when they got it. Could than Commiſſion which is <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. any more conſtitute the 70 ſtanding Officers of the Chriſtian Church, than the like Commiſſion recorded <hi>Math.</hi> 10. cou'd conſtitute the <hi>Twelve</hi> ſuch ſtanding Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers? But it is manifeſt that this Commiſſion did not conſtitute the <hi>Twelve</hi> Governours of the Chriſtian, Church; otherwiſe what need of a <hi>new Commiſſion</hi> to that purpoſe after the Reſurrection? Preſumable therefore it is that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not <hi>at all</hi> believe that the 70 had any Succeſſors, Office-bearers in the Chriſtian Church, ſeeing it is ſo obſervable, that <hi>they themſelves</hi> received no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be ſuch Office-bearers.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Sage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT leaſt thus much is certain, that without <hi>further Powers</hi> given them after our Saviour's Reſurrection, the Apoſtles themſelves muſt never have gone to <hi>the Gentiles.</hi> For in our Lord's Commiſſion to them <hi>Matth.</hi> 10, they are expreſly charged <hi>not to go into the way of the Gentiles, but only to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> From whence it will follow either that the 70 had a <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>more honorable</hi> Commiſſion than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had <hi>at firſt</hi> and ſo were ſuperior to them; or that the Commiſſion of the 70 was but <hi>temporary;</hi> or if it were perpetual, yet that it never was extended by CHRIST <hi>beyond the Circumciſion</hi> I think no <hi>fourth</hi> ſuppoſition can be made; ſo that <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> of thoſe <hi>three</hi> muſt be allowed. And which ever our Author thinks fit to grant, it will be the confuſion of his Scheme Beſure he won't be willing to grant the <hi>firſt,</hi> that the <hi>ſeventy</hi> had a larger and more honorable Commiſſion, and were ſuperior to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And I think no body ever yet ſuppoſed it. Nor will the <hi>ſecond</hi> pleaſe him better; for if the Commiſſion of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> was but <hi>temporary,</hi> and expired upon their return to their Maſter, then it will follow, that CHRIST left not <hi>two</hi> but <hi>only one Order of Officers</hi> in his Church, at his Aſcenſion If therefore he ſhould choſe the <hi>third</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal (which at firſt view ſeems moſt favorable to his cauſe) that the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> did not <hi>expire,</hi> but that it was <hi>confined</hi> to the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> yet neither will this ſerve his Turn. For if the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the 70 was not extended by CHRIST to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> then we have no concern at all with it, nor did CHRIST leave any other <hi>Officers in Commiſſion</hi> at his Aſcenſion, that had any thing to do with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> beſides
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002594_0024_0FDB7E1106D54480"/>
his <hi>Eleven Apoſtles;</hi> but to <hi>them</hi> he committed the whole Care of <hi>diſcipling all Nations, preaching</hi> the <hi>Word, adminiſtring</hi> the <hi>Sacraments, governing</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>ordaining</hi> others to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> and <hi>ſucceed</hi> them in this important Charge; and <hi>promiſed</hi> for their encouragement, to be with <hi>them,</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> in it always, even to the end of the World. Now if CHRIST, at his Aſcenſion, left <hi>no other Officers in Commiſſion</hi> beſides his <hi>Eleven Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>no others in Commiſſion that extended unto the Gentiles,</hi> then all that our Author <hi>advances,</hi> under his <hi>firſt head,</hi> concerning the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> comes to nothing. For whether that <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was <hi>temporary,</hi> on whether it was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained</hi> to the <hi>lost ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> we are alike uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with it. And ſo likewiſe all the pains he takes under his <hi>ſecond head,</hi> to ſhow how the Office of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the Office of the <hi>ſeventy,</hi> were diſtinguiſhed from each other, will be found to be labour ſpent to no purpoſe. For ſince we never read that CHRIST extended the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it will thence follow, either that he ſuffered their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to expire, or that he left it <hi>confined</hi> to the <hi>Jews:</hi> And take it which way you will, you can find ſtill but <hi>one Order of Officers instituted by CHRIST himſelf,</hi> with whom the <hi>Gentile Churches</hi> have any thing to do.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>the moſt</hi> of what the Gentleman ſays beſides under his <hi>ſecond general head,</hi> I have no controverſy at all with him. For I readily, acknowledge what he aſſerts <hi>pa.</hi> 17, That the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> given by our Saviour to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> was <hi>unlimited and univerſal, not only in reſpect of</hi> power <hi>to diſcharge all acts of Religion, relating either to</hi> miniſtry <hi>or</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; <hi>but alſo in reſpect of</hi> place, <hi>not being confined to any particular</hi> Province, <hi>but ſent to the whole</hi> World.</p>
            <p>AND (tho' ſome of the Inſtances he gives, won't bear ſcanning, yet) I firmly believe as he ſayes, <hi>pa.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>That it appears the Apoſtles had</hi> (ſome ſort of) <hi>Authority over other Paſtors and Teachers in the Church, from ſeveral Inſtances of their exerciſing of it, in ſeveral reſpects and ways, recorded in the ſacred Hiſtory.</hi> And I will venture to ſay further, that during the <hi>Infant-State</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, before the Canon of the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> was compleated, (without which the uninſpired <hi>man of GOD</hi> could not be <hi>thoroughly furniſhed unto every good work</hi>) it was abſolutely neceſſary, that ſome kind of <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> over the <hi>uninſpired Paſtors</hi> of the Churches, ſhould be committed to ſuch men as the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who being under the immediate Conduct of an <hi>infallible Spirit,</hi> might be able as often as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002594_0025_0FDB7E129CF9E090"/>
required, with all <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>charge</hi> &amp; <hi>direct</hi> the other <hi>Paſtors how to behave themſelves in the houſe of GOD.</hi> A notable Inſtance we have of this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15. where notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſingular advantages <hi>Timothy</hi> had had to inform himſelf about the <hi>Work of an Evangelist,</hi> by his intimate acquaintance with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and frequent attendance upon him; yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is afraid, that if he ſhould be hindered from coming to him as ſoon as he deſired, <hi>Timothy</hi> might be at a loſs how to diſcharge the Truſt repoſed in him; and therefore he writes unto him the ſolemn Charges, Exhortations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of that Epiſtle, that <hi>he might know how he ought to behave himſelf in the Church of the living GOD.</hi> And not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with this, he followed it with a <hi>ſecond Epiſtle</hi> on the ſame Deſign afterwards.</p>
            <p>NOW, if it be evident that the Apoſtles had ſome ſort of Juriſdiction over other Paſtors; and if it be alſo evident that there was an abſolute neceſſity, <hi>at that day,</hi> that ſome ſuch men as they ſhould have ſuch Juriſdiction; it may very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be inquired, <hi>Whether there is the ſame neceſſity ſince, that ſome of the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould have a like Authority over others throughout all Ages?</hi> And, <hi>Whether the Scriptures teach us that this is the Will of GOD?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Inquiries;</hi> it is very obvious on two Accounts, <hi>That the ſame Reaſon does not hold in the nature of the thing it ſelf, for a ſuperior power in ſome Miniſters over others now.</hi> For <hi>firſt,</hi> there are no Officers in the Church in theſe later Ages, under the Conduct of an <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> to iſſue out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and commands to others on emergent occaſions. Nor indeed is there any body on this ſide <hi>Rome</hi> that pretends to it. Now it's thought by ſome of great name and judgment, That the higher Degree of Authority &amp; Sway, which the Apoſtles had above others, was owing very much to their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts of Infallibility, of diſcerning Spirits, and the like, which were peculiar to them. And indeed there's the greateſt difficulty (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves) to diſcern how much of their power over Presbyters or Biſhops was <hi>merely</hi> from the Excellency of their Gifts and Privileges, and how much might be (if any was) from their Supremacy of Office and Imperial Authority. Nor, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> is there the ſame <hi>Need</hi> that there ſhould be any ſuch <hi>infallible Rulers</hi> in the Church now, that there was in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dayes; becauſe the <hi>Canon of Scripture</hi> being now completed, every Miniſter of the Goſpel hath
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002594_0026_0FDB7E140BF2BF10"/>
an infallible and perfect Rule to direct him in his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To this purpoſe our <hi>Author (pag.</hi> 33, 34) acknowlegeth, as that <hi>the Goſpel-Doctrine being once ſufficiently atteſted &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by miraculous operations, there was no further need of continuing them; So, that ſome Things peculiar to the Apostles, ſuch as, their being</hi> infallible Guides in delivering the Doctrine of the Goſpel, their unlimited Commiſſion, <hi>&amp;c. had a particular Reſpect to the</hi> firſt planting <hi>of the Goſpel, and the erecting and constituting of the Chriſtian Church in the World: which when performed, theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Powers ceaſed.</hi>—Since therefore the ſame Reaſons don't hold good <hi>now</hi> for a ſuperiority of ſome Miniſters over others, we have no ground to believe that ſuch a ſuperiority ought to continue ſtill, <hi>unleſs the Scriptures teach us notwithſtanding, that it is the Will of GOD that this ſuperiority ſhould be standing and perpetual in the Church.</hi> And this is what our <hi>Author</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove under his third Head.</p>
            <p>BUT before the Examination of his Argument here, I muſt premiſe, that he and I are agreed, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with <hi>ſome Powers that were extraordinary &amp; temporary, and expired with their Perſons;</hi> and that therefore in <hi>theſe</hi> they could have no Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>Again, WE are agreed, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were inveſted with other <hi>powers that were ordinary &amp; deſigned to be perpetual,</hi> in which they were to have <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> who ſhould poſſeſs them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages. And with an eye to their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> it was that their Lord <hi>promiſed</hi> to <hi>be with them always to the end of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW ſince we are both agreed in theſe two things, (and have (I think) the concurrence of all the World both <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> &amp; <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> with us in them,) the only thing that remains to be diſputed is, Whether <hi>that Juriſdiction</hi> which was exerciſed by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> over <hi>other Paſtors,</hi> was <hi>one of their</hi> ORDINARY POWERS, <hi>in which they were to have</hi> SUC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSORS? Or, <hi>Whether it was a power only</hi> EXTRORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARY <hi>and</hi> TEMPORARY, <hi>in which they were to have no Succeſſors, and to expire with their Perſons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW here the force of truth hath conſtrained our <hi>Author</hi> to make an acknowledgement, which is in effect at once to give up his whole cauſe. For he himſelf in his 33d <hi>page,</hi> reckons <hi>the Juriſdiction the Apoſtles had over all Churches</hi> (and by conſequence over the Paſtors of them alſo) among <hi>thoſe Powers that were extraordinary &amp; temporary, and expired with their Perſons:</hi> By doing which, he hath (I ſay) in effect at once
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002594_0027_0FDB7E1577F2D870"/>
given up his whole cauſe; for hereby he hath cut himſelf off from all poſſibility of proving, by the Inſtances he gives, <hi>any ordinary power of Juriſdiction in the Apoſtles over other Paſtors.</hi> For ſuppoſing he had given ten thouſand Inſtances, in which the <hi>Apostles</hi> exerciſed an <hi>Authority</hi> over other <hi>Paſtors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yet all theſe might be, for ought he or any man elſe can tell, not by virtue of any <hi>ordinary power,</hi> they were intruſted with, in which they were to have ſucceſſors; but only by virtue of <hi>that extraordinary Power in which they were to have no Succeſſors,</hi> by which he acknowleges it was, that <hi>they had a Juriſdiction over all other Churches.</hi> So that here I might very fairly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my hand from the Table; for the Gentleman hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf put it out of his own power to prove any thing by the Argument he makes uſe of. And yet I ſuppoſe it was not <hi>want of thought</hi> but <hi>force of truth,</hi> and <hi>unavoidable neceſſity,</hi> that drew him into this Acknowlegement ſo fatal to his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For any man that will be at the pains to examin the Inſtances he hath given of the <hi>Apostles Authority</hi> over other Paſtors, and will then carefully look over the Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians, Philippians, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (to mention no more) will preſently find many Inſtances juſt like the moſt of thoſe given by our Author, (nay ſome of <hi>his</hi> may be taken into the number alſo) in which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exerciſed an <hi>Authority</hi> over <hi>Timothy, Titus, Epaphroditus,</hi> and others, whom <hi>Epiſcopal Divines</hi> account <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Now this obſervation being ſo very eaſy, forced our Author upon this unhappy <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to affirm that the Apoſtle exerciſed an <hi>Authority</hi> over ſuch as <hi>Epiſcopal Divines</hi> account <hi>Biſhops,</hi> by virtue of his <hi>ordinary Power</hi> [for no man is able to give me any tolerable Reaſon, why his Government over <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould be grounded on an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Power, and yet his Government over <hi>Paſtors</hi> be by virtue of his ordinary Power] <hi>that was to be perpetuated in the Church;</hi> which would be to ſet up <hi>an ordinary Officer in the Church by divine Institution ſuperior to Biſhops;</hi> a thing contrary to the declared ſenſe of our Author and his Brethren: or elſe, to avoid the ill conſequence of this, he muſt ſay, that this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Apoſtles over all Churches &amp; Paſtors was one of their Extraordinary Powers;</hi> which ſort of powers he elſewhere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges <hi>expired with their perſons</hi> and <hi>that they had no ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in them.</hi> And this latter inconvenience he hath thought fit to chooſe, though it be no leſs deſtructive to his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, than the former, as I have ſhown above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:002594_0028_0FDB7E1946647980"/>I have now ſaid enough (I ſuppoſe) to ſatisfy every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent unprejudiced Perſon of the weakneſs and Inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of our <hi>Author</hi>'s Proofs of his own Scheme. However I am content to follow him ſtill longer, with Remarks upon ſome further Paſſages, in which he more and more weakens and perplexes the Cauſe he pleads for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. he ſays, <hi>That no part of the Apoſtolick Office is more neceſſary to be of perpetual duration in the Church, than their authoritative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection over the ordinary Paſtors.</hi> That he hath as yet proved no neceſſity of this from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> hath been I ſuppoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly ſhown. And that there is no neceſſity of it <hi>in the nature of the thing it ſelf</hi> (to omit what hath been ſaid already) any man may ſatisfy himſelf, if he will but impartially inquire, whether the <hi>Ends of Government</hi> are not as well anſwered, the Intereſts of <hi>Religion</hi> as effectually promoted, and the <hi>Church</hi> as well guarded againſt Errors, Schiſms and Corruptions, in thoſe <hi>Countries,</hi> which acknowlege no <hi>Superiority</hi> in Paſtors one over another, as in thoſe <hi>two Kingdoms,</hi> that are the only <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ones, in which ſuch a Superiority is held to be of Divine Inſtitution?</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Author</hi> now attempts to produce ſome <hi>further</hi> Proofs of his Scheme from the holy-Scriptures. Several Texts he brings to prove that the <hi>Apostolic Office</hi> (he muſt here eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally point at the power of <hi>univerſal Inſpection</hi> over Churches and Paſtors, or elſe he ſays nothing to the purpoſe) <hi>was not extraordinary and temporary,</hi> but deſign'd to be ſtanding and perpetual.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, He draws an Argument from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. Where <hi>CHRIST enjoyns the Apoſtles to teach all Nations, whom they ſhould diſciple, to obſerve all things whatſoever he had commanded them,</hi> and <hi>gives them a Promiſe to be with them to the end of the World.</hi> This he calls their <hi>full</hi> &amp; <hi>laſt Commiſſion:</hi> by this therefore they muſt ſtand or fall, and the Gentleman muſt deſpair of his Cauſe, if this will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
            <p>NOW there's nothing contained in this, but what is the work of <hi>ordinary Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Paſtors.</hi> Teaching and baptizing, which are the undoubted work of Presbyters, are here <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly</hi> mention'd: but indeed we muſt interpret this Text, in the utmoſt Latitude, ſo as to take in all miniſterial Powers, of Ordination, Diſcipline, and Government, as being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply'd. Here's the grand <hi>Charter</hi> for our Office, and all the Power that any can juſtly claim, muſt be here included.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002594_0029_0FDB7E1B745650C0"/>
And the <hi>whole</hi> of the Power here imply'd, belongs to all thoſe, unto whom the Commiſſion extends. Now it was given (our Author owns) not merely to the Apoſtles, but alſo to their <hi>Succeſſors:</hi> and ſo the <hi>Promiſe</hi> annexed, is to their <hi>Office,</hi> not to their <hi>Perſons</hi> only. And the <hi>Office</hi> they were authoriz'd to, by this Commiſſion, was not to expire with them, but to <hi>continue</hi> unto the <hi>end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE muſt note, The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> may be conſidered under a <hi>double</hi> notion, as having either <hi>ordinary</hi> or <hi>extraordinary</hi> Powers. This Commiſſion was given them, in one or other, or both, of theſe Capacities. So far as it cou'd relate to them in their <hi>extraordinary</hi> Capacity, it muſt be only <hi>Perſonal,</hi> and a Patent for Life, expiring with themſelves; or at moſt continuing only through the Age of Inſpiration and Miracles. But ſo far as it related to them in their <hi>ordinary</hi> Character, it was deſign'd to be <hi>perpetual,</hi> and the Promiſe belongs to their Succeſſors in common with them.—That it relates to them under the <hi>latter</hi> Conſideration more eſpecially, is evident from the Tenor of the Commiſſion, which preſcribes only Work that is ordinary; and from the Tenor of the Promiſe, which looks to all future Ages, and therefore ſuppoſes their perpetual Duration. But in theſe things the Author and I are agreed.</p>
            <p>ALL the <hi>Diſpute</hi> here is, Who are the true <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> of the Apoſtles; and ſo, who may lay Claim to this Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Promiſe? Now there are two things which may ſuffice to decide the Caſe: <hi>viz.</hi> The nature of the <hi>Work</hi> laid out in the Commiſſion, and the <hi>Character</hi> of the Apoſtles in their <hi>ordinary</hi> Capacity. And by both of theſe Rules (I preſume) it muſt be concluded that <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>ordinary Paſtors</hi> are the Apoſtles <hi>true Succeſſors.</hi> For the <hi>Work</hi> here aſſign'd is what (as I before obſerv'd) properly belongs to <hi>Them;</hi> who have ever therefore repair'd to this Commiſſion, to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the miniſterial Acts of <hi>preaching, baptiſing,</hi> &amp;c.—And then if we conſider the <hi>Apostles</hi> in their <hi>ordinary Capacity,</hi> it will appear they were moſt properly <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or <hi>Miniſters of the Word,</hi> and could be <hi>Biſhops</hi> only in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Senſe Be ſure they were not Biſhops after the <hi>Engliſh Form,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo to be: for according to this, our Lord muſt have aſſign'd to each of the Apoſtles his <hi>diſtinct Province,</hi> his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Poſt, or Charge, to act and rule in, with a mutual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency; ſeeing they are the approved Principles of that Model, <hi>That all Biſhops are</hi> equal, <hi>and have no Eminency of Power one above another:</hi> So likewiſe <hi>that every Church muſt have its
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002594_0030_0FDB7E1D01813D18"/>
particular Biſhop, and that there can be in a Church but</hi> one <hi>Prelate at a time.</hi> Whereas if we reflect, we ſhall find, that a <hi>Plorality</hi> (even no leſs than 11 or 12) preſided together over the Church in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the beginning; and that the Apoſtles tarry'd there a <hi>conſiderable Time,</hi> (as the ſacred Story aſſures us, and if ſome ancient Church-Hiſtories may be credited, it was no leſs than the ſpace of ſeveral <hi>Years) taking Care of that Church</hi> (which called for peculiar Regards from them) in it's <hi>Infant</hi> State: at leaſt it may be believed they ordinarily reſided in and about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for a while; perhaps only when there was uncommon occaſion, iſſuing out upon particular Miſſions, and then returning to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> as ſeems very probable from the Inſtance we have, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14 — 25 And now in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>that Church,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> acted, either with an equal or an unequal Authority. And take it which way you pleaſe, they could not be <hi>Biſhops</hi> after the Dioceſan notion. For if they all acted with an <hi>equal</hi> Authority; then they could not be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for this very <hi>pertinent</hi> Reaſon, becauſe there can be but <hi>one</hi> Biſhop in a Church Neither again cou'd they be Biſhops, ſuppoſe 'em to have an <hi>unequal</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe <hi>all</hi> Biſhops are <hi>equal,</hi> and none ſubordinate to others. Now they muſt be either Biſhops or Presbyters. And ſince they were not the <hi>former,</hi> What muſt we conclude?</p>
            <p>SO then it appears by the Character they muſt bear, while ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Apoſtles were <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in their ordinary Capacity—In the Root &amp; Principle, they were only <hi>Presbyters:</hi> the other parts of their Character were only additional, or occaſional and circumſtantial. Our <hi>Author</hi> himſelf makes no Exception here, ſave as to their power of <hi>Superintendency,</hi> which he makes to be one of the <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>perpetual</hi> or ordinary Powers of an Apoſtle: but ſince he hath not as yet been able to prove this, we may ſafely adhere to our Opinion, That the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> conſider'd in their ordinary Capacity, were but <hi>Presbyters:</hi> and ſo conſequently all that truly ſuſtain the Character of <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Goſpel-Ministers,</hi> are the Apoſtles <hi>true Succeſſors;</hi> and hence, by an eaſy Inference, appear entitul'd to the Commiſſion and the Promiſe given of old to the Eleven Diſciples, by our bleſſed Lord.</p>
            <p>Briefly; WE may ſet the matter in this Light: Either this Commiſſion <hi>does</hi> belong to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or it does <hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:002594_0031_0FDB7E1EB74AC518"/>IF you aſſume in the <hi>Negative,</hi> or ſay, it does <hi>not:</hi> then it can't eaſily be made out, that <hi>Preſbyters</hi> have <hi>any Divine Miſſion at all,</hi> or any Warrant to miniſter in holy things. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prov'd there is but <hi>one</hi> Commiſſion for the <hi>ſacred Miniſter,</hi> ſtanding or in force; which is that ſame we are ſpeaking of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that CHRIST at his Aſcenſion left no other Officers in power, but his Eleven Apoſtles. Hence then ſuch as have no Intereſt in this Commiſſion, can have no Claim to any part of the Office inſtituted therein, nor may pretend to <hi>Preach</hi> any more than to exerciſe the powers of Diſcipline and Orders.</p>
            <p>BUT if you aſſume in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and ſay that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>are</hi> concern'd in this Commiſſion; then I inquire, <hi>How far?</hi> Do's it belong to them in <hi>whole,</hi> or in <hi>part?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF you ſay in the <hi>whole;</hi> then it follows there can be no <hi>ordinary</hi> eccleſiaſtical Officer ſuperior to <hi>Presbyters:</hi> ſince they are inveſted with the <hi>higheſt</hi> Commiſſion in the Church, and with the <hi>one only</hi> Commiſſion for the Miniſtry. The preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Prelates</hi> can act only by virtue of this Commiſſion, and they that act by one and the ſame Commiſſion, muſt certainly have equal and the ſame Powers Different Powers, or various Degrees of Power, muſt be founded in diſtinct Commiſſions.</p>
            <p>IF any ſay, in <hi>part</hi> only; then I inquire in what parts and degrees, and who are ſharers with them? Our <hi>Author</hi> reſolves the Queſtion, by giving <hi>Presbyters</hi> the power of <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi> and putting into the hands of <hi>Biſhops</hi> the powers of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> &amp; <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> But then I demand a Rule for dividing what GOD has united, and diſtributing the ſeveral parts of this Office into different Hands. Why ſhould not <hi>Presbyters</hi> (if they ſucceed to the Apoſtles, in any proper ſenſe or degree) have one part of their miniſterial Power as well as another? What is the Reaſon or Ground for any Diſcrimination in the matter? Nay, Is it not contrary to the very nature of a proper Succeſſion, that two diſtinct Officers ſhou'd ſhare the <hi>miniſterial Powers</hi> of the Apoſtles between them, and that in <hi>unequal Degrees</hi> too? <hi>Diviſion</hi> here makes an <hi>eſſential Alteration.</hi> Whatever Office is made up out of ſome other Office, and partakes only of a part of the eſſential Powers belonging to it, muſt needs be different from it, and muſt be call'd a <hi>new</hi> Office. And this is the very Caſe we have before us. The <hi>Presbyter</hi> (ſtript of any of the <hi>eſſential</hi> &amp; <hi>ordinary Powers</hi> of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Office) is a Creature of <hi>another</hi> Order, and quite a <hi>new Species;</hi> as much as the <hi>Deacon</hi> was tho' the Former has not (as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002594_0032_0FDB7E2421F47588"/>
the Latter hath) any <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> to ſupport and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance him, and therefore is to be rejected as an <hi>Unſcriptural Officer,</hi> having no proper Title to the Commiſſion and Promiſe made to the Apoſtles; however he may pretend to be deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from them.</p>
            <p>INDEED, Suppoſing our bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> had inſtituted the ſeveral powers which the Apoſtles had, as 'twere by <hi>halves,</hi> (the power of <hi>Government</hi> ſeparately, and the power of <hi>Doctrine</hi> by it ſelf) in diſtinct Commiſſions, both whereof were to be ſtanding; then we might perhaps have reaſonably argu'd thoſe Powers capable of exiſting ſeparately in diſtinct Subjects: and at this Door, the mere <hi>preaching Presbyter</hi> might come in, and be look'd upon as a <hi>regular Officer;</hi> and not <hi>ſimply</hi> new, altho' he had differ'd from his Predeceſſors, the Apoſtles; looking at their Office <hi>in Complexo,</hi> &amp; taking their Powers all together. Or again, Suppoſing the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (in the name of their aſcended Lord) had inſtituted this new Officer, the mere <hi>preaching Presbyter,</hi> (aſſigning him out of their Office, only the power of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> as they appointed a diſtinct Office of <hi>Deacons,</hi> devolving on them the Miniſtry of <hi>Tables</hi> only) there would (in this caſe too) have been ſufficient Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſimple <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Preacher,</hi> and we might have lookt upon his Credentials as very authentic.</p>
            <p>BUT now I cannot learn that this mere <hi>preaching Presbyter</hi> has any manner of Warrant, upon either of theſe Hypotheſes.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort then, If there be any ſuch Officer of CHRIST, as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>Minister of the Word,</hi> he muſt ſtand upon that (ſingle) Commiſſion given the Apoſtles at the Aſcenſion of CHRIST; and ſo by good Conſequence muſt ſucceed them in all the ordinary and continuing parts of their Office. I ask then, By what Rule do any diſtinguiſh the Power of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and the Power of <hi>Government</hi> from one another, and deny the latter to the Order of <hi>Presbyters?</hi>—To bring this matter to a point, I wou'd argue thus. The power of <hi>Government</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Apoſtles either in their <hi>ordinary</hi> or <hi>extraordinary</hi> Capacity. If only in their <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> then no Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Succeſſors has any juſt Pretences to it. If in their <hi>Ordinary,</hi> then they who ſucceed them in the power of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> are the Order, to whom alone that <hi>other</hi> Power alſo of Right belongs: ſince they who are in any degree properly Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, muſt ſucceed them in the whole of their ſtanding Character, as I have proved before. <hi>Moreover,</hi> I would add here, the Key of Diſcipline and Rule muſt needs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002594_0033_0FDB7E2544C7E080"/>
belong to ſuch as have the Key of Doctrine, for this very ſignificant Reaſon, Becauſe the <hi>Latter</hi> is the <hi>greater Honour,</hi> and more worthy Badge, of the Two; I don't ſay in mine and my Brethren's Opinion, but in the Judgment of no leſs a Perſon than the inſpired <hi>Apostle,</hi> as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Now why ſhou'd the <hi>leſs</hi> honorable Power be denied them? Here then I demand again, What <hi>Warrant</hi> (or Colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) have any to deny <hi>Presbyters</hi> the Power of <hi>Government?</hi> Where is the <hi>Scripture</hi> that runs a Line of Diſtinction between <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Preſbyters?</hi> Where ſhall we in all our Bible find the place, that aſſigns different Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, and diſperſeth the miniſterial Powers, united in them; committing to one this, and to another that, as diſtinct Officers in the Church?</p>
            <p>BUT now before I paſs to our <hi>Authors</hi> other Proofs, I think it proper here a little to anticipate him, and beſtow a Reflection or two, upon one declamatory and very harſh Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his, referring to this matter; which we have, in <hi>pag.</hi> 44. <hi>Either</hi> (quoth he) <hi>Biſhops</hi> (Dioceſan, that is) <hi>muſt be</hi> THE TRUE <hi>Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, or elſe they have no Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> AT ALL, <hi>and the Apoſtolic Order &amp; Office is</hi> QUITE <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; and the Church is</hi> TOTALLY <hi>deprived of the prime and chiefeſt Office inſtituted by CHRIST for its Edification, good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Government; and finally, There is now no ſuch Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that</hi> LARGE <hi>and</hi> AMPLE <hi>Commiſſion which CHRIST gave only to his</hi> APOSTLES, <hi>does belong: and with this, the Promiſe falls too.</hi>—Who now can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear admiring the <hi>Zeal</hi> of this Gentleman, and his wonderful <hi>Reaſoning</hi> here! But ſuffer me to expoſtulate a little with him upon it.—What! Is there no <hi>poſſible</hi> way for the <hi>Apoſtolic Order</hi> to continue, but in the Perſons of Dioceſan <hi>Biſhops!</hi> Muſt the Apoſtles be deny'd any <hi>Succeſſors at all,</hi> if his idoliz'd <hi>Prelacy</hi> be deny'd! Has he not taught us to diſtinguiſh between <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Powers in the <hi>Apoſtolate!</hi> And if <hi>presbyters</hi> do ſucceed to the Apoſtles in their <hi>ordinary</hi> miniſterial Powers (as he hath not proved they do not) are theſe <hi>no Succeſſors at all!</hi> While the Goſpel is preached, and there are thoſe in the world, whom himſelf (<hi>pag.</hi> 19.) calls <hi>Chriſt's Ambaſſadors,</hi> can he ſay the <hi>Office</hi> is <hi>quite</hi> extinct! And how can he ſay, The Church is <hi>totally</hi> depriv'd of the chief Office inſtituted by CHRIST for its Edification, ſo long as we have the benefit of the <hi>Apoſtolic Writings,</hi> by which <hi>(being dead) they yet ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002594_0034_0FDB7E2700883330"/>AND finally, Does he complain, That except <hi>Biſhops</hi> be allow'd to ſucceed the Apoſtles, <hi>There is now no ſuch Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that</hi> LARGE <hi>&amp;</hi> AMPLE <hi>Commiſſion, which CHRIST gave</hi> ONLY <hi>to his Apoſtles, does belong!</hi> What means the Gentleman by this?</p>
            <p>IF he wou'd bear the world in hand, that the Commiſſion, which the Apoſtles receiv'd, was given to them <hi>only,</hi> and in diſtinction from <hi>Presbyters;</hi> this is as <hi>gratis dictum;</hi> a Point that needs proof, after all that he hath ſaid upon it.</p>
            <p>AND if he wou'd inſinuate here, that the Commiſſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Apoſtles, doth in its <hi>large</hi> &amp; <hi>ample</hi> Extent deſcend to their <hi>Succeſſors;</hi> then ſurely he deſign'd only to <hi>amuſe</hi> his Readers, and he <hi>contradicts</hi> himſelf t'boot, having forgotten what he had before conceded, (in <hi>pag.</hi> 33.) That <hi>the unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Commiſſion</hi> was a thing <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>firſt Apoſtles, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary &amp; temporary:</hi> in ſaying which, He in effect confeſſes himſelf, that <hi>there is no Order of Men extant in the World,</hi> (and therefore not his <hi>Biſhops</hi>) <hi>to whom that</hi> AMPLE <hi>&amp;</hi> LARGE <hi>Commiſſion</hi> doth belong: and ſince he contends, notwithſtanding, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> are <hi>true</hi> Succeſſors of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> how evidently doth it appear, He allows there may be true Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, (empower'd by the ſame Commiſſion with them) who yet are not veſted with the ſame Plenitude of Power that they exerciſed, or an Authority of the ſame <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Extent</hi> with theirs!—And now if the Power of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> granted in the Apoſtolical Commiſſion, may come under any Limitations, or be confin'd to a particular Charge; ſince our <hi>Author</hi> preſumes to ſhrink it up within the narrow Bounds of a <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> (He ſays not, whether great or <hi>ſmall</hi>) I may as ſafely and warrantably contract it a little <hi>more</hi> &amp; reduce it within the Compaſs of a <hi>ſingle Church</hi> or Congregation. And in this, I have to bear me out, many <hi>Divines</hi> of Name in the <hi>Church of England</hi> it ſelf, who maintain, that <hi>Extent</hi> of Power over <hi>ſeveral</hi> Churches, nay, and having <hi>Presbyters</hi> in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation too, are not (one nor other) of the <hi>Eſſence of Epiſcopacy.</hi> This was the opinion particularly of Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> (a ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Defender of Prelacy) who upon this head obſerves to us, <q>That <hi>Milles</hi> the martyr was a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> tho' he had <hi>not ſo much as one</hi> Chriſtian in his Dioceſe: and he acknowleges, He never yet heard of any men, who made it eſſential to a Biſhop, to have a plurality of Congregations under him <note n="‖" place="bottom">See <hi>Tong</hi>'s Def. <hi>pag.</hi> 115.</note>.</q>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:002594_0035_0FDB7E284754A5E0"/>
So <hi>Saravia</hi> (a prime Leader in the notion of the Divine Right of Prelacy) profeſſeth, <q>We meaſure not a <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> by the number of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or by the amplitude of the <hi>Dioceſs;</hi> for the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> may be included in <hi>one ſmall Pariſh alone</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Jameſ. Naz. qu.</hi> pa. 218.</note>.</q> And it's well known how Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> (a very learned prelatiſt) maintains, <q>That all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> we read of in the New Teſtament were <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and that there was <hi>no inferiour Order</hi> of Miniſters inſtituted by CHRIST or his Apoſtles; but that this was afterwards brought into the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE then, according to theſe Principles, <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian Parity</hi> are very well reconcilable: for I know no difference between a Congregational <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent <hi>Paſtor;</hi> ſave that the latter may want the <hi>Epiſcopal Conſecration,</hi> which they ſpeak of, and make neceſſary to the <hi>Authority of the Epiſcopal Degree.</hi> But ſurely <hi>that</hi> can afford no plea for the Diſtinction between Biſhops and Presbyters; becauſe there's no ſolid proof of any Rule in the <hi>ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> for this Conſecration of Biſhops, as different from the Ordination of Presbyters. I will boldly affirm, They may turn over all the Leaves of their Bible, as long as they have Eyes to ſee, and not be able to produce a Scripture-Canon for any thing more than <hi>Miniſterial</hi> Ordination. Nay in the, Very <hi>Directory</hi> for Ordination, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.) the Apoſtle makes no Diſtinction in the leaſt between <hi>Presbyters</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but rather makes them the very <hi>ſame,</hi> as I ſhall ſhow by'n'by.— However we will not quarrel and part <hi>here:</hi> Nay, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I will for once grant them, That <hi>Biſhops are the true Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles; deriving from them the power of Ordination &amp; Juriſdiction;</hi> this, I ſay I will grant them, if they will but hold to thoſe two Principles, (which we find them ſometimes allowing us,) <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>every Congregation may have its own partieular Biſhop; and then that all Biſhops are upon the Level, having equal &amp; independent Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YEA, If they'll allow theſe two things, I will grant them further, That the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> annexed to the Apoſtles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>does belong to Biſhops;</hi> and ſo the <hi>horrid conſequences</hi> we may hope will be prevented, which our <hi>Author</hi> conceives would follow, if Biſhops be not the true Succeſſors of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002594_0036_0FDB7E29C830AE00"/>THUS at laſt, I think, we are led into a way, to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petuate <hi>the prime Office inſtituted by CHRIST for the Church Edification, good Order &amp; Government,</hi> and to ſecure the great <hi>Promiſe</hi> made to the <hi>Apoſtolical Order,</hi> by a regular Succeſſion of <hi>Biſhops</hi> too: and yet conſiſtent enough with the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Model.</p>
            <p>AND ſo it appears, the <hi>firſt</hi> Text, that our <hi>Author</hi> brings to ſupport the prelatical ſcheme, proves of no ſubſerviency at all to his purpoſe, but much the contrary.</p>
            <p>I have been drawn to a greater length in the conſideration of this Text, becauſe I perceive the <hi>Gentleman</hi> lays pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Streſs upon it; referring us frequently and with great aſſurance to the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> there: and becauſe I think as to this he is in the Right; for I believe, we have <hi>here</hi> (to uſe ſome of <hi>his</hi> words) <hi>the Hinge, on which the whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy in this matter depends</hi> And verily, if <hi>Presbyters</hi> are abſolutely ſhut out of <hi>this</hi> Commiſſion, I ſhall deſpair of finding any other Eſtabliſhment for them, in the whole Bible. Or if <hi>Biſhops</hi> have by virtue of this Commiſſion a Right of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over Presbyters, or any Power but what <hi>Presbyters</hi> have as well as they a Title to, this wou'd decide the Caſe with me: and I ſhou'd think it almoſt needleſs to take the pains to examin any <hi>other</hi> Scripture-Proofs he has to bring. But being, after the moſt impartial ſearch into the matter, ſtrongly convinced of the <hi>contrary,</hi> I ſhall proceed to the other Texts he brings, and ſee whether they can afford any <hi>new Light</hi> to the Argument.</p>
            <p>THO' I wou'd premiſe here one Thing, as a <hi>Principle,</hi> not to be diſputed; <hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>firſt Text,</hi> as containing the <hi>Goſpel-Charter</hi> or Commiſſion for the Miniſtry, muſt therefore be admitted the grand <hi>RULE</hi> to us in interpreting other Texts, relating to the <hi>Controverſy.</hi> All muſt be reduced to <hi>this</hi> Standard; and no Conſtruction of any Scripture be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, that makes it <hi>militate</hi> with this firſt and grand Text. We muſt note; All <hi>Corporations</hi> are to model their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by their <hi>Charter,</hi> and by the Inſtructions of their original Founder: no Laws are to be enacted <hi>repugnant</hi> to theſe; and all Laws already made, are to be <hi>interpreted</hi> in a ſenſe plainly <hi>conſistent</hi> therewith—. As then we may juſtly reject any Decrees or Ordinances of <hi>Men,</hi> that pretend to alter, limit, or add to the ſtanding Powers of the Divine Commiſſion aforeſaid: So we may reaſonably ſuſpect that <hi>Expoſition</hi> of any
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002594_0037_0FDB7E2C08347AA8"/>
               <hi>Text,</hi> which makes it to <hi>interfere</hi> with this. And hence, tho' ſome particular Texts cou'd be produced, that might by a witty Turn be made to look favourably towards the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> between Biſhops and Presbyters: yet if this Diſtinction cannot conſiſt with the Royal CHARTER, or cannot be deduced from it by any rational Inferences, we muſt neceſſarily look out for ſome other ſenſe of thoſe Texts, and reject the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſtruction as certainly erroneous.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add here what one well obſerves; This being <q>a Queſtion concerning a very great Power, extending to a great Number of Perſons, and producing great Effects, a matter of great Diſtinction, and Dependencies, ought to have clear and poſitive Warrant from the Word of GOD, and be very plainly legible in the Commiſſion there. Meer <hi>Names, Titles, Suppoſitions,</hi> and fine <hi>Probabilities,</hi> will not all make a Foundation ſtrong enough, to bear the weight of a ſtructure ſo high and towering, as our Engliſh Prelacy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WELL, we will now examin our <hi>Author</hi>'s other Scripture-Proofs, and ſee what weight they will bear to have laid upon them.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>ſecond</hi> Text is, 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>Where the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>tells us, GOD hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt</hi> APOSTLES, <hi>ſecondly</hi> PROPHETS, <hi>thirdly</hi> TEACHERS.— Here, by the way he inſerts in a Parentheſis this obſervation, That <hi>what follow, are not diſtinct Offices from theſe, but extraordinary Gifts conferred upon them.</hi> But I believe his Obſervation will not hold good, as to all the Articles in the following Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For what will he make of the <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> mention'd there? Do not theſe mean <hi>diſtinct Officers?</hi> I am ſure many learned Interpreters judge ſo: and among others, ſome of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Particularly, Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> (from Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>) ſays on the place, That the <hi>Helps</hi> here were <hi>Deacons,</hi> or ſuch Officers as took Care of the Poor: and by <hi>Governments,</hi> he tells us, <hi>are almoſt generally understood the</hi> Rulers <hi>of the churches planted by the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, Suppoſing them to be (what he calls them, <hi>pag.</hi> 14.) <hi>only various Powers &amp; Gifts, wherewith the Goſpel-Officers were endu'd;</hi> how will this ſerve his Cauſe! Nay, it will very much hurt it. For, to <hi>whom</hi> ſhall we refer theſe <hi>Powers?</hi> Surely not the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> only, but as well to the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> joyned with them. Whence it will neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That <hi>Teachers</hi> have the powers of <hi>Government</hi> belonging
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002594_0038_0FDB7E304227F8B0"/>
to them; and therefore the power of <hi>Ordination</hi> alſo, ſince theſe two are inſeperably united, in the Epiſcopal Scheme. And accordingly Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the place (agreeing with our <hi>Author</hi> in his Interpretation of <hi>Governments</hi>) do's expreſly aſcribe and appropriate theſe <hi>ruling Powers</hi> (as his Phraſe is) to the <hi>Teachers</hi> ſpoken of, whom he makes to be the <hi>Paſtors of particular Churches planted by the Apoſtles.</hi>— We will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute then with our Author, whether the <hi>Apoſtolic Degree be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,</hi> or not; but let him enjoy his opinion about it, and make as much of it as he can: <hi>provided</hi> he will but concur with thoſe his Brethren, (and let <hi>us</hi> quietly enjoy <hi>our</hi> opinion) <hi>That the</hi> Teachers or Paſtors <hi>of particular Congregations have theſe</hi> ruling <hi>Powers belonging to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET, it would make one ſmile to ſee how he lays ſtreſs upon the word SET, and to read his Deſcant on it; when if we conſider the <hi>place</hi> this monoſyllable bears in the Text, it muſt needs be of little weight in the preſent Argument, as referring indifferently to <hi>all</hi> that follows; and conſequently taking in (not only the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. but likewiſe) the <hi>extraordinary Gifts &amp; Powers</hi> there enumerated, as <hi>ſet in the Church,</hi> and ſo (according to him) <hi>immoveably fixed</hi> as the Ordinances of Heaven: which, how <hi>ridiculous</hi> wou'd it be to pretend! In ſhort, This <hi>Gentleman</hi> muſt allow the power of working <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> the <hi>Gift of Interpreting,</hi> and the <hi>Diverſities of Tongues,</hi> to be but <hi>temporary,</hi> even altho' they are ſaid to be SET in the Church: and now the <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> power of univerſal Inſpection might be but in the <hi>ſame ſenſe</hi> ſet in the Church, and have <hi>a reſpect</hi> (like the reſt of thoſe extraordinary Powers) <hi>only to the firſt planting of the Goſpel,</hi> as himſelf expreſly owns, <hi>Pag.</hi> 33, 34.</p>
            <p>SO that it is egregious <hi>Trifling</hi> to uſe this Scripture, as a proof of his Scheme: and his <hi>Diſtinction</hi> here between <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> is nothing to his purpoſe, tho' (as you've heard) it's much to <hi>mine.</hi> And as for his <hi>Admonition</hi> (under this head) to ſuch as <hi>preſume to mutilate &amp; deform the</hi> myſtical <hi>Body of CHRIST, by depriving the Church of any of the ſacred Offices ſet in it by GOD;</hi> we humbly truſt on <hi>our</hi> part no ſuch Cenſure is due, however it was pointed at <hi>us;</hi> and therefore let the <hi>Beſtower</hi> of it, and his Brethren, take it among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who preſume to robb the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the Church of a great part of their Miniſterial Powers, &amp; commit them to other Officers uninſtituted by CHRIST, to the no ſmall damage of his Church in its <hi>Beauty, Integrity</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi>— But I
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002594_0039_0FDB7E3140B824A0"/>
forbear; as ſuppoſing <hi>Re-criminations</hi> however juſt, will do but little Service to my Cauſe.</p>
            <p>TO <hi>go on</hi> with our <hi>Author:</hi> In the <hi>third</hi> place, He argues from the 4th Chap. to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where we are told, That our Lord <hi>gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors &amp; Teachers, — for the edifying the Body of Chriſt; till we all come— unto a perfect Man,</hi>— That we henceforth <hi>be no more Children toſſed to &amp; fro,</hi> &amp;c.— Now he boaſts he has here an <hi>unconteſtible Testimony,</hi> in favor of his Scheme, <hi>taken from the Ends for which theſe Offices were inſtituted; with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration how long they were to continue,</hi> that is, <hi>to the End of the world.</hi>— But this is very eaſily anſwered. 'Tis granted, That the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and others muſt certainly <hi>accompliſh</hi> the Ends they were given for, ſome way or other. And there are two ways, agreable to the twofold Capacity they ſuſtain'd, Ordinary and Extraordinary.</p>
            <p>IF you conſider the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> here, in their <hi>Ordinary</hi> Capacity, the Caſe is very plain: their Order doth <hi>actually continue;</hi> and they do properly in their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> ſerve to the Edification, good Order &amp; Government of the Church, and will do ſo to the End of Time. Which <hi>Succeſſors</hi> are <hi>Goſpel-Teachers</hi> or <hi>Elders.</hi> For ſince our <hi>Author</hi> has not yet been able to prove, That a <hi>Superiority over other Paſtors</hi> was one of the <hi>ordinary</hi> and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parts of the Apoſtolic Office, it thence follows, that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> may well enough be look'd upon, as <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and we have no Reaſon to think any <hi>ſuperior Order to them</hi> was to continue in the Church. For, as he truly obſerves, <hi>pag.</hi> 42. The Queſtion between us is only concerning the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Powers of the Apoſtles, in which <hi>alone</hi> they cou'd have <hi>Succeſſors.</hi> And he <hi>himſelf</hi> (as I took notice before) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, That a <hi>Juriſdiction over all Churches &amp; Paſtors</hi> was one of thoſe <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Powers, of which he ſays (as expreſly as I can) at the foot of <hi>pag.</hi> 41. That <hi>they expired with themſelves, and that they have no Succeſſors in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF then, on the other hand, you conſider the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Capacity, you have our <hi>Author</hi>'s own Confeſſion, that in <hi>this</hi> they had <hi>no</hi> Succeſſors; nor <hi>were to have</hi> any: and ſo their Superintendent Power being extraordinary, was not to continue in <hi>after Ages,</hi> nor is it obligatory to <hi>us. For</hi> (he ſays, <hi>pag</hi> 32.) <hi>if the Inſtitution</hi> of the Apoſtles <hi>was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary &amp; temporary in any part, it is ſo far as it was of this nature, no Rule or Standard now.</hi> Nevertheleſs (I would add)
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002594_0040_0FDB7E32D6013590"/>
After a ſort and in an improper ſenſe, even the <hi>firſt Apoſtles</hi> may be ſaid to continue, that is, In the bleſſed <hi>Effects</hi> of their Miniſtry; and to be ſtill ſerving the Church of CHRIST, by the <hi>Apoſtolical Doctrine,</hi> and the ſtanding Rule of Faith deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us in the New Teſtament; which, as Men infallibly inſpired for that End, they wrote, and publiſh'd, to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded down to Poſterity, and ſpread through the world, for the common benefit of mankind. And theſe Apoſtolical <hi>Writings</hi> have been preſerved to this day, and will (I truſt) be to the world's End continu'd, the great Inſtrument of the Converſion and Edification of Souls, under the Conduct of the Spirit of GOD, and of his Miniſters, as in ſubordination to him, Workers together with GOD, and building upon the Foundation, which thoſe <hi>Maſter-builders</hi> have laid. So that, in this qualify'd ſenſe, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> may be ſaid, even in their <hi>extraordinary</hi> Capacity, yea, and by their <hi>Superintendent</hi> Power too, in the laſting Effects and Influences of it, to continue, <hi>for the work of the Miniſtry, till we all come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>BUT here I have <hi>two Remarks</hi> further to make; one on the Author's <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Reaſoning</hi> upon this Text; and a ſecond, Upon the <hi>Objection</hi> he raiſes, with his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>HERE then I cannot but take notice, How remarkably this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> in his manner of arguing from this Place (for his pretended Biſhop) agrees with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctors; who from the very ſame Text (as Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> obſerves) do argue for an <hi>infallible</hi> Guide <hi>thus;— CHRIST</hi> (ſay they) <hi>gave Apoſtles, Pastors, &amp; Teachers, that Chriſtians might not be</hi> toſſed to and fro <hi>with every wind of Doctrine; which End cou'd not be compaſſed but by</hi> infallible <hi>Guides.</hi> Moreover, <hi>GOD gave ſuch Paſtors to ſerve to theſe Ends,</hi> till we all come <hi>to the unity of the Faith, which will not be till the</hi> laſt <hi>days of all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, till</hi> the End <hi>of the World, the Church must be provided of them, and by them be ſecured from being Children toſſed to and fro.</hi> Thus the <hi>Papiſts</hi> argue. And perhaps <hi>They</hi> have as much <hi>Truth</hi> on their ſide, as our <hi>Author.</hi> Beſure their Argument ſeems to be as well founded and as plauſible, for a perpetual Succeſſion of <hi>infallible Guides</hi> in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his for a perpetual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Apoſtolical <hi>Superintendents.</hi> But ſince the INFAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBLE CHAIR is expreſly renounced by this <hi>Gentleman</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that conſiſtently with the Text we are upon; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it's pity he did not proceed (as he might have done, upon equally juſt Grounds) to reject the EPISCOPAL
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002594_0041_0FDB7E3456EF3740"/>
THRONE together with it. However, <hi>we</hi> will do it, tho' he hasn't; as firmly believing, that <hi>Infallibility</hi> &amp; <hi>Superintendency</hi> were both alike <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>firſt</hi> Apoſtles (to ſpeak in his own Dialect) and being equally deſign'd only to ſerve the <hi>Infancy</hi> and firſt Conſtitution of the Church, they were not to continue.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>other Thing</hi> I mention'd, may now be conſider'd. He is aware, it might be <hi>objected</hi> to him, <hi>That in this Text</hi> (viz. Eph. 4.11.) <hi>more Officers are mention'd than he pleads for;</hi> and therefore, to keep clear of the opinion of many Diſſenters, That the <hi>Apostles, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> here ſpoken of, were <hi>extraordinary</hi> Officers, He is forced to ſay, That <hi>theſe different Deſignations do not import different</hi> Offices, <hi>but different</hi> Exerciſes <hi>of the ſame Office,</hi> (pag. 38.) — But here, how obvious and natural is the Reflection, That by this Principle there is but ONE SINGLE Order in the <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtry;</hi> which is the Thing I am pleading for, and to allow which, is for him intirely to give up the Argument. If <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> do all import only <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the ſame Officer,</hi> under various Denominations, as our <hi>Author</hi> ſeems poſitively to aſſert, then I ſay there's an <hi>End</hi> of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and what need we ſtay any longer upon it!— How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let us ſee how he illuſtrates the matter by an <hi>Example,</hi> ſaying, That <hi>an Apoſtle, Presbyter, or Deacon, might be a Prophet, Evangeliſt, Doctor or Teacher:</hi>— In which, I doubt he ſtill more and more involves himſelf, and diſparages his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>For obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE's a <hi>Fallacy</hi> in this Inſtance, in that one thing which ſhould be in the <hi>Predicate,</hi> He puts into the place of the <hi>Subject,</hi> namely, an <hi>Apostle.</hi> If he wou'd ſpeak conſiſtently with the Account he gives before, of theſe <hi>different Deſignations,</hi> and give a <hi>parallel</hi> Inſtance, It muſt run thus, A <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Deacon,</hi> (or a <hi>third</hi> Perſon, if he could find out ſuch an one; let him ſay, a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> if he will) might be an <hi>Apoſtle, Prophet, Evangeliſt, Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Teacher.</hi> For <hi>Apostle</hi> is one of thoſe <hi>Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> in the Text; all which juſt now he ſaid, imported only <hi>different Exerciſes</hi> of the ſame Office.</p>
            <p>BUT if any will attempt to excuſe him from the Charge of a Fallacy, by ſaying, He meant to <hi>except</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> out of that Number, and ſpoke only of the <hi>other</hi> Deſignations that follow; tho' it happens not to be ſo cautiouſly worded: then let me argue upon the matter thus,— <hi>Either all the Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here do import diſtinct</hi> Offices, <hi>or they all of them do not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:002594_0042_0FDB7E35B30D0010"/>IF <hi>all</hi> do imply diſtinct <hi>Offices;</hi> then theſe are all either ordinary or extraordinary, and take them in which ſenſe he will, he muſt diſtort his own Scheme. Nay further, if any ſhou'd ſay for him, <hi>They are</hi> BOTH (ſome being Ordinary, and others Extraordinary) and to be taken <hi>in ſenſu diviſo;</hi> I doubt this Diſtinction would not help him neither: for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, by the ſame Rules that <hi>any</hi> of them can be prov'd <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> we muſt conclude the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> particularly to be ſo. And then what becomes of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> our <hi>Author</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Succeſſor</hi> to the Apoſtles!</p>
            <p>BUT, If all theſe Deſignations do <hi>not</hi> imply ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Offices,</hi> then I argue thus,— Either they are <hi>ſome</hi> of them proper Offices, and <hi>others</hi> only different <hi>Exerciſes;</hi> or elſe they are all but <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of one Office.</p>
            <p>IF he chuſe to ſay the <hi>Former;</hi> then I ask, <hi>How many,</hi> and <hi>which</hi> of them are <hi>Offices?</hi> He'll doubtleſs ſay particularly <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> which (<hi>pag.</hi> 14.) he ſays, <hi>is the name that the order of the</hi> 70 <hi>go by.</hi> But then I demand, By what Laws of Interpretation, he can ſupport this Conſtruction? Where is there any Colour of <hi>Diſtinction</hi> in the Text, between Theſe and the Reſt that follow? Does not the Enumeration run thus, <hi>ſome</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>and ſome</hi> Prophets, <hi>and ſome</hi> Evangeliſts, <hi>and ſome</hi> Paſtors and Teachers! So that there's no <hi>mark</hi> of Diſtinction between the two Firſt, and the Reſt: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, by the ſame Rule, that the two Firſt, viz. <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> may be diſtinguiſh'd one from the other, may alſo the two next, <hi>Evangelists</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſtors,</hi> be diſtinguiſh'd, and call'd different Offices. Yea, and by parity of Reaſon, If he calls <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſtors</hi> one and the ſame Officer, I may as well call <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Paſtors the ſame. According to him, a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> might be a <hi>Prophet, Evangeliſt, Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Teacher:</hi> and I will add upon as good Grounds, <hi>That he might be an</hi> Apoſtle <hi>too,</hi> as far as the <hi>ordinary</hi> Power of an Apoſtle extended; which was only to <hi>govern</hi> the Church, <hi>ordain</hi> Officers, <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> &amp; <hi>adminiſter</hi> the <hi>Sacraments:</hi> for (I ſay again) he hath not yet proved, That a <hi>Superiority</hi> over other Paſtors was one of the <hi>ordinary</hi> powers of an Apoſtle.— And by the way, This would have ſerved as well for an Anſwer to one of his former Texts, that is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 28. For there is as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe the <hi>different Deſignations</hi> in <hi>that,</hi> as in this, to <hi>import only different Exerciſes of the ſame Office.</hi>— But thus much for the firſt Thing I obſerv'd in our <hi>Author</hi>'s Inſtance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:002594_0043_0FDB7E3B38CDBB98"/>2. OBSERVE a very palpable <hi>Self-Contradiction</hi> (if not alſo another <hi>Fallacy</hi>) in what he affirms here of the <hi>Deacon,</hi> viz. <hi>That He</hi> (as well as a Presbyter or an Apoſtle) <hi>might be a Prophet, Evangeliſt, Doctor, or Teacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE's a plain <hi>Contradiction</hi> to what he ſays elſewhere. For, thoſe ſeveral <hi>Deſignations,</hi> he expreſly tells us (<hi>pag.</hi> 14. and again, <hi>pa.</hi> 21.) belong to the <hi>ſecond Order</hi> of Miniſters, viz. <hi>Preſbyters.</hi> And then, in <hi>pag.</hi> 58. he ſays, <hi>The Apoſtles inſtituted a</hi> 3d <hi>Order, of Deacons, who 'tis certain was</hi> inferior <hi>to Preſbyters, as theſe were to the Apoſtles.</hi>— Yet here, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. He affirms, That a <hi>Deacon</hi> might be a <hi>Prophet, Evangeliſt, Doctor,</hi> or <hi>Teacher.</hi>—Now let any one reconcile theſe Things, that can. If <hi>Deacons</hi> may wear all the diſtinguiſhing <hi>Titles,</hi> and do all the peculiar <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> I cannot imagine how any <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> can be ſuppoſed between them. At leaſt, if ſo, it can't be apprehended that <hi>Deacons</hi> are the <hi>Inferior</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the two. For, tho' ſome particular <hi>Names</hi> &amp; <hi>Works</hi> may be <hi>common</hi> (as our <hi>Author</hi> obſerves, <hi>pag.</hi> 55.) <hi>where Offices are acknowleged to be diſtinct:</hi> Yet it is ever the <hi>Superior Office includes the inferior,</hi> (as, all <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,) but not <hi>vice verſa;</hi> to uſe his own words in <hi>pag.</hi> 56. According to which Principle of our <hi>Author</hi>'s, a <hi>Deacon</hi> can't be <hi>inferior</hi> to a Presbyter, if he may be a <hi>Prophet, Evangeliſt,</hi> &amp;c. for what more can we ſuppoſe a <hi>Preſbyter</hi> to be? What <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctive</hi> Character doth a Presbyter ſuſtain? What <hi>Superior</hi> to theſe? Unleſs he will grant that a Presbyter might be an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Fine, There appears to be another <hi>Fallacy,</hi> in our <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>varying</hi> from the Enumeration in the Text, by ſaying DOCTOR <hi>or Teacher,</hi> inſtead of PASTOR <hi>or Teacher.</hi> It ſeems plainly to be a <hi>deſign'd</hi> Alteration. For, <hi>first,</hi> He knew well enough, that <hi>Doctor</hi> here was a <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> word, ſince it is ſynonimous with <hi>Teacher:</hi> However, becauſe of the Gingle of the word, he ſuppos'd the changing of <hi>Pastor</hi> for <hi>Doctor,</hi> wou'd not be readily minded. And <hi>then,</hi> He knew, if he had aſſerted, A <hi>Deacon,</hi> or an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> (both which he was ſpeaking of) might be a <hi>Paſtor;</hi> [that is, <hi>A Minister of the Word &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſetled in a particular Church, or Place that had receiv'd the Goſpel;</hi> for ſo he defines a <hi>Paſtor; pag.</hi> 14. &amp; 25. compar'd] all the World would have derided the Abſurdity, and every one ſeen the notorious <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> that this wou'd have carry'd in it, to his <hi>own Scheme:</hi> according to which, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had an <hi>unlimited</hi> Commiſſion, and a <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002594_0044_0FDB7E3C7380C0E0"/>
Paſtors; So the <hi>Deacon</hi> is confin'd to <hi>Preaching</hi> &amp; <hi>Baptiſing,</hi> not being authorized to adminiſter the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> which every <hi>Paſtor</hi> has certainly power to do: and hence neither an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> nor <hi>Deacon</hi> cou'd be a <hi>Paſtor.</hi> It was then wittily done of him to <hi>change</hi> the Phraſe of his Text, and put <hi>Doctor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Paſtor. However, The <hi>Wit</hi> (I believe) will hardly <hi>atone</hi> for the <hi>Fallacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have fully and impartially conſider'd the <hi>Three</hi> great Scripture-Arguments he brings.</p>
            <p>AND now upon the whole, Who can forbear pitying his <hi>Cauſe</hi> as deſperate, that needs the help of ſuch little <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Windings</hi> and <hi>Double-Dealings</hi> to maintain it; and the <hi>Man,</hi> as very forgetful at leaſt, and not a Maſter of his own Scheme, that commits ſuch egregious <hi>Blunders</hi> &amp; <hi>Self Contradictions!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WELL; Our Author having (as he thinks) eſtabliſh't his Point, viz <hi>That Authoritative Inſpection over Churches &amp; Paſtors, was one of the ordinary &amp; continuing parts of the Apoſtolick Office, in which they were to have Succeſſors;</hi> He comes now in the 4th &amp; <hi>last</hi> place, to ſhew, that BISHOPS are the true <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of the Apoſtles, and that in <hi>Them</hi> is the <hi>Apoſtolical Government</hi> over Paſtors &amp; Teachers <hi>continu'd</hi> in the Church. Now to illuſtrate and confirm this, he obſerves to us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 43. That the <hi>Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> is (in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20.) expreſly call'd an <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and hence <hi>the Apoſtles were properly and actually Biſhops.</hi>— Says he ſo? Why then, at the ſame Rate of arguing, We may infer that <hi>Preſbyters</hi> are <hi>Biſhops</hi> too; becauſe in another Chapter of the ſame Book, (viz. Act. 20.) <hi>The Elders</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> are expreſly call'd <hi>Overſeers</hi> or <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Yea, by the ſame Rule, we may argue that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves were properly and actually <hi>Preſbyters;</hi> inaſmuch as two of them, <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>John,</hi> expreſly call themſelves ſo. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in two of his Epiſtles, ſalutes his Friends, under no other Name, than that choſen one, <hi>The Elder</hi> —. Poſſibly he was the oldeſt Apoſtle now living, or the only one ſurviving, of that extraordinary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: and this aged Servant of the Lord, willing to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the <hi>continu'd</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtanding</hi> Miniſtry, aſſumed only the more ordinary and common Title of <hi>Elder:</hi> though, being now the firſt and moſt eminent Miniſter in the Church, he ſtyles himſelf emphatically, <hi>THE Elder.</hi> — And then the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> exhorting the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> (1 Epiſt 5 1.) ſtyles himſelf <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Conſenior,</hi> or FELLOW <hi>Preſbyter;</hi> as if he claimed no Superiority over them and ſtood upon a Level with them.— But where now do we find theſe or any other

Apoſtles calling themſelves <hi>Biſhops?</hi> Doubtleſs we ſhou'd have been told of it, if they had done ſo. Beſure if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had call'd himſelf a <hi>Fellow-Biſhop,</hi> in writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> there had been Noiſe &amp; Rattle enough about it.— But what does the Gentleman intend, when he affirms, <hi>That the Apoſtles were</hi> actually <hi>and properly Biſhops?</hi> If he means, that they were actually <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, and had particular Charges or Provinces to rule in; this will <hi>contradict</hi> what he ſays elſewhere, when he aſſigns them an <hi>unlimited Commiſſion.</hi> Or if he means that the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> they (every one in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) exerciſed over <hi>all</hi> Churches &amp; Paſtors, was a <hi>proper Epiſcopacy,</hi> as his Phraſe is; then I inquire, whether his <hi>limited</hi> Prelate be not <hi>improperly</hi> ſtyled a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and how he can be call'd a <hi>true Succeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles!</hi>— But it may be he only meant in <hi>general,</hi> That they were <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as being a <hi>ſuperior Order</hi> to Presbyters and exerting <hi>Authority</hi> over them. If ſo; then he trifles ſtrangely, and abuſes his Reader with the <hi>Ambiguity</hi> of a word, which <hi>He</hi> puts one Conſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Presbyterians another. <hi>He</hi> uſes the word. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in the modern <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Senſe, as importing an Officer <hi>ſuperior</hi> to a Presbyter: but <hi>We</hi> affirm, this is not the ancient <hi>ſcriptural</hi> Senſe. Let them, who ſay it is, produce any place in the Bible, where the word is ſo uſed, if they can. It is to be found 6 or 7 times in the New Teſtament: but it every where makes ſo evidently againſt the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Senſe, that the wiſer &amp; more ſober Prelatiſts generally <hi>ſhun</hi> all Places where the Word is uſed, as being nothing to their purpoſe, but rather tending to the Confuſion of their Cauſe. And when they come to anſwer our Arguments from ſuch Places, they will not fix on any poſitive Senſe contrary to our's, but only ſtudy <hi>Evaſions;</hi> and act like cowardly Soldiers flying from a powerful Enemy, who truſt to their <hi>Heels,</hi> not to their <hi>Weapons:</hi> or if any have more Courage, and reſolve at all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures to ſtand it out, how often do they charge upon one another, and fly in each other's Face!— To Inſtance in one Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſalutes the Saints at <hi>Philippi, with the Biſhops &amp; Deacons.</hi> One Party of them ſays, Thoſe were <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops; and here they take quite different paths: One ſays, <hi>They were the Biſhops of the</hi> neighboring <hi>Citys, met for ſome Conſultation at</hi> Philippi: Another ſays, <hi>No; They were not at</hi> Philippi, <hi>but with</hi> Paul. Again, One ſays, Theſe Biſhops were <hi>Paſtors</hi> and Rulers of Churches, and had <hi>no Preſbyters</hi> under them; no ſuch inferior Order being inſtituted
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002594_0046_0FDB7E3F74065430"/>
by the Apoſtles: but then another ſays, There <hi>was</hi> ſuch an <hi>Inferior</hi> Order, and would have it denoted here by the <hi>Deacons.</hi> Yet further, There's another Party, who ſay, Theſe Biſhops were <hi>nothing</hi> but Presbyters; <hi>ſimple</hi> Presbyters, not having power of Juriſdiction; which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their times reſerved to Themſelves; and ſo there was no ſuch Officer as a <hi>Prelate</hi> between the Apoſtles, and the Presbyters, Finally, There are ſome of them, who hold, That by <hi>Biſhops</hi> here are to be underſtood <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and his <hi>Preſbyters;</hi> for that the Name was then common to both Orders, and the higher Rank includes the lower.— What Contention and Confuſion is here among the learned Advocates for <hi>Prelacy!</hi> You ſee this <hi>one</hi> Text has ſo gravel'd 'em, that they know not which way to turn themſelves, nor how to come off: they can't agree among themſelves upon any tolerable Evaſion, and they ſeem aſham'd of one another's ſophiſtical Attempts.</p>
            <p>BUT I now return to our <hi>Author;</hi> who to confirm the Point he is upon, viz. <hi>That</hi> Biſhops <hi>are Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in their power &amp; Authority over Paſtors,</hi> proceeds (<hi>pag.</hi> 45.) to offer another Argument, taken from the <hi>Apoſtles conferring upon</hi> others <hi>the Apoſtolick Power, in their own Time, which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they would never have done, if they had not concluded it was to be</hi> tranſmitted <hi>from them to others in a continual Succeſſion, to the</hi> End <hi>of the World.</hi> I might make ſeveral <hi>Remarks</hi> on this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; but I ſhall confine my ſelf to the main Thing, that is, to inquire into the Truth of his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>actually confer</hi> Apoſtolic <hi>Power</hi> on <hi>others.</hi> — It is not enough to ſay there were <hi>other</hi> Apoſtles, beſides thoſe <hi>Eleven,</hi> which CHRIST left in Office at his Aſcenſion. For <hi>our Lord</hi> might afterwards raiſe up as many as he pleaſed: but if their <hi>Call</hi> was <hi>immediate,</hi> their Miſſion from CHRIST alone, without the Intervention of Men, or their Qualifications <hi>extraordinary</hi> And <hi>peculiar,</hi> it affords no Argument at all of his deſigning a perpetual <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of an Order of Goſpel-Miniſters, <hi>ſuperior</hi> to ordinary Teachers. Hence then our <hi>Author</hi> muſt inſtance in ſuch as receiv'd the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> in an <hi>ordinary</hi> manner, by a <hi>human</hi> Call and Ordination: or elſe his inſtances are foreign to the purpoſe, and prove nothing.</p>
            <p>NOW in <hi>Pag.</hi> 45 &amp; 46. He offers ſeveral Inſtances; but ſuch as will hardly bear an Examination He firſt inſtances in <hi>Matthias:</hi> But will he ſay this Apoſtle was called in an <hi>ordinary</hi> manner? Nay, Does he not own himſelf, It was <hi>by the</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:002594_0047_0FDB7E43F67037E0"/>
DIRECTION <hi>of GOD, that</hi> Matthias <hi>was received into the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Apoſtles?</hi> And were not the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> and the <hi>Requiſites,</hi> that are mention'd (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.21, 22.) as neceſſary to qualify him to be joyned with the Eleven Apoſtles; I ſay, were not theſe things <hi>extraordinary?</hi> It would then aſtoniſh one to think, any Man in his Wits ſhou'd offer ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as this in Plea for <hi>Biſhops</hi> being the true Succeſſors of the Apoſtles!— The Inſtance of <hi>James,</hi> is exceeding imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; ſince it appears very plainly the <hi>Author</hi> himſelf believ'd <hi>him</hi> to be one of the <hi>Twelve;</hi> and therefore to have his Call <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>CHRIST.</hi> And as for what he inſinuates about this Apoſtle's being <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nothing that he refers us to for proof, will bear him out in this fond Conceit. The next Inſtance he brings is <hi>Paul;</hi> but with what propriety I can't imagin; eſpecially ſince he himſelf confeſſes, that he was <hi>immediately</hi> called by CHRIST.— His laſt Inſtance is <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who (he tells us) was called in the ORDINARY <hi>manner;</hi> that is, He had not an <hi>immediate</hi> Divine Call, but the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> conferred his Apoſtolical Power upon him. But how does that appear? Sure I am, we read of no ſuch Thing in the place he refers us to, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.36. Nay, we have very ſufficient Grounds to conclude, that <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when he received this new Name from the Apoſtles, was no more than a <hi>Teacher</hi> or <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi> We don't hear of his doing any thing more than <hi>preaching the Word,</hi> for a conſiderable Time after this. Nay, not till after (what we read of, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.) his <hi>Seperation</hi> (together with <hi>Paul</hi>) to a ſpecial Miniſtry, by the hands of <hi>certain Teachers,</hi> at the Direction of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> After which indeed we find him call'd an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> ordaining <hi>Elders,</hi> &amp;c. Here then, There are two Things our <hi>Author</hi> muſt grant. 1. If <hi>Barnabas</hi> was an Apoſtle really, and ſeperated to his Apoſtleſhip in an <hi>ordinary</hi> manner, it muſt be at <hi>this</hi> Time: whence it will follow (contrary to his darling Principle) That the Power of <hi>Ordination</hi> is not the <hi>peculiar</hi> Privilege of an Officer <hi>ſuperior</hi> to Presbyters or ordinary Teachers; but that Teachers may ordain Teachers, yea Biſhops and Apoſtles too. Or elſe 2. He muſt own <hi>Barnabas</hi>'s Call to be <hi>immediate</hi> &amp; not in the <hi>ordinary</hi> manner: ſo conſequently the Inſtance not at all to his purpoſe. — The <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> brought theſe Inſtances to prove, was, That the APOSTLES <hi>themſelves conferred Apoſtolical Power on others.</hi> But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every unbyaſs'd Reader will be of opinion, that all his Inſtances are impertinent, and will vote the <hi>Gentleman</hi> wholly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002594_0048_0FDB7E465647B470"/>
beſide his Cuſhion.—And now having thus ſap't the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, hence the Argument he builds upon it in favor of his beloved Prelacy, by natural Conſequence falls to the Ground, and turns to nothing.</p>
            <p>BUT moreover, to enforce what he had ſaid relating to theſe Apoſtles, our <hi>Author</hi> proceeds to inſtance in ſome <hi>others,</hi> who were <hi>raiſed from among the ordinary Pastors, to the</hi> Apoſtolical <hi>or</hi> Epiſcopal <hi>Order; and endu'd with Authority over Churches and their Paſtors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 47. HE inſtances in <hi>Timothy,</hi> and endeavours to prove, <hi>That He was Biſhop of the Church of</hi> Epheſus.— But how does he prove it? Why, becauſe he had committed to him the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Powers of Ordination &amp; Juriſdiction.</hi> But this is of little weight; unleſs he can further prove, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had a PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICULAR and fixed RELATION to that Church; at leaſt that he had the SOLE Power in himſelf; that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd to ordain &amp; govern ALONE, and the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> there abſolutely excluded: Since otherwiſe, by the ſame Rule, and way of Reaſoning, we may as well conclude that <hi>Timothy</hi> was to be <hi>ſole</hi> TEACHER at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and none to <hi>preach</hi> but he; becauſe he is exhorted to <hi>give himſelf to Reading, to Exhortation &amp; Doctrine; to preach the Word, to he instant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon.</hi> 'Tis not enough to ſay, <hi>Timothy</hi> had theſe &amp; thoſe Powers, and was to do this and t'other Thing: but it muſt be prov'd that the <hi>Elders of Epheſus</hi> had not the ſame Powers, and cou'd not do the ſame Things, (even tho' they had the ſame Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications) that they might not <hi>lay on Hands,</hi> might not <hi>reprove one another,</hi> as there was occaſion, and the like. And then, It muſt be proved that <hi>Timothy</hi> had thoſe Powers, and exerciſed them, in the Capacity of a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> not as one having <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Authority, and by virtue of extraordinary Gifts; much leſs as being an <hi>Elder:</hi> and that he had not the <hi>Aſſistence</hi> of the other Elders.— Particularly it muſt be proved, That he had the <hi>ſole</hi> Power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and acted <hi>ſingly</hi> herein, if ever the Prelatiſts wou'd gain their point. But now how improbable is this? Seeing all the <hi>Ordinations</hi> we read of were performed by a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Ordainers: and eſpecially ſeeing, if <hi>Paul</hi> was concern'd in the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> he took the hands of the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> with his own: for we cannot ſuppoſe but that <hi>Timothy</hi> wou'd follow the Pattern of <hi>his own</hi> Ordination, and not aſſume more Power than the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> himſelf claimed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:002594_0049_0FDB7E47B5F585B8"/>MOREOVER, It is obſervable, by the ſame way of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our <hi>Author</hi> makes uſe of here, to prove <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Epiſcopacy, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do infer <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy from other places of Scripture (as <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19 <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15.) Where <hi>CHRIST</hi> gave Inſtructions, Charges and Powers to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</hi> uſing the <hi>ſingular</hi> number, and directing his Speech to <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> even when the <hi>other</hi> Apoſtles were by. And indeed, I think, if the mere Form of Expreſſion is any thing to be built upon, the <hi>Papists</hi> may as well pretend, that what <hi>CHRIST</hi> here ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> was <hi>perſonal</hi> and peculiar to him, as the <hi>Prelatists</hi> appropriate to <hi>Timothy</hi> what <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in his Epiſtles to him about Government &amp; Ordination. For perhaps <hi>Timothy</hi> might differ little more (if any thing) from the Reſt of the <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> than <hi>Peter</hi> did from the Reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Now the Apoſtles acted among themſelves in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Parity;</hi> notwithſtanding the ſeeming <hi>peculiar</hi> Powers given to <hi>Peter.</hi> And the Caſe at <hi>Epheſus</hi> might be the very ſame.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, I wou'd obſerve; If what our <hi>Author</hi> affirms be true, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had a Power over the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it is a Truth, that will rather <hi>hurt</hi> than help his Cauſe. For it is a plain Caſe, that the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were of the <hi>Epiſcopal Order.</hi> Theſe are they to whom the Apoſtle ſaid, Act 20.28. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt hath made you</hi> Biſhops, or, (as in our Tranſlation) <hi>Overſeers.</hi> And in the 1ſt Epiſt. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 3d Chap. <hi>Paul</hi> very evidently aſcribes to theſe Elders <hi>the power of Government.</hi> They were to be <hi>ſuch as ruled well their own Houſes, having their Children in ſubjection with all Gravity,</hi>— for this remarkable Reaſon, becauſe <hi>if a Man know not bow to rule his own Houſe, how ſhall he take Care of the Church of GOD?</hi> Which paſſage, the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (whoſe <hi>Authority</hi> perhaps may go as far with ſome, as our <hi>Author</hi> ſuppoſes Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s will with others) para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes thus; <q>For ſure he that cannot rule ſo much a leſs Province, will be unfit to be made a <hi>Governour</hi> of the Church of GOD.</q> Now the <hi>Epiſcoparians</hi> agree with the <hi>Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> that the Powers of <hi>Government</hi> &amp; <hi>Ordination</hi> go together. Since therefore theſe Presbyters had the <hi>Former,</hi> they muſt of neceſſity have had the <hi>Latter</hi> alſo. Hence if <hi>Timothy</hi> had a Power over theſe <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> affirms, he muſt be forced to grant one of theſe three Things, (neither of which will pleaſe him nor ſerve his Cauſe) <hi>Viz. Either,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:002594_0050_0FDB7E4941761D70"/>(1.) THAT that Power in <hi>Timothy</hi> was only <hi>temporary</hi> &amp; <hi>extraordinary;</hi> and he (ſo far) an extraordinary Officer, as the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> generally ſay he was.— <hi>Or,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THAT there is an <hi>ordinary</hi> Officer in the Church <hi>Juperior</hi> to <hi>Biſhops;</hi> ſince the <hi>Epiſcoparians</hi> reckon all that have the powers of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> to be Biſhops. For which Reaſon, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> puts that Conſtruction upon 2 Tim. 2.2. <hi>Appoint them as Biſhops in the ſeveral Churches</hi> UNDER THEE.— Or elſe,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) HE muſt allow ſuch Officers, as he thinks <hi>inferior to Biſhops,</hi> to have the Powers of <hi>Government</hi> &amp; <hi>Ordination;</hi> which is one of the main Things <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> contend for.</p>
            <p>BUT now in the laſt place, I wou'd obſerve; Our <hi>Author</hi> makes ſome <hi>Acknowlegements</hi> elſewhere that evidently ſubvert the Doctrine of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Epiſcopacy. <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. He confeſſes <hi>Paul</hi>'s Juriſdiction over <hi>Timothy,</hi> when he mentions what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of him, That <hi>He ſerved with him, as a</hi> Son <hi>with his</hi> Father, <hi>in the work of the Goſpel;</hi> being <hi>obſequious to Apoſtolical Orders; going whither</hi> he <hi>was ſent, and coming when called,</hi> &amp;c. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where our <hi>Author</hi> obſerves, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had <hi>Juriſdiction over all Churches;</hi> whence it follows that <hi>Timothy</hi> an Officer in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> muſt be in ſome Subjection to <hi>Paul.</hi> And if he was ſubject or ſubordinate to another, then certainly he cou'd not be a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop;</hi> ſince ſuch a Biſhop muſt have a <hi>Fulneſs of Power</hi> in his particular Province, and be exempt from the Juriſdiction of any Eccleſiaſtical Superiors: Much leſs cou'd he have <hi>Apostolic Power,</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> pretends; becauſe (as he juſtly obſerves, <hi>pag.</hi> 17) <hi>All Apostles by their Commiſſion had equal Power, and there was no Superiority of one Apoſtle to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a word, If (after all) this Gentleman will maintain that <hi>Timothy</hi> had and exerciſed <hi>Epiſcopal Power</hi> over the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (tho' he dare not venture to ſay, <hi>under what Deſignation,</hi> as his Phraſe is) then he muſt neceſſarily grant one of theſe Things — <hi>Either,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) THAT <hi>Timothy</hi> had an <hi>abſolute independent</hi> Power, and was not under the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Juriſdiction.— <hi>Or,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THAT the Power, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> exerciſed over him, was <hi>extraordinary;</hi> and ſo the Apoſtles only <hi>temporary</hi> Officers.— <hi>Or,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) THAT the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Power was not properly and ſimply <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> but of a different Kind: and ſo the Apoſtles an Order <hi>diſtinct</hi> from Biſhops.— <hi>Or elſe,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:002594_0051_0FDB7E4ACF4E1F10"/>(4.) THAT <hi>all</hi> Biſhops have not by Divine Right an <hi>Equality</hi> of Power, but may be in Subordination to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>LET him chuſe which he will of theſe <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> he muſt needs commit <hi>violence</hi> upon one part or other of his Scheme; and what he has built up with one hand, pull down with his other.</p>
            <p>I know not of any way now left our <hi>Author</hi> to take in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of his Doctrine, but to ſay, That <hi>Timothy was the Apoſtle's</hi> Subſtitute, <hi>or Delegate; not acting properly in his</hi> own, <hi>but in</hi> Paul's <hi>Name, governed by Apostolical Inſtructions and executing Apoſtolical Orders.</hi>— And indeed, if we compare what our <hi>Author</hi> ſays of <hi>Timothy</hi> in his 25th <hi>pag.</hi> with what he ſays in his 49th <hi>pag.</hi> he will appear to be of <hi>this Opinion.</hi>—But neither will this help his Argument at all. No Plea can be gather'd from it, for Biſhops being Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, though we ſuppoſe the Delegation to <hi>Timothy</hi> to be matter of Fact: becauſe it can't be prov'd, but that <hi>Timothy</hi> was an <hi>itinerant</hi> Miſſionary, having no particular Relation to the Church of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> becauſe it can't be proved, but that the ſuppoſed <hi>Truſt</hi> committed to him was a <hi>temporary</hi> and tranſient Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one of thoſe <hi>extraordinary Expedients,</hi> which the peculiar Occaſions &amp; Neceſſities of that Day called for; having a <hi>particular Reſpect to the firſt planting of the Goſpel, and the erecting and ſetling the Chriſtian Church in the world:</hi> the Powers relating to which our <hi>Author</hi> himſelf, (<hi>pag.</hi> 33.) owns were <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary.</hi>— Furthermore, As I have had occaſion once and again to obſerve, He confeſſes that the Apoſtles <hi>Juriſdiction over all Churches</hi> was but temporary, and needful only for the primitive Times; and if ſo, I can't ſee how a <hi>limitted</hi> Juriſdiction of that nature ſhould be neceſſary in after-times. If <hi>Paul</hi>'s Juriſdiction over <hi>all Churches</hi> was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, then it ſeems to me that the Juriſdiction he is ſaid to exerciſe over the Church &amp; Paſtors of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in particular, by the mediation of <hi>Timothy</hi> (which was ſpecifically the ſame with that) muſt be likewiſe extraordinary <hi>Timothy</hi>'s pretended E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy cou'd be no other than the Exerciſe of Apoſtolical univerſal Juriſdiction, under a particular Application: and this particular Truſt muſt ceaſe together with the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Power that was the Foundation &amp; Source of it.— Moreover, It is not unworthy of Conſideration, That in the exerciſe of this ſuppoſed Epiſcopal Government, <hi>Timothy</hi> had an <hi>inſpired Apoſtle</hi> to direct him: And now will any imagin
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002594_0052_0FDB7E5037141900"/>
that the <hi>Biſhops, Timothy</hi>'s pretended Succeſſors, do not want ſome <hi>Higher Authority</hi> to ſuperviſe them, as well? Or are <hi>Preſbyters</hi> the only Perſons that need to be under the Conduct and Regulation of Superiors! Methinks, our <hi>Timothies</hi> as much need a <hi>Paul</hi> to inſpect them, as the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> want a <hi>Timothy</hi> to govern them. And ſince there's no more any <hi>Paul</hi> with his extraordinary Powers, we may ſafely conclude that <hi>Timothy</hi> his ſuppoſed <hi>Delegate,</hi> has long ago taken his final Leave of the World.</p>
            <p>BUT now to proceed with our <hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 48. HE inſtanceth in <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſays, That <hi>the like Power &amp; Authority</hi> (with that of <hi>Timothy) was conferred on him, over the Churches in Crete.</hi> But here the like Difficulties ariſe too: and if the Caſe of Both was the ſame, the ſame Anſwer may ſerve for both.— I ſhall only obſerve, that <hi>the Elders</hi> to <hi>be ordained by</hi> Titus <hi>in every City,</hi> were to be blameleſs as the <hi>Stewards of God,</hi> that is (ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond)</hi> as <hi>thoſe that had the</hi> Government <hi>of GOD's Family intruſted to them.</hi> Now ſince the <hi>Elders</hi> or Presbyters, were to have the power of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they were to have that of <hi>Ordination</hi> likewiſe; and ſo were to be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> according to the opinion of the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Hence if our <hi>Author</hi> aſſert <hi>Titus</hi>'s Epiſcopal Power over them, He will entangle himſelf in all the inextricable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which I have caſt in his way, under the former head.</p>
            <p>THUS you ſee the two Inſtances of <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> thought wou'd afford convincing Arguments for a ſettled <hi>Prelacy</hi> in the Church, do conclude nothing at all in favour of it. It was therefore ingenuouſly done of Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> to deſert his Brethren, by making thoſe Conceſſions, which we find in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his Commentary upon <hi>Titus.</hi> "As to the great Controverſy (ſaith he) whether <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> were indeed made <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the one of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the other of <hi>Crete;</hi> I confeſs I can find nothing of this matter in any Writer of the <hi>first three</hi> Centuries, nor any Intimation that they bore that Name —. (He adds afterwards) I confeſs, that theſe two Inſtances, abſolutely taken, afford us no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments for a ſettled <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I come now to our <hi>Author</hi>'s laſt Inſtance, viz. <hi>The</hi> Angels <hi>of the ſeven Churches of Aſia, which</hi> (he tells us) <hi>were Perſons of the</hi> Apoſtolical <hi>&amp;</hi> Epiſcopal <hi>Order.</hi> But his Argument here,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002594_0053_0FDB7E5237269378"/>
is as weak and unconcluding as any of the Former. For there is no Evidence at all, nor any Shadow of Reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> were <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> or ſuch as had Authority over Presbyters. There is nothing in the Word <hi>Angel,</hi> that will yield any Demonſtration of it. Whether you conſider the Etymology of the <hi>Name,</hi> or the Style of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> there's nothing to forbid our taking it in a <hi>Collective</hi> Senſe, for the Body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Presbyters.</hi> And if we look into the <hi>Epistles</hi> to thoſe Churches, we ſhall find many Expreſſions that favour this Conſtruction: but not a word (that I can ſee) countenancing the Epiſcopal Opinion. Nay, if we ſhou'd allow every Angel to be a <hi>ſingle</hi> Perſon; the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt you can ſuppoſe him to be, is a <hi>Senior Pastor</hi> in a Church; or the <hi>Moderator</hi> of a Presbytery, approved by ſome who are in their Judgment &amp; Practice very Anti-prelatical. There is not the leaſt Hint given, as if theſe <hi>Angels</hi> had Juriſdiction over any inferior Miniſters; much leſs the <hi>ſole</hi> power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a <hi>Negative</hi> upon Paſtors and Churches: without which Things, there can be no rational Inference (from thoſe Angels) in favour of <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops.</hi> 'Tis indeed one of the moſt <hi>noiſy</hi> &amp; bluſtering Arguments made uſe of on the Epiſcopal ſide, but perhaps equally <hi>ſhallow,</hi> and ſenſeleſs.</p>
            <p>THUS I have faithfully examin'd all the <hi>Inſtances,</hi> our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> has thought fit to mention, for the proof of his Point, <hi>That the Apoſtolic Power over</hi> Paſtors <hi>is continu'd in the Church, in the hands of</hi> Biſhops. And I am apt to flatter my ſelf, that I have <hi>diſarm'd</hi> him of all his ſuppoſed <hi>Precedents,</hi> have <hi>beaten him off from his ſtrong Holds,</hi> and turn'd moſt of his <hi>own</hi> Weapons upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>NOW it remains to conſider the <hi>Replies</hi> he has made to the Scripture-Proofs, which <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> bring: but before I paſs to that, let me look back a little, and conſider an incidental Paſſage or two of our <hi>Author</hi>'s, under the former head.</p>
            <p>AT the bottom of <hi>pag.</hi> 48. (ſpeaking of <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi>) he ſays, <hi>I will not contend but that in the</hi> EXERCISE OF THIS POWER, <hi>they might have taken the Advice &amp;</hi> CONCUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENCE <hi>of the faithful Paſtors in theſe Churches, &amp; concerted Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with them: and not done things in an arbitrary &amp; deſpotic manner.</hi> To this I cannot anſwer better than in the words of Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Vind. part. <hi>3.</hi> ch. <hi>1.</hi> pa. <hi>39.</hi>
               </note>. <q>As to our part, we do not condemn all manner
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002594_0054_0FDB7E53CBB3ED08"/>
of precedence or pre-eminence. If the Epiſcoparians had only aſſerted it to be both lawful &amp; uſeful, that among Presbyters who are, by the firſt Inſtitution, all equal, there ſhould be one for Order's ſake, placed above the reſt, and called the Biſhop; we ſhould not upon that account have contended with them, or ſeparated from them. Who knows not that the foreign Churches, that are under Presbyterian Government, have, in their Synods &amp; Claſſes, <hi>Moderators, Prolocutors,</hi> &amp;c which are by Experience found neceſſary? And if men had been entruſted with thoſe Offices in our Churches, not barely upon occaſion, but <hi>for life,</hi> or <hi>as long as they behav'd themſelves well in them,</hi> I hardly think any Quarrel would have riſen upon this head. Nay, ſo earneſtly did our Miniſters deſire Peace, that if our Biſhops had been obliged to govern their Churches, with the Conſent and Aſſiſtance of their Presbyters, they would have born with it, rather than have been deprived of the <hi>Publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of their <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> For they thus conſidered with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that it was enough for them, if they preſerved entire the power they received from GOD, and left the Conſecration whereby the Presbyters are made Biſhops, as a uſeleſs thing, to thoſe who were ſatisfied with the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs &amp; Expediency of it. This then is our Judgment, that the diſtinction our Adverſaries make between Presbyter and Biſhop is groundleſs, being no where made in the Scripture; and that CHRIST is alone a Monarch in His Church; and that He hath never appointed a Monarchical Form of Government to be practiſed in it;</q> ſince we no where find any ſuch thing taught, either by <hi>CHRIST himſelf,</hi> or by his <hi>holy Apoſtles, to whom he gave ſpecial Commiſſion and Power to plant, and ſettle, and govern his Church, in his name. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom therefore,</hi> (to borrow our <hi>Author</hi>'s words, <hi>pag.</hi> 50, 51.) <hi>we cannot entertain the leaſt doubt in our minds but that they would be moſt faithful &amp; exact, in ſettling that Order, and Inſtituting thoſe Officers in all fully conſtituted Churches, which their Lord had appointed; and would be careful to leave the Church, at their Death under the ſame Order &amp; Government, furniſhed with the ſame Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; Miniſters, which CHRIST himſelf her Lord, had inſtituted &amp; appointed for her Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, ſince our <hi>Author</hi> is fully perſuaded as well as I, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> were faithful, exact, and careful in model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Church according to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own appointment; I can't ſee, that it would have been any great <hi>Confirmation</hi> of

his Cauſe, if he had brought forth the <hi>Records of the Ancient Church,</hi> and <hi>Catalogues</hi> of its <hi>Biſhops,</hi> which he ſpeaks of, <hi>pa.</hi> 51. [Nay, altho' the Biſhops may be there (<hi>as</hi> pa. 43. <hi>he tells us they are</hi>) frequently called <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and again, the Apoſtles ſtiled <hi>Biſhops;</hi> nay, further, altho' he cou'd make it appear, as evident, as himſelf ſuppoſes it is, that many of the <hi>Ancients</hi> were of opinion, <hi>That in the Apostles was inſtituted the Epiſcopal Office, and that in the Biſhops the Apoſtolic Office was continu'd;</hi> This (neither) cou'd not ſerve him much.] For if they ſpeak <hi>not</hi> according to the <hi>Institution of Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> we may ſafely venture to ſay, That ſo far as they are <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with it, <hi>there is no light in them.</hi> Whereas, on the other hand, if we find them <hi>conformable</hi> to it, however they may deſerve Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, yet they will add no weight or force at all to our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Inſtitution.—Much might be ſaid to this matter, but ſince our <hi>Author</hi> only gives a tranſient <hi>Hint</hi> upon it, and ſeems preſently to retract it, by ingenuouſly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he has taken a ſtep out of the Line he had ſet himſelf, I ſhall add nothing further in Reply to it, but the following Paſſages from a Learned <hi>Diſſenter.</hi> "We deny not (ſaith he) that many of the Fathers ſeem to make a great difference betwixt <hi>Biſhops</hi> &amp; <hi>Preſbyters:</hi> but this doth not overthrow out Hypotheſis. For if they are the ſame in <hi>Scripture,</hi> the ſayings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> cannot make them otherwiſe: and yet (he adds) few or none of the Ancients ſay they are <hi>diſtinct Orders;</hi> much leſs that they are ſo by. <hi>Divine Right:</hi> but ſome of them acknowlege the contrary It is not therefore their uſing the name of <hi>Biſhop</hi> in a ſenſe <hi>diſtinct</hi> from that of Presbyter, no, nor requiring Presbyters to be <hi>obedient</hi> to their Biſhop, that will prove a Superiority of Order <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> for we grant that it was the early Practice of the Church to chooſe one of the <hi>graveſt</hi> &amp; wiſeſt of the <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> and conſtitute him a ſort of <hi>Preſident</hi> over the Reſt; and that where there were <hi>many</hi> Presbyters in a particular Church, commonly the <hi>Eldeſt</hi> or <hi>Worthieſt</hi> was as <hi>Pastor,</hi> and the other his Aſſiſtants: but ſtill we know, thas the <hi>Parſon</hi> of a Pariſh and the <hi>Curates</hi> are of the ſame Order; and every Biſhop in <hi>England</hi> is equal in <hi>Order</hi> to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> altho' they take an oath of <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> to him. The ſame we ſay of the Diſtinction betwixt <hi>Biſhop</hi> &amp; Presbyter in <hi>primitive</hi> Times.

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:002594_0056_0FDB7E56C264BF48"/>IN the next place our <hi>Author,</hi> pa. 52, produces the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of <hi>Calvin,</hi> concerning the <hi>form of the ancient Church;</hi> but to what purpoſe I cannot well imagine: for I think it will be far from doing him any ſervice. The form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks of in <hi>that</hi> Chapter, (which is in the 4th and not in the 1ſt Book of his Inſtitutions, as the Reader may be in danger of miſapprehending, from our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's</hi> way of citing him) is not, as he expreſly tells us, <hi>the Order delivered in the pure word of GOD;</hi> of which he had created in the foregoing Chapter; but only <hi>a ſort of Image of it</hi> exhibited <hi>in the form of the ancient Church.</hi> In which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Calvin</hi>'s charitable Opinion, <hi>that the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops with a ſincere ſtudy endeavoured to preſerve GOD</hi>'s <hi>Institution and had no mind to frame any other form of Church-Government than what was preſcribed by GOD in his Word;</hi> yet it is plain from the very Words recited from him by our <hi>Author,</hi> that he thinks <hi>they had ſomething at leaſt, in this matter diſagreeable to the Word of GOD, ſomething wanting in their Order, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in which they erred.</hi> And as for the three Orders, he he brings in <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaking of, they are not as he repreſents them, <hi>Biſhops, Preſbyters</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons;</hi> but <hi>teaching</hi> &amp; <hi>ruling Elders.</hi> His own words you may ſee in the Margin <note n="*" place="bottom">Quemadmodum tradidimus triplices miniſtros nobis commendari in ſcriptura, ita quicquid ministrorum habuit vetus Eccleſia, in tres Ordines diſtinxit: nam ex ordane <hi>PRESBYTERORUM</hi> partim eligebant Paſtores ac Doctores: reliqua pars Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura Morum et Correctionibus praerat. <hi>DIACONIS</hi> commiſſa crat cura pauperum, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>OUR <hi>Author</hi> now proceeds <hi>pag</hi> 54. <hi>to conſider ſome paſſages of Scripture, that are commonly objected againſt what he hath advanced.</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:002594_0057_0FDB7E5B6749EC20"/>
And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe Paſſages from which 'tis alleged, <hi>that the Names of Biſhop &amp; Preſbyter are promiſcuouſly uſed in the Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſignify but one and the ſame Office.</hi> To <hi>this</hi> he ſays, <hi>it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by</hi> SOME (for he ſeems not very forward to eſpouſe the Anſwer himſelf) <hi>that whenever</hi> Biſhops <hi>are named, we are to underſtand</hi> Biſhops properly ſo called, <hi>and not</hi> Presbyters, <hi>which they make appear from the Texts brought in favour of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Names.</hi> How well, we ſhall ſee preſently!</p>
            <p>THE firſt text mentioned is in <hi>Act.</hi> 20. where the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having <hi>ſent from Miletus to Epheſus,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>and called the Elders of the Church,</hi> ſo charges them, ver. 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and unto all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you</hi> OVERSEERS (or, <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as the ſame word is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tranſlated) <hi>to feed the Church of God,</hi> &amp;c.—Here it is as plain as any thing can be, that the <hi>ſame</hi> perſons who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Preſbyters</hi> ver. 17. are called alſo <hi>Biſhops</hi> ver. 28 and were <hi>ſuch Officers</hi> as there were <hi>more than one of in a Church;</hi> and therefore could not be <hi>Biſhops properly ſo called</hi> in our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>'s ſenſe. To this our <hi>Author</hi> anſwers that <hi>They ſay</hi> (it muſt be only by gueſs; for there is no foundation for it in the Text) <hi>that the Apoſtle called both Biſhops &amp; Preſbyters unto him. and that the Clergy of all the Cities thereabout were there; ſo that what he ſays,</hi> ver. 28. <hi>was principally directed to the</hi> Biſhops, <hi>and by way of reflection to the</hi> Presbyters. If we ſhould grant this were true, yet ſtill their <hi>Names</hi> are uſed <hi>promiſcuouſly.</hi> But it is ſo far from being true, that it is directly contrary both to the letter of the text and the circumſtances of the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF the Clergy of all the neighbouring Cities had been there, the Apoſtle (we may conclude) would have ſaid <hi>Flocks</hi> and Churches, and not <hi>Flock</hi> and Church. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Apoſtle was now <hi>haſtening, if poſſible, to be at Jeruſalem on the day of Pentecoſt,</hi> ver. 16. and therefore would not call at <hi>Epheſus</hi> himſelf, leſt he ſhould be detained too long; but ſent for the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church to come to him at <hi>Miletus:</hi> which makes it the moſt unlikely thing in the world, that he would tarry there till the Clergy of <hi>all</hi> the Cities about <hi>Epheſus</hi> could be called together. So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly both from the manner of the Apoſtle's Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and from the great haſte he was then in, that none but the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were there preſent; whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>Biſhops of the Holy Ghoſt's making.</hi> To all this our <hi>Author</hi> hath nothing to oppoſe, but a mere Gueſs, which
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002594_0058_0FDB7E5CB7A45E98"/>
he ſeems not willing to take the Credit of to himſelf; and which if allowed, won't ſerve the turn he uſes it for. Before I diſmiſs this Text, I would obſerve further, that the Apoſtle charges theſe <hi>Elders</hi> to <hi>feed the Church.</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>feeding</hi> being a metaphor taken from the buſineſs of a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> implies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as well as inſtruction. So that from this Text it appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT <hi>the ſame Perſons were called</hi> ELDERS <hi>&amp;</hi> BISHOPS.</p>
            <p>And</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT <hi>in one Church there were ſeveral</hi> ELDERS <hi>all</hi> ALIKE <hi>concerned in the Government of it;</hi> And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Epiſcoparian Scheme, inveſted with the power of <hi>Ordination</hi> alſo, &amp; all other Powers that belong to the higheſt Office in the Church. So that this Text proves an <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>Office</hi> as well as <hi>name:</hi> To which I will add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT in all probability this charge was given to <hi>thoſe Elders,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Timothy,</hi> who appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to have been one of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s attendants in this Voyage. And if ſo, had the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> been of our <hi>Author</hi>'s opinion, that he was the Biſhop of that Church, it is very ſtrange he ſhould take no notice at all of <hi>him,</hi> as concerned with it; nor give any charge to the Presbyters to pay due reſpect unto their <hi>Biſhop</hi> (whoſe <hi>Youth</hi> might tempt them to <hi>deſpiſe him)</hi> as well as <hi>to take heed to all the Flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE next Paſſage mentioned is that in <hi>Titus,</hi> Chap 1. where after the Apoſtle hath laid down ſome of the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the <hi>Elders whom he left Titus to ordain in every City,</hi> he gives this reaſon <hi>ver.</hi> 7. for inſiſting on thoſe qualifications: <hi>For a</hi> Biſhop <hi>muſt be blameleſs as the Steward of God,</hi> &amp;c. which wou'd be no reaſon at all, unleſs the Apoſtle intended the <hi>ſame Officer</hi> by the Biſhop in the 7th <hi>ver.</hi> which he did by the <hi>Elders</hi> before. To this, I can't find that our <hi>Author</hi> ſays any thing, which hath ſo much as the leaſt tendency to take off the force of it. But he ſays one thing to perplex himſelf and his Cauſe, viz. <hi>That there were Preſbyters before at</hi> Crete, <hi>and</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <hi>was to ordain ſome of them Biſhops;</hi> whereas he had ſaid before <hi>pa</hi> 48. <hi>That an Epiſcopal Power &amp; Authority was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on</hi> Titus <hi>over the Churches in</hi> Crete. From which two paſſages laid together one would think, that <hi>Titus</hi> was to ordain <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in ſome of the Cities in <hi>Crete, inferiour</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; whereas the Scheme of our <hi>Author</hi> and his Brethren is, <hi>That there is no ſuperiority or power of one Biſhop over another.</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:002594_0059_0FDB7E5F029938E0"/>
Beſides, as Critics obſerve, the original word here rendred to <hi>ordain,</hi> will not bear ſuch a ſenſe: it ſignifies plainly to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute</hi> &amp; <hi>appoint.</hi> And ſo here it muſt needs mean the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of perſons to the <hi>office</hi> of <hi>Preſbyters;</hi> and not the <hi>advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Preſbyters</hi> to be <hi>Biſhops. Preſbyter</hi> or <hi>Elder</hi> here is the <hi>Capacity, to which</hi> perſons were to be <hi>ordained;</hi> and not <hi>from which</hi> they were to be <hi>promoted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the next place he tells us that 1 Tim. 3.2,—7. <hi>is to be understood of Biſhops properly ſo called, that were to be ordained to preſide over other Cities, as Timothy did over Epheſus.</hi> But this won't ſerve his turn; for <hi>Timothy</hi> was <hi>to abide at Epheſus,</hi> ch 1. ver. 3. and not to travel from City to City to <hi>ordain Biſhops.</hi> Beſides, if the Apoſtle had known any middle ſort of Officer, called a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> between the <hi>Biſhop</hi> here mentioned, and the <hi>Deacon</hi> deſcribed afterwards, in the ſame Chapter, it is very ſtrange he ſhould give <hi>no character</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> when he is ſo carefully inſtructing <hi>Timothy, how to behave himſelf in the Houſe of God,</hi> that he might know what manner of perſon to put into this Office alſo, if there ſhould be occaſion for it. And therefore we cannot but conclude, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Preſbyter</hi> were the ſame thing in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s account, and that he knew no other <hi>ordinary Officers</hi> in the Church, but <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>

            <p>THE laſt Text he mentions is Phil. 1.1. <hi>Paul &amp; Timothy the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, to all the ſaints in Chriſt Jeſus, which are at Philippi, with the Biſhops &amp; Deacons.</hi> From this text we gather that the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> was not lodged in the hands of a <hi>ſingle Perſon,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop, properly ſo called,</hi> in our <hi>Author</hi>'s ſenſe; but in the hands of a <hi>plurality</hi> or <hi>Preſbytery;</hi> and that there was no <hi>middle Order</hi> in the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> between the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> here mentioned.</p>
            <p>TO this our <hi>Author</hi> anſwers, firſt. <hi>That theſe words may be underſtood of the Biſhops of</hi> Philippi, <hi>and other neighbouring Cities, who were wont to convene and meet together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY reply is, 1. That this Epiſtle is written to a <hi>Church;</hi> that therefore when it ſays <hi>to the ſaints which are at</hi> Philippi, it is to be underſtood of the Saints that dwelt there and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted that Church. And in like manner ought the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> to be underſtood of thoſe that did belong to <hi>that</hi> Church; unleſs there were ſome apparent reaſon to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:002594_0060_0FDB7E60BAD82DB0"/>2. THAT there is no Intimation in this Epiſtle, that it was to be delivered to an <hi>Aſſembly of Biſhops</hi> convened at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi;</hi> that therefore there is no Ground for ſuch a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it is a <hi>mere Gueſs</hi> to ſerve a Cauſe that needs ſuch Helps.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT it is a <hi>Gueſs</hi> not only without Foundation, but againſt the expreſs words of the Epiſtle it ſelf. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls thoſe whom he wrote it to, <hi>Philippians.</hi> Chap. 4.15. <hi>Ye Philippians know alſo,</hi> &amp;c. Now it would be very abſurd to call an <hi>Aſſembly of Biſhops,</hi> met together from the neighbouring Cities, <hi>Philippians,</hi> only becauſe they happened to hold a meeting at <hi>Philippi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 OUR <hi>Author</hi>'s Gueſs cannot be right, nor yet the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis which it is deſigned to ſerve, becauſe the Apoſtle takes no notice of any <hi>middle Order</hi> in his <hi>Salutations.</hi> For had there at that day been <hi>three Orders of Officers</hi> in the Church, and had there been ſuch a convention of <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the neighbouring Cities at <hi>Philippi,</hi> it can't be ſuppoſed, that the Deacons who are the <hi>loweſt Order</hi> would have been preſent, and the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> who are <hi>ſuperior</hi> to them, not ſo. And if the Presbyters had been preſent, certainly the Apoſtle would not have <hi>ſaluted</hi> their <hi>Inferiors,</hi> without taking any notice at all of <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WELL, If a bad <hi>Gueſs</hi> won't deſtroy the Argument foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on this Text, perhaps a forced Conſtruction may do the buſineſs better; for our <hi>Author</hi> ſays, ſecondly, <hi>That this Text may mean that</hi> Paul, <hi>and the</hi> Biſhops <hi>&amp;</hi> Deacons <hi>that were with him, ſalute the ſaints that are at</hi> Philippi. As if it had run thus. <hi>Paul &amp; Timothy the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, with the Biſhops and Deacons, to all the ſaints in Christ Jeſus, which are at Philippi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I readily agree with our <hi>Author,</hi> that this Anſwer is <hi>not obvious to every one.</hi> For it is a wonder to me, that <hi>any man,</hi> that hath re'd the two Epiſtles of the ſame Apoſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> ſhould ever make it. In both thoſe Epiſtles, the <hi>form of Expreſſion</hi> uſed in the <hi>Salutation,</hi> is exactly Parallel both in the <hi>Original,</hi> and in <hi>our Tranſlation,</hi> to the <hi>form of Expreſſion</hi> uſed here. And yet I believe the greateſt Zealot for our <hi>Author</hi>'s cauſe (when he is not out of temper) will hardly be able to perſwade himſelf, that the <hi>Salutation,</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, ought to run thus; <hi>Paul an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, thro' the will of God, and Soſthenes our Brother, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord both theirs and ours, unto the Church of God which is at Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. Or that the <hi>true Conſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Salutation</hi> in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002594_0061_0FDB7E64EB1A58F8"/>
an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt by the will of God, and Timothy our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with all the ſaints that are in all A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>haia; unto the Church of God which is at Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. I think, I need not mention the reaſons why I ſuppoſe no Body will be ambitious of the Credit of finding out ſuch a new way of reading the two laſt mentioned Salutations. And why the <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>inverted,</hi> as it is manifeſt, the <hi>ſame form of Expreſſion</hi> ought not to be, in any other place, where it is uſed by the <hi>ſame Apoſtle</hi> I believe no reaſon can be given, but ſuch an one, as it will be tho't prudence not to expoſe.</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Author</hi> hath now done with the Texts of Scripture, from which, he ſays, <hi>we allege that the Names of Biſhop &amp; Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter are uſed promiſcuouſly.</hi> And upon the whole concludes, that if he ſhould <hi>grant an Identity of names, yet it will not follow, that there was an Identity of</hi> Offices; <hi>becauſe names are common in Scripture, where Offices are acknowleged to be diſtinct.</hi> But he ſhould have remembred, that <hi>ſomething more</hi> than a bare <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Names</hi> is argued from diverſe of theſe Texts. And ſince he hath been no better able to prove, <hi>that in all theſe places we are to underſtand Biſhops properly ſo called, and not Preſbyters;</hi> he might have tho't it worth his while, to have endeavoured an anſwer to what we argue from the Texts, beſides a <hi>promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe of Names.</hi> For from <hi>Acts</hi> 20 27, 28. we not only prove, that the names of <hi>Biſhop</hi> &amp; <hi>Preſbyter</hi> are uſed promiſcuouſly; but alſo that the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was committed to a <hi>Plurality,</hi> and not to a <hi>ſingle Perſon;</hi> and that therefore all theſe <hi>Preſbyters</hi> had a power of <hi>Ordination</hi> alſo; (ſince the Powers of Government and Ordination go together, our Adverſaries themſelves being Judges) from whence it follows that <hi>Preſbyters</hi> properly ſo called have a Right by <hi>Scripture</hi> to all thoſe <hi>Powers,</hi> which <hi>Biſhops</hi> now claim as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to themſelves.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; From 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 3.4. &amp;c. We argue that the Apoſtle knew of but <hi>two Orders of Officers</hi> in the Church. For it would be <hi>very ſtrange,</hi> when he is ſo ſollicitous, that <hi>Timothy might know how he ought to behave himſelf in the Houſe of God;</hi> that yet he ſhould not give him any account of the <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> neceſſary for <hi>one Order of Officers</hi> that belonged to it. And it would be <hi>much ſtranger ſtill,</hi> that he ſhould be ſo <hi>very particular,</hi> in ſetting down the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of one ſit for the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> which is on all hands, allowed to be the <hi>lowest Order</hi> and yet <hi>omit</hi> all mention of an <hi>Officer</hi> of <hi>higher Degree and more importance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:002594_0062_0FDB7E661130F488"/>SO again, (to mention no more,) we ſay, it appears from <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. that there were but but <hi>two orders of Officers</hi> in <hi>that Church.</hi> For it would be no way conſiſtent with the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> obſerved on all occaſions by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> to have ſaluted the <hi>Deacons</hi> by name, and to have taken <hi>no notice</hi> at all of one of the <hi>Orders ſuperior to them,</hi> if there had been <hi>more than one</hi> that were ſo. And we ſay moreover, that it farther appears from this Text, that the <hi>higheſt Order</hi> here mentioned was <hi>ſuch</hi> as there might be <hi>more than one of,</hi> at the ſame time, in the ſame Church; and that therefore they could <hi>not</hi> be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the ſenſe of our Adverſaries; for of them there can be <hi>but one</hi> in a Church at once.</p>
            <p>THESE things lie <hi>plain</hi> &amp; <hi>obvious</hi> to every Eye in theſe Texts, and are much more than a <hi>bare Identity</hi> of <hi>Names;</hi> which is alſo demonſtrable from ſome of them, as hath been ſhewn above. And though our <hi>Author</hi> is pleaſed to make light of the <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>Identity of Names</hi> to <hi>Identity of Offices,</hi> and many of his brethren have treated it with a great deal of <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>inſult:</hi> yet, I ſuppoſe, if the matter be <hi>duely weighed,</hi> it will be ſound much eaſier to <hi>laugh at</hi> it, than to <hi>anſwer</hi> it</p>
            <p>INDEED it muſt be acknowledged, that <hi>all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of the <hi>Offices</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> admit of a <hi>twofold acceptation:</hi> being ſometimes uſed in a <hi>common,</hi> and ſometimes in an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate ſenſe,</hi> by the ſacred Writers. Thus for inſtance; <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſometimes ſignifies <hi>any Meſſenger,</hi> and ſometimes it is more ſtrictly taken for <hi>one of the Twelve,</hi> immediately ſent forth by our Lord. So <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in its <hi>common</hi> acceptation, ſignifies an <hi>Overſeer,</hi> and <hi>Preſbyter</hi> ſignifies an <hi>old man;</hi> but they are both of them often uſed in a more <hi>appropriate ſenſe,</hi> to denote thoſe <hi>Officers,</hi> to whom the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> &amp; <hi>Government</hi> of the Churches were committed. So again, <hi>Deacon,</hi> in its <hi>common ſenſe</hi> intends any <hi>ſervant</hi> or <hi>miniſter:</hi> but in its <hi>stricter uſe</hi> is <hi>appropriated</hi> to <hi>that Officer,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to <hi>ſerve Tables.</hi> And it is generally eaſy enough to diſcern from the ſenſe, when theſe words are to be taken for the <hi>proper Names</hi> of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſometimes denoted by them; and when they are to be taken in the <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> only to intend <hi>ſomething</hi> that may be <hi>as well</hi> expreſſed by <hi>them,</hi> as by any <hi>other words</hi> of the like ſignification.</p>
            <p>NOW this Obſervation eaſily accounts for the <hi>difficulty,</hi> objected by our <hi>Author, that the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>&amp;</hi> Paſtors <hi>are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called</hi> Deacons; Upon which he truly ſays, <hi>That it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002594_0063_0FDB7E676A5802F8"/>
cannot thence be argued, that the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>&amp;</hi> Presbyter's <hi>Office was one and the ſame with the</hi> Deacon's. The reaſon of which is, that the word <hi>Deacon</hi> in thoſe Places is uſed in its <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> according to the <hi>original ſignification</hi> of it, before it was appropriated, as a <hi>name of diſtinction,</hi> to any <hi>particular Order of Officers</hi> in the Church. And this our Tranſlators were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of; and accordingly, as the ſenſe directed them, have very well rendred it <hi>Miniſter,</hi> in thoſe places.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding this, it is certain (as hath already been obſerved) that <hi>this,</hi> and the <hi>other names</hi> of the <hi>Offices</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, are often uſed in the New Teſtament, in a more <hi>ſtrict</hi> &amp; <hi>appropriate</hi> ſenſe, to denote certain Offices, which by theſe names were diſtinguiſhed from each other. For common ſenſe will teach us that there muſt be (at leaſt) as many <hi>diſtinguiſhing names,</hi> as there were <hi>diſtinct Offices</hi> in the Church; and that <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>names</hi> muſt be <hi>as early</hi> as the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Offices:</hi> otherwiſe Chriſtians muſt have been unable for ſome time, to expreſs themſelves in ſome Caſes, either in Converſation, or in Writing, without an unintelligible Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity. Unleſs therefore our <hi>Author</hi> can prove, that the <hi>Scripture Offices</hi> were not diſtinguiſhed in the <hi>Apostles days,</hi> by the <hi>names</hi> given them in <hi>Scripture;</hi> but by ſome <hi>other names,</hi> beſt known to himſelf, and not to be met with <hi>there;</hi> he muſt allow us to conclude, that wherever we meet with theſe <hi>names,</hi> evidently uſed in a <hi>ſtrict appropriate ſenſe,</hi> there we are to underſtand <hi>certain Officers,</hi> diſtinguiſhed by theſe <hi>names</hi> from <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>any other Order,</hi> and that could <hi>not</hi> be <hi>distinguiſhed</hi> from <hi>other Orders,</hi> either in <hi>ſpeaking</hi> or <hi>writing,</hi> without theſe <hi>diſtinguiſhing names,</hi> which cuſtom had <hi>appropriated</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>AND ſtill further, where we find two of theſe names (tho' evidently uſed in a <hi>ſtrict ſenſe,</hi> yet) <hi>indifferently</hi> applied to the <hi>ſame Office,</hi> and <hi>never</hi> find them applied to <hi>any other Office,</hi> or <hi>any other names</hi> applied to <hi>that Office</hi> in an <hi>appropriate ſenſe;</hi> there we muſt be allowed to conclude, that <hi>both</hi> theſe were <hi>names,</hi> which cuſtom had given to <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame Office;</hi> and that it was well enough known at <hi>that time</hi> from all <hi>other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> by <hi>either</hi> of theſe <hi>names.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW this is exactly the Caſe, with reſpect to the <hi>names, Preſbyter</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhop.</hi> For where they are uſed in the moſt <hi>ſtrict appropriate ſenſe</hi> that can be, we find them <hi>both</hi> applied <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently</hi> to the <hi>Order of Officers,</hi> unto whom the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> &amp; <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of the Church was committed. And we <hi>never</hi> find <hi>either</hi> of them applied, in a <hi>ſtrict &amp; proper ſenſe,</hi> to any <hi>other
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002594_0064_0FDB7E68B88E64C0"/>
Order.</hi> Nor do we find the <hi>name Deacon,</hi> ever applied to <hi>this Order,</hi> but where it is <hi>manifeſtly</hi> uſed in the <hi>common,</hi> and not in the <hi>appropriate ſenſe</hi> of the word. And therefore we very juſtly conclude, that not <hi>two,</hi> but <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the ſame</hi> Office, is intended by <hi>both</hi> theſe <hi>names;</hi> and that <hi>this Office</hi> was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſtinguiſhed in the <hi>Apostles time,</hi> by <hi>either</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>FOR it would be the moſt unreaſonable thing in the world, to imagine, that there could be <hi>two diſtinct Offices,</hi> to which theſe <hi>names</hi> belonged, and yet the <hi>names</hi> be certainly uſed <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly;</hi> and never <hi>ſo</hi> uſed, as that any <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Offices</hi> can be collected from them; nor <hi>any other names</hi> given us by the ſacred writers, to <hi>distinguiſh theſe Offices</hi> by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the <hi>names</hi> of <hi>any other Office</hi> given in an <hi>appropriate ſenſe,</hi> to the <hi>Office,</hi> to which <hi>theſe two names</hi> are, in <hi>ſuch a ſenſe</hi> promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly applyed; nor laſtly, either of <hi>theſe names</hi> ever given, in an <hi>appropriate ſenſe,</hi> to any <hi>other Office,</hi> but that of <hi>inſtructing</hi> &amp; <hi>governing</hi> the Church.</p>
            <p>BUT if we ſhould let all this go for nothing, and take our <hi>Author</hi>'s own Account of the matter, it will be found to make <hi>ſtrongly for our Opinion.</hi> For after he hath told us, <hi>that the Apoſtles &amp; Pastors are frequently called</hi> Deacons; and yet that <hi>it cannot thence be argued, that the Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>&amp; Preſbyter's Office was one &amp; the ſame with the Deacon</hi>'s: the reaſon he gives for it is, <hi>That the name of the</hi> Genus <hi>is uſually given to the ſpecies; the ſuperior Office including the inferior. All</hi> Apoſtles <hi>were</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters &amp; Deacons: <hi>tho' not</hi> vice verſa; that is, tho' all <hi>Preſbyters</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons</hi> were not <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> So that according to him a <hi>ſuperior Office</hi> might be called by the name of an <hi>inferior:</hi> but an <hi>inferior Office</hi> might not be called by the name of a <hi>ſuperior,</hi> If therefore we can find the ſame perſons, that are called <hi>Preſbyters</hi> (and that <hi>certainly</hi> were <hi>Preſbyters</hi> in <hi>fact</hi> as well as <hi>name</hi>) immediately after called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, from our <hi>Author</hi>'s own way of reaſoning, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> were not an <hi>order ſuperior</hi> to <hi>Preſbyters.</hi> Now for an Inſtance of this, I will only refer him to the above mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. where thoſe that are called <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Preſbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ver. 17. (and who were certainly <hi>Preſbyters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called,</hi> becauſe there were more than one of them in the ſame Church) are called alſo <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ver. 28. as hath been before obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:002594_0065_0FDB7E6A41334428"/>NOW, In the <hi>next</hi> place our <hi>Author</hi> comes to anſwer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments bro't by us for <hi>Preſbyterian Parity,</hi> from ſeveral Texts; ſuch as Matth. 20.25 <hi>The Lords of the Gentiles</hi> &amp;c. and the parallel places. Tho' 'tis to be obſerved; he groſsly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſents us, when he inſinuates, that we plead <hi>this Text,</hi> or any of the others mention'd by him, as <hi>condemning all Imparity among Church.</hi> Officers, <hi>or a ſuperiority of one</hi> Order <hi>above another</hi> or the like. For, we allow of the Diſtinction betwixt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of an <hi>ordinary</hi> Character, and Others inveſted with <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Powers: So likewiſe we diſtinguiſh between one ordinary Officer and another, and aſſert a difference of Order between <hi>Biſhops</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons.</hi> But what we make uſe of this Text for, is to prove a <hi>Parity</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> among themſelves, and ſo of <hi>Preſbyters</hi> or Biſhops among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>I cannot give into his opinion, That this Text forbids <hi>only that</hi> Power &amp; Juriſdiction, <hi>which is exerciſed with imperious Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs &amp; Domination:</hi> but muſt beg leave to think (till I can obtain better Light) that it condemns and inhibits <hi>all manner</hi> of Superiority &amp; Dominion whatſoever, <hi>in the Caſe it relates to.</hi> And when our <hi>Author</hi> is pleas'd to ſay, <hi>It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to any ſuch purpoſe, by any judicious Perſon of either Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion;</hi> he commits a grand <hi>Miſtake,</hi> and betrays his want of Reading or Memory.

'Twas briefly this; The Mother of <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s Children came with her Sons to our <hi>Lord,</hi> worſhipping him, and deſiring a certain Favour of him, viz.

            <p n="1">1ſt then, HE obſerves, <hi>That it</hi>'s <hi>only a</hi> Secular <hi>Dominion, that our Lord forbids,</hi> &amp;c. Where, by the way, He ſeems to <hi>retract</hi> what he had ſaid juſt before, when he <hi>deny'd</hi> any other Dominion to be condemned, but <hi>only that which is exerciſed with imperious Bitterneſs.</hi> He has done well to correct himſelf, as he ſeems to do, when he here interprets it of <hi>ſecular</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; which being mention'd without any Limitation or Qualification, we muſt ſuppoſe him to allow it forbidden to the Apoſtles <hi>intirely,</hi> whether <hi>exerciſed with Bitterneſs</hi> or not. Now this, methinks, is a good Advance towards the <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Biſhops, who ſo much affect <hi>State.</hi> Dignities, and ſometimes ſuſtain <hi>Civil</hi> Offices; therein approving themſelves <hi>true Succeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> while dreaming of an <hi>Earthly</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It was what ſo offended good old <hi>Latimer,</hi> that he is ſaid in a Sermon to have adviſed King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. to <hi>unlord</hi> all the <hi>Lordly Biſhops,</hi> and remove them from all their <hi>temporal Offices &amp; Employments, that they might follow their ſpiritual Plough.

For their frequenting the <hi>Court,</hi> attending the <hi>Council Table,</hi> ſitting in <hi>Parliament,</hi> being ſometimes <hi>Regents</hi> of the Kingdom, or <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> abroad, and the like, muſt needs take them very much off from their more <hi>proper</hi> Work, as well as very little ſute with their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Character. Hence the Wiſdom of a <hi>Church of England Parliament</hi> ſaw fit once to paſs a Vote, That <hi>no Biſhop ſhould ſit in Parliament, nor bear any ſway in Temporal Affairs; and that no Clergyman ſhou'd be in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the Peace.</hi> The Apoſtle obſerves upon this head; <hi>No man that warreth, entangleth himſelf with the Affairs of this Life;</hi> requiring <hi>Timothy,</hi> as a good Soldier, and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the Church of CHRIST, not to engage himſelf in any ſecular Negotiations: So Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> notes on the Place; and moreover obſerves to us, That the <hi>Apoſtolical Canons</hi> (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) declare, Thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> ought to be <hi>depoſed,</hi> who immerſe themſelves in <hi>worldly</hi> Affairs. — But I ſeem to have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that our <hi>Author</hi> &amp; I have no Diſpute about theſe Things; ſince he fairly confeſſes, that our Savior forbids his Apoſtles and Miniſters to exerciſe <hi>Secular</hi> Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:002594_0068_0FDB7E741871EB58"/>HOWEVER, I don't agree with him, that <hi>this</hi> was <hi>all.</hi> I preſume this do'sn't reach the <hi>utmoſt meaning</hi> of our Saviour's. For, tho' he might have ſome View (as our <hi>Author</hi> obſerves) to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> opinion of a <hi>Temporal Kingdom,</hi> and deſign partly to remove that Miſtake; yet the Generality of the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Interpreters that I have ſeen, do ſuppoſe our Savior's Words alſo to have a Reference to their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Capacity,</hi> and to forbid their Affectation of Pre-eminence &amp; Authority one over another in the <hi>Church.</hi>— And 'tis very obſervable that our Lord uſed often, in his Replies unto others, to have a meaning <hi>beyond</hi> the Drift of the Queſtion put to him, and different from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. OUR <hi>Author</hi> obſerves; <hi>That Dominion, which the Lord, of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exerciſed, was over their Subjects; not one over another.</hi> But how weak an Inſinuation is this! Who knows not, How the Kings of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have exerciſed <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> not only over their <hi>Subjects,</hi> but ever &amp; anon alſo over other <hi>Princes</hi> round about them! What mean Imperial Dignities, and petty Sovereignties!— I think our Text may be ſo turned, and perhaps not unfairly; <hi>The Princes of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exerciſe Dominion over them,</hi> i. e. The People: <hi>and they that are Great,</hi> (ſuch as Emperors) <hi>do exerciſe Authority upon them,</hi> that is, upon inferior Princes. <hi>But</hi> (ſays our Lord to his Apoſtles) <hi>it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> It is the Dominion of one <hi>Apoſtle</hi> over <hi>another,</hi> that is here forbidden: as ſeems evident from what is added, <hi>Whoſoever will be chief</hi> among you, <hi>let him be your ſervant.</hi> And this is but agreeable to the Scope of the <hi>Woman's</hi> Requeſt to our Lord, <hi>That her Sons</hi> (two of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) <hi>might have the two</hi> higheſt <hi>Poſts in his Kingdom,</hi> and ſit above the other Ten; who are therefore ſaid to be <hi>moved with indignation againſt the two Brethren, when they heard it.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it will be clearer ſtill, if we conſult the <hi>parallel Texts</hi> mention'd by our <hi>Author, (Luk.</hi> 9.47. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.24.) where we find the <hi>occaſion</hi> of our Lord's giving theſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Rules to his Apoſtles is ſaid to be the <hi>Riſing of a Strife &amp; Reaſoning among them,</hi> which of them <hi>ſhould be accounted the greateſt.</hi>— Nothing then can be more evident, whatever the Superiority condemned here by our Lo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

joyn the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and maintain <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy:</hi> but then he will have the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> world againſt him, even his own Epiſcopal <hi>Brethren,</hi> who conſtantly make uſe of theſe very Texts in writing againſt the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> who pretends to be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, and claims to be <hi>oecumenical Primate!</hi> Now if the <hi>Romiſh Primacy</hi> is unlawful by virtue of theſe Texts, I believe any man will be hard put to't to give me a tolerable Reaſon, why the <hi>Engliſh Prelacy</hi> ſhou'd not be as well accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unlawful too; for I think it has been ſufficiently prov'd, that <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> or Paſtors, are the true <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of the Apoſtles: and therefore, ſince there was a perfect <hi>Equality</hi> among the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, it follows there ſhou'd be the like among ordinary <hi>Ministers,</hi> who ſucceed them, and a Superiority of one Paſtor over another muſt be eſteem'd forbidden by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in theſe Texts we are conſidering.</p>
            <p>VERY groundleſs are the <hi>Conſequences</hi> that our <hi>Author</hi> draws from the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Interpretation of our Saviour's Words. This will not (as he inſinuates) <hi>deſtroy the power of Ministers over their Flocks:</hi> for, it is only the Dominion of one <hi>Miniſter</hi> over <hi>another,</hi> that we ſuppoſe forbidden. Neither will it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the power of Synods &amp; Councils,</hi> if they keep within their proper Limits, and aſſume not, what the inſpired Apoſtle diſclaim'd, <hi>A Dominion over the Faith of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. HE obſerves, That Phraſe in Luke, <hi>He that is greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> plainly implies a Superiority of Power:— But I pray, why not rather an <hi>Eminency</hi> of <hi>Gifts</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſonal worth,</hi> as is attributed to thoſe Apoſtles, of whom we read <hi>They ſeemed to be Pillars.</hi> And how will he reconcile ſuch a Conſtruction, with what he aſſerts elſewhere, viz. <hi>That all the Apostles were equal!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, He argues from the <hi>Example</hi> of CHRIST miniſtring to his Diſciples, which he propoſeth to their Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That <hi>the Command of miniſtring takes not away the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp; Power, ſince none will doubt, that Chriſt was Lord &amp; Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.</hi> But there's <hi>no weight</hi> in this, if we conſider the <hi>nature</hi> of the Argument from CHRIST's <hi>Example;</hi> it being taken <hi>a Majori.</hi> When he urges his own Example, in taking upon him the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> and <hi>humbling</hi> himſelf to the <hi>meaneſt Offices</hi> for his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> in order to ſhame them out of their <hi>fooliſh Ambition</hi> to appear in the <hi>Form of Princes,</hi> and to <hi>Lord it over</hi> one another; I ſay, in thus urging his own Example. He only argues from the <hi>greater</hi> to the <hi>leſs:</hi> As if he had ſaid, If <hi>I,</hi> who am your <hi>ſupreme Lord,</hi> have ſtoop'd to miniſter unto <hi>you,</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:002594_0070_0FDB7E7748D65058"/>
How <hi>much more</hi> ſhou'd you my Diſciples, who are <hi>Fellow-Servants</hi> under one Maſter, <hi>ſubmit</hi> your ſelves one to another, and be <hi>aſhamed</hi> any of you to ſtrive after <hi>Superiority</hi> &amp; <hi>Pre-eminene</hi> over one another! — We may illuſtrate and confirm this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, by our Savior's own words elſewhere, (Joh. 13.14, 16.) <hi>If I then your Lord &amp; Maſter have waſhed your Feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet.—The ſervant is not greater than his Lord.</hi>—</p>
            <p>BUT further,</p>
            <p n="4">4. HE argues from <hi>our Saviour's Inſtituting Miniſters of different Offices &amp; Degrees; firſt, Apoſtles, then the</hi> 70, &amp;c. that it can't be tho't he condemn'd a <hi>Diſparity</hi> among <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters.</hi>— To this I anſwer, That here's either a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> or a mean <hi>begging of the Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO Body diſputes an <hi>Imparity</hi> or <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of Order among Goſpel-<hi>Officers;</hi> tho' we deny it among Officers of the <hi>ſame Kind,</hi> and particularly among <hi>Biſhops, Pastors</hi> or Teachers.</p>
            <p>HE argues from the 70, who have been long ago <hi>diſcharg'd;</hi> and Evidence brought, that CHRIST left them not in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at his Aſcenſion: or however, that they were not a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Order from the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>BUT if none of the former <hi>Objections</hi> will bear, He has another in Store—</p>
            <p n="5">5. HE adds, <hi>If our Lord had deſign'd to forbid</hi> all Diſparity <hi>among the Miniſters of the Goſpel;</hi> 'Tis like, he wou'd <hi>rather</hi> have ſtated the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> between Them, and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Religion under the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation, and not the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to this the Anſwer is eaſy. Our Savior choſe this Compariſon to <hi>meet more fully</hi> with the carnal Notion, our <hi>Author</hi> juſt now mention'd, of an <hi>Earthly Kingdom</hi> &amp; <hi>Civil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> which the Diſciples (with the Jews) dreamt of; as well as at the ſame time to <hi>reprove</hi> their <hi>Ambition</hi> of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority to one another.</p>
            <p>IT might be added, (as I find a Learned Man <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Anderſ.</hi> Def. pa. 84.</note> obſerving) that our Lord did <hi>not</hi> ſtate the oppoſition 'twixt Them, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts, becauſe the Diſciples did not as yet think of any other Church-Government than what at preſent obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and CHRIST did not find them ripe for receiving any Intimation thereof; but tho't it enough to give
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002594_0071_0FDB7E7888B00F60"/>
them a <hi>general Rule</hi> to be obſerved by them afterwards, which (when it was to be put in practice) they wou'd eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the meaning of, after <hi>their Understandings were opened,</hi> and <hi>all Things brought to their Remembrance</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt. This Thought is ſuggeſted to us by Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> (that celebrated Champion of the Church of <hi>England) The Apoſtles themſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do not ſeem to have known any thing concerning the Government of the Church, till their Separation from the</hi> Synagogues: <hi>They were by Birth</hi> JEWS, <hi>and zealous of the Law &amp; Cuſtoms of their Fathers, and if our Lord (before that) had ravealed any thing to them which looked that way, that is, a</hi> Change <hi>of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had been in hazard of revolting from him, inſtead of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. And therefore our Lord dealt cautiouſly with them, and wou'd not put new wine into old Bottles, nor while their Minds were yet alienated, bear in new Revelations upon them concerning Facts, from which They wou'd have had an Averſion.</hi>—</p>
            <p>THUS I have (I hope) remov'd all that our <hi>Author</hi> has offer'd to invalidate our Objection againſt <hi>Prelacy</hi> from our Savior's Rule in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25, 26.— And have vindicated the <hi>Parallel Places</hi> therewith.</p>
            <p>YET I wou'd take particular Notice of the laſt Text our <hi>Author</hi> mentions, that is, 1 Pet. 5.2, 3. <hi>Feed the Flock of God, which is among you, taking the overſight thereof</hi> (or acting as Biſhops over it,) <hi>not by conſtraint, but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready mind: neither as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being Enſamples to the Flock.</hi> He brings in this, as a <hi>parallel place,</hi> but I do not remember at preſent, that I have known it to be improv'd by any of our Perſuation, to the ſame purpoſe with the other Texts: So that it ſeems <hi>not fair &amp; ingenuous Dealing in him</hi> to mention it as ſo alledged. However ſince it falls in my way, I will obſerve upon it, with our <hi>Author,</hi> That <hi>Lording over GOD's Heritage</hi> is here expreſly diſcharg'd or forbidden. From this Text it is plain that Goſpel-Biſhops are not to be <hi>Lording</hi> Biſhops; are not to exerciſe <hi>Princelike</hi> or <hi>Masterly</hi> Dominion over their Flocks. CHRIST will have no ſuch Government, either of Miniſters over Miniſters, or of Miniſters over their Flocks: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle diſclaim'd it, 2 Cor. 1.24. <hi>Not for that we have Dominion over your Faith, but are Helpers of your Joy.</hi> So, 1 Cor. 3 5. <hi>Who is</hi> Paul? <hi>And Who</hi> is Apollos? <hi>But</hi> Miniſters, <hi>by whom ye believed!</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5. <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the</hi> LORD, <hi>and our ſelves your</hi> SERVANTS <hi>for Jeſus ſake.</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:002594_0072_0FDB15BEAAAE6FF8"/>
               <q>Hence (as Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> obſerves <note n="*" place="bottom">Notes on <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25.</note>) are they ſo often ſtiled <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and their Work a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to the Saints: And therefore, ſaith he, All the Office any man can have in the Kingdom of CHRIST, can only be a larger <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to others. The Office of Miniſters is to reveal the <hi>Will of</hi> CHRIST. He will allow them no ſuch Power over others, as to rule them by their <hi>own Will,</hi>
               </q> in an arbitrary way; to ſet up themſelves for <hi>Lawgivers</hi> or <hi>Dictators,</hi> expecting that the People ſhould entertain all their Doctrines with an implicit Faith, and yield a blind Obedience to all their Decrees &amp; Canons.— This is indeed <hi>Lording</hi> over GOD's Heritage. And wou'd to GOD there had been leſs of this <hi>Domineering</hi> Spirit in the Chriſtian World! I am ſure there ought not to be (to uſe Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s <note n="‖" place="bottom">Notes on <hi>Eph</hi> 4.4.</note> phraſe) any ſuch <hi>Magiſterial Guides</hi> in the Church.</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Author</hi> conſents to the Diſcharging of this <hi>Domineering</hi> in Miniſters over their Flocks; yet he well obſerves, The <hi>Paſtor's Power &amp; Authority over them, is expreſly aſſerted</hi> (Heb. 13.7, 17.) <hi>where they are called Rulers, and the People comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to obey them.</hi> Yea, He might have obſerved, That the ſame is aſſerted in <hi>our Text,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2. where the Presbyters are exhorted to <hi>feed the Flock of God, taking the overſight thereof,</hi> &amp;c. Here's a plain Text for the ſpiritual Juriſdiction and ruling Power of <hi>Preſbyters.</hi> 'Tis couched in two Words. FEED <hi>the Flock;</hi>

1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>Neglect not the Gift— which was given Thee — with the Laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery.</hi> We judge it evident from this Place, That <hi>Preſbyters have a Right &amp; Power to ordain Preſbyters.</hi> And I think, nothing he has ſaid do's at all diſprove it. As for <hi>Jerom</hi>'s acknowlegement, that Ordination belongs, if not <hi>ſolely,</hi> yet <hi>chiefly,</hi> to <hi>Biſhops;</hi> this don't at all move me: becauſe it is well known, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Jerom</hi> thought peculiar to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> he thought to be ſo, <hi>rather by the Cuſtom of the Church, than by Divine Appointment</hi>

            </p>
            <p>BUT our <hi>Author</hi> objects, that <hi>if we</hi> ſhould <hi>grant that the Preſbytery is to be understood here, of the</hi> Meeting <hi>of Preſbyters, yet it will not prove, that they had full power &amp; authority to ordain; for here</hi> (ſays he) <hi>at the moſt they did but concur &amp; aſſiſt in the ordination of</hi> Timothy, <hi>as is evident from</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6. <hi>Where the Apoſtle calling on him to ſtir up that Gift,</hi> ſays of it, <hi>which is in Thee, by the Putting on of</hi> MY <hi>Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO which I anſwer; If we take this to refer to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> (which is queſtioned by many) altho' it appears from hence, that the Apoſtle <hi>laid on hands,</hi> as well as the Aſſembly or Council of <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> in the Ordination of <hi>Timothy:</hi> yet that gives us no more grounds to ſuſpect, That <hi>the Preſbyters had not full power &amp; authority to ordain by themſelves,</hi> than it does to ſuſpect whether the <hi>Apoſtle had power to ordain by himſelf.</hi> For the Apoſtle plainly attributes as much to <hi>the laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery,</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> Epiſtle, as he does to <hi>the putting on of his own hands,</hi> in the <hi>other;</hi> which it would
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:002594_0074_0FDB7E7F4D568530"/>
be very unreaſonable for him to do, if the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> had not had the <hi>ſame power</hi> with <hi>himſelf</hi> in <hi>that</hi> Caſe. And if inſtead of the hands of the <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> Epiſtle, it had been ſaid, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by the <hi>laying on of the hands of the</hi> BISHOP, (notwithſtanding the mention of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s hands alſo in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Epiſtle,) I queſtion not, but our <hi>Author</hi> wou'd have triumphed in it, and tho't the Text <hi>deciſive.</hi> Whereas now he tells us, <hi>it is certain that Apoſtles did ordain without the Concurrence of Preſbyters; but he reads not that ever Preſbyters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained without an Apoſtle or Biſhop:</hi> And <hi>without a warrant or precedent to be found for it in Scripture, he knows not how any can be fully perſuaded in his own mind.</hi> I can't tell whether it will help our <hi>Author</hi> under his doubts, or perplex him ſtill more, to mention what ſome have obſerved, <hi>that the Scriptures are wholly ſilent about ordination by a Biſhop; that indeed they ſometimes ſpeak of ordination by the Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles ſometimes call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Elders or Preſbyters; but they read not that the Apoſtles are ever called Biſhops in the New Testament; or that the laying on of hands, either without an Apoſtle, or with one, is any where aſcribed to any perſon that is called a Biſhop in the word of GOD.</hi> This Obſervation may perhaps draw ſome weak perſons into doubts about the validity of <hi>Epiſcopal Ordination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the truth of the Caſe is, (as hath been, I hope, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved, in the preceding pages) that <hi>Biſhops</hi> &amp; <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are one and the ſame <hi>Order</hi> by <hi>Divine Inſtitution;</hi> and that they ſucceed the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in all their <hi>ordinary</hi> Powers, of which that of <hi>Ordination</hi> is one; which is warrant enough for <hi>Ordination</hi> by Presbyters, and the very ſame warrant which <hi>thoſe</hi> have for it, who are now, by <hi>Custom,</hi> and <hi>humane Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> dignified and diſtinguiſhed with the Title of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But if our <hi>Author</hi> muſt have a <hi>precedent</hi> as well as a <hi>warrant</hi> for Ordination by Presbyters, and ſuch a <hi>Praecedent</hi> too as no <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was concerned in; I might with as good reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon his giving an <hi>Inſtance</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Ordination,</hi> by any perſon, or perſons that are any where called <hi>Biſhops.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if he will pleaſe to read <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>begin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he himſelf underſtands by <hi>Prophets &amp; Teachers,</hi> (pag. 36, 38.) and what he takes to be the deſign of <hi>prayer &amp; Impoſition of hands</hi> (pa. 12.) I hope he will find a <hi>Praecedent</hi> to his heart's deſire, in which no <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> (nor <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop)</hi> was otherwiſe than <hi>paſſively</hi> concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:002594_0075_0FDB7E81A121C020"/>I thought now to have drawn to a Cloſe; but I muſt beg leave to take Notice here of a Paſſage or two in our <hi>Author</hi>'s CONCLUSION; wherein he ſeems to intend ſomething <hi>New</hi> of Argument.</p>
            <p>Pag. 61. HE obſerves, <hi>We cannot find in all the New Teſtament the leaſt Inſinuation, that after a ſhort Time</hi> the Apoſtolical Power over ordinary Paſtors <hi>was to ceaſe:</hi> which is the ſame Argument that Dr. <hi>Scot</hi> brings &amp; builds much upon; who ſpeaking of the Apoſtolick Office ſays, <q>Men muſt prove it's repealed by the ſame Authority that eſtabliſht it, before they preſume to renounce it; for (ſays he) The Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Commands is diſſolvable only by Divine Countermands: ſo that tho' GOD had not declared he inſtituted it for Perpetuity; yet till he declare the contrary, the Inſtitution muſt bind &amp; preſcribe to all Ages &amp; Nations.</q>
But methinks, this admits of an eaſy Anſwer. For what need is there of an expreſs Repeal or formal Inhibition, where the Reaſon of the Thing ceaſeth, as is apparently the Caſe before us! I think it has been ſufficiently prov'd, That the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Power ſpoken of, was founded in <hi>peculiar</hi> &amp; <hi>extraordinary</hi> Ends and Deſigns, reſpecting the Infancy of the Goſpel-Diſpenſation; That there's nothing in the <hi>Nature</hi> &amp; Reaſon of things requiring the Continuance of it, nor the leaſt Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation given in <hi>Scripture,</hi> to move us to think it any other than Temporary. But after all I have ſaid, I don't know whether our <hi>Author</hi> and his Brethren will be convinced. If not, I wiſh they would go to School to an eminent Divine of their own Church, and a great Ornament of it, tho' he was not in Communion with them in theſe Notions; I mean the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> who freely declares his Judgment, <q>That the Apoſtleſhip, as ſuch <hi>(ſtrictly ſpeaking)</hi> was perſonal and temporary, and in all reſpects extraordinary; conferred in a ſpecial manner, deſign'd for ſpecial purpoſes, diſcharged by ſpecial aids, endowed with ſpecial privileges, as was needful for the propagation of Chriſtianity &amp; founding of Churches: That the Apoſtles did not pretend to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it: That they did indeed appoint ſtanding Paſtors and Teachers in each Church, but not conſtitute Apoſtles: and that (as ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) Biſhops have no true Apoſtolical Authority: That this in its Nature &amp; Deſign was not communicable to others, &amp;c.</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> pag. 73, &amp;c. whoſe works are publiſh'd by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Tillotſon;</hi> and ſo perhaps we
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002594_0076_0FDB7E83112A5D08"/>
have the Sentiments of this eminent Doctor alſo here expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Now further,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 62. OUR <hi>Author</hi> argues againſt the Presbyterian Principle, from <hi>its dangerous Conſequence to Religion,</hi> as if it <hi>open'd a Gap to all Errors,</hi> and led to the Subverſion of the whole Goſpel-Miniſtry.— This, I ſuppoſe, he might think wou'd give us an alarm, and make us look to our ſelves, and beware how we attempt to ſhake Epiſcopacy, leſt <hi>Preſbytery</hi> ſhou'd unhappily fall with it. But I ſee no Cauſe for ſuch a Fear. Beſure I can ſee no ground to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any <hi>more</hi> danger in <hi>our</hi> affirming the Apoſtles Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over Paſtors to be <hi>wholly</hi> &amp; abſolutely extraordinary, than in our <hi>Author</hi>'s affirming their <hi>unlimited Commiſſion</hi> was ſo. Neither am I able to diſcern how it may any more, or on any better grounds, be <hi>improv'd againſt the Office of a Preſbyter:</hi> Nor indeed how it can <hi>at all</hi> be ſo improv'd, with any ſhew of Reaſon. For the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of a Goſpel-Miniſtry may be evinced by many Arguments of a <hi>moral</hi> Nature: The Ends &amp; Grounds of it being manifeſtly ſuch as agree to all Ages of the Church to the End of the World. And then there is the cleareſt <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Proof</hi> imaginable that it was <hi>deſign'd</hi> to be perpetual. <hi>We have the ſame Evidence for the perpetual Duration of</hi> the Paſtoral Office, <hi>as we have for its first Inſtitution:</hi> whereas no ſolid Arguments have as yet been brought to ſupport the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Claim, either from Reaſon or Scripture. So that the Presbyterians Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of this, cannot in the leaſt tend to ſerve the Deſign of thoſe that are for intirely caſting off a ſtanding Miniſtry: and if ſuch have nothing better to ſay in Defenſe of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than what our <hi>Author</hi> hath ſuggeſted in their behalf, we ſee no occaſion for much Fear from this Quarter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND now having finiſh'd what I deſign'd,</hi> that is, having ſhown the Weakneſs of our <hi>Author</hi>'s ſuppoſed <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> and the Inconſiſtency of <hi>his</hi> Account with the <hi>Scripture-account of theſe matters; I ſhall only add, by way of Concluſion,</hi> ſome of his own <hi>Expoſtulations</hi> (with a little alteration, turned upon himſelf and thoſe of his perſuaſion) <hi>in the Spirit of meekneſs &amp; Love; and calmly inquire</hi> (with him) <hi>what is the ground of all that Noiſe &amp; Clamour, Hatred &amp; Prejudice, raiſed againſt them who are of the principles, as to the Point of Church-Government, which</hi> I have been defending?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'TIS evident we own</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>to be</hi> ſole <hi>Lord &amp; Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to his Church; that he hath Power to eſtabliſh Order &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, and to inſtitute what Offices he pleaſeth in his ſpiritual
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002594_0077_0FDB7E8499BAC2F0"/>
Kingdom.</hi> Theſe are the Things we earneſtly contend for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WE are fully perſuaded, that He, who is of infinite Wiſdom &amp; Goodneſs, hath diſpoſed all Affairs relating to the Government of his Church, in the moſt excellent Method, to promote the Edification &amp; Salvation of his People.</hi> And therefore we cannot conſent, that the Fooliſhneſs of Men ſhould intermeddle and alter the Conſtitutions of Divine Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WE plainly find</hi> but one Order of <hi>Officers,</hi> the Eleven <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> left in the Church by CHRIST himſelf at his Aſcenſion into Heaven: and one Order more, <hi>the ſeven Deacons,</hi> inſtituted afterwards by the Apoſtles under the Conduct of the Spirit of GOD. <hi>Theſe</hi> two <hi>Orders are unquestionably of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but more we cannot find to be ſo. We deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to each of theſe, all the <hi>ordinary Powers</hi> they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with by Divine Appointment; and not to thruſt either of them into Employments, which the wiſdom of GOD never allotted to them. We are far from ſaying that either of theſe Offices was <hi>temporary.</hi> We only affirm, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them had ſome Powers at the beginning, which were <hi>extraordinary</hi> &amp; <hi>temporary,</hi> and expired with the Perſons they were committed to: but that as to their ordinary Powers, they have been, and ſhall be ſucceeded, to the <hi>end of the World,</hi> by <hi>Preſbyters</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whom we every where find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be one and the ſame Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND now let any impartially judge, who do moſt truly aſſert Chriſt's Kingly Office, and the Prerogatives of his Crown: WE, who plead for his Inſtitution, and cloſely adhere thereunto, and to the Offices which he hath appointed in his Church;</hi> without increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Number, or adding to, or taking any thing away from, the <hi>ordinary Powers,</hi> he committed to either of them. <hi>Or</hi> THEY, <hi>who make bold with his Inſtitution,</hi> to alter it as they pleaſe: who have ſet up more Offices in the Church, than were appointed by CHRIST and his Apoſtles; who call upon thoſe to preach &amp; baptiſe, whoſe only Buſineſs, by Divine Appointment, is to ſerve Tables: and who have <hi>caſhier'd</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Auth.</hi> pag. 40.</note> in a great meaſure <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s <hi>prime Officers &amp; Repreſentatives, and the Churches principal Guides, and have depriv'd the Church</hi> very much of the Benefit of theſe <hi>Pledges of her Lord's Care and Kindneſs,</hi> the Paſtors &amp; Teachers, <hi>which he gave her, when he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up to Heaven:</hi> who have intirely wreſted the Power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and wou'd take that of Ordination alſo, out of the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:002594_0078_0FDB7E8613A8BAE8"/>
Hands of perhaps Ninety nine in an Hundred of Thoſe to whom CHRIST himſelf by his Commiſſion gave them; <hi>and this only upon a falſe &amp; groundleſs Suppoſition,</hi> that the Apoſtles Authority over Paſtors was one of their ordinary Powers, and inherited by Biſhops, as an Order of Men by Divine Right ſuperior to Presbyters, and ſucceeding to the Apoſtles. <hi>The Falſeneſs of which I have already ſhewed; and ſhall now repreſent briefly of what dangerous Conſequence it is to Religion.</hi> — To deny <hi>Preſbyters</hi> the power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> is in effect to deny the <hi>validity</hi> of all the Adminiſtrations of Thoſe, who are not under the Epiſcopal Form of Government; or who, if under it now, yet derive the Succeſſion of their <hi>Biſhops</hi> from ſuch as were ordain'd by <hi>Preſbyters:</hi> which is to number far the biggeſt part of the Proteſtant Churches, and in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the Church of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, among <hi>Aliens</hi> from the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Strangers</hi> from the Covenants of Promiſe, who have no hope, &amp; are without CHRIST, and without GOD in the World! — To alledge <note n="‖" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Auth.</hi> pag. 39.</note> that <hi>Biſhops are the true Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, or elſe they have no Succeſſors at all;</hi> and that <hi>Preſbyters ſucceed only to the Seventy, having no Claim to the Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles at our Lord's Aſcenſion, or to the Promiſe annexed;</hi> This ſurely <hi>is to make the Rule and Standard of our Religion uncertain &amp; unfixed, and opens a Gap to all Errors</hi> and Confuſions. To put Eccleſiaſtical Government into Lay-Hands, and <hi>To ſet up new Offices paramount to thoſe that CHRIST has appointed, and to alter any of his holy Inſtitutions, What intolerable Preſumption is it?—At this Rate &amp; upon the like Pretences,</hi> Papiſts ſet up ſeveral more Officers, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Cardinals, and paramount to all, the POPE, claiming Apoſtolical Power &amp; Infallibility, pretending to be CHRIST's Vicar, the great Monarch &amp; viſible Head of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick; from whom all other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Authority; <hi>Neceſſary</hi> (ſay they) for the deciding of Controverſies, for preſerving the Unity of the Church, and rendering the <hi>New-Testament</hi> Church, conformable to the Church of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which had a <hi>High Prieſt</hi> above all.</p>
            <p>NOW <hi>if any thus principled cou'd but gain ſuch an Aſcendent over the Populace, as to inſpire them with this</hi> unhappy <hi>Notion, and thereby influence them as much</hi> in favour of the Romiſh Papacy, <hi>as they have been</hi> for the Engliſh Prelacy; <hi>what ſhou'd then become of Order in the Church?</hi> GOD
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002594_0079_0FDB7E8912A2FB18"/>
               <hi>forbid! That any ſuch wild Caprice ſhould ever ſieze on a</hi> Proteſtant People! <hi>But I make the Suppoſition to repreſent thereby the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence of that Principle,</hi> That there are by Divine Appointment <hi>Biſhops</hi> of a diſtinct &amp; ſuperior Order to <hi>Paſtors</hi> and Teachers; always <hi>neceſſary</hi> for the Good of the Church, and without which the Apoſtles have no Succeſſors <hi>at all,</hi> nor is any Church rightly conſtituted. <hi>For it may be improv'd</hi> very <hi>much</hi> in favour of Popery; and I think can be defended by no Arguments, but what unhappily make againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Reformation—. <hi>And there may come an unhappy Juncture when</hi> the Papacy <hi>may come to be thought as</hi> needful as Prelacy. <hi>For alas! If the Truth may be told, 'tis greatly to be fear'd, that</hi> the power of Paſtors, and the ſtrict Diſcipline commonly uſed in Presbyterial Churches, <hi>is become intolerable to too many carnal Libertines,</hi> whoſe Language is that, <hi>Come, let us break their Bonds aſunder, and caſt away their Cords from us:</hi> and that not a few, who with an uncharitable &amp; bitter Zeal contend for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Pre eminence, have too much of the Roman Leaven in them; are too ſincere Friends to the Papal Supremacy, <hi>and only want a favorable Opportunity to vent their Minds,</hi> and throw off the Mask: Or at leaſt they may be ſuppos'd in no little danger of contracting a Reverence &amp; Affection to it; ſince this furious Zeal for a difference of Order among Goſpel-<hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſeems to tend by a natural Efficacy to beget favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thoughts of a Diſtinction <hi>&amp;</hi> Subordination among <hi>Biſhops</hi> likewiſe, and to prepare the Mind to embrace the Notion of a <hi>ſupreme</hi> Biſhop; and ſo to pave the way for their Return to a humble Submiſſion to the Pontificate of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOW will they be able to anſwer to GOD and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences for it? Who have combined together</hi> to propagate <hi>Doctrines</hi> ſo <hi>unſcriptural</hi> in themſelves; ſo uncharitable &amp; unmerciful in their Conſequences, and in their tendency, ſo fatal to <hi>that Order ſettled by</hi> CHRIST <hi>in his Church; and who have left no Stone unturned in their reſtleſs Endeavours, to bring the ſacred</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Presbyterian <hi>Biſhops &amp; Paſtors into perpetual Contempt, and have induſtriouſly ſet themſelves to oppoſe &amp; fruſtrate all their Goſpel Adminiſtrations; and not only to alienate the minds of poor ſimple People from</hi> thoſe <hi>their</hi> Rightful <hi>Governors and Pastors; but with Noiſe &amp; Clamour, and bitter Invectives</hi> have too often endeavoured <hi>to inſpire them with the higheſt Rage &amp; Fury to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the most horrid Outrages on their ſacred Perſons, as good Service
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:002594_0080_0FDB7E8A950E4A10"/>
done to GOD; and all upon no other account, but their firm adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Inſtitutions of</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>I will now only add my ſincere wiſhes, in the very <hi>Terms</hi> of our <hi>Author</hi>'s own concluding Collect:— <hi>Father, forgive them; they know not what they do: Lord, lay not this Sin to their Charge; But mercifully open their Eyes: that they may ſee the Evil of their Ways, and may be converted to the Way of Truth and Godlineſs, Peace &amp; Charity, Unity &amp; Order; and be eternally, ſaved, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

            <p>THUS, Sir, I have in ſome meaſure perform'd what I undertook at your Requeſt; have made my Remarks upon the moſt material Paſſages in the Book you ſent me; and I ſuppoſe nothing that might be likely to lead unwary Readers into any conſiderable Miſtakes, hath eſcap'd a ſufficient Notice. The Diſcourſe hath ſwell'd a great deal beyond my Expectations: and yet I have wav'd much of what might have been ſaid under ſeveral Heads: and have paſt over divers Things in our <hi>Author,</hi> not unexceptionable, as being of leſſer Conſequence. Tho' I muſt confeſs, I have been now and then almoſt inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly drawn to debate ſome more <hi>minute Particulars,</hi> than I tho't at firſt to trouble you with any Reflections upon; and have ſet too great a Task to your Patience; but I truſt your <hi>Candour</hi> will overlook &amp; excuſe <hi>this,</hi> and all <hi>other Imperfections</hi> of my <hi>Performance.</hi> I have almoſt wholly confin'd my ſelf to the <hi>Defenſive part,</hi> or at leaſt not meddl'd with any thing (that I remember) but what our <hi>Author</hi> has unavoidably led me into; becauſe I was not willing to give any <hi>unneceſſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi> For which Reaſon alſo, I have hardly at all allow'd my ſelf to addreſs the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> or to write in the <hi>declamatory Strain</hi> at leaſt not ſo much as <hi>ſome</hi> might perhaps reaſonably have expected on this occaſion; eſpecially ſince our <hi>Author</hi> had ſet me an <hi>Example,</hi> by mixing ſo much of <hi>Harangue</hi> with his <hi>Arguings:</hi> for I am ſenſible it is no eaſy matter to write in this Method, without ſaying ſuch Things as ſome wou'd think, however true &amp; juſt, yet <hi>grievous to be born,</hi> and touching too near. I have ſtudy'd to preſerve a due <hi>Moderation,</hi> and <hi>Temper;</hi> which the Laws of Civility &amp; Chriſtianity oblige to: and endeavored that nothing might fall from me, that could give offence to any, but ſuch as will be offended at whatever thwarts their own Opinion; of which <hi>Sort of Perſons</hi> there are
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002594_0081_0FDB7E8BF557A3C0"/>
(it may be) too many in all Parties. It had been eaſy to have been <hi>tart</hi> &amp; <hi>ſevere</hi> in ſeveral places, where it may be there was ſufficient <hi>provocation</hi> given: but I am none of thoſe that love to be always dealing in <hi>Satyr.</hi> And if any Expreſſions have happen'd to ſlip from me, that may ſeem a little too <hi>warm</hi> or <hi>harſh,</hi> I ſhall be ſorry for it.</p>
            <p>WHAT Occaſion there may be for making any thing of this Nature publick, you are in better Circumſtances to judge than I. For, as I have written at <hi>your Deſire;</hi> ſo my Reaſons for it are owing very much to your Information.
