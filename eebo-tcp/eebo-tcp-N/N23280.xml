            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>A BELIEF in the exiſtence of God, and in his intercourſe with rational creatures, has pervaded all ages and nations. Every temple that has been built, every victim that has been ſlain, all the rites of paganiſm, and all the inſtitutions of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, bear teſtimony in favour of this aſſertion. The various and oppoſite methods in which men have attempted to approach God, to render him their worſhip and to receive his favours, evince that they were ignorant of their true ſtate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the divine attributes, and of the great Mediator, through whom all bleſſings deſcend. Inſpiration aſſures us, that <q>there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</q> 1 Tim. ii. 5. Through him every true Chriſtian, worſhipping in ſpirit and in truth, looks up to God as his parent, and receives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030780_0005_0FE9253FF98A31B0"/>
favours. Intercourſe in this way with God, is a peculiar privilege of every real believer, and a diſtinguiſhing trait in his character. It marks his progreſs through life. It bears him above im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate attachment to earthly, periſhable objects, ſublimes his ſoul, invigorates his affections, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges his capacity of enjoyment, and qualifies him for the ſervice of heaven. While he ſits under the ſhadow of the Almighty, his raviſhed ſoul, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with extaſy, burſts from her confines of clay, joining with <q>angels, and the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect.</q> His religion is not founded on conjecture; it is no Idle formality, no uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting ſpeculation; but it is a truth, a ſubſtance, a heart-felt reality, a heaven on earth. All the operations of the divine ſpirit, in regeneration, repentance, faith, ſanctification and communion with God, are indications of his favour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible evidences of the reality of vital piety. Though reaſon abundantly confirms the divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Chriſtian religion, and points it out as the only road to glory; yet reaſon is by no means the chief ſource from which believers in general derive their aſſurance and conſolation. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe they realize. They believe, becauſe they feel. They reſt aſſured, becauſe they have the evidence of their internal ſenſes. <q>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in himſelf.</q> 1 John, v. 10. He who has been brought by the power of God to a cordial reception of the goſpel, can no more doubt the reality of religion, than he can the exiſtence of the material world. In both caſes he relies on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of his ſenſible experience. How abſurd then and vain is it, for thoſe who poſſeſs no real
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030780_0006_0FE9251B14D2A0A0"/>
knowledge of religion, to repreſent it as a phantom, a cheat, or deluſion! With the ſame propriety might a deaf man deny the exiſtence of ſound, or a blind man the exiſtence of light and colours. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, in all ages and countries, have the happineſs to "know in whom they have believed." God is limited neither by time nor place. He often comes ſenſibly near to his people by day and by night, on the ocean or on the land, in the populous city or in the lonely deſert. Behold Jacob, taking leave of his aged father, flying from the rage of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed brother, having no one to accompany him through a ſtrange country. The ſun falls beneath the horizon. Darkneſs ſpreads over the earth, and muffles up the ſky. Jacob in the open air lays his head upon a ſtone. He ſleeps. In this expoſed and ſolitary ſtate, his heavenly Father meets him, and fills him with conſolation. God ſays to him, <q>behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goeſt.</q> And Jacob awaked out of his ſleep, and ſaid, <q>ſurely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.—How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this place! This is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</q>—You will pleaſe to obſerve that Jacob utters theſe words while his heart is filled with a lively ſenſe of God's preſence. It is on this account that he calls the place in which he was the houſe of God, and the gate of heaven. It is on the ſame account that the ſcriptures repreſent the church as the houſe of God. I propoſe, therefore, on the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to accommodate the words of the text to the meaning of thoſe phraſes in the ſcriptures, which ſpeak of the church as an habitation for God. In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the ſubject preſented in the text, I ſhall in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030780_0007_0FE925418E62C128"/>
I. Firſt place, ſhew what conſtitutes a church that may be ſtyled the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>II. In the ſecond place, conſider the church as a ſtate preparatory for heaven.</p>
            <p>A few obſervations ſhall then conclude the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I. I ſhall in the firſt place ſhew what conſtitutes a church that may be ſtyled the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>Under this head, I do not propoſe to point out all the particular things neceſſary to the organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſtruction, and government of a church; but the nature of it, conſidered as an habitation for God. A church conſiſts of a number of real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt, united together under his laws, for the worſhip and ſervice of God. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are ſome of the leading traits in their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have experienced regeneration. This is expreſſed in the ſcriptures by various phraſes, tending to point out its greatneſs and importance. Chriſt repreſented it under the notion of a birth, when he ſaid to Nicodemus, <q>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</q> Paul repreſented it as <q>the putting off and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of the old man, as the deſtruction of the body of ſin, as a reſtoration from death, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the ſpirit of the mind, as a new cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</q> The neceſſity of this change originates in the depravity and ſinfulneſs of the human heart. Theſe are abundantly teſtified of in the ſcriptures, and confirmed by the conduct of men in all ages and nations. The teſtimony of eternal truth is, that men have all gone out of the way; that there is none that doeth good; that there is no fear of God before their eyes; that they deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his ways; that they have come ſhort of his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030780_0008_0FE925232B875750"/>
glory; that the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; that every thought of the imagination of man's heart is evil, and that continually. Theſe expreſſions convey an idea of the greateſt alienation of heart from God and holineſs. Though all men are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet all are not equally criminal, obſtinate and incorrigible. All, however, are by nature in ſuch a ſtate as to need a renovation of heart to ſit them for the houſe of God, and the enjoyment of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. He whoſe ſoul is the haunt of wickedneſs, whoſe paſſions are the vile minions of riot and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, whoſe life is a catalogue of ſins; he can be rouzed from his lethargy by nothing but the loudeſt thunders of Sinai, and be changed to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by nothing but the reſiſtleſs arm of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. The eſſence of this change conſiſts neither in the illumination of the underſtanding, nor in the reception of any new faculties; but in the infuſion of a holy diſpoſition, prompting to holy exerciſes of heart and conduct in life. The great work of regeneration is by the ſcriptures uniformly aſcribed to the Holy Spirit, as the immediate agent. Thus ſaid Chriſt, <q>except a man be born of the Spirit, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God. That which is born of the Spirit, is ſpirit.</q> John iii. 5, 6. John, ſpeaking of thoſe who received Chriſt, ſays they were <q>born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</q> John i. 13. Paul to the Corinthians ſays, <q>we all beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</q> 2 Cor. iii. 18. Paul to Titus ſays of God, <q>he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> Tit. iii. 5. The Spirit of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030780_0009_0FE9255033ACF548"/>
God ſheds abroad his love in the heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys to it the ſame kind of diſpoſition which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in himſelf. Hence he who is regenerated, is united to God in love. <q>For God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</q> 1 John, iv. 16. Hence it is, that all who are regenerated, <q>are built up a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual houſe.</q> None but ſuch can properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it and conſtitute an habitation for the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. Thus regeneration appears to be an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential trait in the character of true members, who form a church that may be ſtyled the houſe of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next trait in their character is, that they have true repentance for ſin. This is indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary to pardon and ſalvation. This was the uniform language of John the Baptiſt, of Jeſus Chriſt, and his apoſtles. John <q>preached the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins.</q> Jeſus taught <q>that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> The apoſtles preached the ſame doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, when they ſaid, <q>repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins.</q> Evangelical repentance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in occaſional pangs of remorſe, horrors of conſcience, or reſolutions to amend. If it does, then a Judas, a Felix, and a Herod, muſt be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with the pious, and be enrolled on the liſt of ſalvation. There are ſcarcely any, who, at ſome period of their lives, have not been alarmed with fearful apprehenſions for the conſequences of ſin, have reformed their conduct, and implored forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. Theſe things they may have done, and yet be entire ſtrangers to true repentance. This penetrates the inmoſt retirements of the heart. It
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030780_0010_0FE9255359E5EDB8"/>
conſiſts in a holy diſguſt of ſin, conſidered as a moſt heinous crime againſt God, and prompts the true penitent not merely to view ſinful actions with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, but to trace them up to their origin, and diſcloſe all the ſecret receſſes of wickedneſs. Even when his conduct is fair and unblameable in the eyes of the world, he laments over the depravity of his heart. He poſſeſſes a deep and affecting ſenſe of the intrinſic evil of ſin; and oppoſes it, not merely becauſe it expoſes to puniſhment, not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it would injure his character, and ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his eſtate, but chiefly becauſe he views it to be vile in its own nature, ruinous to his peace in its tendency, diſhonourable to God, rebellion againſt his authority, oppoſition to his holineſs and goodneſs. That repentance cannot be conſidered as genuine, which does not produce a uniform diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt of all ſin, in every kind and degree; while it prompts to an invincible perſeverance in every known duty, and an humble dependence on the mercy of God, through Jeſus Chriſt. Repentance, as it implies an entire change of motives, feelings and actions, reſpecting ſin, is an indiſpenſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite to the enjoyment of God and heaven. Salvation without it, appears highly irrational and abſurd. For God to receive one without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, would be to receive one as a friend whom he knew to be an enemy. Hence it appears neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that all who belong to God's houſe, ſhould have true repentance for ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another trait in their character is, that they poſſeſs true evangelical faith. By this we are to underſtand a firm perſuaſion of all revealed truth; a perſuaſion effected in the underſtanding by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teſtimony, and wrought into the heart by the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030780_0011_0FE92570630076E8"/>
influences of the Divine Spirit. Hence it appears, that genuine faith is no dormant unintereſting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, leaving the poſſeſſor in a ſtate of languor and indifference; but active, producing good works, aſſuring of juſtification and eternal life. Paul ſays, <q>faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</q> According to this definition, it appears to be a kind of divine internal ſenſe, diffuſing itſelf into futurity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with diſtant inviſible objects, bringing them home into preſent enjoyment, ſubſtantiating them to the mind, and laying a firm and immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation for hope. Evangelical faith has more immediate reference to Chriſt in his various offices; to all parts of his work as Mediator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Saviour; to his righteouſneſs as the only ground of acceptance with God; to divine mercy through Chriſt; for the pardon of ſin; for the ſanctification of the heart; for growth in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly life; for complete deliverance from evil, and in ſtatement in eternal beatitude. Hence the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures repreſent faith as "working by love." No wonder that it does; for it brings into view God's moſt holy character in the great ſcheme of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt, and deſcries all the glorious realities of the heavenly ſtate. When the heart is reconciled by divine grace, the ſoul not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends God's character, but approves it, loves and admires it, as infinitely excellent, and longs to be changed into the ſame image. Faith works by love towards men. It diſplays itſelf in kind benevolent affection, eſpecially to <q>the houſehold of faith.</q> It embraces, "with arms of love," all good men of every denomination, and views them as children of God, and heirs of glory. The
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030780_0012_0FE9257379CD4590"/>
ſcriptures repreſent faith as "purifying the heart." This effect appears neceſſarily to reſult from its nature. We are ſo conſtituted, as readily to aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate ourſelves to thoſe objects about which we are converſant. As faith brings into our view and enjoyment things heavenly and holy, it changes us "into their image, from glory to glory." Victory over the world is another effect aſcribed to faith. <q>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</q> As faith brings into view things of eternal weight and importance, the world, with all its pomp and pageantry, recedes and dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to a point. The ſoul riſes above it, and ſoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the divine nature, is loſt in its immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and glory. Thus it appears that faith is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted grace, and fits its ſubjects for the houſe of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another trait in their character is, devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart to God. This implies a cordial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his character, laws and government. As all true religion is ſeated in the heart, the ſource of action and virtue, devotedneſs of heart implies a conſtant obedience of all the affections to the divine will, and an external practical obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all the duties, religious and moral. He who has been born from above, whoſe heart has been filled with ſincere godly ſorrow for ſin, who depends for ſalvation entirely on the mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt, conſiders himſelf not as his own, but as "bought with a price;" and endeavours to glorify God in body and ſpirit. He does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider religion as a taſk, but as a pleaſure. He finds that the Saviour's <q>yoke is eaſy, and his burthen light.</q> He rejoices to poſſeſs religion
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030780_0013_0FE92578D08C4078"/>
in his heart, purifying his affections, and ſitting him for the houſe of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another trait in the character of thoſe who compoſe the true church, ſtyled the houſe of God, is, that God's glory is the higheſt object in their view and regard. His nature is the ſum of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and perfection. It contains every thing that can attract the affections, excite the admiration, and call forth the praiſes of all holy beings. <q>God is love.</q> With this all his actions, and all his treatment of rational creatures, will perfectly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond. For God can do nothing contrary to himſelf. All his arrangements and operations, in the great works of creation, in the great kingdoms of providence and grace, are calculated to effect a perfect diſplay of his true character, and to ſecure the higheſt happineſs of the rational univerſe. A diſplay of God's true character is his glory. Thoſe then who are real friends to God, muſt feel a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to coincide with all his deſigns and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another trait in their character is, that they ſtrive for higher attainments in the divine life. The principle of this is implanted in the heart in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Under the influences of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is increaſed and brought forth in all its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. This life implies an inward propenſity to holineſs, and a divine activity in all the powers of the ſoul. It is, in its nature, tendency and effects, utterly oppoſed to ſin. It implies an elevation of the affections towards God, and a progreſſive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement towards heaven. <q>It is a well of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</q> It is communicated from Chriſt to all his ſincere diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. They look to him as the exhauſtleſs foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030780_0014_0FE9257D72E69420"/>
and eagerly anticipate the glorious period when they ſhall be changed into his image, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with his fulneſs.</p>
            <p>Various other things enter into the character of thoſe who are real members of the houſe of God. Thoſe I have enumerated appear the moſt eſſential. For all who have experienced them, feel united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when worſhipping their common Parent and Saviour, are ſenſible of his preſence, and can exclaim, <q>this is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>II. I now proceed, in the ſecond place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the church as a preparatory ſtate for heaven.</p>
            <p>The deſign of religion is to meliorate the hearts, reform the manners, and ſave the ſouls of men. For theſe important ends, Jeſus deſcended from heaven, and founded the church on that rock, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not prevail. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to purify the hearts of men, in a ſtate of diſcipline and enjoyment, and thus prepare them for the ſublime delights of heaven. That we may view the ſtate of the church in the preſent world as preparatory for happineſs and glory in the next, we need but conſider them in a comparative point of light.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſider the church as a ſtate of ſociety, it will appear preparatory for heaven. In this point of view, it appears peculiarly accommodat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to man, as a rational, communicative being. Not only his neceſſities and dependencies, but his natural inſtincts, impel him into ſociety. Neither the beauties of nature, nor the inventions of art, can diſſipate the gloom, nor alleviate the irkſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of perpetual ſolitude. The pleaſures of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intercourſe hold an elevated rank in the ſcale
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030780_0015_0FE9258572A32668"/>
of man's enjoyments. They expand his affections, enlarge his capacity, refine his nature, and learn him to guide his conduct by the rules of decency and propriety. If ſuch are the effects and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſulting from the ſociety of men poſſeſſing different inclinations, purſuing different objects, and aiming at different ends—what that is truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, amiable and delightful, may we not expect from the ſociety of thoſe, who imbibe the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, poſſeſs the ſame moral temper, join in the ſame worſhip, and ſtrive for the ſame heaven? Men in a church ſtate are united by the neareſt ties; ties founded in love. <q>Being knit together in love, they hold the head from which all the body, by joints and bands, having nouriſhment miniſtered, increaſeth with the increaſe of God.</q> Col. ii. 2, 19. Heaven appears to be the continuance and perfection of that happineſs which is begun in the ſocial ſtate of the church on earth. Here we are ſurrounded with numerous imperfections, liable to many difficulties and animoſities; but in heaven, theſe will ceaſe; perfect union will take place; a more extenſive ſociety will commence; the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be enlarged beyond all bounds; all hearts will leap with extaſy; each, happy in itſelf, and in that <q>great multitude, which no man can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.</q> Thus the church ſtate, in the preſent world, conſidered as a ſociety, appears to be the gate of heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The church, conſidered as a ſtate of progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in knowledge and holineſs, is preparatory for heaven.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have experienced the great change of regeneration, are brought to a particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030780_0016_0FE92587697F0FE8"/>
of God, and in a degree aſſimilated to his nature. In theſe conſiſts the higheſt excellency of the Chriſtian religion. It imparts to men the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and moral qualities of God. Theſe at firſt are drawn in ſmall characters, but under the light of truth, they enlarge and riſe into view, till Deity ſtands confeſſed in man. <q>We all, with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</q> 2 Cor. iii. 18. That men in the preſent obſcure and ſinful ſtate need ſome particular knowledge of God, and ſome change of their moral temper into his likeneſs, before they can be prepared to enjoy him, is a truth too reaſonable and obvious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much illuſtration. The church ſtate is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of light and holineſs, by which men are trained up as in a family, under one common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and fitted for heaven. It is by the goſpel only, that men can acquire true and ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. By the works of creation they may learn his exiſtence, power, wiſdom and goodneſs; by the law of Moſes they may learn his holineſs, juſtice, and oppoſition to ſin; but it is by the goſpel only that they learn his mercy, in the forgiveneſs of tranſgreſſion, and in the ſalvation of the ſoul. In Chriſt they behold him under the endearing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Father. Under him, they are here in a church ſtate trained up as his children, growing in his knowledge, forming into his likeneſs, and looking forward to the manſions of glory. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God appears to be an indiſpenſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite to eternal life. Chriſt ſays, <q>this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</q> John xvii. 3. From the ſcriptures it appears, that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030780_0017_0FE9258F65DB96E0"/>
the knowledge and enjoyment of Chriſt will conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an eſſential part of the happineſs of the ſaints in heaven. They will ſee him as he is; they will dwell with him; he will lead them by the waters of life; he will be their everlaſting light and glory. In theſe reſpects the houſe of God appears to be the gate of heaven; for all its inhabitants know and enjoy Chriſt. They receive him as God and man, as a prophet to inſtruct them, as a friend to increaſe their conſolations, as a king to reign over them, and protect them from all their enemies. <q>They grow in grace, and in the knowledge of their Lord and Saviour.</q> They have a ſpecial knowledge of the Holy Spirit, illuminating their underſtandings, ſanctifying their hearts, aſſuring them of pardon, juſtification and eternal life. They will paſs on from one degree of improvement to another, till they ſhall be uſhered into the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of eternal beatitude. Various other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances might be mentioned, and conſiderations adduced, to preſent the church as preparatory for heaven; but the narrow limits preſcribed by the preſent occaſion, urge me to finiſh this ſubject with ſome obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the firſt part of this diſcourſe, we learn what are the moſt eſſential traits in the character of thoſe who are fit to become members of the houſe or church of God; and conſequently, that if we admit thoſe of diſſimilar character, we deviate from Chriſtianity and vital religion. For if we conſider thoſe as belonging to the houſe of God who have not been born from above, we conſider thoſe to be fit to worſhip him, who, according to the declaration of Chriſt, cannot enter his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. How then could a church, compoſed of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030780_0018_0FE92590F3B61538"/>
ſuch characters, be conſidered as the temple of God, or the gate of heaven? How could thoſe be ſit to enjoy God in that holy manſion, who on earth had no delight in him? The requirements of the goſpel are all reaſonable and conſiſtent, ſuited to the nature of God, and the ſtate of man. Men are required to repent, becauſe this reconciles them to God, and leads them to view ſin as God views it. Men are required to exerciſe faith in Chriſt, becauſe this implies an acknowledgment of him in all his characters, works and offices; and conſequently a cordial approbation of ſalvation through his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. Men are required to devote their whole hearts to God, to do all things for his glory, and ſtrive for heaven. How reaſonable are theſe things! If complied with, how conducive to our happineſs! How can we expect to enjoy God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we love him ſupremely? Heaven, to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent heart, would be like the richeſt banquet to the ſick. Is it not then of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for us to enquire whether we are born from above? Whether we ſincerely repent of our ſins? Whether we ſtrive to oppoſe the wickedneſs of our hearts? Whether we receive and approve the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? Whether we depend on him for ſalvation and eternal life? Unleſs we do theſe things, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude ourſelves, if we entertain hopes of heaven. For common ſenſe teaches us, that we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy an object, unleſs our diſpoſition be aſſimilated to its nature. How then ought our attention to be excited, that we be reconciled to God? Will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the terrors of eternal darkneſs, nor the charms of eternal light, rouſe us from our lethargy? Shall Jeſus diveſt himſelf of his heavenly radiance? Shall he deſcend to earth in the form of a ſervant? Shall
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030780_0019_0FE92597ACE5A318"/>
he agonize and die upon the croſs? Shall he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the dreary manſions of the grave, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne the king of terrors? Shall he aſcend on high, amidſt the ſhouts of admiring angels, and fling wide open the gates of Paradiſe for men? Shall he diſcloſe to our view the ever-verdant tree of life, bending with the food of archangels, and ſpreading its branches for the <q>healing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</q> Shall the glorious Saviour do all theſe things for us, and we remain unmoved and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent? God forbid. Let us receive him as our Lord and Maſter. We ſhall then look towards heaven as our proper reſidence. We ſhall antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate its joys, and triumph over the ruins of ſin. We ſhall leap with pleaſure at the approach of our emancipation. Our hearts will expand with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the proſpect of that period, when the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſtanding amidſt his ranſomed millions, ſhall lift the ſword of victory, and the pale horſe of death ſhall ſhrink into darkneſs—never, never to ſtrike his houghs in the vale of immortality! Then will an ocean of love, broad as the circuit of the ſpheres, roll down from the throne of God, and bear off the redeemed multitude to that delightful country, where ſin, and pain, and death, and ſorrow, never had a name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond obſervation which I make from the preceding diſcourſe is, that if the church is a ſtate deſigned by God, and calculated to prepare men for heaven, the maintenance of public worſhip muſt be of the higheſt importance. In the ordinary courſe of Divine Providence, we are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that men will become virtuous and good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means of inſtruction and information.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030780_0020_0FE9259B02200970"/>
God appears, in all things reſpecting this world, to operate by ſecondary cauſes. In all the means which he has eſtabliſhed in the miniſtration of the goſpel, there appears to be a tendency to holineſs and virtue. If this be not the caſe, why are the means appointed? If there be not greater proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that thoſe who hear the goſpel will become good, than there is that thoſe who do not hear it will, why is it to be preached? If men expect to be ſaved by the goſpel, they muſt attend its miniſtration. <q>For faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</q> We muſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the worſhip of God and enquire in his temple. If God point out the road to heaven, and we refuſe to walk in it, can we without the greateſt abſurdity expect to arrive in that happy manſion? As reaſonably might we expect, that by deſcending into the earth we ſhould light upon the ſun, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come companions of the ſtars.—Your exertions in this place for the eſtabliſhment and ſupport of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, evince your ſenſe of its importance. Permit me to congratulate you on the ſucceſs with which your efforts have been crowned. The libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of your inſtitution does honour to human nature. Like heaven, you receive men of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, without regard to any thing but their goodneſs. May no ſtandard ever be lifted here to call forth the ſpirit of party, but may you live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in peace, forbearing and forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let all things be done with decency, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and moderation. May you all enjoy the bleſſings of ſalvation, and while worſhipping your common Parent, enjoy his ſenſible preſence, ſo that with unſeigned fervour of ſoul you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030780_0021_0FE925A31C444848"/>
               <q>this is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</q> I now commend you to him who is able to keep you, and lead you into all truth. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</p>
