            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY the great vanity which you diſcover, and the ſelf-important airs which you aſſume thro'out your ſlanderous <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I conclude you ſuppoſed that I would either enter the liſts with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as a ſhrewd polemical writer, or elſe be wholly ſilent, from a conviction of my inability to defend the ſermons which you have attack'd in ſo heroic a manner. But if you imagined either of theſe things, you was under a miſtake. If ever I enter into a formal controverſy with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon ſuch points, it ſhall be with One, who appears to me to have both a better head, and honeſter heart than you have diſcovered in this ſpecimen of your abilities, and zeal for what you call orthodoxy. And yet I do not think it convenient to be quite ſilent upon this occaſion. Tho' my ſermons need no elaborate, argumentative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt your ratiotinations, and impertinent criticiſms; yet ſo much rudeneſs and inſolence, ſo much miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſlander, falſehood and forgery as your libel contains, ſhould not, methinks, be paſſed over without ſome animadverſions: Eſpecially ſince it is probable that this will be read chiefly by thoſe who have never ſeen the ſermons aforeſaid; and who may be ſo ignorant of you, as to imagine you had too much integrity and honor to miſrepreſent and falſify them. It is partly upon this conſideration, that I give you and myſelf the preſent trouble; my principal aim being, not to diſpute with, but to chaſtize and admoniſh you, for your real good; and to make you an example and warning to others. If in doing this, I ſhould tranſiently touch upon the merits of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009737_0003_0F7A4B348B4ACEE0"/>
the cauſe, theologically conſidered, you are not to flatter yourſelf, that I mean to controvert ſuch points with you; whom I conſider as a perſon wholly unworthy to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with about them, any farther than is requiſite to ſhew your diſhoneſty and wickedneſs with reference to them.</p>
            <p>If I had really publiſhed any material errors in point of doctrine, let me tell you, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> that you was one of the moſt unſutable perſons in the world, to undertake a confutation of them, or to ſet yourſelf up for an author, tho' you ſay, p. 4, that you have 'an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right' to do it. I am ſenſible that Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have a legal right to <hi>expoſe themſelves</hi> in print, on politics, divinity, or any other ſubject: And if this is what you inſiſt on as an invaluable privilege, I would by no means have your liberty, or that of the preſs reſtrained. But you ſpeak, p. 3. of 'Divines of indiſputable ability for ſuch an undertaking', as that of <hi>vindicating the truth againſt me.</hi> Can you then poſſibly think it became you, an obſcure perſon from another province, and one ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letter'd as you are; an out-caſt from the college to which you was a diſgrace; for ſome time a rambling itinerant, and promoter of diſorders and confuſion among us; ſo raw and unſtudied in divinity; one hardly ever heard of among us, but in the frequent reports of your follies and extravagances, and at length ſet up as a miniſter to an aſſembly of ſeparatiſts;—Can you poſſibly think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>you</hi> to turn author upon this occaſion; and to take this ſuppoſed neceſſary work of defending the <hi>moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant principles</hi> of the proteſtant religion againſt me, out of the hands of <hi>our Divines of indiſputable ability?</hi> What unaccountable vanity and infatuation was this! And you have preſumed to paſs an implicit cenſure on thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> alſo, by ſaying, p. 3.
<q>I <hi>marvel</hi> that none of our divines of indiſputable ability for ſuch an undertaking, have <hi>attempted</hi> to vindicate the truth againſt him</q>
—Is not this a proof, that none of our <hi>able Divines</hi> thought there was any <hi>occaſion</hi> for oppoſition to me? And do not you ſhew the utmoſt aſſurance, in thus ſetting up your <hi>little</hi> ſelf in oppoſition to their opinion, as well as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009737_0004_0F7A4B34FA15FEC0"/>
to my ſermons? Poor, unhappy man! You doubtleſs thought to emerge from your obſcurity, and to appear as a perſon of ſome conſequence, by this vain attempt. But you have great reaſon to wiſh, you had continued as unnoticed as ever: For it were much better to remain as unknown as heretofore, than to be only more <hi>infamous;</hi> as you are at leaſt in a fair way now to be, by means of your libel.</p>
            <p>If it were my intention to write to you as a ſcholar, logician or divine, I would take ſome notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and want of method, ſo apparent thro'out your <hi>Eſſay;</hi> the needleſs and numberleſs repetitions therein; and your running the propoſed heads of it into each other: So that one had almoſt as good look for what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe under any particular one, under any of the other, as that. This is particularly obſervable with reſpect to the three <hi>latter</hi> of them, which are the principal. And even under your <hi>firſt,</hi> the deſign of which, you ſay, is, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeveral things in which you "agree" with me <note n="*" place="bottom">Thus it is expreſſed p 4.
<q>I. Mention ſeveral things, WE agree with the Dr. in</q>.
So p 7. 'Yea, WE ſtick not to ſay'.—p 95. 'OUR ſyſtem of doctrine'—97. 'Another principle of OUR ſyſtem' —After this manner he ſpeaks in numerous other places: WE, OUR, US. &amp;c. As if all this wrong headed creature's whimſies were the common cauſe of proteſtants, and himſelf a diſtinguiſhed champion therefor. Who can help ſmiling at the folly and impertinence of this, that is not too much provok'd at the inſolence &amp; arrogance of it?</note>, you mention near as many, I think, in which, you ſay, we <hi>diſagree.</hi> But it is as much beneath me to play the <hi>critic</hi> on ſuch a performance as yours, as it would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to expoſe the vanity of your criticiſms on my ſermons. Let me here only juſt obſerve by the way, that if I agree with you in ſo many things as you ſay I do, this is a better preſumptive evidence, that I am under ſome <hi>miſtakes,</hi> than any which you have produced. For I can hardly ſuppoſe it poſſible for any one to be of your opinion in many points of doctrine, without being in the <hi>wrong</hi> with reſpect to ſome.</p>
            <p>But I will now proceed to the main buſineſs of this Letter, which is, to ſet your falſehood, and iniquitous proceedings with reference to my ſermons, in ſome <hi>order
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009737_0005_0F7A4B35C3B65910"/>
before your eyes;</hi> and to adminiſter the reproof and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which you deſerve; or rather a <hi>part</hi> thereof. For it is only they that hold the ſword of <hi>public</hi> juſtice, that can legally puniſh ſuch wickedneſs to the <hi>extent</hi> of its demerits. Your villainy in this affair appears written, as one may ſay, even upon your forehead; I mean in your title-page: In which you have the aſſurance to repreſent me to the world, as an enemy to 'the moſt important principles' of the proteſtant religion; particularly 'the doctrine of Chriſt's ſacrifice and atonement', &amp;c. On which, you there ſay, I caſt 'injurious aſperſions'. After the word <hi>atonement,</hi> you indeed inſert theſe clauſes, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>as being abſolutely neceſſary to the pardon of ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with God's infinite and unchangeable <hi>rectitude</hi>
               </q>;
—that you might have an hole to creep out at. But this will not ſerve your turn. You know, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> in your conſcience, that I did not deny any neceſſity of atonement, ariſing from wiſdom, fitneſs, the ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or the moral character of God; but rather ſaid what implies it, as will hereafter appear to your confuſion, unleſs you are paſt all ſhame. How then could you have the confidence, becauſe my expreſſions concerning atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do not exactly correſpond with yours, to repreſent me to the world, as caſting 'injurious aſperſions' on it? by which you doubtleſs intended ſomething beyond a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple denial of it. But it muſt be obſerved, that I am charged, in this villainous title-page, with <hi>injuriouſly aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> other important doctrines of the goſpel, beſides that of Chriſt's atonement; unleſs you will ſay, that there are ſome 'moſt important principles in the proteſtant reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſyſtem of chriſtianity', which are not themſelves real and important doctrines of the goſpel; and therefore that I may be ſuppoſed to <hi>aſperſe</hi> the former, tho' I maintain the latter: Which, I conclude, you will not ſay. Indeed, nothing is more manifeſt, than that it was your formal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to <hi>aſperſe</hi> me, as an enemy to ſome of the moſt fundamental doctrines of the chriſtian religion; which you accordingly <hi>eſſay</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> againſt the ſuppoſed injurious aſperſions caſt on them in my ſermons. You muſt be ſenſible, that this is a very high charge to be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009737_0006_0F7A4B36815BABE8"/>
one who is, at leaſt by his ſtation and profeſſion, a miniſter of the goſpel. But I have the leſs reaſon to be any ways uneaſy at your diſlike of my ſermons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think it pretty evident that you do not well like the <hi>text</hi> itſelf, in its plain, literal ſenſe; or, in other words, that you do not really believe, 'The Lord is good to ALL, and his tender mercies over ALL his works.' Had you believed this to be ſtrictly true, I do not think you would (I am ſure you could not <hi>conſiſtently</hi>) have made ſuch a tragical out-cry againſt thoſe diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>But having made theſe curſory remarks on the iniquity of your title-page, as well as the vanity of your intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and the impertinence and confuſion of your <hi>firſt</hi> head; I ſhall now paſs on to your <hi>ſecond:</hi> which is thus expreſſed in your libel, p.9.
<q>To take notice of the Dr's evident <hi>deſign.</hi>
               </q>
And this, you immediately add, was,
<q>To repreſent the divine goodneſs in ſuch a light as to ſhew, there was no abſolute neceſſity for the ſacrifice of Chriſt to make atonement, or to ſatisfy <note n="*" place="bottom">It ſhould be remembered, that the ſcripture makes uſe of no ſuch language as this, of Chriſt's <hi>ſatisfying divine juſtice,</hi> in any one place. However, the author of this letter is far from having any diſpoſition to contend about mere words. If thoſe who expreſs themſelves after this manner, intend no more by the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, than is implied in his <hi>ſacrifice</hi> or <hi>atonement,</hi> (as they ought not to do) he makes no objection againſt it; but aſſerts the doctrine of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction himſelf, in this ſenſe; as is evident even from thoſe ſermons which have been attack'd in ſo outrageous a manner.</note> divine juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in order to God's forgiving the ſins of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with his moral goodneſs.</q>
Upon which let it be remarked in the firſt place,</p>
            <p>That if I had, in expreſs terms, aſſerted the non-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of atonement or ſatisfaction, in order to the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin; this would have been no more than ſome eminent proteſtant Divines have done; even <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Divines; whom, I conclude, you account the moſt <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> of any. I will particularly mention but one of them; the famous Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> who was in ſuch high reputation with the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter,</hi> that he was choſen and ſerved as <hi>Prolocutor,</hi> or <hi>Chairman</hi> of that venerable aſſembly. And his opinion ought, perhaps, to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009737_0007_0F7A4B3757A5CD70"/>
have almoſt as much weight as that of Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> The Dr. has nine folio pages in his <hi>Vindiciae Gratiae</hi> &amp;c. upon this point; beginning p. 198. under the head <hi>De Electione</hi>; the <hi>eighth Digreſſion,</hi> as he terms it:
<q>In quâ probatur poſſe Deum per potentiam abſolutam vel CITRA SATISFACTIONEM peccata remittere, ſimulque ad Lubberti &amp; Piſcatoris contraſentientium rationes reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur</q>.
Which, for the ſake of you, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> and my other Engliſh readers, I here tranſlate— <hi>In which it is proved, That God can forgive ſins by his abſolute power, even</hi> WITHOUT SATISFACTION; <hi>and alſo the reaſonings of Lubbertus &amp; Piſcator, who think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, are anſwered.</hi> It immediately follows,
<q>Poſſe Deum vel citra ſatisfactionem peccata remittere, juxta potentiam ejus abſolutam, adeo manifeſtum mihi videtur, ut extra controverſiam ponendum eſſe facile cenſerem.</q>
i. e. <hi>That God can forgive ſins even without ſatisfaction, by his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, appears ſo manifeſt to me, that I ſhould think it a point which ought to be placed beyond all controverſy.</hi> Afterwards,
<q>Si Deus non poſſit peccata ſine ſatisfactione remittere; tum vel quia non poteſt per <hi>potentiam,</hi> vel quia non poteſt per JUSTITIAM. At <hi>neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi> horum dici poteſt,</q>
&amp;c. i. e. <hi>If God cannot forgive ſins without ſatisfaction; this is either becauſe he cannot, with reſpect to power, or becauſe he cannot, in reſpect of</hi> JUSTICE. <hi>But neither of theſe things can be affirmed,</hi> &amp;c. From hence it is manifeſt, that this eminent <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> Divine, in high repute with the Weſtminſter Aſſembly, for which you expreſs ſo great a veneration, was full and poſitive in his opinion, that ſin might have been forgiven without <hi>any</hi> ſatisfaction; and particularly, that the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God did not indiſpenſibly require it. This he thought ſo plain a point, that it ought not to be called in queſtion. If, therefore, I had as expreſly aſſerted the ſame thing, did it become <hi>you,</hi>—I ſay, <hi>you,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> to inveigh againſt me for it; and to load me with ſo much obloquy? Could you not differ from me in opinion, and yet obſerve ſome ſort of decorum and modeſty in your oppoſition?</p>
            <p>But let me remind you in the next place, that I did not aſſert the poſſibility of forgiveneſs without atonement.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009737_0008_0F7A4B3809D58C30"/>
So far from it, that the manner in which I expreſſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon this point, rather implied a <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in order to forgiveneſs: And ſurely you will not aſſert any other kind of neceſſity, or a <hi>natural</hi> one, as contradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from <hi>moral.</hi> At leaſt, I am perſuaded that no man who underſtands what he ſays, ſuppoſes any other: What <hi>you</hi> may do, I cannot ſay.—That I denied not ſuch a neceſſity, but rather ſuppoſed it, will fully appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; together with your wilful falſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> on the method which you take to prove that I had the <hi>deſign</hi> aforeſaid. You infer this from what I ſaid of divine juſtice, conſidered as a branch or mode of goodneſs; which opinion of mine you ſuppoſe, without any reaſon, to be inconſiſtent with the doctrine of atonement. But what an iniquitous method of proceeding is this? Upon ſuppoſition I was miſtaken about divine juſtice, (which I am perſuaded no man can prove) is this a ſufficient ground to charge me with ſuch a <hi>deſign</hi> as you ſpeak of? This is the ſame kind of diſhoneſty, that it would be in any one to accuſe you of deiſm or atheiſm, becauſe he ſuppoſed ſome of your principles, being purſued into their juſt conſequences, would terminate therein; which probably may be the caſe. But yet I ſhould think it injurious to charge you with a deſign to propagate deiſm or atheiſm, while you profeſs the contrary; even tho' you have ſhewn ſo little regard to truth and integrity, as you have done in many parts of your libel. One inſtance hereof may indeed be found in this part of it, p. 9. Where you inſinuate that I hold <hi>every</hi> act of punitive juſtice in God, to be intended for the good of the <hi>individual,</hi> on whom it terminates. You ſay,
<q>Now if juſtice, even punitive juſtice in God, is only a mode or modification of his goodneſs, or kindneſs and beneficence towards his creatures, then the great end (as the Dr. ſays it is) of God's exerciſing punitive juſtice, muſt be "the good of his creatures," and even the good of <hi>thoſe that it is exerciſed upon</hi>; and hence <hi>every</hi> act of punitive juſtice muſt be an act of kindneſs, "for it is goodneſs
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009737_0009_0F7A4B38B78E84D8"/>
itſelf that gives the blow."</q>
Here you refer to Serm. p. 21. Now would not any one who never read my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and took you for an honeſt man, conclude from hence, that I ſuppoſed it would be unjuſt for God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any ſinner more than would be for his <hi>own</hi> good? Indeed you ſay expreſly, p. 10. that according to my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<q>God would not be perfectly good but cruel, if he ſhould puniſh them</q>
[ſinners]
<q>any farther than would be for <hi>their</hi> good or happineſs</q>
—Now are you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> of ſuch prevarication as this? I did indeed compare God's acts of punitive juſtice to thoſe of a wiſe and good earthly parent or ſovereign; who has always <hi>ſome</hi> good or benevolent deſign in puniſhing. But then I expreſly guarded, as you know, againſt the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that all acts of punitive juſtice, whether in God or man, are acts of kindneſs to the ſuffering individuals. That thoſe who have never read my ſermons, may ſee it is not without good reaſon that I accuſe you of diſhoneſty in this reſpect, I ſhall here extract a few paſſages from them, out of many to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>SPEAKING of the motive from which a wiſe and good parent puniſhes his children, when he is under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not of mere <hi>paſſion,</hi> but of reaſon only, I ſay,
<q>Is it not in order to reform, and do them good?—or at leaſt with a view <hi>to the benefit of his other children,</hi> or <hi>thoſe of the houſhold</hi>;—that they may be kept under due ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.—So that in a good parent, as was ſaid before, there is no ſuch quality as juſtice, <hi>really diſtinct from goodneſs;</hi> not even in puniſhing: <hi>For it is goodneſs itſelf that gives the blow,</hi>
               </q>
Serm. p. 21. This laſt clauſe you diſhoneſtly introduce, as if I had not only uſed it expreſly concerning God; but had thereby intended to aſſert, that he never puniſhes a ſinner, but for his <hi>own good,</hi> in diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>public</hi> or <hi>common:</hi> And is not this a wicked, wilful perverſion of my evident meaning? Again:</p>
            <p>SPEAKING juſt after, of a wiſe and good earthly ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, I expreſſed myſelf thus,—
<q>Neither does he inflict any puniſhments, but what he conſiders as needful for the ſupport of his government;—if not for the particular
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009737_0010_0F7A4B39CE7848E0"/>
good of <hi>thoſe that ſuffer,</hi> as in capital caſes, yet for the good of his <hi>people in general,</hi> by way of example and terror, that good order may be preſerved. So that even in this caſe of exciſion, or capital puniſhment, the juſtice of the ſovereign is no real quality in him, diſtinct from goodneſs. It is goodneſs, or a regard to <hi>common good,</hi> that takes off the head of the traitor,</q>
&amp;c. p. 21, 22. It is afterwards obſerved, that God is often repreſented to us in ſcripture under the characters of a Father and a King; 'the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> Father, the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> King,' p. 23, 24. And after quoting Heb. XII. 6—12. where God is repreſented as chaſtening us 'for our profit,' I go on thus, p. 25.
<q>No man will deny, but that God is at once juſt and good in theſe chaſtenings. Goodneſs and juſtice in him, therefore, are not to be conſidered as <hi>oppoſites</hi>: They <hi>may,</hi> in all other caſes without exception, be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident; the latter being, <hi>perhaps,</hi> only a particular modification of the former, and tending to poſitive good, <hi>at leaſt the public or common.</hi>
               </q>
And you your ſelf, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> know, and have often acknowledged, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly p. 15. that I ſpeak of the <hi>future</hi> puniſhment of wicked men in the language of ſcripture, as <hi>eternal, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> &amp;c. How then could you have ſo much diſhoneſty and impudence, as to repreſent it to the world as my doctrine, or at leaſt implied in my doctrine concerning divine goodneſs, that <hi>every</hi> act of punitive juſtice in God, is an act of kindneſs to the individual puniſhed; or that God's end therein is the good even
<q>of thoſe, that it is exerciſed upon</q>?
Was not this very fooliſh alſo, as well as injurious? For do you think you can make the world believe that I either aſſerted or ſuppoſed, it was for the good of ſinners themſelves to be <hi>eternally</hi> puniſhed? For ſhame, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland;</hi> what do you think of yourſelf? Or what opinion do you ſuppoſe the world can have, either of your ſenſe or honeſty in this reſpect? You proceed upon the ſame <hi>known</hi> falſe ſuppoſition, when you ſo pertly demand, p. 10.
<q>And if God's punitive juſtice is poſitive kindneſs, or if <hi>all</hi> his acts of puniſhing, are acts of poſitive kindneſs, how could the ſufferings of Chriſt, the juſt for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009737_0011_0F7A4B3A434A1250"/>
the unjuſt, be an effect of God's love, mercy and grace? Is it an act of love, mercy and grace, to <hi>withold from ſinners an act of poſitive kindneſs?</hi>
               </q>
Fye! Mr. <hi>Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> You know that, according to my principles, ſinners may be juſtly puniſhed by way of terror and example to others, for the ſupport of government, order and <hi>common</hi> good, tho' themſelves are not benefitted, nor deſigned to be benefitted thereby. And Chriſt's atonement, or his ſuffering, the juſt for the unjuſt, or in the room, place or ſtead of ſinners, (which I ſuppoſe the true, natural import of that expreſſion) was not in order to their being exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any diſciplinary correction, or medicinal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for their real good; (for thus the ſaints are corrected, or puniſhed, notwithſtanding Chriſt ſuffered for them) but in order to their being exempted from that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which they might otherwiſe have been ſubjected, in order to vindicate the honor of Gods law and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the ſupport of order, and therein for the good of the univerſe, which eſſentially depends thereon. And if theſe ends may be anſwered by the ſufferings of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator or ſubſtitute, as I ſuppoſe, I hope you will allow it to be an 'act of love, mercy and grace,' to appoint a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to ſuffer thus, in order to prevent our ſuffering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, by way of example and warning, as malefactors do in the caſe of capital puniſhment; tho' it would not be an act of love, mercy and grace,
<q>to withold from ſinners an act of <hi>poſitive</hi> kindneſs,</q>
or any puniſhment which is for their good; as you, at once with equal folly, effrontery and malice, ſuggeſt it would be, upon my principles.</p>
            <p>YOU go on with your imaginary proof of the <hi>deſign</hi> imputed to me; but really, only in further expoſing the naughtineſs of your heart. You ſay,
<q>This deſign farther appears from what the Dr. ſays in p. 64 and 65; where he plainly intimates, that there was no neceſſity of the atonement of Chriſt, in reference to <hi>any ſuch divine juſtice in God,</hi> that muſt be ſatisfied by the ſufferings or death of Chriſt, that men might be pardoned or ſaved; "ſuch idea of divine juſtice, muſt be wholly and forever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</q>
—Libel, p. 10. The laſt clauſes here, with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009737_0012_0F7A4B3B1CA09530"/>
double comma's, you cite as mine; tho' they are altered, ſo as not to give your readers a true idea of my meaning. You have here the confidence to inſinuate, that I denied the atonement of Chriſt had any reference to the juſtice of God, the honor of his law and government; or was deſigned to exempt ſinners from that puniſhment, which muſt otherwiſe have been inflicted upon them. This is your manifeſt intention; and yet it is abſolutely falſe, and you know it to be ſo. You know that in the places, to which you refer, I did not ſpeak of divine juſtice in general, as if Chriſt's ſufferings had no reference thereto; but only of a particular notion of juſtice, as if it were in nature wholly and abſolutely diſtinct from goodneſs; for which, I ſuppoſe, there is no foundation in reaſon or ſcripture. But, inſtead of fairly quoting my words, you had the diſhoneſty to mutilate them in ſuch a manner, as to give your unwary readers quite a wrong conception of my meaning; as if I had, in general terms, denied <hi>any</hi> juſtice in God, to which the ſatisfaction [atonement] of Chriſt had reference, in order to the pardon of ſin. Are you not aſhamed of ſuch a wicked artifice as this, at once to ſlander me, and impoſe upon your readers?</p>
            <p>YOU proceed in the ſame page, viz. 10. to cite me thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to prove your point: I ſhall tranſcribe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence juſt as it ſtands in the libel—"We are aſſured (ſays he) in the holy ſcriptures, that God forgives the ſins of men thro' this great ſacrifice (of Chriſt) intervening, <hi>rather</hi> than without any." This is your pointing; here you make a period for me, where I made only a comma, the ſenſe being incomplete. It immediately follows in the ſermon, p. 64. after the comma at the word <hi>any,</hi>—
<q>not becauſe he is deficient in goodneſs, or not perfectly merciful, but becauſe he is infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> as well as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; taking ſuch a method herein, as is in its nature admirably adapted to
<q>magnify the law and make it honourable,</q>
i. e. to beget and preſerve in the minds of reaſonable creatures a juſt ſenſe of God's authority, the dignity of his laws and government: Which, as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before, is evidently beſt even for themſelves.</q>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:009737_0013_0F7A4B3BB99A5298"/>
Now, had you quoted the ſentence intire, inſtead of muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it in the ſhameful manner you have done, it would probably have convinced every diſcerning and unprejudiced man, that you had injuriouſly repreſented my deſign. No perſon, ſurely, that underſtands himſelf, will ſay, that the appointing a mediator to atone for ſin, and forgiving us thro' him, proceeded from any want of goodneſs or mercy in God. Nor can any thing be ſaid more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary to the atonement, than that God provided it, 'becauſe he was infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> as well as merciful; taking ſuch a method,' &amp;c. But all this latter part of that long ſentence you diſhoneſtly leave out, making a period at the word <hi>any;</hi> and go on to comment upon the former part thus:
<q>q. d. There was no abſolute neceſſity of this ſacrifice intervening; God might have forgiven ſin without any; but <hi>of the two,</hi> he choſe rather to do it with than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any.</q>
You quote and point that part of the ſentence juſt in the ſame manner, I think, ten or a dozen times in your libel; and often give the like comment upon it: As if I intended, that God might, conſiſtently with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his infinite wiſdom, and his moral perfections, (all ſummarily comprehended in goodneſs) have forgiven the ſins of men, in a method not wiſe and good, or at leaſt not ſo wiſe and good as that which he actually choſe. You pretend to give my ſenſe thus,—'of the two he choſe <hi>rather</hi> to do it with than without any': Which evidently amounts to this, that <hi>of the two,</hi> God choſe to act as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an infinitely wiſe and perfect being, <hi>rather</hi> than to act as did not become ſuch an One! My expreſſion does not any more ſuppoſe that God might, conſiſtently with his perfections, have forgiven the ſins of men without the atonement of Chriſt, than it does, that he might in any, or all other reſpects in general, have acted a part different from that which is the wiſeſt and beſt. And do you find neither <hi>nature</hi> nor <hi>grace</hi> inclining you to bluſh, Mr. <hi>Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when you ſee your perverſeneſs and diſhoneſty thus expoſed to the world! If either of them, I am perſwaded it is the <hi>former,</hi> corrupt as it is; for a reaſon which I leave to be conjectured—You go on thus, p. 11. 'But why
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009737_0014_0F7A4B3C79AD3A70"/>
did God chuſe to do it with a ſacrifice, rather than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any?' What impudence is this! Did I not plainly inform you <hi>why,</hi> both negatively and poſitively, in that part of the ſame ſentence, which you ſo felloneouſly left out?—<hi>viz.</hi> 'not becauſe he was <hi>deficient in goodneſs,</hi> or <hi>not perfectly merciful</hi>; but becauſe he was infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> as well as merciful; taking ſuch a method herein, as is in its nature admirably adapted <hi>to magnify the law, and make it honourable.</hi>' Is not this a ſufficient reaſon,—that this method was infinitely wiſe, and admirably adapted to anſwer the moſt important ends in the divine government? What would the man have? It might perhaps have pleaſed you, who, it ſeems, have ſo little regard either for wiſdom or goodneſs, or even common honeſty, (in writing) if I had ſaid that the atonement had not its foundation in, or riſe from, infinite wiſdom and goodneſs. For it ſeems, that to ſay it had, is, in your depraved opinion, to caſt <hi>injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſperſions</hi> upon it: In which, it is to be hoped, that no wiſe and good man will agree with you.</p>
            <p>BUT it ſeems you would farther infer my <hi>deſign</hi> to ſhew the non-neceſſity of Chriſt's atonement, from my words quoted by you in the laſt-mentioned page. Speaking of that paſſage, Heb. II.9, 10.—<hi>It</hi> BECAME <hi>him,</hi> &amp;c. I ſaid,
<q>It became his wiſdom, it became his goodneſs—There was a fitneſs and congruity in it, as the wiſeſt and beſt method of ſaving ſinful men, without any kind of refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that common, but yet ſtrange ſuppoſition, of divine juſtice <hi>being intirely diſtinct</hi> from divine goodneſs.</q>
—Therefore, to be ſure, I ſuppoſed there was no moral neceſſity of atonement, with reference to divine juſtice in <hi>any ſenſe!</hi> This is evidently what you deſign to make your readers believe, p. 11. after citing the paſſage aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>NOW the diſhoneſty of this appears divers ways: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my idea of God's goodneſs, it is
<q>always to be conſidered as inſeparably connected with his <hi>wiſdom;</hi> and regulated thereby in <hi>all</hi> its operations. It is not to be conſidered as a ſort of blind inſtinct, or good-nature; detached from reaſon and right, or a regard to fitneſs and propriety.</q>
(Serm. p. 14.) And being thus conſidered, I
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009737_0015_0F7A4B3D3A048DE8"/>
ſuppoſed that it comprized the whole moral character of God, even his <hi>juſtice.</hi> Theſe things you knew; for you have quoted many paſſages to this purpoſe, only to pervert them; as may appear hereafter. You therefore doubtleſs knew, that when I ſaid, it became the wiſdom and goodneſs of God to forgive the ſins of men, thro' the ſacrifice of Chriſt, I did not ſpeak of his goodneſs in the common reſtrained ſenſe, but as including his juſtice; in a ſenſe analogous to that, in which the goodneſs of a wiſe prince or parent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes juſtice. So that if the atonement of Chriſt had any reference to goodneſs in this ſenſe, it muſt neceſſarily have ſome, indeed a particular reference to juſtice. And this evidently appears to have been my meaning, becauſe I expreſly ſpeak of it, in the ſame paſſage, as a method 'admirably adapted to magnify the law, and make it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,' &amp;c. which could not be ſaid with any propriety, if the atonement had no reference to juſtice and law. What then became of your honeſty or your ſenſes, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> when you wrote as you did? Beſides; this very paſſage, which you have uſed ſo villainouſly, is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in a manner, which plainly ſuppoſes I allowed a ſort of moral neceſſity of atonement, in order to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of mens ſins. For it is an anſwer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which, I thought, ſome might poſſibly make againſt the doctrine delivered by me—
<q>What <hi>occaſion</hi> was there for any atonement, upon theſe principles?—Whereas the ſcriptures <hi>conſtantly ſuppoſe the need of it in order to the pardon of ſin.</hi>
               </q>
Now, that the ſcriptures really ſuppoſe a <hi>need,</hi> or neceſſity of it in order to our forgiveneſs, I plainly allowed: And accordingly went on to ſhew, whence that need or neceſſity aroſe, upon my own principles; <hi>viz.</hi> that the law of God might be <hi>magnified</hi> and made <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> that <hi>a juſt ſenſe of his authority, the dignity of his laws and government, might be begotten and preſerved in the minds of reaſonable creatures; which is evidently beſt even for themſelves.</hi> And yet you have ſuch a front, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> as to repreſent me to the world as having <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly aſperſed</hi> the atonement of Chriſt as <hi>unneceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009737_0016_0F7A4B3ED00EEA88"/>BUT it is the word <hi>rather,</hi> as uſed by me with reference to this point, that ſeems chiefly to provoke your ſpleen, and put you upon fibbing and raging in ſuch an ungodly manner as you do. Tho' I uſed this harmleſs word but once, I think, you fall foul of it in ten or a dozen places: In all of them giving a ſpecimen of your <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>honeſty.</hi> For example, p. 43. you quote, paraphraſe and remark on my words thus, <hi>verbatim,</hi> in order to prove me guilty of an inconſiſtency—'He was juſt ſaying,
<q>That we are aſſured in the holy ſcriptures, that God forgives the ſins of men thro' this great ſacrifice intervening, RATHER than without <hi>any.</hi>
               </q>
q. d.
<q>He might have done it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>any,</hi> there was no abſolute neceſſity of his doing it in this way, or not all.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe this was intended for, not <hi>at</hi> all; but I follow my copy.</note>
               <q>And yet immediately adds, There was a neceſſity of God's doing it in this way; otherwiſe he could not maintain his own authority, nor the dignity of his laws and government.</q>
This were doubtleſs a very palpable contradiction; ſuch an one as few beſides yourſelf could be guilty of. But, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> do you not know the old proverb concerning perſons of a certain very <hi>infamous character?</hi>—that it behoves them to have a <hi>good memory.</hi> In the firſt place, I neither <hi>immediately,</hi> nor at all added the words which you ſay I did; they are none of mine, tho' you have formally quoted them as ſuch, in order to fix an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency on me. In the next place, tho' I had actually expreſſed myſelf in that manner, I ſhould not have been guilty of the leaſt inconſiſtency. For I never denied a moral neceſſity of Chriſt's atonement, in order to God's maintaining the dignity of his laws and government, while he forgives the ſins of men; tho' you have the front to inſinuate that I did. Thirdly, your allowing, as you here do, that I aſſert there was a neceſſity of God's forgiving the ſins of men thro' Chriſt's atonement, if he did it at all; ſince
<q>otherwiſe he could not maintain his own authority,</q>
&amp;c. Your allowing this, I ſay, intirely overthrows the grand indictment brought againſt me, in order to ſupport which you have told ſo many falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009737_0017_0F7A4B3FA3A83C20"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> that of having <hi>injuriouſly aſperſed the doctrine of Chriſt's ſacrifice and atonement,</hi> as not being <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c. Unhappy man! I beg that, at leaſt for your own credit, you would rub up your <hi>memory,</hi> before you publiſh any more ſlander to the world.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt take a little farther notice of your cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the innocent word <hi>rather,</hi> againſt which you rave thro' ſo great a part of your libel. In p. 77. (a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which will be further noticed hereafter, with another view) you introduce me ſaying expreſly,
<q>God might have forgiven the ſins of men without any ſacrifice intervening; indeed it was <hi>rather</hi> the beſt and wiſeſt method to forgive the ſins of men, thro' this great ſacrifice of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening, than without any. The eternal rule of right, and the honor and dignity of God's moral law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are of <hi>ſo ſmall weight,</hi> that they did but <hi>juſt turn the ſcale</hi> in favor of an atonement</q>
—Theſe, you know, you quote as my words; but I will indulge you ſo far at preſent, as to conſider them only as your paraphraſe upon my words, tho' it is beyond diſpute, you intended your readers ſhould think them mine. Now the manner of your commenting upon the word <hi>rather,</hi> as uſed by me, (ſuppoſing this to be deſigned only as a comment) brings to my mind many paſſages of ſcripture, in which the ſame word occurs: And I have been thinking what a notable expoſitor, caſuiſt and divine you would appear, if you was to preach or print upon them, obſerving the ſame rule and method of interpretation, that you have in expounding my words. It muſt be hugely edifying to the good people of <hi>Ipſwich</hi>—For example, the Pſalmiſt ſays, 'I had RATHER be a door-keeper in the houſe of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedneſs.' This you might deſcant upon thus—
<q>There was no abſolute, indiſpenſible moral reaſon or ground, why holy David ſhould prefer the houſe of God to the tents of wickedneſs: But <hi>of the two,</hi> he <hi>rather</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the former to the latter. He might have <hi>well</hi> and <hi>wiſely</hi> choſen the tents of wickedneſs: <hi>The eternal rule of right,</hi> the honor of the divine authority and laws, were <hi>of ſo ſmall weight, that they did but juſt turn the ſcale in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009737_0018_0F7A4B40348488C8"/>
favor</hi> of the holy tabernacle. Mark, <hi>O ye dear children of</hi>—, ye precious ſouls! mark well what a ſlight, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial regard this <hi>eminent ſaint</hi> had to the houſe of — the place where his honor dwells; and how little aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had to wickedneſs, and the habitations thereof. O ye dear ſouls! what glorious encouragement does this give, to think yourſelves in a converted, ſafe eſtate, even tho' you ſhould not love the one, or hate the other <hi>quite</hi> ſo much as holy David did, little as that was!</q>
Again, it is ſaid, 'Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul: but RATHER fear him that is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both ſoul and body in hell.' The pious Mr. <hi>Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon the place, in conformity to his own method of interpretation:
<q>q. d. It is of very little conſequence which of theſe you fear: indeed it is of the two <hi>rather</hi> the wiſeſt and beſt to fear the latter; but there is no abſolute, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible obligation to do ſo; the eternal rule of right, the dignity of —'s moral law and government are <hi>of ſo ſmall weight, that they do but juſt turn the ſcale:</hi> and whether only your bodies are killed now, or both your ſouls and bodies are deſtroyed hereafter, is hardly of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</q>
—It is eaſy to imagine what <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting uſes</hi> you might extract for yourſelf, and dear chriſtian brethren, from this text ſo interpreted. Again: It is ſaid, 'Seek not what ye ſhall eat, and what ye ſhall drink, or wherewithal ye ſhall be cloathed: But RATHER ſeek the kingdom of God'—The learned and pious Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> in Locum,
<q>q. d. The kingdom of heaven, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and life eternal, are indeed of the two <hi>rather</hi> preferable to good eating, drinking and fine cloaths; this muſt be allowed: But yet, precious ſouls! the difference is ſo inconſiderable, that it is not much matter which ye ſeek: the eternal rule of right,</q>
&amp;c. are of <hi>ſo ſmall 'weight,</hi> that,' &amp;c. The excellent practical inſtructions and conſolations reſulting naturally from ſuch an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the place, I need not mention.—Once more: It is ſaid, 'Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs; but RATHER reprove them.' The warm and zealous, the clarified and greatly illuminated
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009737_0019_0F7A4B43A0D161E8"/>
Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> upon the place—
<q>q. d. There is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, dear ſouls! of your abſtaining from the works of <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>diſhoneſty,</hi> or of diſcountenancing them in others; you may be juſtified and ſaved without this. But yet <hi>of the two,</hi> it is <hi>rather</hi> more becoming you to reprove, than to practiſe and encourage ſuch works. This is all that can be ſaid. The eternal rule of right, the honor of — the dignity of his laws and government, and the credit of chriſtianity in the world, are of <hi>ſo ſmall weight,</hi> that they do but <hi>juſt turn the ſcale,</hi>
               </q>
&amp;c. What excellent, uſeful and moſt comfortable reflexions might the apoſtle's words afford to <hi>ſome people,</hi> being thus paraphraſed?</p>
            <p>I HAVE here taken the liberty, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for you, in your own way: giving the word <hi>rather,</hi> in theſe paſſages, preciſely the ſame ſignification and force, that you have given it in my ſermon: Upon which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of it, the grand argument of your libel turns. I might altogether with as much truth and juſtice ſay, that I have delivered your natural, genuine ſenſe of theſe ſeveral texts, as you can, that you have given mine, in your para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe. Indeed I might add, that by what I have heard of your wild, ſenſeleſs and extravagant way of preaching in times paſt, I can ſcarce doubt but that you have often expounded ſcripture as ridiculouſly, as licentiouſly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely as you would have done, had you actually para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed thoſe ſeveral paſſages, in the manner before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And if you continue in the ſame way, tho' you ſtile yourſelf V. D. M. <hi>a miniſter of God's word;</hi> it ſhould have <hi>rather</hi> been V. D. C. <hi>a corrupter of his word.</hi> Let me add that, by the many groſs falſehoods, and wicked ſlanders in your libel, ſome of which have been already ſhewn, (and more are behind) it may be feared, tho' I do not affirm, that you are near as great a <hi>corruptor</hi> thereof in practice, as you are in principle or doctrine.</p>
            <p>IT is needleſs for me to ſpend time to bruſh away the other flimſy, cobweb-reaſonings in the ſecond part of your libel; and indeed it was my determination from the firſt, not to enter into a diſpute with ſuch a wrong-headed and worſe-hearted wretch, any farther than was requiſite to lay open
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009737_0020_0F7A4B440D009530"/>
the villainy of this attack upon me. That you have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſrepreſented my deſign, miſquoted my words in ſome places, and put a moſt perverſe conſtruction upon them in others, is, I believe, very apparent to every impartial and intelligent perſon, who has ever compared your libel with my ſermons. And if any thing, coming from <hi>you,</hi> could aſtoniſh me, (except ſober truth, ſolid reaſoning and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor) after what I have already obſerved in your libel, I ſhould be aſtoniſhed at the effrontery which you diſcover at the cloſe of your ſaid ſecond head, p. 15.
<q>If I have not <hi>hit</hi> upon the Dr's <hi>evident deſign,</hi> I confeſs it is becauſe I <hi>can't comprehend</hi> him</q>
—What do you mean, pray! by not <hi>hitting</hi> upon, or not comprehending an <hi>evident deſign?</hi> If the deſign is <hi>evident,</hi> who but an idiot could help <hi>hitting</hi> upon, <hi>comprehending,</hi> or at leaſt in general knowing what it is? That <hi>you</hi> could not comprehend my <hi>whole</hi> deſign, may be true; but that you underſtood more of it, than you was willing to own, and knowingly miſrepreſented it, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; particularly from your miſquoting, curtailing, mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and miſpointing my words, and by your perverſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting on the word <hi>rather:</hi> Whereas had you acted honeſtly, it would have at once appeared to your readers, that you was only expoſing yourſelf, by objecting againſt my ſermons, in the manner you have done. No one can help <hi>hitting</hi> upon <hi>your deſign,</hi> in this way of proceeding; and ſeeing it to be villainous in an high degree. And pray! how much better a <hi>deſign</hi> had you, in what you ſay in the margin of p. 14. about my being
<q>full in the ſcheme (at leaſt as to the fundamental and leading prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of it) which the Rev. Preſident <hi>Clap,</hi> of Yale-College, collected out of ſeveral authors, viz. <hi>Chubb,</hi>
               </q>
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c? I will tell you what ſome ſuppoſe to be at leaſt partly your <hi>deſign,</hi> in introducing that pamphlet, and thus charging me with being in the ſcheme therein repreſented: <hi>viz.</hi> recommending yourſelf to the author, and the other governors of ſaid College; which, it is ſaid, <hi>ſpewed</hi> you out ſome years ago; (tho' not as a <hi>Laodicean,</hi> 'neither cold nor hot'—) and ſo obtaining, by this diſhoneſt means, thoſe academical honors, of which you are at once ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009737_0021_0F7A4B45EE038E68"/>
and ſo ambitious: For had not this been the caſe, you would not, ſurely, ſo long have ſought them in vain—</p>
            <p>THE third head of your libel, from p. 15. to 47. is
<q>to give a <hi>conciſe</hi> repreſentation of the doctrine of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes, together with ſome of the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, as held by proteſtant reformers.</q>
This tedious medly of inconſiſtencies and abſurdities, which you call a <hi>conciſe repreſentation,</hi> &amp;c. I take to be the marrow and quinteſſence of ſeveral of your old ſermons, reviſed and tranſcribed upon this occaſion. You appear in moſt parts of it to talk without any clear ideas; making as free with your Creator, almoſt, as if you was his equal, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended his nature as perfectly as he does himſelf. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this as your ſyſtem of divinity; and a greater piece of confuſion and impertinence I hardly ever ſaw. It is partly ſuch precious, ſublime jargon as the wild, rambling exhorters uſed to entertain the gaping rabble with, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years ago, when you was one of them. Only by being printed, it appears rather more ridiculous, than if it were fo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med out <hi>extempore.</hi> I ſhall not miſpend time by particularly expoſing it. I do not indeed deny, but that there are ſeveral important, well-known truths ſcattered here and there; as particularly when you ſay, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove, p. 21. that God <hi>cannot lie.</hi> And yet, I think, you have much more clearly demonſtrated in many places, <hi>who can,</hi> even without deſigning to make it appear. Whether you have, or have not done this, even in the next page, I leave you and others to conſider. Speaking there of me, you ſay,
<q>We may with greater propriety charge him with a <hi>robbing of God,</hi> of what he eſteems his glory —in <hi>excluding the attribute of divine juſtice.</hi>
               </q>
Now, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> what do you think of ſuch a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this? Did I not often ſpeak of juſtice, even punitive juſtice, as a part of God's moral character?—as a branch of his eſſential goodneſs, conſidered in connection with infinite wiſdom, a regard to right, fitneſs and propriety, &amp;c? Why then would you ſlander me thus, as if I <hi>excluded</hi> divine juſtice; eſpecially when I ſometimes ſpeak of it, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the common method, as a particular diſtinct attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009737_0022_0F7A4B4643369220"/>
of God? If you go on in this way, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> without repentance, I verily believe you will have reaſon to wiſh in earneſt, that God was not a <hi>juſt</hi> Being, either in your own ſenſe or mine—You have interlarded your afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſyſtem of divinity, with other groſs miſrepreſentations of me, and many rude aſperſions, by way of ſeaſoning; that it might go down the better. But I leave you to enjoy the credit of theſe; not thinking them worthy of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice.</p>
            <p>I PASS on to the 4th and laſt general head of your libel, which you expreſs thus, p. 47.
<q>To take notice of ſome of the Dr's inaccuracies and inconſiſtencies.</q>
I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve here, that your whole libel contains but 108 pages, 61 of which belong to this laſt head; in which you was to play the <hi>critic</hi> upon my inaccuracies, and ſhew your own wit and ſagacity. Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> I never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to much accuracy in writing; but, methinks, it is a little merry, that you, of all men, ſhould undertake to ſhew my inaccuracies. When or where did you learn this curious art of criticiſing?—in what <hi>college?</hi> in what <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity?</hi>—during the little time that you was <hi>permitted</hi> to continue at Yale-college?—Was you a <hi>freſhman</hi> or <hi>ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> or of what ſtanding was you, when you <hi>left</hi> that ſeat of the muſes? Tho' this was ſo early, yet what an <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> are you! But it muſt be obſerved, that <hi>nature</hi> had done a great deal for you, without <hi>art.</hi> For, I think, it will be apparent to any one, that your criticiſms actually proceeded from <hi>nature</hi>; I mean <hi>human nature</hi> as it is commonly repreſented—<hi>wholly evil and corrupt</hi>— To be ſerious; had you not expoſed yourſelf enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in quality of a theologian, and champion for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant faith in oppoſition to the <hi>injurious aſperſions</hi> caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by me, without pretending to ſet up for a critic too! Should you not at leaſt have learnt the difference between ruſtic impudence and wit, between lying and criticiſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you attempted to ſhew your talents in this way? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you did, or did not know theſe material differences, may appear to all who ſhall think it worth while to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your pretended criticiſms, with my ſermons. I am
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009737_0023_0F7A4B4717655D58"/>
far from deſigning a <hi>defence</hi> of them againſt you. I only mean to ſhame you, if poſſible, for your vanity and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by taking a curſory notice of ſome of your criticiſms. This being my chief aim, I ſhall ſcarce meddle with any of them, in which folly and ignorance bear the greater part; but almoſt intirely confine myſelf to thoſe of them, in which impudence and falſehood are the moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous. Some indeed may be briefly mentioned, in which it will not be eaſy to determine, whether the former or the latter are moſt prevalent.</p>
            <p>As to what you object concerning my uſing the terms <hi>attribute</hi> or <hi>property</hi> and <hi>quality,</hi> as ſynonymous; I ſhall only aſk you, What would be the material and preciſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between one perſon's ſaying of Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> that the <hi>attribute</hi> or <hi>property</hi> of ſelf-conceit is very conſpicuous in him, and another's ſaying that the <hi>quality</hi> of ſelf-conceit is ſo? Which of theſe would be the greateſt compliment, or the moſt <hi>accurate</hi> way of ſpeaking? In p. 48. you ſpeak of me as having repreſented God as
<q>a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi> being, made up of as many diſtinct ſelf-exiſtent qualities or <hi>parts,</hi> as he has divine attributes.</q>
Now what foundation had you for this, beſides a paſſage in which I expreſly ſpake of the <hi>impropriety</hi> of aſcribing <hi>parts</hi> to God? Speaking of goodneſs as an 'eſſential attribute' of God; I add, that it is
<q>no borrowed or precarious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as the goodneſs of men and angels is in them, but as neceſſary as his being. Indeed, one need not ſcruple to call it a <hi>part</hi> of God himſelf, only as there may be an <hi>impropriety in that manner of expreſſion concerning the infinite God, in</hi> ALL <hi>other reſpects in general</hi>
               </q>
—Serm. p. 12. Now, after this, what greater diſhoneſty or villainy could any <hi>Critic</hi> be guilty of, than you are, in making ſuch a buſtle as you do, for almoſt two pages together, about <hi>parts of God?</hi> And you have the inſolence to ſay, p. 49. —'ſee what an accurate and conſiſtent deſcription <hi>the Dr. 'gives</hi> of the One only living and true God. q. d.
<q>God is a <hi>compound</hi> being, made up of eternal, eſſential, and equally neceſſary, ſelf-exiſtent parts: And tho' theſe parts, &amp;c.</q>
Now, could you have given your readers ſuch a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009737_0024_0F7A4B47DC1E9FA8"/>
repreſentation of my doctrine, if you had underſtood the material diſtinction which I before mentioned to you; that between <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>criticiſing</hi>? If you take theſe for <hi>ſynonimous terms,</hi> I do not wonder that you think yourſelf a very maſterly <hi>critic.</hi> — Thus you father your own nonſenſe and impiety upon me; contrary to my expreſs, declared opinion.</p>
            <p>The next of your criticiſms which I ſhall take notice of, is this, That I ſometimes ſpeak of juſtice as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular moral attribute of God, diſtinct from goodneſs; and at other times ſpeak of it as one branch of his eſſential goodneſs. Your cavils about this, make ſo great a part of your libel, that there is no occaſion to refer to any particular place. I explained myſelf ſo far, reſpecting this matter, that no intelligent, candid perſon could miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my meaning. For it is evident that when I ſpake of juſtice in God, as diſtinct from goodneſs or benevolence in the common reſtrained ſenſe; I conſidered it as no otherwiſe diſtinct therefrom in him, than it is in a wiſe and good man, whether a parent or a prince. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſpeak of juſtice in man, as a moral virtue diſtinct from charity or love, which is frequently ſpoken of as another moral virtue. And yet it is certain that love or charity, conſidered in the largeſt, or moſt comprehenſive ſenſe of it, includes, not only juſtice, but all other moral and ſocial virtues. The apoſtle Paul often ſpeaks of charity in this comprehenſive ſenſe; but moſt expreſsly, Rom. XIII.8, 9. A paſſage, of which if you had had any tolerable underſtanding, you could ſurely never have cavilled in the manner you have done—
<q>Owe no man any thing, <hi>ſays he,</hi> but to love one another. For he that <hi>loveth</hi> another, hath <hi>fulfilled the law.</hi> For this, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet; and if there be any <hi>other commandment,</hi> it is briefly <hi>comprehended</hi> in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf.</q>
Pray, <hi>learned Sir,</hi> is not doing juſtice often ſpoken of as a particular moral virtue
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009737_0025_0F7A4B4881F5D8A8"/>
in ſcripture, as if it were in ſome ſort diſtinct from <hi>loving money,</hi> or from <hi>charity</hi>; and <hi>vice verſa</hi>? And yet does not the apoſtle here ſpeak of that commandment, <hi>loving our neighbours as our ſelves,</hi> as ſummarily <hi>comprehending</hi> all the commandments of the ſecond table? and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently juſtice? And are not chriſtian magiſtrates and parents bound, by that <hi>comprehenſive command</hi> which the apoſtle ſpeaks of, when underſtood in its proper extent, even to <hi>puniſh</hi> their ſubjects and children reſpectively, for the good of thoſe that do evil, or for the warning and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others? But your narrow, dark and groveling mind can perhaps have no conception of puniſhment proceeding from love, or from any thing beſides a ſpirit of revenge. Not that I by any means exclude the <hi>hatred</hi> of ſin or vice, as if it had not, or ought not to have any place in him that puniſhes it; whether it be God or man—All the nugatory, flimzy ratiotionations and criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms which you have adduced, reſpecting my ſometimes ſpeaking of juſtice as if it were a diſtinct moral attribute of God, and at other times of goodneſs as if it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended juſtice, and all divine moral attributes, would hold equally good againſt the apoſtle Paul's account of charity, and its various branches. When once you have enough of wiſdom, and of the ſpirit of chriſtianity, to conceive how <hi>love</hi> is the fulfilling of the law; or how all moral, ſocial virtues are ſummarily comprehended and enjoined in this ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf</hi>; you will no longer be at any loſs to underſtand what I mean, when I ſpeak of divine juſtice and divine goodneſs in the manner I do; nor be ſo captious as to object againſt it as an inaccuracy or inconſiſtency. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your criticiſms upon this head chiefly proceed from ignorance, or from malice and vanity, I will not pretend to determine: But, that there is a great deal of both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered therein, is undeniable. And you may if you pleaſe, in the next place try your critical ſkill upon the apoſtle Paul; and endeavour to ſhew that he did not underſtand himſelf, but wrote inaccurately and <hi>inconſiſtently</hi>—But I
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009737_0026_0F7A4B494B10C768"/>
forgot myſelf in what I have ſaid in this paragraph; by deſcending to reaſon with a man, whom I was only to reprove and chaſtize as a captious, conceited wrangler, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That you deſerve no better a character than this, is farther evident from what you offer page 50, 51. in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſhew me guilty of an inconſiſtency, becauſe, tho' I ſpoke of the goodneſs of God as infinite, "without meaſure, without bounds;" yet I afterwards ſpoke of it as <hi>directed, controuled</hi> and <hi>regulated</hi> by infinite <hi>wiſdom</hi> in all its operations; in oppoſition to its being
<q>a ſort of blind inſtinct, or good-nature, detached from reaſon and right, or a regard to fitneſs and propriety.</q>
With reference to which you ſay,
<q>What is controuled and regulated, I thought was <hi>bounded</hi> and <hi>limited!</hi>
               </q>
A great deal of the like <hi>critical</hi> ſtuff is in the pages aforeſaid. So that, in your ſage opinion, if the divine goodneſs is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, controuled and limited by infinite wiſdom in its operations; and always to be conſidered in connexion therewith, in oppoſition to its being a mere <hi>blind inſtinct,</hi> it muſt be <hi>bounded</hi> and <hi>limited,</hi> and therefore <hi>finite.</hi> And if you here mean any thing, in oppoſition to me, it muſt be this, that God cannot at once be infinite both in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs; for if infinite wiſdom regulates good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the latter, ſay you, muſt be 'bounded and limited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſame way of reaſoning, or rather of impious trifling, might be applied to the <hi>power</hi> of God. I ſuppoſe all are agreed in general, that the power of God is exerciſed according to, or regulated by his infinite wiſdom; not exerted at random. If ſo, according to you, great <hi>Critic!</hi> God's power cannot be infinite,
<q>without meaſure, without bounds:</q>
becauſe you <hi>always thought,</hi> that what is directed, controuled and regulated, even tho' it be only by <hi>infinite</hi> wiſdom, 'is bounded &amp; limited,' and therefore finite—What but the moſt ſtupid ignorance, or the blindeſt rage and malice, could lead you to <hi>critize</hi> in this manner? So deſirous are you to prove me guilty of <hi>inaccuracies</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtencies,</hi> that you will run yourſelf into atheiſm, or what is next akin to it, by denying, in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009737_0027_0F7A4B4A035EABC0"/>
effect, that God can be both infinitely wiſe and infinitely good!</p>
            <p>With the ſame <hi>pious</hi> intention doubtleſs it is, that you miſquote my words, p. 57. "That the truly great, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent end which a good God has in view," &amp;c. Theſe are none of my words, tho' you quote and comma them as if they were. You alſo miſquote me p.58. where ſpeaking of me, you ſay,—'He argues thus 'to prove punitive juſtice to be a branch of goodneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> "God's end muſt be either poſitively good, or poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bad; if it be the creatures happineſs, it is poſitively good; if it be the creatures miſery, it is poſitively bad and cruel," &amp;c. &amp;c.—Now tho' you mark theſe words as a quotation from me; I aſſert that they are none of mine. And in that paſſage in my ſermon, which comes the neareſt to them, (not very near) p 30. I was not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning punitive juſtice, as a branch of goodneſs; but of the almoſt infinite <hi>variety</hi> of God's works, or of the univerſe; and the end thereof—Why will you fib ſo, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland?</hi> You diſcover your diſhoneſty again, p. 60. where you ſay,
<q>Let us ſee how the Dr. <hi>reconciles</hi> God's leaving the heathen world to unavoidable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal miſery, with his being actually kind and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all.</q>
You then pretend to give my ſolution of this difficulty; adding with an unmannerly ſneer—
<q>A ſatisfactory anſwer this!</q>
—
<q>This is enough to ſatisfy ſome I trow!</q>
—But, you know, I did not allow the truth of the ſaid ſuppoſition about the heathen world; nor pretend to ſhew its conſiſtency with God's goodneſs to all. It was therefore knaviſh in you to give ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the matter, ſaving,
<q>Let us ſee how the Dr. <hi>reconciles,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
—But it ſeems almoſt as eaſy for the <hi>Aethiopian to change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots,</hi> as for you that have been ſo <hi>accuſtomed</hi> to miſrepreſentation and fibbing, to write, and repreſent things fairly. You are at your dirty work again, in ſeveral pages following; and particularly page 67. where you ſay,
<q>In p. 45 the Dr. preſumes to tell, how <hi>God</hi> BECAME <hi>infinitely, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009737_0028_0F7A4B4AE6E0F8F0"/>
good,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
This is another infamouſly falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. What I endeavoured to ſhew in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to which you refer, is not how God <hi>became</hi> infinitely wiſe or good; but, as it is there expreſſed, that
<q>God being ſuppoſed all-knowing, independent and almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the abſolute perfection of his goodneſs <hi>may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi> from hence, &amp;c.</q>
i. e. clearly <hi>argued</hi> or <hi>inferred.</hi> And I expreſly guarded againſt the impious ſuppoſition, that God is not <hi>eternally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> good. Now are you, or are you not an impudent ſlanderer, for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world, that I <hi>preſume to tell how God</hi> BECAME <hi>infinitely good,</hi> &amp;c. only becauſe I ſhewed an eternal, neceſſary <hi>connexion</hi> between omniſcience, independency, omnipotence and <hi>goodneſs</hi>? Is this criticizing or lying, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland?</hi> For once, let conſcience ſpeak.</p>
            <p>But I now proceed to take notice of a wonderful <hi>criticiſm</hi> indeed: I mean one of the moſt impudent, barefac'd and execrable pieces of <hi>forgery</hi> that, I believe, any man ever commited, without being pillor'd or cropp'd, or ſuffering ſome other infamous puniſhment; unleſs where proof of the fact was wanting, as it is not in the preſent caſe. You have pretended to cite from me, in the moſt formal manner, a long paſſage, part of three pages in your libel, not a ſingle compleat ſentence of which is mine. You have, indeed, taken two or three ſcraps of ſentences from my ſermons, here and there, at many pages diſtance; fill'd them up with your own nonſenſe and impiety; put all in ſuch an order as beſt ſuited your <hi>critical</hi> deſign, and palmed the whole upon the world as mine, without the leaſt diſtinction; I mean as my very words: And all this, in order to ſhew my <hi>inaccuracies</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtencies</hi>! For your utter confuſion, I ſhall now ſet this piece of wickedneſs in folio before your eyes, and the eyes of the world. Page 76 and onwards, you ſay thus, <hi>verbatim</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>But I muſt not paſs from this without taking ſome notice of the Dr's conſiſtency, or rather inconſiſtency: SAYS HE,
<q>A good God from his punitive juſtice, which
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009737_0029_0F7A4B4B8A070440"/>
is a branch of his goodneſs, may be obliged to puniſh tranſgreſſors, for the ſupport of order, right, &amp;c. or of the honour of God's violated commandments, and the dignity of his moral government—Chriſt ſuffered from punitive juſtice, and was numbered with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors (tho' he was without ſin, a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot, for he ſuffered the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt) when he made atonement by his blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſupported the honor of God's violated command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the dignity of his government, in ſuch ſort that guilty ſinners might be pardoned conſiſtently with the eternal rule of right; but tho' God may from punitive juſtice be obliged to puniſh ſinners for the ſupport of order, right, &amp;c. and when he puniſhed Chriſt, the juſt for the unjuſt, it was to ſupport the honor of his violated laws, and the dignity of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that guilty ſinners might be pardoned conſiſtently with the eternal rule of right: Yet Chriſt's ſufferings were without any kind of reference to divine juſtice to ſatisfy that, for this is abſolutely irreconcilable with Chriſt's dying the juſt for the unjuſt, as conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential to, and the effect of, God's love, mercy and grace,—And tho' punitive juſtice in God, regarding the eternal rule of right, and the ſupport of the honor and dignity of God's laws and moral government, in order that we guilty ſinners might be pardon'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently therewith; obliged God to lay on Chriſt the iniquities of us all, and to bruiſe the ſon of his love in our ſtead: Yet there was no abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt's atonement in reference to juſtice being ſatisfied thereby, ſuch idea of divine juſtice muſt be wholly and forever excluded; God might have forgiven the ſins of men without any ſacrifice intervening; indeed, it was <hi>rather</hi> the beſt and wiſeſt method to forgive the ſins of men, thro' the great ſacrifice of Chriſt's interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than without any. The eternal rule of right, and the honor and dignity of God's moral law and government are of ſo ſmall weight, that they did but
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009737_0030_0F7A4B4C36F62CD8"/>
juſt turn the ſcale in favour of an atonement to be made for ſin, by the ſacrifice of Chriſt: And tho' the reſult was, that Chriſt was to make an attonement by ſuffering the penalty of the law at the hands of puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice, yet this muſt be without any kind of reference to divine juſtice, to ſatisfy that.</q>
— O Doctor! can God the Judge all the earth, require an atonement to be made, if he is not offended? And can he be offended, and yet not juſtly offended?</q>
—</p>
            <p>O Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi>! can you read theſe laſt words of your own, without trembling? Do not your knees ſmite one againſt the other, when you reflect on your own falſehood and villainy, particularly in the pretended long citation from me, immediately foregoing? All that long paſſage, which I have here marked with double commas, is ſo marked, and ſtands exactly thus in your libel. It is alſo introduced by you in the moſt formal manner, as a quotation from me, with theſe words preceding, 'SAYS HE' — Nor is there the leaſt room to doubt, but that you intended your readers, who were unacquainted with me and my ſermons, ſhould believe you had extracted this paſſage from them, word for word. Muſt they not neceſſarily have ſuppoſed ſo, if they had been ſo credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as to think you a man of any truth, honor or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? And yet you know in your own conſcience, if you have any, that this is a piece of right down forgery; that not one intire ſentence of all this gallimafry or hotch potch, is mine. Is not the worſt ſort of lying and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that of writing, and publiſhing to the world known falſhoods, injurious to the reputation of another? It is well, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> if you have not, ſooner or later, great reaſon to wiſh, that you had never learnt even to <hi>write</hi>; in which caſe your guilt might probably have been leſs than it is. For you could not poſſibly have uſed me in ſo injurious a manner with your tongue, tho' <hi>ſet on fire of hell,</hi> and <hi>walking thro' the earth,</hi> as you have done by writing and publiſhing this libel; which may be diſperſed farther abroad than you might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009737_0031_0F7A4B4CF611B490"/>
to ramble in perſon, without being taken up, and <hi>receiving your due deſerts.</hi> I find, on this occaſion, a great ſtrife in my breaſt between indignation againſt, and pity for, a perſon ſo loſt to all ſenſe of honor, virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as to be capable of ſuch a piece of wickedneſs as this— Is it not as eaſy to prove one man as another guilty of inconſiſtencies, in your way? — a <hi>Newton, Locke, Clarke</hi> or <hi>Butler,</hi> as a <hi>Cleaveland!</hi> —</p>
            <p>Another inſtance of groſs prevarication, and even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs in you, I find p. 79, ſo ſoon after this. After quoting ſomething which I had ſaid concerning the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to his creatures in general, in puniſhing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men hereafter, by way of example and terror; you wickedly wreſt my words, as if I had ſaid, that he would therein be good and merciful even to thoſe whom he will <hi>deſtroy, ſoul and body in hell.</hi> For thus you expreſs yourſelf—
<q>I have no apprehenſion that <hi>tender mercy</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will manifeſt and exerciſe itſelf <hi>towards the wicked in their terrible puniſhment</hi> in the other world— How tender mercy <hi>to the miſerable</hi> is manifeſted, in making the miſerable <hi>as miſerable as they can be,</hi> by executing puniſhment upon <hi>them</hi> for their ſins — is beyond <hi>my apprehenſion!</hi> I believe, if the Dr. was to ſuffer the puniſhment of hell, he would have no diſcovery at all of the tender mercy of God <hi>towards him</hi> in ſuch a terrible puniſhment. I pray God that neither of us may ever know what that puniſhment is, by experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſame in the other world.</q>
P. 79, 80. Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> you know in your own ſoul, that you here pervert my words and meaning. And are you not aſhamed and afraid to trifle thus upon ſo tremendous a ſubject, in order to prove me guilty of an <hi>inaccuracy,</hi> or <hi>inconſiſtency?</hi> Do you really believe there is any hell for wicked men?—particularly a <hi>lake burning with fire and brimſtone,</hi> in which <hi>all liars are to have their part?</hi> If you do, it appears to me that you are chargeable with the worſt and moſt unaccountable kind of <hi>inconſiſtency,</hi> in miſ-repreſenting and falſifying my ſermons, in the manner you have done; and particularly as to this point —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:009737_0032_0F7A4B4DC9FB2530"/>But ſtill you go on to fib egregiouſly for many pages together, in order to ſhew me inconſiſtent with myſelf. I ſhall only glance at a few particulars more. You give a ſad example of <hi>the ſin that does ſo eaſily beſet you,</hi> p. 87. with reference to what I ſaid concerning an unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his commentary on my text. You there ſay,
<q>The Dr. places in the margin of p. 83 and 84 a paſſage of the learned Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reprobate, and ſays,</q>
               <q>That a <hi>certain</hi> decree of reprobation was the known opinion of that learned man</q>.
Theſe words are there marked by you with double commas, as if they were mine, tho' they are not. Upon which you immediately go on thus, 'And adds,
<q>A ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at once unſupported by reaſon or ſcripture; nay contrary to both,</q>
&amp;c. Theſe words are mine; but you here miſrepreſent me, as denying any '<hi>certain</hi> decree of reprobation'. This will appear to any one who conſults the paſſage, to which you refer. After quoting Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s words, I obſerved that they naturally import,
<q>That there are many perſons who, by a ſuppoſed eternal decree of reprobation, are <hi>abſolutely precluded from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of pardon,</hi> or <hi>the grace of God revealed to the world.</hi> This was the known opinion of that learned man: A ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, at once unſupported by reaſon or ſcripture</q>,
&amp;c. Now why could you not quote truly and fairly, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland?</hi> Can you give any other reaſon for it, than that it is more agreeable to your depraved mind to fib, cavil and miſrepreſent, than to ſpeak truth? You go on to exerciſe your talent, and to ſhew <hi>whoſe child</hi> you are, in the ſame page; where you ſay,— 'The Dr. <hi>ſtates</hi> the doctrine' (i. e. as you evidently mean, the <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of reprobation)
<q>in an objection; but diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſingenuous and abuſive in the manner of his <hi>ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it; and then vents his indignation againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</q>
&amp;c. Now it is falſe, that I <hi>ſtated</hi> either the ſcripture—or the <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> doctrine of reprobation, in the place to which you refer, Serm. p. 66. May not one ſpeak of the abſurd, impious notions which ſome perſons have of reprobation, but you muſt preſently take it to your ſelf, or ſay this was aimed againſt the <hi>Calviniſts?</hi> even
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009737_0033_0F7A4B4E782A1CE0"/>
tho' you deny they hold it in the manner expreſſed! Beſides; I did not ſay, that <hi>any</hi> actually held the impious doctrine, which I there ſpake of; tho', I believe, I might have truly done ſo. I ſpake with great caution, becauſe I would not needleſly give offence to any: Saying,—
<q>If any perſons <hi>really</hi> hold ſuch a doctrine</q>,
&amp;c. And even you, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> with all your uncommon ſtock of aſſurance, will not dare openly to aſſert the doctrine of reprobation, in the ſenſe there denied by me. Are you not then an inſolent caviller, to talk at the rate you do here? —I hope there are but few perſons in the world, who have ſuch ſtrong and ſad <hi>marks</hi> of reprobation upon them, as a certain man whom I could name to you; but one, to whom you are a great <hi>ſtranger,</hi> tho' it nearly concerns you to have an intimate <hi>acquaintance</hi> with him.—</p>
            <p>You go on miſrepreſenting and cavilling, till you come to p. 94. where you again miſquote me. You there ſay, 'And as the Dr. ſays,'
<q>God's knowledge (which formed his plan</q>)
—This is none of my expreſſion. So prone you are to <hi>leaſing,</hi> when you pretend to cite, that you will ſome times do it, even without having any occaſion for it: And what is this, but fibbing for fibbing's ſake? Will you never leave off this ſcurvy trick? You are at it again in the next page. You there repreſent me as ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 'the doctrine of original ſin', as <hi>the groſeſt of all abſurdities,</hi> &amp;c. Now you know, I ſaid not this of the <hi>doctrine of original ſin,</hi> but only of that unſcriptural opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that infants,—
<q>infants of <hi>a ſpan long,</hi> are juſtly liable to eternal torments</q>
—Do all that hold the doctrine of <hi>original ſin,</hi> hold this opinion alſo? If not, I could not be juſtly charged in general, with calling that doctrine <hi>the groſeſt of all abſurdities:</hi> or as ſpeaking of thoſe that maintain it, as <hi>perſons of a ſadly depraved judgment.</hi> I am ſorry if you have ſo little conſcience, as to feel no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe after ſuch baſe and diſingenuous conduct, to ſay the leaſt of it. You trifle and prevaricate ſhamefully again, p. 97. by applying what I ſaid ſo reſpectfully of thoſe, who have in ſome reſpects different conceptions from my own, about juſtice as a branch of goodneſs, and the atonement of Chriſt, to thoſe who hold that infants are
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009737_0034_0F7A4B4F62E83BC8"/>
juſtly liable to eternal torments: This you do, in order to ſhew an inconſiſtency in me. You captiouſly and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent what I ſay upon theſe different points, thus— "He has a high veneration for many of Us, <hi>as wiſe and excellent</hi> men, <hi>that are to be pitied as perſons of a ſadly depraved judgment."—Many of</hi> US!—to be ſure, US, if wiſe and excellent men are ſpoken of! Many ſuch I know, but who art thou, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland?</hi> Do you think this diſcovers your ſagacity or your impudence?—What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others are, yet that you are a perſon, not only of a ſadly depraved <hi>judgment,</hi> but heart alſo, is very manifeſt: And if you <hi>excel</hi> in any thing, it is in what all wiſe and good men of every denomination, greatly deteſt and abhor.</p>
            <p>I muſt next rebuke you for your irreverence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanity in ſpeaking of the great God. p. 101. You there ſay,
<q>Why may'nt the judgment of God—be a juſt and righteous judgment? The Dr. will not ſay, it was the effect of <hi>a ſadly depraved judgment</hi> in the Almighty!</q>
I take no notice of the <hi>nonſenſe</hi> of this; (that being ſo common with you, and your libel ſo much below criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm): But you are very culpable for your impiety in ſpeaking of the ALMIGHTY in this light, fleering, flouting manner: Shewing a want of due reverence to him, as well as of all decorum and good manners in your treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me. Rudeneſs and inſolence towards man, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> tho' inexcuſeable, are harmleſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of impiety to God. I fear you have forgotten, or never learnt the third commandment. I therefore adviſe you to think ſeriouſly of, and to remember it. Men of your ſtamp, are generally much too free with their Maker.</p>
            <p>You are guilty of another falſehood, at leaſt an implicit one, when ſpeaking of original ſin, you ſay, p. 101. 'Hence the Dr. does not <hi>ſtate</hi> the doctrine right, when 'he ſays, "without any offence of their own". You know I neither <hi>ſtated,</hi> nor attempted to <hi>ſtate</hi> that doctrine; tho' I mentioned what I take to be one great error rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereto; <hi>viz.</hi> that infants, before actual ſin, are juſtly liable to eternal torments. And you doubtleſs deſigned to impoſe upon your readers, by ſpeaking of my <hi>ſtating</hi> the doctrine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:009737_0035_0F7A4B4FF53A9A28"/>Thus I have produced a ſpecimen of your way of criticiſing. I have let paſs innumerable ſcurrilous reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as ſenſeleſs remarks on my ſermons; ſcarce taking notice of any thing in your libel, but what betrays the falſehood and wickedneſs of your heart. Mere non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and abſurdity I can overlook in <hi>you;</hi> but for your diſhoneſty you ought to be rebuked, and that <hi>before all;</hi> becauſe your ſin, in this reſpect, is public; you have <hi>proclaimed</hi> it yourſelf. However, before I proceed to adminiſter the more general correction which I intend for you. I muſt take notice of one very ſingular piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence in your 104th page. After ſo much falſehood and forgery, abuſe and calumny, you have the front to give me a caution, not to <hi>throw dirt at you.</hi>—
<q>If the Dr. ſhall think proper to make any reply</q>,
&amp;c —it is juſtly
<q>expected, that he will not debaſe his noble powers, <hi>by raking together, and throwing dirt</hi>
               </q>
—What matchleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence is this! Whether you ſpeak of my 'noble pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers', by way of irony, as I conclude from the whole tenor of your libel, or by way of compliment, is a matter of great indifference to me. I equally deſpiſe your clowniſh, unmannerly ſneers and ſcoffs, and your pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks. Or rather, the compliments of ſo inſignificant, falſe a perſon, as you appear to be by this libel, would be more nauſeous and diſhonourable to me than your fouleſt invectives; which are, in one reſpect, the higheſt encomiums that you can beſtow. And yet, for your own ſake, I am ſorry you ſhould diſcover ſo much inſolence, and cauſeleſs virulence againſt me, (to crown all the reſt) as to caution me againſt throwing <hi>dirt</hi> at you. You was doubtleſs conſcious, that you deſerved a ſevere chaſtiſement. But know, unhappy, ſhameleſs man! that to adminiſter proper reproof and correction to ſuch an one as thou art, is not throwing dirt! And tho' the chaſtizing a <hi>Therſites</hi> is not thought a matter of much glory; yet it has ever been accounted a uſeful ſervice to the public at leaſt, if not eventually to the brawling, wrangling wretch himſelf, who is the ſubject of the diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> your guilt is really great, very great; and it's proper you ſhould be made ſenſible of it. What
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009737_0036_0F7A4B50C6DD1480"/>
is the ground of your public quarrel againſt me? Does it really amount to any thing more than this? I think divine juſtice is comprehended in divine goodneſs, in a way analogous to that in which juſtice, and all other ſocial vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are comprehended in the love of our neighbour: you think it is not. I think God forgives the ſins of men, thro' the atonement of Chriſt, becauſe this was wiſeſt and beſt; what moſt became a God of infinite wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: you ſeem to think otherwiſe. I do not think God has decreed to damn men, but for their unrepented ſins; neither dare you aſſert that he has, tho' you have reviled me with reference to this matter. I do not think it conſiſtent with juſtice to make infants eternally miſerable, ſolely on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the firſt tranſgreſſion: you think it is. This is the ſum of the matter. And do you, can you ſuppoſe my ſentiments in theſe reſpects, as expreſſed in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, a ſufficient foundation for repreſenting me to the world as an enemy to ſome of the <hi>moſt important</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the chriſtian religion!—Or can it be a credit to any religion, to repreſent it as <hi>mainly</hi> founded on ſuch principles as I denied! You reproach chriſtianity by doing ſo, whatever you may imagine.</p>
            <p>Beſides; if I was erroneous in any of theſe reſpects; yet how unwarrantable a method have you taken? In your very firſt page, the civil epithets you give me, are, 'bold and dogmatical'—And are not palpable falſehoods, miſquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and forgeries, in order to give the world an ill opinion of the principles, and to hurt the reputation of any one, very heinous ſins? You and I, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> know very well who has done theſe things—Is not a good name rather to be choſen than great riches? If ſo, your endeavouring, by repeated falſehoods proved upon you, and the moſt vile arts, to repreſent me to the world as an impious fool and madman, is certainly a much more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſin, than to have ſtolen a great treaſure from me, or taken it from me on the high-way. I really think the ſin you have been guilty of, in writing and publiſhing this libel, far greater than either of theſe, or to have burnt my houſe, would have been. Nor have I reaſon to think, you would refrain from doing me any kind of miſchief
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009737_0037_0F7A4B5181321F30"/>
in your power, unleſs more reſtrained by <hi>ſomething elſe,</hi> than either by the fear of God, or a principle of juſtice— The injury would have been great, in my opinion, if you had palmed upon the world any thing of <hi>your</hi> own writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>mine,</hi> even tho' you had done your <hi>beſt:</hi> What is it then, to palm upon it, as mine, what you wrote when you did your <hi>worſt;</hi> crowding together as much folly, contradiction and impiety, as even you could get into ſo narrow a compaſs! This is what you have done, more eſpecially in that long piece of forgery beginning p. 76 of your libel. Now ſuppoſe any ſhould be ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my principles, and ſo ignorant of you, as to think you fair and honeſt in your citations, and in the repreſentations you have given of my ſermons; as poſſibly ſome may be: What opinion muſt they have of me?— Such an one, do you imagine, as they would have from reading thoſe ſermons themſelves?—How would you like, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> to be treated in this manner yourſelf?— Make the caſe your own.—If your conſcience is not ſcared as with an hot iron, you muſt feel great anguiſh therein: Or if that is paſt feeling, ſtill your anxiety muſt be great, unleſs you are alſo loſt to all ſenſe of ſhame, and regard for your reputation.</p>
            <p>You undoubtedly ſinned againſt <hi>light.</hi> For you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge p. 8. (perhaps inadvertently, but certainly unluckily for you) that '<hi>lying</hi> and <hi>unfaithfulneſs</hi> are as really <hi>moral evils,</hi> as unkindneſs or unmercifulneſs.'—How then could you miſrepreſent and falſify my ſermons ſo notoriouſly; at once abuſing me and the world, after ſuch a conceſſion as this! Is it becauſe you think lightly of <hi>moral evils</hi>; or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the practice of them conſiſtent with a <hi>ſtate of grace?</hi> and that your <hi>orthodoxy</hi> will cover all?—But if ſuch things are really <hi>moral evils</hi> even you muſt own, it is RATHER <hi>beſt of the two,</hi> that men ſhould abſtain from them; even tho' you ſhould ſuppoſe it <hi>not abſolutely neceſſary</hi> in order to ſalvation. I do not pretend exactly to know your ſentiments upon theſe points: But if <hi>the eternal rule of right, and God's moral law and government are of ſo ſmall weight, that they do but juſt turn the ſcale</hi> in favour of truth and integrity, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009737_0038_0F7A4B53A1355BA8"/>
to <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>unfaithfulneſs;</hi> yet ſince they actually <hi>turn</hi> it, I ſee not but that you muſt be ſelf-condemned upon your own principles. And whereas you ſay, that theſe are as certainly moral evils, as <hi>unkindneſs</hi> or <hi>unmercifulneſs</hi>; I muſt remind you, that if you are guilty of the former, you are certainly guilty of the latter alſo. For what could be more <hi>unkind</hi> or <hi>unmerciful</hi> in you, than to father your own nonſenſe and impiety upon me!—And this, not when you did your beſt, but worſt! How unmerciful, as well as falſe and perfidious was this, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are the more inexcuſeable for this outrageous aſſault upon me, becauſe of the cautious manner in which I expreſſed myſelf as to divine juſtice and goodneſs, and the atonement; (which are the chief ground of your quarrel.) Speaking of divine juſtice as included in goodneſs, and of my intention briefly to explain my-ſelf on that point, I ſaid,
<q>This I would do, at once with all reverence to God, and with <hi>all due reſpect to thoſe who have different conceptions of the matter,</hi>
               </q>
Serm. p. 20. Again, p. 24.
<q>From whence, I think, (tho' it doth not become a mortal man to ſpeak <hi>confidently</hi> in ſuch caſes) that it follows, That there is not really in the great and glorious God, any <hi>ſuch diſtinction</hi> betwixt goodneſs and juſtice, as has been objected againſt.</q>
Again, referring to the ſame point, and to what I had been briefly ſaying about atonement, it is ſubjoined—
<q>Tho' by the way, theſe things are not ſaid by me, but with an high veneration for thoſe many wiſe and excellent men, who either have, or ſeem to have, different conceptions of this matter.</q>
p. 65. Was not this peaceable, modeſt and candid; tho' you may call it 'bold and dogmatical'? Had I not a right to ſpeak my ſentiments upon theſe points? If you diſliked them, could you not content yourſelf with preaching your own? Or if you muſt needs publiſh them; would it not have been more decent and expedient for you to do it, without engaging in a perſonal controverſy with me? Would not any valuable end which you could propoſe to yourſelf, have been anſwered as well, tho' you had never mentioned my name? There was, as I am well informed, but one copy of my ſermons in your pariſh; and that in <hi>ſuch hands,</hi> that there was no danger of its being lent about
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009737_0039_0F7A4B53B90B60D8"/>
to <hi>corrupt</hi> your pariſhioners—Or if you thought the <hi>care of all theſe churches was upon you</hi>; and that it was incumbent on <hi>you,</hi> I ſay, upon <hi>you!</hi> to ſtand up in defence of <hi>the moſt important</hi> principles of religion againſt me, (while
<q>our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>indiſputable ability</hi>
               </q>
were ſilent) ſhould you not at leaſt have paid a ſtrict regard to <hi>truth, decency</hi> and <hi>moral honeſty?</hi>—</p>
            <p>Moreover: this furious attack appears to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from <hi>malice prepenſe:</hi> it was a deliberate piece of wickedneſs. Your libel, by the many references, quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, miſquotations, and ſtudied perverſions which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſhews a great deal of malicious <hi>pains</hi> in the author; and, as confuſed and immethodical as the compoſition is, (I ſcarce ever ſaw one more ſo) I conjecture it muſt have employed a perſon of your abilities near <hi>half a year</hi> in the writing. And even after it was finiſhed, it lay by ſeveral months, before you could get either man or angel to help this <hi>lame</hi> offspring of your brain into the <hi>pool,</hi> I mean the <hi>preſs;</hi> there having been, as I am informed, but one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber for your libel in Boſton. Here you had time for recollection: And this want of ſubſcribers was an hint to you, tho' you would not take it, to deſiſt from your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purpoſe; as it ſhew'd that you had not the public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Beſides: there were extracts from my ſermons publiſhed in the ſame paper with your <hi>propoſals;</hi> plainly ſhewing the iniquity of your undertaking, as to the main point—But perſiſt you would and did; even tho' you was forced to come under obligation <hi>yourſelf,</hi> to take off about half the whole impreſſion, (for want of ſubſcribers) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you could perſwade the printer to undertake this dirty job. A charge which, I ſuppoſe, you was ill able to bear; tho' poſſibly your <hi>prudent</hi> intention was, to ſell theſe copies to your pariſhoners at a <hi>moderate advance;</hi> I know not— In the mean time, it is ſaid, you took a journey of more than 200 miles, into <hi>Connecticut,</hi> in order to get a <hi>degree</hi> from that College, in which, for ſome nameleſs reaſons, it was thought <hi>improper for you to ſtay the uſual time;</hi>—that you might gratify your vanity, and recommend your libel, by annexing A. M. to your name. But failing in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, you was reſolved to go on, and take your revenge,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009737_0040_0F7A4B5493235A60"/>
by adding <hi>three</hi> letters to your name (V. D. M.) inſtead of <hi>two</hi>; which might anſwer the end as well, perhaps, with moſt of your readers. And indeed, I muſt own, there are ſome <hi>Arts,</hi> of which you have ſhewn yourſelf an undoubted <hi>Maſter</hi> in this performance, without a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>; tho' ſuch <hi>Arts</hi> as entitle a man much leſs to <hi>aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical</hi> honors, in my opinion, than to ſomething which I ſhall not mention—But not to digreſs farther; all theſe things ſhew, how deliberate and reſolute you have been in the perpetration of this piece of wickedneſs; which is a great aggravation of it.</p>
            <p>I may take the hint of another aggravation, from the three great <hi>Capitals</hi> aforeſaid, annexed to your Name, with the following title, <hi>Paſtor of a church</hi>—Such groſs falſhoods, miſrepreſentations and forgeries as your libel contains, would have been highly criminal in any man; But, in a pretended miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe mouth there was no guile;—in a man, who ſhould not only preach truth and righteouſneſs, but be an example thereof to others;—in one who pretends to extraordinary zeal and ſanctity;—an uncommon concern for the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of religion;—in one who, in his firſt page, expreſſed his apprehenſion that my doctrine was
<q>not only ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the <hi>orthodox faith,</hi> but even of <hi>morality,</hi> or <hi>true virtue</hi>;</q>
—in ſuch a man, I ſay, this conduct is ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, impudent and abominable, that words are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to expreſs the foulneſs and infamy of it! Biſhop <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon,</hi> whom you doubtleſs think a grand heretic, ſpeaks of ſome perſons who have got <hi>a ſcurvy trick of lying for the truth.</hi> And if the truth of God will <hi>the more abound thro' any man's lies,</hi> I will not deny but that you, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> may prove a very eminent inſtrument of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting it— But can you think it proper to oppoſe thoſe whom you think hereticks, by ſuch wicked arts as you have uſed? Is orthodoxy, ſuppoſing you to be in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, to be defended and propagated by defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſlander and forgery? Have theſe methods any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to put ſuppoſed <hi>Arminians</hi> out of countenance?
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009737_0041_0F7A4B55367D5740"/>
or are they any credit to the cauſe in which they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed? Does it not ſhew the moſt conſummate effrontery, impiety and hypocriſy, for any one who ſets himſelf up as a zealous champion for the cauſe of God and his truth; and pretends a great concern for the ſalvation of precious, immortal ſouls, to be ſo regardleſs of <hi>his own,</hi> as to do ſuch things under the cloak of religion, as a common hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then would bluſh at? Let me tell you plainly, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> I had much rather my ſoul ſhould be in a pagan's ſoul's ſtead (even a very immoral one's) than in your's, if you allow yourſelf in ſuch wicked practices in other reſpects, as I have proved you guilty of in this, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all your ſuppoſed orthodoxy, goſpel-light, or any <hi>other light.</hi> It will doubtleſs be more intolerable in the day of judgment, for thoſe who live and die <hi>with a</hi> LIE <hi>in their right hand,</hi> under the goſpel-diſpenſation, than for wicked heathen. I hope this will not be the caſe with you. I do not deſpair of you: For I am told, one excuſe you made to the printer for not coming ſeaſonably to take off the copies of your libel, which you ſtood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for, was, that many people in your pariſh were under great ſpiritual awakenings; ſo that you was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to attend upon, adviſe and comfort them. It may therefore be hoped, that it will ſoon be <hi>your own turn</hi> to be awakened, convinced and brought to repentance. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with perſons under great concern of ſoul, and deep impreſſions of the evil and danger of ſin, may, by the bleſſing of God, be one means of bringing you to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe of your own ſins, in ſo ſlandering and abuſing me; and when you are a true penitent yourſelf, you will doubtleſs be better qualified to comfort and <hi>ſtrengthen your brethren.</hi>—I do not condemn you as a wicked man on account of your <hi>opinions,</hi> though I think ſome of them very abſurd; nor preſume to judge your heart, in a way unauthorized by ſcripture, as many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your ſtamp uſed to do ſome years ago. No! In whatever I ſay of you, I obſerve the rule—'By their fruits ye ſhall know them.' You came among us in <hi>ſheep</hi>'s
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009737_0042_0F7A4B58D1EED200"/>
cloathing; which being turned a little on one ſide, no ſheep, but a ravenous animal is ſeen under it. I have plucked and examined ſome of the fruit which you bear; and found it to be corrupt and evil—ſour grapes: What then muſt the <hi>tree,</hi> what the <hi>vine</hi> be? When the grapes are grapes of <hi>gall,</hi> and the cluſters ſo <hi>bitter</hi>; probably the vine is of the vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and of the fields of <hi>Gomorrha</hi>—</p>
            <p>You are in the opinion of many people, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſeable in writing and publiſhing ſuch a wicked libel againſt me, on account of the <hi>time when it was done</hi> — when I was engaged in a public controverſy of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the churches of New-England, as well as to the American heathen, and thoſe Britiſh colonies which are almoſt deſtitute of the adminiſtration of God's word, worſhip and ſacraments: and when I was employing my mean abilities to the utmoſt, to ſerve them—A work which I was repeatedly ſolicited to engage in by ſeveral Divines of the firſt reputation among us, ſome years before that incident took place, which finally determined me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. At this very time, you was planning or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing miſchief againſt me, as an enemy to the <hi>moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant principles</hi> of the proteſtant religion; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not only to theſe churches, but to chriſtianity itſelf! You have joined your ſlanders to thoſe of my anonymous <hi>epiſcopal</hi> defamers; you have brought the like accuſation againſt me, and made uſe of the like diſhoneſt arts to hurt my reputation. By publiſhing your libel at ſuch a time, you have, to the utmoſt of <hi>your power,</hi> defeated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of my writing on the ſubject before referred to; and thereby diſſerved, as far as your influence reaches, the good cauſe I was labouring to promote; in which you was alſo intereſted yourſelf. Some, I know, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>epiſcopal influence</hi> had a ſhare in bringing out your ſcandalous pamphlet at this time; and that either you, or thoſe with whom you have <hi>cloſe connexions,</hi> have been tampered with, ſet on, and encouraged in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this wicked deſign. I particularly remember
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009737_0043_0F7A4B5A64366E78"/>
that in one of the many libels publiſhed againſt me <hi>by that party,</hi> there is ſomething ſaid about you and your then propoſed pamphlet, apparently with this view.—And what reward do you expect from that quarter, for this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attack upon me?—Perhaps to be made a BISHOP <hi>in America!</hi>—</p>
            <p>If you ſuppoſe you are likely to gain any credit with 'our Divines of indiſputable ability,' by this wicked piece of work; I have good reaſon to think the contrary. Some of them, (<hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Divines) have ſpoken of you and your libel to me, with great contempt and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and ſeem'd quite aſtoniſh'd at your aſſurance in ſetting up for an author; but more eſpecially at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous arts which you had uſed to injure my reputation. Some of them ſaid, they did not own <hi>you</hi> nor <hi>your ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy.</hi> Even your Rev. friend (or patron, ſhall I call him?) in Boſton, who corrected the preſs for you; a gentleman who has finallized his zeal againſt ſome mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters accuſed of <hi>arminianiſm</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who has encouraged the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of counſels againſt them, and had a principal hand in their eccleſiaſtical <hi>death</hi>; and, let me add, who has more than once, in a pretty public manner, diſcovered his particular ſpleen againſt me; even this Rev'd gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I ſay, was ſomething ſhock'd at your unfairneſs at leaſt, before your libel got through the preſs; when he came to perceive how groſly you had miſrepreſented and falſified my ſermons; particularly in that moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance which has been taken notice of—Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a more delicate conſcience, or nicer ſenſe of honor, would probably have had nothing to do with you or your libel, after ſuch a diſcovery as this; but immediately put the affair out of their hands, leſt they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>acceſſaries.</hi> This Rev'd gentleman, however, went on with the <hi>honourable</hi> employment which you had aſſigned him; not having, as I am informed, either ſo much concern for his own reputation, or ſo much real friendſhip for you, as to ſend you word what he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in order to prevent the diſgrace that was likely
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009737_0044_0F7A4B5AD4CCB8E8"/>
to come upon <hi>you</hi>—But, that even this warm gentleman is now no advocate for your libel, or the moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles of it, I can aſſure you upon good grounds. —Judge then, what Credit you are likely to gain among people in general, clergy and laiety; whether they do, or do not agree with me in certain points of doctrine.— The zealous gentleman, to whom I referred, who has ſuch a thirſt for <hi>unorthodox blood,</hi> (I do not mean literally) would doubtleſs have highly extolled your performance, it being <hi>againſt me,</hi> had it been but <hi>tolerable</hi>; but it was too groſs an abuſe to go down even with him!—So that I do not think you will, on account of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> very ſpeedily have a call to preach the Convention-ſermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'our Divines of indiſputable ability;' as you very probably expected: For I know not what a man of your conſummate vanity, may not be ſuppoſed to flatter himſelf with the hopes of!</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, it is the opinion of many, that you had not the <hi>principal</hi> hand in compoſing the libel to which your name is prefixed. Many ſuppoſe it to be <hi>chiefly</hi> the work of a certain lay-gentleman, unhappily bewilder'd for many years paſt, with law, military affairs, polemic divinity, metaphyſicks, ſuperſtition, politics and <hi>platform,</hi> all crowding on his brain at once! — a man of a wily, jeſuitical head and heart, at leaſt <hi>in ſome reſpects</hi>;— full of whimſical deſigns and notions; and one who, to all his other unaccountable fancies, it is ſaid, has added this ſtrangeſt of all deluſions, That he is an <hi>eminent ſaint,</hi> and that the churches of this country ſtand in great need of ſuch an able pilot as himſelf, to ſteer them a right courſe!—It is known that, as diſtinguiſhed and <hi>candid</hi> a <hi>writer</hi> as he has been <hi>againſt miniſters,</hi> he labours under ſome <hi>ſmall</hi> inconveniences as an author, never having learnt to <hi>ſpell</hi>; much leſs to put any thing into tolerable method —Now it is ſuppoſed by ſome, that this truly extraordinary perſon, not being able to <hi>contain himſelf,</hi> and yet labouring under the <hi>trivial</hi> diſadvantages afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, put his written, but unſpelt, unconnected lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009737_0045_0F7A4B5B8CADCDC8"/>
into your <hi>learned</hi> hands, to have thoſe defects ſupplied: In conſequence of which, and ſome additional ſtrokes of your own, they appear to the world in ſuch a wonderful order and method as is obſerved in the libel; it having been previouſly agreed that, as the reward of your pains, you ſhould have the <hi>whole honour</hi> of being the author of it. — No ſmall piece of ſelf-denial, to be ſure, to the ſaid original draughts-man! This may be all mere conjecture, for any thing that I know; but ſome are confident it is not. And one thing that affords ground of ſuſpicion, is, that the ſaid <hi>modeſt</hi> perſon extols the libel much more highly than it is ſuppoſed, he would extol any man's performance, <hi>except his own.</hi> Now, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> if you have really been led into ſuch a <hi>premunire</hi>; if you have been made what the vulgar call a <hi>cat's-paw,</hi> and perſuaded to father the <hi>ill-favoured, ſinful</hi> child which you did not beget, but only foſtered; it may perhaps be moſt for your honor to confeſs the truth, and to bring out this whole piece of roguery. And if you ſhould do ſo, you may be ſure of one advantage on your ſide; I mean, that tho' you are not better than you ſhould be, yet one will, on this occaſion, apply to you the old proverb, <hi>That the</hi> WORST KNAVE <hi>has turned King's evidence.</hi> But at preſent I muſt take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the libel is your's; ſince you declare it to be ſo. It is upon ſuppoſition that you ſpake the truth <hi>in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi> that I have proceeded in the reproof already given you. If I have not handled you very tenderly, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately, it was only becauſe your caſe required ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity: You appear not a little <hi>hardened.</hi> Tho' I abhor falſehood and villainy, and have been treated ſo injuriouſly by you; yet I would not have you imagine, that my reproofs proceed from a ſpirit of malice, or unchriſtian <hi>revenge.</hi> According to my principles, you know, chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizement ſhould always have <hi>good</hi> for its propoſed end, either private or public, or both. And altho' that which I have adminiſtred to you, may and muſt make you <hi>ſmart</hi> for a while, unleſs you are paſt <hi>feeling</hi>; yet, to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009737_0046_0F7A4B5BF641C158"/>
convince you and the world, that I charitably intend it for your real benefit, I will now cloſe this <hi>epiſtle</hi> (which you may poſſibly think ſomewhat <hi>tedious</hi>) with a few friendly and ſalutary pieces of advice.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I adviſe you to humble yourſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore almighty God; and to implore his forgiveneſs thro' that <hi>atonement,</hi> of which you have ſo wickedly repreſented me as an <hi>injurious aſperſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, I counſel you to acknowledge your ſin to the world; by publiſhing an ample confeſſion of the injuſtice you have done me, in the news-papers, or otherwiſe; and thereby giving me reaſonable ſatisfaction —It is my preſent determination never ſo much as to <hi>read</hi> any thing which you may publiſh hereafter, unleſs it is written in the <hi>penitential way,</hi> now recommended to you—After having ſhewn the world the falſehood and villainy of your <hi>firſt Eſſay,</hi> I ſhall think my own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intirely unconcerned in any thing you may hereafter ſay of me or my principles—</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I adviſe you to be diligent in your ſtudies, and to take pains in compoſing your ſermons; that there may be both uſeful matter and method in them;—inſtead of preaching in that flaſhy, rambling and incoherent way, that I underſtand you do; and for which our other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>exhorters</hi> have been ſo famous—Alas! how much precious time did you miſpend in writing your libel! All which time, the poor people of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> I believe, fared miſerably enough.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Whatever you do, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> beware of mixing <hi>metaphyſics</hi> with your divinity. Your libel ſhews that your head is almoſt turned therewith already; which is the occaſion of my giving you this caution. Preach the plain, indiſputable doctrines and duties of the goſpel, in a plain, familiar way. Do not exerciſe yourſelf in things <hi>too high for you:</hi> Aim at no great refinements, or very nice diſtinctions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Meddle as little as poſſible with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, controverſial points; for which, I perceive, you have a huge appetite, without a digeſtion anſwerable
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009737_0047_0F7A4B5CB8EBBF30"/>
thereto. Your head, if not your heart, is already much affected and hurt thereby; and the conſequence of your going on in this way, may be right down phrenzy!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Avoid all cenſoriouſneſs; all raſh judging and condemning of others, whoſe religious opinions are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from yours. Preach your own ſentiments honeſtly; but you ſhould not repreſent all thoſe who diſlike them, as graceleſs, unconverted men; and enemies to the <hi>moſt important</hi> doctrines of chriſtianity. A moſt fundamental principle of true <hi>proteſtantiſm,</hi> (for which you would be thought an advocate) is, that the holy ſcriptures are a ſufficient, and the only rule of Chriſtian faith; and that all Chriſtians have a right to judge of the ſenſe of ſcripture for themſelves. In this imperfect ſtate there will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably be ſome conſiderable diverſity of opinion, even among wiſe and good men; among true Chriſtians and true Proteſtants; and, perhaps, ſtill more diverſity in their manner of expreſſing themſelves upon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular points, than in their ſentiments. You ſhould not expect to bring all men to think and expreſs themſelves juſt as you do, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi>; much leſs pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with, miſrepreſent, abuſe and defame them, if they do not. Even <hi>Calviniſts</hi> differ very conſiderably among themſelves; as appears particularly by what I cited to you from Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> relative to <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould exerciſe forbearance and candor towards each other; and Chriſtian miniſters (of whom, it ſeems, you reckon yourſelf one) ought to ſet the example.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more unbecoming a miniſter of the goſpel, Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> than a narrow and cenſorious, a captious and wrangling diſpoſition: And they, in whom this evil temper prevails, generally promote it among their hearers; inſpiring them with antichriſtian rage and bitterneſs againſt their fellow-chriſtians, inſtead of the meek, benign and charitable ſpirit of the goſpel. I hope you will beware of this bad Spirit for the future.</p>
            <p>If you put theſe counſels in practice, I am perſuaded it will turn to good account;—much better than for
