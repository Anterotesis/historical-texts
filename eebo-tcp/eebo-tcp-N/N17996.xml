            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſeparation of the diſtrict of Maine from the preſent government of Maſſachuſetts was a ſubject, which, from the year 1785 to the year 1788, occupied much of the publick attention. A buſineſs of ſo much import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and pregnant with ſo many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to that part of the country which we inhabit, ought not to ſink into oblivion. During the time comprehended in the abovementioned periods, it went through a fair and general diſcuſſion. Beſides the candid examination of it in the public newſpapers, the Portland Convention, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of delegates from a reſpectable number of towns in the diſtrict, gave the ſubject its due conſideration. A very large majority of that Convention, after a lengthy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate enquiry into the ſtate of the diſtrict, and its rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſituation with the Commmonwealth at large, deemed it expedient and neceſſary for us to become a ſeparate gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. To carry this determination into effect, they choſe a commitee to draft and prefer to the General Court, a dutiful and reſpectful Addreſs, ſtating their wiſhes to be diſmembered from the weſtern part of the Commonwealth, their reaſons for wiſhing to be thus diſmembered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting their concurrence therein. This addreſs would undoubtedly have produced a final deciſion of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023313_0004_0FBF02A8295B99C8"/>
upon the queſtion, had not the very particular and diſtreſſed ſituation of the government, at the time it was preſented, abſorbed every other publick conſideration.— This time happenned to be immediately ſubſequent to the late unhappy inſurrections. While the diſordered ſtate of the government continued, the attention of the Legiſlature could not with propriety have been called to the ſubject; and thus the whole buſineſs fell aſleep, and remained un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>attended to, and almoſt unthought of, till the ſeſſion the General Court held in Jannuary, 1791.</p>
            <p>So far as the ſentiments of the people could be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by repeatedly converſing with the principal men in moſt of the populous towns in the diſtrict, or by their delegates to the Portland Convention, there is reaſon to conclude, that, in the year 1787, a government in this territory would have been agreeable to a majority of its inhabitants. But many reaſons which did not then exiſt, now operate to render ſuch an event extremely deſirable. The adoption, and firm eſtabliſhment of the conſtitution of the United States, is one of the firſt. The ſeveral objects of legiſlation which are the moſt difficult to manage, are, by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, taken out of the hands of the ſtate governments; and referred to the Legiſlature of the Union. This muſt be conſidered as a great relief to thoſe, whoſe lot it may be to adminiſter a government, without the neceſſary experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The intricate and important buſineſs of finance, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and collecting duties, impoſts and exciſes, regulating commerce with foreign nations and the ſeveral States, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring war, raiſing armies and navies, and making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their ſupport, and rules for their government, together with other concerns of ſuch a nature, are truſts which will not hereafter devolve upon thoſe who are called to adminiſter the State governments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:023313_0005_0FBF02ABD8E25C80"/>To this I might add many others of great weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to convince ſuch as were formerly in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe, that the preſent time affords the golden oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to revive the important work of eſtabliſhing a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in the diſtrict of Maine. But theſe will, with greater propriety, come under conſideration hereafter.</p>
            <p>In order to conſider this ſubject clearly, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To enumerate, and enlarge upon, the advantages which will accrue to the citizens of this diſtrict, by a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Maſſachuſetts, and an admiſſion into the Union.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To mention, and endeavour to obviate, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which have been raiſed a inſt ſuch a meaſure.— And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To make it appear, that no time ought to be loſt, in applying to the Legiſlatures of the Commonwealth, and of the Union, for their conſent.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I will endeavour to enumerate the advantages to be gained by the Diſtrict;—And I ſhall not here confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf merely to thoſe benefits and advantages, which will immediately and ſenſibly reſult from the eſtabliſhment of the government; as all the reaſons (from whatever ſource they may be drawn) in favour of, and all the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which would probably be remedied by ſuch a meaſure, may with propriety be here conſidered.</p>
            <p>The firſt and moſt obvious reaſon, and indeed that from which moſt of the others muſt be derived, is <hi>our detached and already diſmembered ſituation from the other parts of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> According to the preſent territorial ſituation of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023313_0006_0FBF02AE69D77CA0"/>
Maſſachuſetts and Newhampſhire, it ſeems to be thwarting the deſigns of nature, for the diſtrict of Maine to continue any longer connected with another government, than what mere neceſſity dictates. We inhabit an extenſive tract of country, which, by the intervention of the ſtate of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampſhire, is divided and ſeparated from every part of the Commonwealth, with which we are in other reſpects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected. There is therefore the ſame reaſon for our being attached to the government of Newyork or Southcarolina, as to Maſſachuſetts, except that it does not operate in an equal degree; that is, the diſtance to the ſeat of government, for inſtance, would in that caſe be greater, and of courſe the inconveniences of ſuch a connection greater. But we are now at a <hi>great</hi> diſtance from the ſeat of government— we are now as totally ſeparated from Maſſachuſetts, with reſpect to local ſituation, as we are from Newyork or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carolina—and we are now embarraſſed with many of the ſame troubles and inconveniences that we ſhould be, were our ſeat of government in either of the laſt mentioned States.</p>
            <p>We ſhall be entitled to <hi>ſend two Senators to the Federal Legiſlature,</hi> when we become a diſtinct member of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. This is one of the advantages that we may realize, in conſequence of the eſtabliſhment of the conſtitution of the United States, which provides, that "the Senate ſhall be compoſed of two Senators from each State, choſen by the legiſlature thereof." The happy effects to be derived from the appointment of two perſons to ſo important a ſtation, are, the inducements which it will afford (to thoſe of our fellow citizens whoſe education and characters allow them the proſpect of being elected to fill it) to qualify themſelves by gaining the neceſſary information, and to conduct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a manner, as to enjoy the confidence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023313_0007_0FBF02AFAE3D0D28"/>
of the wiſe and good part of the community— the political knowledge which they muſt neceſſarily gain by paying attention to, and taking a part in the buſineſs of Congreſs—the propagating of that knowledge among their fellow citizens at home—the circulation of the money which their compenſations will entitle them to receive—and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their returning from their elevated ſtations to mix, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, and come down to the level of their maſters the people.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe advantages, which will be wholly confined to the Diſtrict, there are others which the Commonwealth at large, and the northern States in general, will enjoy, by this addition of two members to the Federal Senate. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery perſon who is acquainted with the commerce, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and mode of living in the various parts of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, muſt acknowledge, that there is a great diverſity of intereſt between the northern and ſouthern States. The journals of Congreſs, or ſuch of their proceedings as have been made publick in the newſpapers, for the laſt two years, ſufficiently evidence the truth of this fact. But were it not for theſe, it is well known that the commercial intereſts of the two extremes of the continent are almoſt in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to each other; and that the mode of education, manners, and habits of life, are evidently different at the ſouthward, from what they are in the Newengland States. Oppoſite intereſts, and oppoſite modes of life, very natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly create oppoſite ſentiments. Hence it is, that in moſt of the deciſions of Congreſs, upon queſtions which affect the general intereſt of the United States, we find the ſouthern gentlemen upon one ſide, &amp; thoſe from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon the other. The publick buſineſs is hereby much retarded; and, in ſome inſtances, the influence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſouthern members, have produced laws and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023313_0008_0FBF02B12F1F3798"/>
which have an injurious operation upon us.— Some of the conſequences of theſe laws now are, that we cannot obtain ſome of the moſt common neceſſaries of life, without paying a high duty upon them.</p>
            <p>The fiſheries, thoſe important and valuable ſources of livelihood and wealth to ſome of our beſt citizens, are now on the decline; and the carrying trade by the American ſhipping, in ſuch a ſituation, that it muſt abſolutely be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up, unleſs ſome regulations in its favour are ſpeedily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted. One of theſe regulations muſt be, an additional tonnage upon foreign ſhipping, to prevent their becoming carriers of the ſouthern produce. But ſuch is the partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the merchants of the ſouthern States, in favour of ſhipping owned and navigated by Europeans, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in Congreſs will never conſent to ſuch a ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, until they are compelled to it by a majority of votes.</p>
            <p>Theſe are evils of the firſt magnitude. The beſt and moſt important intereſts of this Commonwealth in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as well as of the northern States at large, are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially affected by them. What remedy ſhall we apply? Perhaps it is out of our power, at this time, to provide one that is perfectly adequate; but it is, nevertheleſs, our duty to effect all that we poſſibly can for this purpoſe. We ought to become a ſeparate government; and thereby give to the northern intereſt an addition of two Senators in the Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>Having enlarged upon the advantages of an additional number of Federal Senators, I will now mention one or two other reaſons which ought to induce us to wiſh for a government of our own, and which are alſo of a general nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:023313_0009_0FBF02B3A6F7C0F8"/>The conſtitution of the United States is ſo happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that ſo long as it is faithfully adminiſtered, the powers which it gives to Congreſs, and thoſe retained by the ſeveral States, will be kept clearly diſtinct, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly exerciſed by each of them reſpectively. But when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is <hi>unfaithfully</hi> adminiſtered, Congreſs may uſurp powers which they have no conſtitutional right to exerciſe; and in the courſe of time, bring about <hi>a conſolidation of the States.</hi> This is an event which we have no reaſon to believe will be effected very ſuddenly—perhaps not in the preſent age. But if it ſhould happen at all, it is ſuch an event as every friend to the proſperity of his country muſt depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate more than all the catalogue of political miſchiefs.— The beſt ſecurity that we have againſt it, is that laudable jealouſy which the Legiſlatures of the ſeveral States will conſtantly exerciſe over the adminiſtration of the general government. This jealouſy will operate as a check upon Congreſs. For ſhould they attempt a uſurpation of any powers not expreſsly delegated to them by the conſtitution, the State Legiſlatures will immediately conſider ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as an encroachment upon their rights; upon this principle, that whatever powers are not expreſsly delegat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Congreſs, are impliedly reſerved to the people. If theſe obſervations are founded on the principles of the Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Union, it will neceſſarily follow, that the more of theſe checks there are, the greater will be the ſafety in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the government, both of the United States, and the individual States. An additional Legiſlature in the Diſtrict of Maine, will be an additional check upon the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Congreſs.</p>
            <p>This argument ought to have its due weight in the ſcale. I profeſs to be as free as any man from groundleſs jealouſies of the adminiſtration of the Federal Government. But it

ought to be conſidered, that the conſtitution of the United States is to be tranſmitted to, and truſted in, the hands of poſterity; —that we can neither foreſee, or prevent, any changes in the principles or morals of mankind, which the lapſe of one or two centuries may introduce, and which may be very unfriendly to the liberties and happineſs of future generations.</p>
            <p>Another important argument in favour of a diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſtrict, is, <hi>that we ſhall have the government ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in the midſt of the people.</hi> The advantages which will flow from a government thus adminiſtered are very numerous, as every perſon muſt be ſenſible, who is the leaſt acquainted with the buſineſs. The people at large will not then be ſo far removed from the ſources of political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as they are at preſent. It is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that they ſhould be as well informed of the meaſures which their Legiſlators are purſuing, as their ſituation will admit. They will then be able to form a juſt opinion of ſuch meaſures, and of thoſe who purſue them. Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind will be the means of preventing errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and falſe repreſentations of the conduct of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature. This is an evil which too much care cannot be taken to prevent. It creates a groundleſs diſaffection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the people and their rulers, which generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the worſt miſchiefs to ſociety.—Deſigning men, who happen to be diſaffected towards the Government, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail themſelves of the ignorance which people far remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſeat of governmental information are neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly involved in; and by impoſing upon their credulity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to believe that the beſt of men are become the worſt of tyrants. Falſe repreſentations of this kind, by men of this character, were undoubtedly a principal cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023313_0011_0FBF02BCBA984A38"/>
of the late civil diſcords, which terminated in nothing ſhort of high treaſon and rebellion.</p>
            <p>In addition to theſe advantages, the intereſt of every part of the Diſtrict is ſo preciſely the ſame, that the laws of the new government might be conſtructed in ſuch a manner, as to apply directly to the local ſituation, climate, habits and buſineſs of every part of the territory. It cannot be ſaid that this is the caſe with the preſent laws of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, as they reſpect us. In many inſtances their laws have an injurious operation upon us; but admitting that was not the caſe, it is nevertheleſs true, that many new ones might be inſtituted more congenial to the ſtate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than any that ever have been, or ever will be enacted by that government, until the eaſtern intereſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates over the weſtern. Whether it will be prudent for us to wait the arrival of that period before we attempt to do ourſelves juſtice, I leave to the determination of thoſe who have conſidered the ſubject. But in private life we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſe, that when a man's buſineſs lies at a diſtance from him, he cannot ſuperintend it with that care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which is neceſſary to prevent its falling into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged and relaxed ſituation.—It is the ſame with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government. We are conſidered as the excreſence of the family; and their language is, "We have enough to do in taking care of the Commonwealth in <hi>general;</hi> and if we make laws adapted particularly to the Diſtrict of Maine, we muſt do the ſame for every county in the State."— This I confeſs is the language of truth. Let us then relieve them from ſo diſtreſſing an embarraſſment, and make laws for ourſelves. For, being at preſent but a minor part of the Commonwealth, whenever a law is propoſed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, which would be advantageous to the Commonwealth in general, but adverſe to the intereſt of this part of it in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023313_0012_0FBF02BDF018F918"/>
particular, it will not only be the intereſt, but the duty of the General Court to paſs it. It will alſo be the duty of our own members to promote it, although it ſhould be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their intereſt.</hi> For every one of them is under the ſacred obligations of an oath, to diſcharge the duties of his appointment impartially, and according to his beſt ſkill and judgment. They cannot, therefore, without a violation of their oaths, be governed by their own intereſt, or the intereſt of thoſe whom they repreſent, when it comes in competition with that of the majority.—Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in all the inſtances of the nature of thoſe which I dwell upon, the duty of the General Court will oblige them to enact ſuch laws as may have a cruel operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and that <hi>our own members will be under oath to oppreſs us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may rationally indulge a hope, that the eſtabliſhment of a Legiſlative Body in the Diſtrict <hi>will be the means of changing for the better, the preſent melancholly ſtate of religion and learning.</hi>—It does not come within the compaſs of my preſent undertaking to point out the neceſſity of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtitutions of the former, or the benefits that may be derived from a laudable uſe of the latter of theſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and bleſſings of human life. But I cannot forbear to add, that without them, mankind would ſoon degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into ſavage ferocity; and ſociety, inſtead of preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with the ſcenes of delightful enjoyment, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the ſad, uncomely picture of vicious and capricious folly. None, therefore, but the abandoned &amp; profligate will deny, that the benefits of a good government greatly depend upon the inſtructions and examples of a learned and liberal clergy; and none but the debaſed and degenerate will aſſert, that the eſtabliſhment of regular and well ordered ſchools of learning, will not tend equally to promote the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023313_0013_0FBF02BF6AB02190"/>
of an enlightened people. The diſadvantages and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which many parts of the Diſtrict are obliged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to combat, and which thoſe inſtructions which are gained from ſchools, and from the pulpit, would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly tend to remove, muſt afford real anxiety and diſtreſs to every heart that wiſhes for the proſperity and happineſs of mankind. But it would afford greater anxiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to ſuch a heart, if the real ſtate of the diſtrict in this reſpect were truly deſcribed. I will not undertake to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the painful taſk. It is enough for me to ſay, that the preſent laws of Maſſachuſetts are inadequate to the complete removal of theſe evils.</p>
            <p>In the old inhabited parts of the Commonwealth, the people have been ſo long accuſtomed to provide for the ſupport of miniſters &amp; ſchoolmaſters, that mere habit would be ſufficient to induce them to continue in the laudable practice. But in a new country, where the inhabitants are, for a number of years, obliged to encounter every hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and uſe every exertion for the ſupport of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they frequently regret the want, but ſeldom provide for the means of publick worſhip and private inſtruction. Thus the ſame habit which in an ancient ſettlement ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in favour of ſuch a proviſion, in a new one has a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tendency. The force of this habit often tends to perſuade people, that they cannot afford the means for education of their children, when they might do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inconvenience to themſelves or families.</p>
            <p>The neglect with which the laws for the regulations of ſchools are treated, by many of the towns in this part of the country, ſeems to meet with a general indulgence I will not undertake to enumerate thoſe, which for a long time have been, and ſtill continue in this neglect. But let
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023313_0014_0FBF02C0E92D1788"/>
any man who is acquainted with the country, eſpecially the three eaſtermoſt counties, call to his mind the number of towns which ought by law to have been provided with miniſters and ſchoolmaſters for the laſt ten years; and then let him inquire how many of them have been puniſhed for their neglect of being thus provided, in the courſe of that time. The reſult of that enquiry will afford full proof, that very little notice has been taken of the laws; and alſo, that unleſs ſome amendments in them are introduced, the benefits which they were deſigned to diſpenſe will never be enjoyed by the people in the eaſtern country. But theſe amendments cannot be obtained until the governmental connection with Maſſachuſetts is diſſolved. In the weſtern parts of the Commonwealth, the inſtitutions of religion and learning, are generally attended to, and therefore, as to the people there, the laws for their ſupport have no need of amendments. But moſt unfortunately for us, it is oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe here; and our duty as men, as citizens and as chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, calls aloud upon us to introduce a legiſlature into the very center of the miſchief, in order the more effectually to aboliſh it.</p>
            <p>Another very important advantage that we ſhall enjoy by a ſeparation from Maſſachuſetts, will be <hi>the ſitting of a Supreme Judicial Court twice a year in ſome, and once at leaſt in all the counties in the diſtrict.</hi> At preſent we are indulged with but one term of that Court annually in each of the counties of York, Cumberland and Lincoln; and it is now holden in Lincoln but once a year for that, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Hancock and Waſhington. The extent of the Commonwealth, and the quantity of buſineſs they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to tranſact, is ſo great, that it is impracticable to effect a more favourable arrangement in that department.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023313_0015_0FBF02C76F3B2408"/>
All the buſineſs of the Diſtrict, which a Supreme Court will, for ſome years to come be called to tranſact, will not probably require more than eight weeks in each year, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the time they are traveling. A fortnight in each of the counties wherein the Supreme Court is at preſent holden, would be amply ſufficient for the whole of their buſineſs. A Supreme Court, therefore, in caſe of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, might be conveniently holden twice a year in the counties of York Cumberland and Lincoln, and once (or oftener if neceſſary) in thoſe of Hancock and Waſhington.</p>
            <p>The relief which this arrangement would afford to the people would be very great. For in each of the two weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern counties there is but one week allowed for the whole of the buſineſs. The conſequence is, that very often near one half of it is left unfiniſhed, for want of time. Parties and their witneſſes, with all the horrors of poverty in their appearance, are obliged to attend the Court the whole of the week, and at the end of it, return to their families with their buſineſs undone, diſappointed, diſſatisfied and impoveriſhed. Their complaints are loud and affecting, and of ſuch a nature that they cannot be removed. But, it is of great conſequence to the intereſt and happineſs of the citizens, that their wrongs ſhould be redreſſed without delay; and we cannot provide for them a greater bleſſing than the ſpeedy and prompt adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
            <p>An additional number of terms of the Supreme Judicial Court would alſo relieve the people from a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expenſe, which is now annually incurred in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of criminals committed for trial. This is an evil which is daily increaſing. It is not an unuſual thing, for perſons to be confined in the jails, at the publick expenſe, for nine or ten months together, waiting for nothing but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023313_0016_0FBF02C933BD9EE8"/>
of the Supreme Judicial court, to give them their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.<note n="*" place="bottom">Samuel Hadlock was confined in Pownalborough jail ten months.— There are alſo two perſons now remaining in Portland jail, committed upon a charge of arſon, in the month of Auguſt; and who cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a trial until July; which will be nearly eleven months from the time of their commitment.—Abigail Thompſon was alſo confined in York jail eleven months.—The ſupport of theſe perſons, at <hi>nine ſhillings</hi> a week, which is the ſum commonly allowed, amounts to above <hi>ſixty pounds.</hi>
               </note> Upon a fair calculation, one half of this expenſe would be avoided, if the terms of that Court could be increaſed in the manner before ſtated. But, ſuppoſe an <hi>innocent man</hi> to be committed for an offence not bailable; or if it is, the perſon unable to procure either bail or the benefits of a <hi>habeas corpus:</hi> The public muſt not only defray the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of his confinement, but the injured priſoner may ſuffer the pairs and horrors of a twelve months impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any other ſatisfaction than what ariſes from a conſcious innocence, and the pleaſure of reproaching the government for its delay.</p>
            <p>The trouble, expenſe and injury occaſioned by <hi>keeping the Clerks office of the Supreme Judicial Court at Boſton,</hi> are very great, and call for an immediate remedy. At preſent, if a man recovers judgement for a debt, he cannot obtain an execution (without which his judgment is fruitleſs) until he ſends for it to Boſton. Many an honeſt cauſe has been loſt by the ignorant or careleſs party, who has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinated the procuring of his neceſſary papers from this office, until the diſtance, or ſome other difficulty, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his obtaining them in ſeaſon for trial. In many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, they have been unable to defray the expenſe; and in all, the trouble of doing buſineſs there from this part of the country, is grievous and intolerable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:023313_0017_0FBF02CAAD49A890"/>The advantages of a Supreme Judicial Court would be peculiarly great in the counties of Hancock and Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Their law buſineſs would be done nearer home; and their eyes would be regaled with a pleaſure, that many of the inhabitants have been quite unaccuſtomed to enjoy— I mean the pleaſure of ſeeing the reſpectable rulers of the people, acting in concert with the magiſtrates of their own counties, in carrying on the buſineſs of good government. Their ſituation is ſo remote from any place where juſtice has been adminiſtered by a collection of magiſtrates (until the late eſtabliſhment of their county courts) that many of them muſt neceſſarily be ſtrangers to judicial proceedings.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have been informed, from good authority, that when a late Court of Seſſions was held at Machias, a number of perſons were <hi>indicted by the Grand Jury;</hi> and that they ſuppoſed themſelves to be <hi>actually convicted,</hi> as ſoon as the bill of indictment was found againſt them. The ignorance of theſe people of their right to be tried by Juries of their peers, is a ſtriking proof of the melancholly ſtate of government in that part of the country.</note> It is really to be wiſhed, that the ſitting of a Supreme Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Court among them may be accompliſhed. Beſides the political and legal information which they might gain by it, the annual return of the Judges among them would create habits of reſpect and reverence for their characters. Theſe would be inſenſibly extended to the laws; and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produce the enjoyments of peace and good order.</p>
            <p>An argument of great weight in favour of a Separate Government, is, <hi>the inequality with which the publick taxes operate upon us.</hi> —Taxes apportioned according to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral valuation, muſt always have, in ſome degree, an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual operation, where the article taxed is of greater value in one part of the Commonwealth than in another. A farmer in this part of the country is taxed as much for
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023313_0018_0FBF02CC293652D0"/>
the ſame quantity of ſtock, and the ſame number of acres of land, as a farmer is in the vicinity of Boſton. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently unjuſt; becauſe a cow in that vicinity is of double the value of one in this; and ten acres of land may be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged there in ſuch a manner as to produce more profit to the owner, than a hundred acres are made to yield in any part of the eaſtern country. In addition to this, the length and ſeverity of our winters are ſuch as to require, at leaſt, one fourth part more of forage to ſupport our ſtock, than is required for that purpoſe at the weſtward. We are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſubject to the loſs of our crops by untimely froſts and wild beaſts, which are by no means ſo deſtructive in the ſouthern and weſtern counties as they are here.</p>
            <p>Theſe difficulties, ariſing from ſuch ſources as, in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent political ſituation, nothing but the hand of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can remove, neceſſarily and greatly decreaſe the value of our lands and ſtock, and reduce them far below the general value of the ſame property elſewhere. For this injury there can be no radical cure but a ſyſtem of revenue founded upon a valuation of the property of this diſtrict in particular: And if the conſequences of it were thoroughly traced, it would be found that the taxes which we annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay more than our juſt and equitabe proportion, would go far towards the ſupport of a government of our own.</p>
            <p>There are in the diſtrict of Maine upwards of <hi>thirty unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated plantations,</hi> the inhabitants of which do not at preſent enjoy their full proportion of the public privileges. This is an argument in favour of a new government, which ought to have its due weight. By putting them in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſituation in this reſpect, we ſhall derive additional ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and aſſiſtance from them in the government, By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating them with town privileges, we ſhould reap the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023313_0019_0FBF02D39581FF28"/>
advantages of an increaſed repreſentation. Members of the general court, coming from the interior parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where moſt of theſe plantations are ſituated, would bring with them credible accounts of the wants and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of infant and indigent ſettlements, which always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the foſtering hand of government for their encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement and protection. When they are called upon to bear their proportion of the public burthens, their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives will be inſtrumental in quieting the complaints which generally follow theſe demands, by removing their apprehenſions that their rulers are ſpending their money un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily; and by explaining to them the real ſtate and management of the publick concerns. This will tend to eſtabliſh in their minds that confidence in publick men, and their meaſures, without which the harmony, ſo neceſſary to be cultivated between them and the people, will be in a great meaſure deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>We need not apprehend, <hi>at preſent,</hi> any danger from making our Houſe of Repreſentatives too unwieldly, by the increaſe of its number. The buſineſs of legiſlation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and ought not to be tranſacted in a hurry. The greateſt inconvenience ariſing from a numerous repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, that it retards the publick buſineſs. But much more injuſtice may be done to the publick, in running through the diſcuſſion of a meaſure in one day; and, by not thoroughly digeſting it, determining <hi>wrong;</hi> than, by ſpending a week upon it, and finally determining <hi>right.</hi>— I am ſenſible that it is a favourite ſentiment with many, that a ſmall repreſentation is preferable to a large one; becauſe it can diſpatch the publick buſineſs with greater ſpeed. In ſome reſpects this ſentiment is juſt; in others it is not ſo. But, all things conſidered, there certainly is greater <hi>ſafety</hi> in a full repreſentation than in a ſmall one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:023313_0020_0FBF02D5F0EF2150"/>It is highly probable, that the eſtabliſhment of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Diſtrict will <hi>induce men of learning and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſettle in it.</hi> It will be happy for us, if, by this means, we can add to the number of our men of literature. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this character, who happen to be a little tinctured with ambition, will probably make the firſt attempt They will conſider that the new State muſt have its officers, civil, military and judicial. This will open a field for their ambitious and aſpiring geniuſes. They will imagine a young Government in a new country, to be the proper theatre for the commencement of their career; and although they may be deceived in their expectations, the country may gain a number of reſpectable citizens.</p>
            <p>Immigrations of other valuable citizens will probably be increaſed by a new Government. Should this be the caſe, the intereſt of, and improvements in, huſbandry will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, the country opened, and many of the hardſhips, which we now encounter from climate and local ſituation, alleviated. Good policy will dictate the enacting of laws for the encouragement of agriculture; for inviting ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to ſettle upon governmental lands, free from taxes for a number of years;—and for making other regulations of a ſimilar nature.</p>
            <p>A great inconvenience which we labour under in having <hi>all our money that is raiſed and expended for the ſupport of Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, carried out of the Diſtrict,</hi> will be remedied by a ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration from Maſſachuſetts. All the money which we now pay towards the ſupport of government, and the diſcharge of its debts, is carried to the ſeat of government, there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, and there expended. With this inconvenience may be alſo ranked others of a ſimilar nature. While the ſeat of government remains at Boſton, we are neceſſarily
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023313_0021_0FBF02D78D901F48"/>
called to that capital to tranſact all our public buſineſs. — Nothing can be done at the offices of the Secretary, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, Commiſſary General, Clerk of the Supreme Court, &amp;c. &amp;c. without traveling, at a great expenſe, from ſixty to four hundred miles. It is true opportunities by water frequently happen, and in the moſt eaſterly parts of the Diſtrict, are generally embraced; but their uncertainty oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en occaſions delays and diſappointments, to the great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the people.</p>
            <p>If the money, which is neceſſarily carried out of the country by theſe means, could be retained in circulation at home, it would contribute towards the removal of ſome of the many complaints ariſing from the ſcarcity of caſh. All the money ſent out of the Diſtrict in this manner, is the ſame to us as if it were ſent out of the world. Our policy ought therefore to be ſuch as will contribute to keep it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ourſelves. In the back and recently ſettled parts of the country, caſh is ſcarcely known as a medium of trade. When the people are called upon for their taxes, it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens that they are obliged to make great ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of their property in order to obtain caſh; and when the trouble of procuring it at any rate, is taken into conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, humanity requires that we ſhould exert ourſelves for their relief.</p>
            <p>There is another conſideration, which ought to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the liſt of reaſons in favour of a new government in this Diſtrict; and that is, <hi>the appointment of ſuch State officers as now are, or in future may be, in the gift of the federal admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration.</hi> We are now conſidered by the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, merely as a part of, or rather as an appendage to, the Commonwealth of Maſſachuſetts. Whenever, therefore, any thing is to be done, or any appointments made, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023313_0022_0FBF02DB9693D8A0"/>
of the State at large, our ſituation is at preſent ſuch as does not entitle us to the expectation of being benefited by them. I will mention only one inſtance, which has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened.</p>
            <p>By the paſſing of the exciſe bill, which Congreſs have now agreed to, there is an officer in each State, called a Supervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the exciſe. The emoluments of this office, will be handſome; but the Preſident of the United States could not with propriety appoint to it a perſon whoſe place of reſidence is remote from the capital. Indeed, his duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that he ſhould appoint a man ſituated in the centre of the buſineſs. As there is one of theſe officers only in each State, if we had been a ſeparate government at the time of paſſing the before mentioned bill, the country in general, and very probably the town of Portland in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, would have been benefited by the appointment of a Superviſor of the exciſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">The States of Newhampſhire and Vermont have been benefited by the appointment of a Superviſor of the exciſe, when neither of them are ſo juſtly intitled to the advantage as we are; becauſe we pay a greater ſum for impoſt and exciſe than either of thoſe States.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It does not require the ſpirit of prophecy to predict, that we ſhall conſtantly be in the way of ſimilar advantages, ſhould we become a diſtinct member of the Union. But, ſo long as we continue in our preſent ſituation, we can have no reaſon to expect the enjoyment of any of them.</p>
            <p>To theſe obſervations it may be added, that our dignity and reſpectability will be increaſed, by our becoming a member of the great federal body; and when it is found that our governmental concerns are well managed in the hands of our own publick men, the idea will create a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023313_0023_0FBF02E1158DDA50"/>
regard and attachment to the welfare of the Diſtrict, which will tend to ripen and expand the noble principles of patriotiſm, in the minds of thoſe who are accuſtomed to feel for the proſperity of their country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The pay now expended in Boſton, by the Senators and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, during their attendance of the General Court,</hi> will centre at the ſeat of the new government; and the circulation of it be thence extended into the country.— Wherever this place may be, it will be more rapidly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by men in trade than it otherwiſe would; who may not only benefit themſelves but the whole country by the circulation of their property. Such are our advantages for ſhip building and navigation, that the number of wealthy importers of their own goods, will probably be increaſed.— They will by theſe means be able to diſpoſe of them at a lower price than they can now be purchaſed at; the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of which will be extended to the poor and induſtrious part of the country.</p>
            <p>We ſhall alſo <hi>reap the advantages of the growth and increaſe of the country,</hi> by diſſolving our connection with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government. This argument does not operate with the ſame force now, as it did before the late aſſumption of the greater part of the State debt. But it ſtill has weight, becauſe there is ſtill a publick debt to be provided for, and becauſe the expenſes of a new government will not increaſe in proportion to the increaſe of the people.</p>
            <p>In order to demonſtrate its importance, let it be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our part of the publick taxes, before the laſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken, was about one eleventh of the whole. — This valuation was ordered to be taken in the year 1783; and was completed in the latter part of the year 1785.—
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023313_0024_0FBF02E21313B678"/>
But ſuch is the increaſe of our numbers ſince that time, that if a valuation ſhould be taken in the preſent year, and the taxes afterwards laid upon the polls only, we ſhould pay nearly, if not quite, <hi>one fifth</hi> of the whole taxes of govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. <note n="*" place="bottom">This cannot be preciſely aſcertained; becauſe the numbers in the Diſtrict are not yet accurately known; but from the beſt accounts the Marſhal can obtain from thoſe he has employed to take the cenſus, and from his own enumeration, our numbers will amount to about £.95,000.</note> I will not undertake to determine how it would be, if the taxes were laid upon the eſtates as well as the polls; becauſe it is not certain that our property increaſes in proportion to our numbers. But admiting our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inhabitants to be 95,000, and thoſe to the weſt of Newhampſhire, to be 378,787 (which is the return of the Marſhal of Maſſachuſetts Diſtrict) our proportion to their's is about as one to four—as common arithmetick will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.—Now, if we had obtained a ſeparation, when our proportion of the publick debt, and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick burthens, were only a tenth, allowing that we had made no proviſion to reduce them, it would now have been only half as difficult to pay them as it was then; becauſe we now have double the number of inhabitants to apportion them upon. And ſuch is the effect of the increaſe of our country in this reſpect, that if we delay the buſineſs of a ſeparation until after a new valuation is ordered to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, our proportion of the taxes of the preſent government, will fall very little ſhort of double the ſum to what it was ſeven years ago.</p>
            <p>By the conſtitution of the Commonwealth, the General Court are obliged to order a valuation to be taken once in ten years; and as much oftener as the publick good may require. As it is now more than ſeven years ſince the laſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023313_0025_0FBF02E38EDBD540"/>
valuation bill paſſed, and as two years are commonly taken up in putting it in execution, we may reaſonably expect that, in the courſe of the next year a valuation will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably be ordered to be taken.<note n="*" place="bottom">The houſe of Repreſentatives ordered a valuation to be taken in February 1790, and paſſed a bill for that purpoſe, which was negatived in the Senate. They paſſed another bill for the ſame purpoſe the laſt February, which was alſo negatived in the Senate. We may expect that a third attempt will prevail.</note> We ought therefore to haſten the progreſs of a ſeparation on this account.</p>
            <p>The <hi>preſent proſperous ſtate of the publick treaſury,</hi> is anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reaſon in favour of a ſeparate government. While the conſolidated debt of the Commonwealth hung like a dead weight upon the ſhoulders of the people, it was conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the difficulty we ſhould meet with in adjuſting our proportion, and the danger of our being unable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to provide for the payment of it, would be a reaſon for the General Court to withhold their conſent to the meaſure.</p>
            <p>The whole of this debt, before the aſſumption of about four fifths of it by Congreſs, amounted to upwards of five millions of dollars; four millions of which are now taken into the hands of Congreſs, and muſt be provided for out of the reſources of the general government. We have, therefore, nothing to do with it. The balance, or that part unaſſumed, and which the Commonwealth have now to provide for, will in the beginning of the year 1792, and including the intereſt, amount to £.560,000. To this is to be added about £.75,000, now due from the treaſury of the Commonwealth to individuals, and is commonly called the debt due by warrants and due bills (which includes the orders upon back taxes) amounting in the whole to the ſum of £635,000.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:023313_0026_0FBF02E579867C78"/>To diſcharge this ſum, we may rely upon the following reſources. Firſt, the demand which the Commonwealth has againſt the United States for advances made in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the late war, more than her proportion. Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners have been appointed by Congreſs, to receive and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the demands of this nature, which the ſeveral States have againſt the United States. The General Court, more than a year ago, appointed a gentleman,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Honourable Nathan Dane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </note> with full power to exhibit and enforce theſe claims and accounts of the Commonwealth; who has been laboriouſly employed in the buſineſs to the preſent time. And from the beſt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that I can obtain, as to the ſtate of it, he will be able to bring the whole to a cloſe, in the courſe of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent year. The ſum which will be found due to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, upon this ſettlement, cannot be preciſely aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but it is generally ſuppoſed by thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the buſineſs, that the balance in our favour will amount to a ſufficient ſum to diſcharge the whole of the unaſſumed part of the conſolidated debt.—I will mention only two facts to ſhew that this opinion is well founded.</p>
            <p>When the armies of the United States were diſbanded, at the concluſion of the late war, nearly one third of all the troops then in ſervice, belonged to the Maſſachuſetts line.— If this be true (and I had the information from good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) it cannot be doubted that we ſupported more than our proportion of continental troops; and that we ſhall be credited accordingly in the adjuſtment of our demands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the United States.</p>
            <p>The whole expenſe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eſtimated at £.300,000.</note> of the Penobſcot expedition was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023313_0027_0FBF02E9C9CA1698"/>
borne by this Commonwealth, and is yet to be placed to our credit in the publick accounts. We may, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reaſonably conclude from the foregoing ſtatement, that our demands upon the federal treaſury will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſet againſt the whole of the unaſſumed part of the conſolidated debt. And many who pretend to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the buſineſs, are confident that it will be more than ſufficient for that purpoſe, and that a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble balance will be found in our favour.</p>
            <p>In order to diſcharge the £.75,000, due, as beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, by warrants and due bills, we have more than that ſum due to the treaſury, upon taxes prior to No. 8, which is already appropriated for that purpoſe. Whenever the collection of theſe taxes is enforced, we ſhall find the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Commonwealth quite clear of debt. But, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that I am too ſanguine in my expectations from the ſettlement of our demands againſt the United States; we have continental ſecurities now in the treaſury, to the amount of £.90.000, the price of which is daily increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will ſoon riſe to their nominal value. There is £100,000 in ſpecie due to the Commonwealth, from the late purchaſer of the Geneſee lands — Meſſiers Gorham and Phelps's bond to the Commonwealth for £.100,000, in conſolidated notes, which the General Court have agreed to receive at 6<abbr>

            <p>The foregoing ſtatement is made without including in the credit of the Commonwealth any ſum we are to receive from the United States, as the balance of our account againſt them. And the reader will perceive that no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is made upon the continental paper, from the idea that it will ſoon riſe to its nominal value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:023313_0029_0FBF02EF28190F78"/>I think it muſt now plainly appear, that the unembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, or rather the proſperous ſtate of the treaſury of the Commonwealth, is a great reaſon in favour of our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Maſſachuſetts. Indeed, it is very evident, that if the publick property ſhould be judiciouſly managed, it might be put into ſuch a ſituation as ſpeedily to pay off the publick debt; and the reſidue might be appropriated in ſuch a manner as to produce an income which would go far towards defraying the annual expenſes of the civil liſt. — When this happy period will arrive, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſay; but ſure I am, that the proportion of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick property which belongs to this Diſtrict, whenever it comes into the hands of a Legiſlature of our own, may be ſo diſpoſed of as to produce the happieſt effects to the community.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I WILL now, according to my propoſed original intention, ſtate, and endeavour to obviate, ſuch objections as have been raiſed againſt a ſeparate government in the Diſtrict of Maine.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, <hi>that multiplying the number of States will be very inconvenient; and productive of diſagreeable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the general intereſt of the nation.</hi>—This was a real and weighty objection in my mind, while the States were under the confederation. The abſolute and unlimited ſovereignty with which each State was then inveſted, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the general, and particularly the commercial intereſt of the Union extremely perplexed. In thoſe deciſions, where the various intereſts of the extenſive whole were affect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, unanimity was out of the queſtion; and as deciſions of this kind were frequently made, an increaſe of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of States would then have been an increaſe of their perplexities —But the ſtate of the Union, in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023313_0030_0FBF02F0F3367940"/>
is far different from what it then was. That excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſublime production of human genius, the federal conſtitution, has bound the United States together, with laſting cords, in the ſure bundle of national proſperity.— The diviſion of a State is now no longer an evil; but by being properly conducted, may be converted into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant advantage. The great objection againſt it, which formerly exiſted, is now removed. It is now no longer in the power of a ſingle State in the Union, to prevent the adoption of wiſe and neceſſary regulations, merely by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately withholding its conſent to them. Having provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt this evil by the eſtabliſhment of the federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, we may now offer the ſame reaſon for dividing a State, when the intereſt or convenience of its inhabitants require it, as would operate in favour of dividing a town, in a ſimilar ſituation. The object of the State Legiſlatures is now, merely, to eſtabliſh ſuch local laws and regulations, as will tend to make all the burthens of government reſt lightly upon the ſhoulders of the people. The management of all the intricate and weighty concerns of government, as has been ſhewn in a former page, is in the hands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Thoſe of a leſs important nature can always be more underſtandingly managed by a Legiſlature in the vicinity of its conſtituents. Perhaps the true intereſt of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States at large requires, that their number ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. I will ſuppoſe, for inſtance, the time to be now arrived, when, according to the number of the inhabitants in the United States, the federal Houſe of Repreſentatives muſt conſiſt of two hundred members, and the number of ſtates to be the ſame as when the conſtitution was framed. There being no increaſe of the number of States, and of courſe no increaſe of the number of federal Senators, it would be in the power of fourteen men to put a negative
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023313_0031_0FBF02F3218442E0"/>
upon a law, which two hundred of the Repreſentatives of the people believed to be neceſſary and productive of the publick good. This is a ſtriking proof of the neceſſity of increaſing the number of States, in order that the ariſtocrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick branch of the federal Legiſlature ſhould bear a greater proportion, in point of numbers, to that branch which is choſen more immediately by the people.</p>
            <p>It has alſo been objected, <hi>that the difficulty of adjuſting and ſettling our proportion of the publick debt, and of the unimproved lands which now belong to the Commonwealth, will be inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable.</hi>—The former of theſe difficulties, I truſt, is now removed by the proſperous change of our affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. As to the latter, that of dividing the State lands, I can ſee no difficulty at all in the buſineſs. If a diviſion of them takes place, it is not to be expected that our ſeveral proportions can be aſcertained to a ſingle acre. We have now ſuch ſurveys of them, as to render their quantity generally known. But perhaps there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their being divided in the preſent ſituation of things. Let the preſent committee for their ſale be continued in their office, and authoriſed to go on to diſpoſe of them, on the joint account of the two States. It will be eaſy to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and ſettle our proportion of the proceeds;—and whatever that proportion is, we may either have credit for the amount in the treaſury of the Commonwealth, if that ſhould be found convenient, after the terms of our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are agreed upon; if not, it may be paid immediately into our own treaſury. I can foreſee no poſſible injury that will accrue to us from this mode of conducting the buſineſs.—We ſhall, at all events, retain the juriſdiction over the land which may be in this manner ſold; and thus avail ourſelves, not only of our proportion of the money which the lands may ſell for, but reap the advantages and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023313_0032_0FBF02F4EBE9BAD0"/>
ſupports which a ſettlement of them by induſtrious citizens will afford to the government.</p>
            <p>Another objection, and which I have lately heard made to our ſeparation from Maſſachuſetts, is, <hi>that it will be the means of transferring to the federal Judicial Courts, all actions and controverſies between the citizens of the two States.</hi>—It is certainly true, that being citizens of different States, in caſe a ſeparation is obtained, their controverſies of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind and amount will be cognizable in the Diſtrict or Circuit Courts of the United States. But it is alſo true, that when a plaintiff in any action thus cognizable, chooſes a federal juriſdiction, it will be in <hi>favour</hi> of the citizens of this Diſtrict. For by the judicial bill of the United States it is enacted, "That no citizen ſhall be arreſted in one Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict for trial in another, in any civil action, before a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict or Circuit Court. And no civil action ſhall be bro't before either of ſaid Courts againſt an inhabitant of the United States by any original proceſs in any other Diſtrict, than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he ſhall be found at the time of the ſervice of the writ." Inſtead, therefore, of being liable to be called to anſwer to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of parties in diſtant counties of the Commonwealth, as we now are, the certain conſequence of a ſeparation will be, that no citizen can be ſued in any court of law, <hi>in any caſe whatever,</hi> which is not holden in ſome part of the Diſtrict, unleſs he happens to be arreſted when he is out of it. For no proceſs proceeding from the Judicial Courts of a State, can run into, or be executed in, any place that is not within the State where it is iſſued. And by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going extract it appears, that no civil action can be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted againſt an inhabitant of the United States, in any of the federal Courts, which are not holden in the Diſtrict where he has his reſidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:023313_0033_0FBF02F62BC51400"/>The conſequences of a ſeparation on this account, thus appear to be <hi>in favour</hi> of the meaſure, inſtead of operating againſt it. The ſcandalous practice, which has too long prevailed, of negociating notes of hand merely for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of increaſing the coſt of ſuing them (by commencing actions upon them in the extreme corners of the State in the name of nominal or fictitious plaintiffs) will be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aboliſhed. The unfortunate, and perhaps indigent debtor, by this means, has been frequently loaded with a bill of coſt, equal to, if not greater, than the ſum he has been ſued for; to the diſgrace of the hard hearted creditor who conſented to it, and the avaricious attorney who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and conducted the ſuit.</p>
            <p>But, in many inſtances, the real plaintiff may live in a diſtant county, and will be juſtified in calling the party with whom he is contending as near to his own door as poſſible. In all theſe caſes, the enormous ſums of money which are now paid for bills of coſt, and other expenſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by the travel and attendance of parties and their witneſſes, will be ſaved to thoſe who are obliged to attend the judicial courts in the weſt and ſouth parts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p>But all theſe conſiderations aſide, I apprehend the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will continue to be too partial to the judicial courts of the State, to wiſh to change them for any other. And without entering into an examination of the comparative merit or advantages of the two juriſdictions, we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude that there is no danger of the federal court's being preferred to thoſe which we ſhall hereafter inſtitute by a Legiſlature of our own chuſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A want of learned and experienced men,</hi> has been alleged as
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023313_0034_0FBF02F8697D1BE8"/>
an unanſwerable argument againſt a new government.— Thoſe who are weak enough to make this objection, ought to be acquainted, not only with the character of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Diſtrict in general, and thoſe in particular who have already ſerved an apprenticeſhip in politicks, but alſo with the nature of the buſineſs they will be called to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act. It is improper to particularize any number of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe abilities might be proved equal to the duties of any office they may be called to ſuſtain under the new government. But the nature of their buſineſs may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and explained, and the people hereby aſſiſted in forming an opinion as to the probability of its being per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed with honour to the government, and credit to thoſe who may be employed in it.</p>
            <p>The executive, legiſlative, and judicial departments of government, are thoſe which will moſt require the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of abilities, integrity and induſtry.—For the firſt, nothing more will be required than diſcretion, ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an acquaintance with the world and with publick life. The ſtructure of moſt, if not all the conſtitutions on the continent, have denied to this department the exerciſe of any powers, which even an improper uſe of, could ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very prejudicial to the people. But notwithſtanding this, the perſon who is called to fill it, has an opportunity of gaining ſuch an aſcendency over the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that by a prudent management of their confidence, he may in ſome meaſure direct the politicks of the State.— The place, however, that is commonly aſſigned him by the frame of government, rather conſtitutes him a reſpectable maſter of ceremony, than gives to him the exerciſe of any important powers. In this, neither ſublimity of genius, nor profundity of erudition, are <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:023313_0035_0FBF02FF326AFB80"/>As to the ſecond, viz. the legiſlative department, we may obſerve, as we have repeatedly done before, that the moſt difficult and important buſineſs of it is transfered to the general government. With reſpect to the reſidue, it is chiefly done already. The preſent code of Maſſachuſetts laws (except thoſe which will require alteration or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before they are put in operation here) will doubtleſs be adopted. There are enough of them in all conſcience; and I ſincerely believe, that if there was not another to be added to them which would affect the general regulations of property, or the adminiſtration of juſtice, it would be far better than the continual change through which they have paſſed for the laſt ſeven years.</p>
            <p>The future buſineſs of a General Court, after the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment is once firmly eſtabliſhed, will conſiſt principally of ſuch local regulations as any men of common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſound judgment will be capable of making. I truſt we have as great a proportion of ſuch men in the Diſtrict of Maine, as there are in any part of the Commonwealth. We may, therefore, go on with a new government, on this account, with the utmoſt ſafety.</p>
            <p>But the judicial department muſt be filled by men of great abilities and integrity, in order to inſure a happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the new government. Much of its digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and importance will depend upon a bench of Supreme Judges, filled by men of this character. For the wiſeſt and beſt laws may be enacted by the legiſlature; but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot enjoy the benefit of them, unleſs they are wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreted, and put in operation, by the Judicial Courts.</p>
            <p>I flatter myſelf that four or five men may be found in the Diſtrict of Maine, whoſe knowledge of the law, whoſe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023313_0036_0FBF030242D15BF8"/>
integrity and judgment will be found equal to an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcharge of the duties of a Supreme Court. A know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the intricate and abſtruſe points of law, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be of ſervice to them; at leaſt ſo far as to guard them againſt any unjuſt attempts of the gentlemen of the bar, to miſlead them. Sound judgment, quick penetration, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient inveſtigation, and candid deliberate inquiry, together with a knowledge of the general principles of law, will go very far to make up the character of a valuable and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Judge. We certainly have more than five men in the Diſtrict who are in every reſpect deſerving this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I could enumerate double the number without the leaſt heſitation.</p>
            <p>We ſhall have ſtill leſs difficulty to encounter from the ſuppoſed want of men of learning and experience in form<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing a conſtitution. We ſhall have at leaſt fourteen models before us to ſelect from, ſome of which are allowed, both in Europe and America, to contain the utmoſt perfection of human wiſdom in matters of civil policy. The conſtitution of this Commonwealth in particular, under the authority of which we have been ſo long and ſo happily governed, has been generally reckoned one of the beſt. That of the United States, which contains the collected wiſdom of the whole continent, varies from it but in ſome few inſtances. In forming one for ourſelves, we ſhall have, not only the advantage of comparing the two together, and judging for ourſelves upon that compariſon; but we ſhall alſo be able to correct any errors in the former which a ten year's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and practice upon it, may dictate.</p>
            <p>The laſt objection which I ſhall attempt to anſwer, ariſes from an opinion <hi>that the expences of the new government will exceed our proportion of the preſent.</hi>— This objection depends
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023313_0037_0FBF0303B429B2E0"/>
entirely upon the future conduct of the people. If they mean to throw away their money by ſupporting a great number of uſeleſs officers in luxury and debauchery, the objection is certainly well founded. But if, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are determined to create no more of them than may be found neceſſary for the management of the affairs of the State with propriety and diſpatch, and to allow them ſuch ſalaries as will be a handſome equivalent for their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and <hi>no more,</hi> it will be found that we ſhall <hi>ſave money</hi> by the exchange of governments.</p>
            <p>The expenſes of the government of Maſſachuſetts before the adoption of the federal conſtitution, amounted annually to £.18,000; but ſince that time, they have been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably leſs. The buſineſs of the General Court does not now take up ſo much time, as it then did; and the pay of the members of Congreſs, which was then a State charge, is now taken from the treaſury of the United States. Theſe two circumſtances have reduced the annual expenſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government to £. 15,000. The proportion of this ſum which the citizens of this Diſtrict will pay after a new valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is taken, being one fifth, will be £.3000. As has been formerly obſerved, we muſt expect that the General Court will order a new valuation to be taken in the courſe of the next year. Our calculations, therefore, ought all to be made according to the proportion of taxes which we ſhall be obliged to pay after that time: Becauſe, let us be ever ſo expeditious, we ſhall be probably more than a year in ſettling the terms of our ſeparation with the government, and in obtaining the conſent of Congreſs.</p>
            <p>I will now exhibit an eſtimate of the expenſes of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Diſtrict which will fall ſome what ſhort of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023313_0038_0FBF030629AB6390"/>
£.3000 per annum, and then endeavour to defend it, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining my reaſons for each article.</p>

            <p>By this eſtimate it appears, that after a valuation is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, provided the increaſe of property in the Diſtrict has been equal to that of its numbers, we ſhall ſave annually the ſum of £.561 by becoming a ſeparate Government, if it can be made to appear that the eſtimate is accurate and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If it is too high, as many will think it is, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that a larger ſum will be ſaved.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, the ſum of £300 will be an ample ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for the Chief Magiſtrate, whom I chooſe to call a <hi>Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernour.</hi> For as the federal conſtitution allows no title ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of <hi>Preſident,</hi> to the firſt man in the nation (and while the office is ſuſtained by its preſent illuſtrious poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023313_0039_0FBF0307CFA42A68"/>
I may add, the firſt man in the world) to give the ſame title to the Chief Magiſtrate of a ſingle State, will be found not only improper, but inconvenient.</p>
            <p>But in order to ſhew that the ſum of £.300 is ample for the ſupport of a Governour, it may be ſaid, that their is no part of the Diſtrict where that ſum, regularly paid and economically expended, will not ſupport a family in as good a ſtile as will be conſiſtant with the preſent ſtate of ſociety in this part of the country. The refinements of luxury in this wooden world would be rediculous. Beſides the pernicious example of idleneſs which they would ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people, the catalogue of vices they would engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might alarm and affright the plain honeſt citizen. We have no occaſion, therefore, to make any allowance for the expenſes they would create.</p>
            <p>An attention to a little private buſineſs would be not at all incompatible with the true dignity of a Governour. By this means he might not only increaſe his property, but ſet an example of induſtry to the publick. From the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of our ſituation he would be unexpoſed to many expenſes which devolve upon Governours of others States, by the viſits of ſtrangers of diſtinction, whom decency obliges them to notice.</p>
            <p>The next article in the foregoing eſtimate, is an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of 6<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> per day for ten Senators, ſuppoſing their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to require their attendance 60 days in a year. This allowance will be found fully competent for the pay of that branch of the Legiſlature. It is 6<abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> leſs per day than our preſent Senators have received for ſome years paſt. This ſum will not be thought too large; the doubt as to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is, whether 60 days in a year will be a ſufficient allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023313_0040_0FBF0309A9083A08"/>
of time for their buſineſs to be done in. We muſt form our opinion upon this point, by comparing the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole Commonwealth with what will probably ariſe hereafter in this Diſtrict.</p>
            <p>The General Court of Maſſachuſetts, ſince the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the federal conſtitution, has generally ſat from eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ninety days in the year. Much of that time has been taken up, in debating upon ſubjects which we ſhall have nothing to do with in future. From the great number of people in the Commonwealth, who have conſtant occaſion to apply to the Legiſlature for remedies which no other tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal in the government can provide, their private buſineſs neceſſarily occupies a great ſhare of their attention; perhaps a much greater, than that of a publick nature. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Diſtrict being much leſs, the buſineſs of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture General Court will be leſs of courſe. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it may be fairly concluded, that although more than ſixty days in a year may be neceſſary upon the firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Government, in order to put it into operation, yet, after that time, the ordinary buſineſs of it will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more than fifty or ſixty days at moſt.</p>
            <p>The number of Senators will doubtleſs be as many as twelve, but not more than ten out of the number will be conſtantly attending the General Court.</p>
            <p>The travel of the Senators and of the Repreſentatives muſt both be paid out of the publick cheſt. I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted this at £.75, allowing twenty miles travel to be equal to a day's attendance (which is the preſent cuſtom) and ſuppoſing the number of Repreſentatives to be forty, and their travel to average each a hundred miles, including the diſtance to and from the ſeat of government. Forty Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentatives
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023313_0041_0FBF031162C94218"/>
are as few as we can expect the General Court to conſiſt of, when we conſider that there are now ſixty nine incorporated towns in the Diſtrict which have a right to be repreſented, and alſo the number of plantations which will immediately upon a ſeparation, receive the privileges of incorporation. And it will be found that the allowance of 100 miles travel to each Senator and Repreſentative is as much as the whole travel will average for a number of years to come, if the place for the ſeat of the new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be, as it undoubtedly will be, fixed upon in the center of the inhabitants, and not of the territory.</p>
            <p>The allowance of 5<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> a day for the pay of the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, is 1<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> leſs than what has been uſually allowed by the General Court of Maſſachuſetts. But as the expenſes of living in this Diſtrict will be ſomewhat leſs than they are in Boſton, this ſum will be an adequate compenſation.</p>
            <p>The Secretary will be an important officer, and ought to be fully compenſated. The ſum I have allowed him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch perquiſites of his office as will naturally accrue, will be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>The Treaſurer is a more reſponſible officer than the Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retary, and the duties of his office more intricate and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; he will therefore be entitled to a larger ſalary. His office will admit of ſo few perquiſites, and require ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attention, that £. 120 will not be more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for his ſervices.</p>
            <p>The allowance of £.30 for each of the Clerks, will be nearly if not quite equal to the pay of the members of the General Court. They cannot expect to be better provided for than their employers; but the tedious buſineſs of their office entitles them to be made nearly equal to them. Theſe,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023313_0042_0FBF03136B89FB18"/>
together with the Meſſenger and Chaplain, will be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, but naming the preciſe ſums is of little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>The Chief Juſtice, and the Aſſociate Judges of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court ought, above all the other officers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be liberally paid.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſalaries of the Chief Juſtice of Maſſachuſetts is £.370, that of the other Judges £.350 each.</note> The duty of the Chief Juſtice is of ſuch a nature as entitles him to a larger ſum than his Aſſociates, were the dignity of his office out of the queſtion. I will mention no inſtance, excepting that moſt painful one, pronouncing ſentence of death upon criminals, There is no duty which a man can be called to the diſcharge of in ſociety, more diſtreſſing, or which would put his ſenſibility ſo much to the torture. When the very nature of it is, to add to the weight of affliction with which the wretched criminal is loaded, what a miſerable alleviation is money to the diſtreſſes of a feeling heart!</p>
            <p>The ſum of £.200 which I have allowed for the ſalaries of the puiſne Judges, will not be ſufficient to ſupport their families, and to pay their traveling expenſes. They ought therefore to be higher, if the abilities of the people were equal to it, to enable them to devote that time to ſtudy, which muſt otherwiſe be employed in procuring a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. They ought to be placed beyond the reach of temptation, by being honourably provided for by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. They can purſue no other buſineſs to advantage while their duty obliges them to be often upon the circuit; and if any of the bar ſhould be advanced to that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtation, they could have no other means of ſupport.— But it is a nigardly idea, that the publick officers ſhould be
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023313_0043_0FBF0314F354CEE0"/>
               <hi>barely</hi> ſupported, when every other citizen is purſuing and adding to his worldly intereſt. Why ſhould the man who gives himſelf up to the ſervice of his country, be the only one who is precluded from a moderate increaſe of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate? It ought to be conſidered, that ſuch men have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whoſe education and advancement in the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend altogether upon their exertions; that if the proceeds of their offices are expended in the neceſſary ſuport of their families, theſe children muſt be brought up in ignorance; and that annexing a low and pitiful ſalary to the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant offices in the community, will be the probable means of having them filled by ignorant or unprincipled men.</p>
            <p>The office of Attorney General ought alſo to be filled by a man of integrity and abilities. It is an office, upon the faithful diſcharge of which, depends much of the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the government. The Attorney General ought to be equal, in point of learning and abilities, to any of the Judges of the Supreme Court; and if the reſponſibility, labour, and diſagreeable buſineſs of the office were duly attended to, he would appear to be entitled to an equal ſalary.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſalary of the preſent Attorney General is £.300.</note> It in a great meaſure throws him out of other buſineſs; and renders him in ſome degree an unpopular character.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>I have omitted to inſert in the eſtimate any ſum for the annual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent expenſes of government. As theſe cannot be aſcertained with any degree of certainty, to mention any particular ſum might be the means of an erroneous computation. But it is almoſt certain they will fall ſhort of our preſent proportion of that ſpecies of expenſe, which is now incurred in the Commonwealth. The enormous ſums of money which are annually granted for the ſupport of the <hi>State's poor</hi> and of <hi>Caſtle William,</hi> make a great proportion of this expenſe.</p>
                  <p>From February 1789 to June 1790, the General Court granted the ſum of £.6786 3 10, for the ſupport of the State's poor and of Boſton alms houſe; and in June 1788, another ſum of £.3500 for the ſupport of <hi>Caſtle William</hi>—amounting in the whole to the enormous ſum of £.10,286 3 10. Although in Juſtice we ought to take our proportion of the State's poor, ſhould a ſeparation take place, yet it may be obſerved that this will be only a temporary burthen. As Boſton, from its extenſive trade, is the principal reſort of foreigners, the number of perſons who are intitled to the charity of government will generally center in that capital. But we may add that our proportion of the public property, ſuch as the <hi>State Houſe,</hi> the publick <hi>Arſenals,</hi> &amp;c. will balance the expenſe of that part of the public poor which will ſail upon us for a maintenance.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:023313_0044_0FBF0316B9FD2B48"/>It has probably been noticed, that the beforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſtimate does not contain an allowance for the ſalary of a Lieutenant Governour, nor the pay of a Council. My reaſon for omitting them is, that they will both be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary in ſuch a form of government as might be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adopted. The conſtitution of the Commonwealth does not give to the Lieutenant Governour a ſingle particle of power, in any caſe whatever, excepting in the abſence of the Chief Magiſtrate. Whenever therefore the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is able to attend to buſineſs, the Lieutenant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour has nothing to do, excepting as a member of the Council, which he always is, by virtue of his office. And if it ſhould appear, that a Council may be ſafely omitted in our new form of government, it will follow that a Lieut. Governour will be a uſeleſs and ſuperfluous officer; a mere cypher in the government, without any authority to make him or his office reſpectable. In ſhort, he would be noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than a kind of death watch to the Governour, waiting, and perhaps <hi>wiſhing</hi> for his deceaſe, or removal.— The Preſident of the Senate may be appointed to ſucceed the Chief Magiſtrate, in caſe of his death, or removal from office; and the parade and expenſe of a Lieut. Governour by this means ſaved to the people.<note n="*" place="bottom">Should this plan of government be thought too ſimple, a Lieutenant Governour may be choſen, and made the Preſident of the Senate, and veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other powers ſimilar to thoſe of the Vice Preſident of the United States. He might receive his pay as a member of the Senate, without any additional ſalary, in which caſe the increaſe of expenſe would be very trifling.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:023313_0045_0FBF031BA960D988"/>A Council to adviſe the Governour, would in my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion be equally unneceſſary.—As an authority for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I need only cite the conſtitution of the United States. By that conſtitution there is no ſet of men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as a diſtinct branch of the government, merely to adviſe the Preſident. But in the exerciſe of all the moſt important powers with which he is inveſted, he acts by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate. If, therefore, in a government ſo complex, and which is deſigned to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed over ſuch an extenſive empire as that of the United States, a Council has not been found to be neceſſary, we may with ſafety be without one in the government of a territory ſo comparatively ſmall.</p>
            <p>The only objection to this plan is, that it in ſome degree blends the legiſlative and executive departments; but the principle of civil policy on which this is founded, may be too much refined upon. Our Governour will have little elſe to conſult the Senate upon, than the appointment of civil officers. Perhaps it would be as well, if he was left to act independently of the advice of any branch of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. His reſponſibility would in this caſe be greater, and the inducements to a faithful diſcharge of his truſt, proportionably increaſed. Should he be diſpoſed to make an improper appointment, the conſequences would then reſt upon his own head, without his having the advice and conſent of a Council or Senate, behind which to ſcreen himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:023313_0046_0FBF03208BC68E90"/>But after all, our great ſafety is, that the powers of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment are wholly in the hands of the people. If they make choice of good men for their rulers, ſuch rulers will make a judicious uſe of their authority. If by any means bad men ſhould be called to adminiſter the government, they will be conſtantly under the eyes of the people, who can order them into private life, at ſtated and ſhort periods.</p>
            <p>Having made theſe obſervations upon the expenſes of the new government, I will take my leave of this part of the ſubject, by obſerving, that it muſt plainly appear to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery unprejudiced mind, that our expenſes cannot be <hi>enhanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the meaſure, whether the foregoing eſtimate, and the plan upon which it is projected, are accurate or not.— Our proportion of the expenſes of the preſent government which is an eighth part of the whole, amounts now to £.1875, only £.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>64 leſs than the foot of my eſtimate, which I believe will be acknowledged, to be fully as high as will be conſented to by the government—Admitting alſo, that our proportion of the whole will be as much as a ſixth (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a valuation is taken) which will doubtleſs be the caſe, it will amount to £.2500. We ſhall then make an annual ſaving of £.70 by the ſeparation. But if our proportion ſhould be a fifth, after a new valuation is taken, which we know muſt be the caſe if comparative numbers were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it, we ſhould ſave the ſum of £.561 per annum.</p>
            <p>To theſe ideas let us add, the many advantages which will certainly accrue to us, and it appears to me impoſſible that any man can heſitate in what manner to decide upon the queſtion.</p>
            <p n="3">III. WE have now arrived to the laſt thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which is that we have now the beſt opportunity
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023313_0047_0FBF032399CEDF60"/>
to apply to the Legiſlatures of the Commonwealth and of the Union for their conſent to our ſeparation.</p>
            <p>That no time ought to be loſt in making this application will appear from divers conſiderations. The firſt I ſhall mention is, that the terms upon which we are to ſeparate, will not probably be ſettled without taking up ſome time in coming to an agreement upon them.— If we were to adopt the opinion of thoſe who would put off the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration until the year 1795, when the conſtitution of the Commonwealth may be reviſed, I think every prerequiſite ought to be firſt ſettled. For if we poſtpone any ſteps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the ſubject till the moment a Convention of the Commonwealth is called to reviſe the conſtitution, and then, inſtead of joining in that Convention, begin the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a new government, <hi>ſhall we not have an interregnum</hi> during the whole time we ſhall be employed in effecting the meaſure?<note n="*" place="bottom">The State of Kentucky began the buſineſs of a new government in 1787, and did not obtain the conſent of the legiſlatures of Virginia and of Congreſs until the latter part of the year 1790, although they met with no other delay than what might naturally be expected, in ſettling a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo much importance. Their admiſſion into the Union takes place in July 1792.</note> The conſent, therefore, of the two Legiſlatures which the federal conſtitution requires, ought to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch ſeaſon, that we may have time to agree upon and adopt a conſtitution for ourſelves, and have every thing elſe ready for our admiſſion into the Union, at the time the preſent conſtitution is propoſed to be reviſed. Otherwiſe we might be reduced to the diſagreeable alternative of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to join with the other part of the Commonwealth in this reviſion, and of courſe remaining ſome time without any government at all; or of joining with them in amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſtitution which we ſhould have no intention of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023313_0048_0FBF0324B8B07768"/>
being governed by. In either of theſe caſes, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences would be diſagreeable and inconvenient. Altho' I ſee no neceſſity of waiting till the year 1795, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better employed, than in attending to the buſineſs of a ſeparation, and putting it in ſuch a train as will enſure its advancement to a final iſſue at that time. Indeed, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve, that the ſtate of the Commonwealth will then be ſuch, that there will be a peculiar fitneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in our bidding the weſtern part of it a friendly fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. The covenant which we have all entered into for the promotion of our ſocial happineſs, will then be in ſome meaſure diſſolved by mutual conſent. Having been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in that connection for fifteen years, we can then ſay to them—<q>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> we are of opinion that our mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt dictates a ſeparation from each other. We are become a numerous people, inhabiting an extenſive terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and ſhall be able in future, with the bleſſing of Heaven, to maintain a government of our own. We think it beſt not to unite with you in a reviſion of the form government, having taken the conſtitutional ſteps to effect an amicable diſſolution of our preſent connexion. —<hi>There is land enough for us both; go ye to the right hand, and we will turn to the leſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is natural to expect, that in a buſineſs of ſuch import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we ſhall meet with ſome delays. Whenever the queſtion ſhall be ſeriouſly diſcuſſed in the General Court, ſuch of the members as have not attended to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, will deſire to have every doubt removed, and every difficulty ſolved. If the application ſhould be made to the firſt ſeſſion of the next General Court, this ſeſſion being a ſhort one the buſineſs will go through but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſcuſſion, and be then refered to the winter ſeſſion.—
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023313_0049_0FBF03266CE08298"/>
Thus almoſt a year will elapſe before we can ſecure the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Legiſlature to the ſubject, in ſuch a manner as to expect a final deciſion. Many unforeſeen delays may happen, which ought to induce us to embrace the earlieſt opportunity to further the undertaking.</p>
            <p>We have not much reaſon to fear that the conſent of the Legiſlature to our ſeparation, will be withheld after they have been properly informed of the conditions upon which we expect it to be granted. We may ſafely rely upon their impartiality in the deciſion; but if this were not the caſe, we might reſt aſſured that a majority of its members will find it for their intereſt to vote in our favour. One im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect of our diſmemberment will be, the removal of the ſeat of government to the town of Worceſter. This removal has been frequently talked of but never effected.— It is an event, however, which would be extremely gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a large proportion of the members of the General Court. The intereſt of the members who repreſent what is called the Old Plymouth Colony, together with the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port towns in the vicinity of Boſton, would moſt probably dictate an oppoſition. To balance which, there would be the whole of the numerous repreſentation from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Worceſter, Hampſhire, and Berkſhire, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts of the county of Middleſex. When a full rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation from this Diſtrict is added to that laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there can be no doubt of our obtaining a large majority of votes in favour of a ſeparation, notwithſtanding its operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to change the ſeat of government. In addition to this they will conſider that the buſineſs of their General Court, Supreme Judicial Court, &amp;c. will be leſſened, the expenſes of their government proportionably curtailed, and the bounds of the Commonwealth made natural and convenient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:023313_0050_0FBF032ED5A2F4A8"/>The conſent of Congreſs to our admiſſion into the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which is alſo neceſſary to be obtained, may be applied for at this time with greater probability of ſucceſs, than at any other which may happen for a number of years.— They have lately been petitioned for, and have granted their conſent to, the admiſſion of a new State into the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, by the name of Kentucky; a territory which has been hitherto under the juriſdiction of Virginia. The addition of two members in the federal Senate, from the ſouthern States (which will be made by the State of Kentucky) will increaſe their power and influence in the national Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This power ought, in juſtice to us, to be balanced by an equal number of Senators from this end of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. I cannot undertake to ſtate any particular claim the State of Kentucky has to an admiſſion into the Union, more than we ſhall have, becauſe I have not heard of any. All that they have, is undoubtedly the ſame which we can make uſe of, with equal propriety and truth. Having eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed this precedent, Congreſs have in ſome degree laid themſelves under an obligation, to grant a ſimilar requeſt upon a ſimilar application. Surely they will not manifeſt a partiality in favour of the ſouthern intereſt, at the expenſe of the rights of their fellow citizens here.</p>
            <p>But, admitting that we had not this reaſonable claim upon their impartiality, they have virtually given their conſent to our ſeparation, by erecting us into a Diſtrict, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from, and independent of the Diſtrict of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. They have done more; they have given the Judge of this Diſtrict the powers of the Circuit Courts of the United States. What could induce them to do this, but a conviction that we ought now to be a State by ourſelves? Their conduct in this inſtance muſt have originated from
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023313_0051_0FBF0330AC0E55E8"/>
a perſuaſion, that we cannot with convenience hold any communion or intercourſe with Maſſachuſetts, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of government. The circumſtance that our Diſtrict Judge is inveſted with circuit powers, operates in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with double force; for it amounts to full proof that Congreſs were ſenſible, not only of the great impropriety of our being annexed to Maſſachuſetts, but conſidered us ſo ſeparated from them, that a Circuit Court could not travel into the Diſtrict without manifeſt inconvenience.</p>
            <p>I have now gone through the ſubject, in the manner that was at firſt propoſed. I preſume its importance, however deficient I may have been in conſidering it, will induce ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery citizen of the Diſtrict to make a candid enquiry into its merits. For he may be aſſured, however indifferent he may feel at preſent, that the time is faſt approaching when he will be called to decide upon it for himſelf and for his poſterity. From this conſideration, I hope the ſources of every kind of information, will be laid open, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the induſtrious enquirer. No reſolutions ought to be haſtily adopted; becauſe, in order to form a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the propoſed ſeparation, the advantages and diſadvantages ought to be laid together, and thoroughly examined. Although I am clearly of the opinion, that we ſhould gain much by the event, our ſituation at preſent is not ſo deplorable, but that we ſhall find our advantage in proceeding with coolneſs and moderation. Every poſſible precaution ought to be taken, againſt the exerciſe of that fiery zeal, which blazes no where but in the breaſts of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fellow citizens!</hi> guard yourſelves againſt the effects of ambition, that dangerous, reſiſtleſs paſſion, which too often
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023313_0052_0FBF03322C40BC40"/>
predominates in the human heart. If you find men whom you believe to be governed by it, placing themſelves at the head of the important buſineſs of a ſeparate government, when they <hi>aſſault</hi> you with the pomp and parade of patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>"turn not aſide to follow after them."</hi> Truſt your cauſe with the moderate and judicious part of the community; and be aſſured, that in due time it will terminate in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual eſtabliſhment of your public and private felicity.</p>
