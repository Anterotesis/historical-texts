            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE two wonderful Things, of a quite oppoſite Nature, were united in one Perſon by an <hi>Union</hi> as wonderful as either; their mutual <hi>Influence, Dependance</hi> on, and <hi>Subſerviency</hi> to each other, in this preſent State, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of: But what that <hi>Tie</hi> or Bond of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether it conſiſts in their <hi>mutual Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> or in that <hi>Law of Creation</hi> from which this Influence reſults, or in <hi>ſomething elſe</hi> that we can't ſo much as imagine, is perhaps what cannot be known but by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>primitive Innocence,</hi> or <hi>future Glory,</hi> neither of which we now enjoy.</p>

            <p>HIS <hi>Dominion over the Creatures</hi> is to be conſidered laſtly under this Head.</p>
            <p>WE find him <hi>commiſſion'd</hi> to be his <hi>Vice-Gerent,</hi> or <hi>Lieutenant-Governor</hi> by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Gen. i. 28. <hi>Have Dominion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowle of the Air, and over every living Thing that moveth upon the Earth:</hi> And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> makes particular mention of the <hi>Subjection of other Creatures to Man,</hi> in the 8th <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Perhaps their coming to him to <hi>receive Names</hi> was deſign'd as a <hi>Token</hi> and Inſtance of it, for it ſeems an <hi>Act of Authority</hi> to <hi>impoſe Names;</hi> and indeed the <hi>Remains</hi> of that <hi>Subjection</hi> ſtill continued by the kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Heaven for the Safety of Mankind, plainly intimate, that when <hi>every thing</hi> was in the <hi>Perfection</hi> peculiar to the State of <hi>Innocence, this</hi> was <hi>ſo</hi> too; in this reſpect, Man was the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of the <hi>Univerſal King,</hi> and bore the <hi>Image of his Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Advantages</hi> of it to Man were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly

            <p>WE know, however, that hereby he was <hi>exempted from Injuries from other Creatures;</hi> who, ſince his Rebellion carry Arms, as the Hoſts of GOD to maintain the Rights of their Sovereign.</p>
            <p n="2">II.

            </p>
            <p>WE are told, that GOD <hi>created Man in his own Likeneſs,</hi> Gen. i. 27.

            <p>IN order at once both to <hi>explain</hi> this <hi>moral Rectitude,</hi> and <hi>prove</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>endow'd</hi> therewith; it may be expedient to enquire <hi>more abſtractly, What thoſe Qualifications are, which muſt neceſſarily be concreated with a rational Creature, under no Imputation of Guilt, that he may anſwer the Deſign of his Creation, and be capable to perform thoſe Obligations which are founded on his very Eſſence.</hi>

            <p>THAT it would be a piece of <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and Folly to make a <hi>rational Creature</hi> without <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing</hi> him with a <hi>Capacity</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> that <hi>Law</hi> which is founded in his <hi>very Nature,</hi> is very demonſtrable: For, if the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of a <hi>rational Creature</hi> infers its <hi>Duty</hi> to its <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> then the <hi>End</hi> of its <hi>Creation</hi> muſt be, that it may <hi>perform that Duty;</hi> for ſure <hi>in its Creation</hi> it was <hi>deſign'd</hi> for the <hi>Performance</hi> of all that which its <hi>very Creation obliges</hi> it to.</p>
            <p>NOW to form ſuch a Creature for ſuch an <hi>End</hi> without giving it Ability to <hi>obtain it,</hi> is manifeſt ſilly Weakneſs, unbecoming the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe Creator; as to make a Watch, that anſwers not its proper End, reflects Diſhonour on the Maker.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, if <hi>moral Obligations</hi> to GOD reſult from his <hi>being a rational Creature,</hi> what a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> would he have been, had he been created <hi>without Ability</hi> to perform them!

            </p>
            <p>AND may we not ſtrongly <hi>preſume</hi> this from the divine <hi>Goodneſs?</hi> Can we think, that when his <hi>Juſtice</hi> was ſo <hi>ſtrict</hi> as that it could not but <hi>require</hi> Obedience, his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> would be ſo <hi>illiberal</hi> as not to <hi>afford Strength to yield</hi> it?

            </p>
            <p>HE muſt <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Law as the <hi>Rule of his Obedience;</hi> Otherwiſe he could not know <hi>wherein</hi> to obey him:—Muſt <hi>know,</hi> that there is an eternal <hi>Difference,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Contrariety</hi> between moral <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil:</hi> That the <hi>former</hi> is immutably <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>congruous,</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> infinitely <hi>baſe, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> and <hi>deteſtable.</hi>

            <p>THUS largely endow'd was <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Intellect,</hi> and in this he bore the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>infinite Intelligent,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates when he ſpeaks (Coll. iii. 10.) of being <hi>renew'd in Knowledge after the Image of him that created him:</hi> Where it is implied, that Man <hi>was once endow'd with Knowledge,</hi> otherwiſe he could not be <hi>reſtored thereto by Renovation;</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, that the Creator's <hi>Image</hi> conſiſted in <hi>Knowledge.</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006121_0016_1027EC9161850A18"/>of <hi>moral Duties</hi> was not borrowed from <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Revelation,</hi> nor obtain'd by a tedious, perplext, uncertain <hi>Procedure from Conſequence to Conſequence;</hi> but was <hi>interwoven</hi> with his Knowledge of other Things; his <hi>Reaſon dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of Duty, and diſcovered to him every moral Obligation under which he was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. HIS <hi>Will muſt have been inclined to keep the Law,</hi> and propenſe to choſe it as the Rule of his Walk; his <hi>Knowledge, without this</hi> would have but rendered him Self-inconſiſtent, and expos'd him to the Perplexities of perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Tumults and Broils between his <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> His Will would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually reluctated and ſtruggled againſt the Dictates of his Reaſon.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT <hi>this,</hi> he could not have been denominated <hi>Upright;</hi> for to <hi>perceive</hi> the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies</hi> of moral <hi>Goodneſs</hi> without being <hi>ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined</hi> to it, or the <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> of moral <hi>Evil</hi> without <hi>deteſting</hi> it, is a more aggravated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, than when this Indifferency flows from meer <hi>neſcience</hi> or <hi>ignorance.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that to be <hi>created after GOD</hi> (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Adam</hi> was) is to be <hi>created in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true Holineſs:</hi> But <hi>Holineſs,</hi> ſure, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt with an <hi>Indifferency</hi> towards known Good and Evil, much leſs with a <hi>Propenſity</hi> to the latter, and an <hi>Averſion</hi> to the former.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, tho' in many Things he had a <hi>Liberty of Indifferency,</hi> the Uprightneſs of his Will muſt include ſomething <hi>more:</hi> It could not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006121_0017_1027EC92E9DA08F8"/>be a <hi>neceſſary unchangeable Determination</hi> of his Will to Holineſs, for that would not have comported with his <hi>State of Trial,</hi> and the <hi>Event</hi> ſhew'd he had it not.

            <p>THAT <hi>Liberty</hi> of Will which is <hi>eſſential</hi> to a rational Creature, <hi>Adam</hi> undoubtedly had; but then, <hi>that</hi> may be where there is not the <hi>Liberty</hi> which Uprightneſs includes, as is plain by the Inſtance of <hi>damned Ghoſts,</hi> and where there is not <hi>that Liberty</hi> which is requiſite to a State of Trial, as in <hi>glorified Saints.</hi> But as <hi>Adam</hi> as not only a <hi>rational</hi> Being, but alſo an <hi>upright Probationer,</hi> he muſt have ſuch <hi>Liberty</hi> as was requiſite to him under all theſe <hi>Views,</hi> which I conceive included theſe two Things,</p>

            <p>TO compleat his Power of Obedience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ALL his <hi>Affections</hi> muſt be <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>governable,</hi> otherwiſe he <hi>cou'd not keep</hi> the Law; which requires that they ſhould be <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>governable;</hi> and which, were they <hi>not ſo,</hi> would be perpetually violated by their Perturbations
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006121_0018_1027EC953946B840"/>and Eruptions; otherwiſe he <hi>cou'd not be called</hi> an <hi>upright</hi> Man: For is he <hi>upright</hi> whoſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi> Powers <hi>rebel</hi> againſt <hi>the Superior?</hi> Whoſe <hi>Love,</hi> for inſtance, is fix'd on <hi>Evil,</hi> the the proper Object of <hi>Hatred?</hi> On the <hi>Supreme</hi> Good in a <hi>ſmall</hi> Degree? Or on a <hi>leſſer</hi> Good in an <hi>exceſſive</hi> Degree?</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his <hi>Affections</hi> may be inferred from the <hi>Light</hi> of his <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>due Temperament</hi> of his <hi>Body:</hi> For the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being only the more <hi>violent and vigorous Acts</hi> of the Will towards an <hi>Object</hi> repreſented by the Underſtanding, attended with ſome <hi>ſtrong Commotions</hi> in the <hi>animal</hi> Frame; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if the <hi>Underſtanding rightly</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an Object, and the <hi>Will</hi> act towards it according to that <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> contribute nothing to <hi>confuſe</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> or <hi>pervert</hi> the <hi>latter,</hi> then the <hi>Affections</hi> alſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Uprightneſs</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> was another <hi>Part,</hi> and indeed the <hi>principal</hi> one, of the moral <hi>Image</hi> of GOD; who with infinite Complacence and rational Liberty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſces in moral Goodneſs, and bears a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſpaſſionate Averſion to all Evil.</p>
            <p>BUT here I would obſerve, that as moral <hi>Rectitude, abſtractly</hi> conſidered, conſiſts in ſuch a Knowledge, and complacential Approbation of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of Things that come under a moral Conſideration, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006121_0019_1027EC9B274D3FB0"/>accordingly, as their Nature and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions require, moral <hi>Rectitude</hi> in the <hi>abſtract</hi> is every where the ſame. But as the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Relations of <hi>different</hi> Beings with regard to one another, and conſequently with regard to <hi>Things of a moral Conſideration,</hi> are <hi>different;</hi> ſo this Principle muſt be diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in its Operations according to the <hi>different Circumſtances and Relations</hi> of the <hi>Subjects</hi> in which it is. Hence, for GOD to act in that Manner <hi>formally</hi> which this Principle excites <hi>Man</hi> to act <hi>in;</hi> or to have <hi>Diſpoſitions formally the ſame</hi> with thoſe which this Principle in Man includes; as, a <hi>Senſe of Dependance on an Efficient, of Duty to a Superior,</hi> or of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to a Benefactor,</hi> would be incongruous and inconſiſtent; for tho' they comport well with the Relations of a <hi>Creature</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> they are perfectly contrary to the Relations of the independent <hi>Creator,</hi> and ſupreme <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND for Man to delight in himſelf as the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> an Object worthy of all Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be entirely inconſiſtent with moral <hi>Uprightneſs,</hi> becauſe inconſiſtent with his Circumſtances and Relations.</p>
            <p>ONE Thing yet remains to be conſidered under this Head; <hi>The Happineſs</hi> of the firſt Man <hi>reſulting from the Contemplation of his State,</hi> which, I conceive, we may juſtly look upon as a <hi>Part</hi> of his Maker's <hi>Image;</hi> tho' it be not commonly ſo called; for in this lower World there could not be ſo <hi>near a Likeneſs</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006121_0020_1027EC9DCAEFC630"/>of the <hi>all-ſufficient</hi> GOD, whoſe Happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſurveying and contemplating the infinite Excellencies of his all-perfect Nature, and in eternal Complacence in what is Good and Right, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his <hi>primitive State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO doubt the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Activity,</hi> the ſtrong Powers and comprehenſive Capacities of his Soul <hi>Phyſically</hi> conſider'd, were the Objects of his delightful Contemplation; but into what Extaſy muſt his Mind be carried, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the divine <hi>Light,</hi> and penetration of his <hi>Judgement;</hi> the ſacred Propenſities of his <hi>Will;</hi> the undiſturbed Order and due Governableneſs of his <hi>Affections;</hi> the Uprightneſs of his whole <hi>Soul!</hi> To conceive of GOD as delighting in him! To feel him refreſhing his Heart with plentiful Effuſions of divine Conſolations! To hold Communion with the celeſtial Majeſty without being chargeable with preſumptuous <hi>Intruſion,</hi> or affrighted with the <hi>Horrors</hi> of Guilt! Theſe are Pleaſures worthy an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirit! Sufficient to diſtend its comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Capacities! Becoming a State of perfect Holineſs!</p>
            <p>HAIL happy <hi>Adam!

            <p>THY <hi>Body</hi> comely, lively and active, not infected with the lurking Principle of Death!</p>
            <p>—WITHOUT, the <hi>Works of GOD</hi> allure thy contemplative Mind to the delightful Study of them. The Earth offers thee all her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, and collects them to thy Hand in to the <hi>Garden of Eden!</hi> the Beaſts, the Birds, the Fiſhes are the willing Subjects!

            <p>But are we not by this Time ready to cry out, <hi>O for ſome probable Method to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate this Felicity to him, and convey it to his Poſterity!</hi> The Happineſs is leſſen'd while it is in ſuſpence: The <hi>Requeſt</hi> was anſwered, as we ſhall ſee, when</p>

            </p>
            <p>UNDER this Head we have only to conſider, <hi>The Covenant itſelf;</hi> and <hi>the Part</hi> Adam <hi>bore</hi> therein.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="unknown:006121_0022_1027ECA0F3B1FA70"/>
            <p>WITH reſpect to the <hi>Covenant itſelf,</hi> we promiſe,</p>
            <p>THO' there are no Tranſactions between <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> which in every Reſpect perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſemble the Tranſactions of GOD with <hi>Man,</hi> yet ſuch is our Ignorance of a divine Dialect, that we are obliged to borrow Terms from the <hi>former</hi> to expreſs the <hi>latter;</hi> and undoubtedly the beſt Rule in ſo doing is this; That <hi>thoſe Terms be transferred from human Tranſactions to divine, which are uſed to ſignify ſuch human Tranſactions as are moſt like to the Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE, tho' it is hardly worth while to contend about Words, yet, if we find the Tranſaction between GOD and <hi>Adam,</hi> more like to what is call'd a <hi>Covenant</hi> among Men, than what is call'd a <hi>Law;</hi> 'tis more proper to call it a <hi>Covenant,</hi> than a <hi>Law,</hi> which I think is the only Term that ſome wou'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude into its Place.</p>
            <p>THAT <hi>Adam was,</hi> and cou'd not but be under a Law, has been already evinced. But whether this <hi>Law</hi> had ſuch <hi>Appendencies</hi> and Additions as rendered it more properly a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> we are now to enquire.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Law</hi> requires the <hi>Preformance</hi> of it's <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and ſo does a <hi>Covenant</hi> the <hi>Performance</hi> of it's <hi>Condition,</hi> wherefore in this they agree, with this ſmall Diverſity, that what is a <hi>Precept</hi> with reſpect to a <hi>Law,</hi> is a <hi>Condition</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006121_0023_1027ECA4C31828F8"/>
            <p>A Law enforces it's Precepts with penal Sanctions, and a Covenant enforces its Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſame; thus far they agree.</p>
            <p>BUT a Law promiſes no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dditional Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Caſe of Obedience, but only Indemnity, and the continued Poſſeſſion of preſent Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Priviledges; and in this it differs from a Covenant, which promiſes ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded Happineſs upon the Performance of the Condition.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the Diſpenſation of GOD towards <hi>Adam:</hi> Therein GOD engaged, in Caſe of perfect Obedience, not only to continue to him the Poſſeſſion of all the Bleſſings he enjoy'd <hi>previous to this Diſpenſation</hi> according to the <hi>Laws of his Creation;</hi> to which therefore he might be ſaid to have a <hi>natural Right:</hi> But alſo that he and his Poſterity ſhould be advanced to a State of <hi>immutable Holineſs,</hi> after his State of Probation was ended, and finally to <hi>ſuperior</hi> and <hi>everlaſting Felicity</hi> in the heavenly World; which Bleſſings he could have no Right to but by ſome gracious <hi>Grant</hi> of his Creator, ſuperadded to his <hi>natural</hi> Rights.</p>
            <p>SUNDRY Arguments concur for the Proof of this.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Threatening of Death,</hi> (Gen. ii. 27.) <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> implied a <hi>Promiſe of Life</hi> in caſe of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for if <hi>Adam</hi> would have <hi>died,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Obedience; the <hi>Threatning</hi> of Death could not have been annext as an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006121_0024_1027ECA887408D58"/>to Obedience, and a <hi>Diſſuaſive</hi> from Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>NOW <hi>Death</hi> in the Commination included the Loſs of temporal, ſpiritual and eternal <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> and therefore it was but reaſonable, that the Life implicitly promiſed, oppoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſhould be equally <hi>comprehenſive,</hi> including temporal, ſpiritual and eternal <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> in which Latitude the Terms <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> are frequently taken in Scripture.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> purchaſed by CHRIST are ſubſtantially the ſame with thoſe which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt and forfeited; this the Words <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Redemption, Renovation,</hi> and the like, intimate; for that cannot be ſaved which was never loſt, nor that loſt which was never poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed: Nothing can be redeemed that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forfeited, nor that forfeited which Man never had a Right to: <hi>Renovation</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Reſtoration</hi> to a former State. Wherefore ſince theſe Terms imply <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal Bleſſings,</hi> it muſt be that they were promiſed in the FIRST COVENANT.</p>
            <p>WE are alſo expreſsly told in <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3. that <hi>GOD ſent his Son to do that which the Law could not do, becauſe it was weak thro' the Fleſh;</hi> and that doubtleſs was, to <hi>confer ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>everlaſting Life</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But if theſe were never annexed to it, it was weak in <hi>itſelf,</hi> and not <hi>thro' the Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, we are informed, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 12. <hi>The Law is not of Faith, but the Man that doth
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006121_0025_1027ECAA1340C5A0"/>them ſhall live in them:</hi> And to the ſame Purpoſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 5. and in CHRIST'S An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Lawyer</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>What muſt I do to inherit eternal Life?</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> x. 25,—28.) In the <hi>two firſt</hi> of which Places, 'tis plain the Term <hi>Life</hi> ſignifies <hi>eternal Life;</hi> for <hi>ſo</hi> it is always taken in the Controverſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is there treating of; and in the <hi>latter,</hi> the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is expreſsly concerning <hi>eternal Life only;</hi> and therefore CHRIST'S <hi>Anſwer</hi> refers to the <hi>ſame,</hi> or it is nothing to the Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe Place aſſert, That <hi>eternal Life</hi> is the <hi>certain Conſequence</hi> of <hi>Doing</hi> the Things commanded in the <hi>Law:</hi> Which would not be, were it <hi>only</hi> a <hi>Law,</hi> and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>IT may ſeem prepoſterous that we have ſpoken of the promiſſary <hi>Sanction</hi> before the <hi>Condition,</hi> but this was neceſſary in order to prove, <hi>that there was a Covenant,</hi> which a <hi>Condition</hi> preſuppoſes.</p>
            <p>BUT we now addreſs ourſelves to conſider the <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>penal Sanction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Condition</hi> was the <hi>preceptive Part</hi> of the <hi>moral Law,</hi> with the Appendix of <hi>a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commandment, Not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the Condition included the <hi>precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Part</hi> of the <hi>moral</hi> Law, is moſt certain; for this being the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and of <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>indiſputable Obligation,</hi> he could not
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006121_0026_1027ECACCD21D100"/>but be <hi>under it</hi> by <hi>Nature:</hi> And how abſurd is the Suppoſition that would follow upon the Denial of it, That if he had <hi>broken</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the <hi>moral Law,</hi> e. g. <hi>declined to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> he would notwithſtanding have obtained <hi>Life</hi> only by <hi>keeping</hi> a particular <hi>poſitive</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment!</p>
            <p>BUT yet this <hi>poſitive</hi> Commandment was <hi>more expreſsly</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant, and <hi>more immediately</hi> the Teſt of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And a <hi>poſitive</hi> Precept, founded only on the Sovereign Pleaſure of the Legiſlator, was better adapted to try his perfect <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to his commanding <hi>Will,</hi> than <hi>moral</hi> Precepts, which are founded on the <hi>Nature of Things</hi> as well as on the divine Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Prohibition</hi> was alſo well adapted to teach him, That <hi>GOD was the Proprietor of the World,</hi> and therefore without his Permiſſion he had no Title to any of its Enjoyments: That <hi>he ſhould duly govern his Appetites,</hi> and prefer Obedience to GOD to the Gratification of them.</p>
            <p>WHETHER any <hi>poſitive</hi> Precepts <hi>beſides this</hi> was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence, we cannot, I think, certainly determine, unleſs we look on GOD'S <hi>ordering</hi> him <hi>to be fruitful; to have Dominion over other Creatures; to feed on the Products of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. not only as a <hi>Grant</hi> of <hi>Priviledges,</hi> but alſo as an <hi>Injunction</hi> of Duties.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="unknown:006121_0027_1027ECAF72CF6688"/>
            <p>THE <hi>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</hi> was ſo called, becauſe there was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Revelation</hi> from GOD concerning it, whereby he might <hi>know Good Evil;</hi> that it was Good not to eat of that Tree, and Evil to eat of it; end eſpecially as <hi>by not eating</hi> of it he had the experimental <hi>Knowledge of Good,</hi> and <hi>by eating of it,</hi> would have of <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO perform the Condition <hi>in any Sort</hi> was not ſufficient; but Man was obliged to yield perfect and perſonal Obedience both to the poſitive and moral Parts of the Condition; and to the moral Part, perpetual.</p>
            <p>THERE was the ſame Reaſon that he ſhould <hi>obey it perfectly,</hi> as there was that he ſhould <hi>obey it at all;</hi> for if <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience was allowable, no Obedience at all, or perfect Diſobedience might be ſo too; for as far as Obedience is imperfect, it is no Obedience at all, it is <hi>perfect Diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER, <hi>GOD</hi> was perfectly his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and <hi>Law-giver:</hi> He was under the moſt perfect Obligations to obey him; Obedience was perfectly becoming; he was able perfectly to yield it, and therefore he was bound to yield perfect Obedience.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, Every Law requires perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to itſelf, and to deny it is to deny, that it <hi>requires all that it does requires;</hi> for <hi>all that</hi> which it does require is perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with reſpect to itſelf; and ſince it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006121_0028_1027ECB21A26E2A0"/>all that, it requires perfect Obedience: Therefore Man was obliged to yield perfect Obedience to the <hi>Condition,</hi> which, as has been obſerved, was alſo a <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE was obliged moreover, to yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it in his <hi>own Perſon,</hi> there was no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of a <hi>Surety</hi> in this Covenant; tho' it did not ſo require per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Obedience? to render it impoſſible that <hi>another Covenant</hi> ſhould be made, in which the imputed Obedience of <hi>another</hi> would be accepted, as the Event happily ſhews.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, he was bound to yield perpetual Obedience to the <hi>moral</hi> Part of the Condition; the <hi>moral</hi> Part, I ſay: For whether the <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> would have perpetually continued in Force, or whether rather GOD would have abrogated it, when <hi>Adam</hi>'s probationary State was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, is not certain to us: This we are certain of, That while it continued in Force, his Obedience would have been ſtill due.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>moral</hi> Part he muſt be bound per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to obey, while in a <hi>State of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> under the <hi>Notion of a Condition</hi> of Life; and when <hi>confirm'd in Holineſs</hi> and aſſur'd of Life, under the <hi>Notion of a Law-Obligation</hi> invariably and eternally binding; for tho' when the Bleſſing promis'd was <hi>enſured,</hi> he could not obey it under the Notion of a <hi>Federal Condition,</hi> yet this hinder'd not but he might obey it conſidered as a <hi>Law-Obligation.</hi>

            <p>AND indeed a <hi>Penalty</hi> of ſuch a dreadful Comprehenſion <hi>expreſsly</hi> threatned, had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Tendency</hi> to deter <hi>Adam</hi> from every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> and therefore, <hi>without it,</hi> his Advantage would not have been ſo well conſulted.</p>
            <p>BUT we need not tarry long in the Proof of this, which every Threatning in Scripture is a ſufficient Proof of.</p>
            <p>A PARTICULAR Tree in the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was inſtituted by GOD as a <hi>Sacramental Seal and ſenſible Sign of this Covenant;</hi> which was called <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> not probably becauſe it had any uncommon Virtue to preſerve <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Life, much leſs to confer <hi>eternal</hi> Life; but becauſe <hi>Adam's Right to eat of it</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to <hi>ſignifie</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> to him his <hi>Right to the Bleſſings of the Covenant,</hi> upon his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and his <hi>loſing that Right,</hi> to ſignify his Forfeiture of the Bleſſings promis'd, by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
            <p>WE ſee by this Survey that the <hi>Eſſentials of a Covenant</hi> were contained in this Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006121_0032_1027ECBCC05F17C0"/>of GOD towards <hi>Adam;</hi> and no doubt but he conſented voluntarily to it as ſuch; nor could he, conſiſtenly with his State of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi> and Uprightneſs, have done otherwiſe; for he was under previous Obligations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all that this Covenant required: And if he had previouſly conſented to it <hi>in the Form</hi> of a <hi>Law,</hi> which required Obedience, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced it <hi>only</hi> with a <hi>penal</hi> Sanction, ſure he would conſent to it <hi>in the Form</hi> of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> recommended with the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>ſuperadded eternal Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT now remains that we enquire, <hi>What Part Adam bore in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE true <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, That he bore the <hi>Part of a federal Repreſentative,</hi> and was to act for his <hi>Poſterity</hi> as well as for <hi>himſelf;</hi> ſo that in Caſe <hi>he</hi> perform'd the Condition, <hi>he</hi> and <hi>they</hi> would be entitled to the <hi>Reward</hi> promis'd; and, in Caſe <hi>he</hi> did not, <hi>both</hi> ſhould be expoſed to the <hi>Penalty</hi> threatened.</p>
            <p>IT was but <hi>reaſonable</hi> it ſhould be ſo; for, ſure, that Method was moſt <hi>reaſonable</hi> which had the <hi>greateſt</hi> probable <hi>Tendency</hi> to excite <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>ſtand,</hi> and to perpetuate to <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>convey</hi> to his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> the Happineſs he would have been entitled to <hi>thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW that this <hi>Method</hi> was ſuch, might be demonſtrated from theſe <hi>Poſitions,</hi> had we Time to enlarge on them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi> had <hi>ſufficient Power,</hi> as was already
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006121_0033_1027ECBE4C5906A8"/>proven, to yield perfect Obedience to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That he was the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> he was bound to yield no <hi>more</hi> than perfect Obedience to ſecure <hi>their</hi> Happineſs as well as his <hi>own:</hi> The <hi>ſame Obedience</hi> that was <hi>requiſite</hi> to his <hi>own</hi> perſonal Happineſs, would have been <hi>ſufficient</hi> alſo to ſecure the Happineſs of all his <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM both which <hi>Poſitions</hi> it follows,</p>
            <p>THAT <hi>Adam</hi> was as able to <hi>ſtand</hi> for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> and <hi>all his Poſterity</hi> conjunctly, as for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> ſeparately and alone; ſince he was able to yield that Obedience which was neceſſary to his <hi>own</hi> Happineſs; and ſince that ſame Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience would have been ſufficient to ſecure <hi>their</hi> Happineſs alſo; he was as able to yield it for <hi>both</hi> as for <hi>himſelf alone:</hi> From whence it follows;</p>
            <p>THAT there was the <hi>ſame rational Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of his <hi>ſtanding</hi> as the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of all Mankind, as there would have been had he acted <hi>only</hi> for <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF therefore <hi>two Ends,</hi> his <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of his Poſterity, might be ſecured with as much Eaſe and Probability by his Obedience as the <hi>leaſt</hi> of them, his <hi>perſonal Happineſs;</hi> and if it be <hi>more reaſonable</hi> and wiſe to appoint <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Mean</hi> of obtaining <hi>two</hi> good <hi>Ends,</hi> which is as capable of obtaining <hi>both,</hi> as <hi>one</hi> of them, than to appoint <hi>it</hi> to be the <hi>Mean</hi> of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one</hi> of them, excluſive of the more <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant End</hi> and <hi>greater Good,</hi> equally attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006121_0034_1027D925372EE460"/>then it was <hi>more reaſonable</hi> and wiſe to appoint <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Performance</hi> of the Condition a <hi>Mean</hi> of ſecuring Happineſs to his <hi>Poſterity</hi> and <hi>himſelf</hi> too, than to <hi>himſelf alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND no doubt had he perform'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and were we enjoying the happy Fruits of it To-day, we would highly approve the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>BUT if he had other and greater <hi>Motives</hi> to ſtand, as the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of Mankind, than he could have had, conſider'd as a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon;</hi> it follows further, That there was a <hi>greater</hi> rational <hi>Probability</hi> of his ſtanding in the <hi>former</hi> Capacity than in the <hi>latter,</hi> for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of a rational Creature, who is induced to exert it's Power by rational <hi>Motives</hi> according to their <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> there is a <hi>greater Probability,</hi> that a Man will <hi>exert</hi> his <hi>Ability,</hi> when he has <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more Motives</hi> to induce him, than when he has <hi>leſſer</hi> and <hi>fewer Motives,</hi> tho' he have the <hi>ſame Strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW <hi>this</hi> was really the Caſe with reſpect to <hi>Adam;</hi> for, in the Capacity of a <hi>private Perſon,</hi> his only <hi>Motive</hi> to ſtand, was his <hi>own Well-fare;</hi> but in the Capacity of a <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,</hi> he had not only the <hi>former Motive</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> Weight as if he had acted for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Well-fare</hi> of all his dear and numerous Poſterity: Here is an additional <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of inexpreſſible Importance; the Bowels of an affectionate <hi>Father</hi> could not but be mov'd
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006121_0035_1027ECC5CE699B10"/>with it: What a ſtrong <hi>Inducement</hi> to Obedience to think, That <hi>by his Obedience</hi> all his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Offspring would be advanc'd <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>Poſſibility of Sinning!</hi> Be the everlaſting <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites</hi> of Heaven! And finally, inherit ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior inconceivable Bliſs in the Perfection of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the Enjoyment of the ever-bleſſed GOD!</p>
            <p>AND how ſtrong a <hi>Diſſuaſive</hi> on the other Hand, from Diſobedience to think, That by <hi>his Diſobedience</hi> they would be deprived of all Felicity <hi>enjoy'd</hi> or <hi>hop'd</hi> for! Be Subject to the moſt exquiſite Miſeries! And expos'd to the moſt tremenduous Infliction of Death in all it's Views, and with all it's Horrors!</p>
            <p>MUST not any reaſonable Man therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That there was a <hi>greater</hi> Probability of his ſtanding <hi>with</hi> theſe <hi>Motives</hi> than <hi>without</hi> them? And that if it was moſt reaſonable to take that <hi>Method</hi> in which there was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rational <hi>Likelihood</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſtanding; then undoubtedly <hi>this</hi> Method ſhould have been taken?</p>
            <p>AGAIN, There was a <hi>greater Probability</hi> in the View of Reaſon, that <hi>Adam</hi> would have ſtood in the Capacity of a <hi>publick Repreſentative,</hi> than that <hi>any</hi> of his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> according to the contrary <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> would have ſtood for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> in a <hi>private Capacity:</hi> For.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ADAM</hi> was as able to perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant for <hi>himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> as <hi>any one</hi> of them would have been
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006121_0036_1027ECC8745E95F0"/>to perform it for <hi>himſelf:</hi> He was created as <hi>holy,</hi> and endow'd with as much <hi>Power</hi> to obey, as <hi>any</hi> of them would have been; and the Obedience exacted of him was no <hi>greater</hi> than that which would have been exacted of <hi>each</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>HE had <hi>more and ſtronger Excitements</hi> than <hi>any</hi> of them could have, <hi>viz. The Well-fare</hi> of all <hi>Mankind</hi> beſide his <hi>own;</hi> whereas <hi>they</hi> could have but their <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE again therefore, let any rational Man judge, Whether it was <hi>moſt likely</hi> than <hi>Adam,</hi> with vaſtly <hi>greater Excitements,</hi> and <hi>no leſs Strength,</hi> would ſtand: Or <hi>any one</hi> of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with <hi>far leſs Excitements,</hi> and <hi>no more Strength?</hi> Sure the Concluſion muſt be, That if that <hi>Plan</hi> was moſt <hi>reaſonable,</hi> which was moſt <hi>likely to ſecure the ſtanding of all Mankind;</hi> then it was moſt <hi>reaſonable</hi> that he ſhould be conſtituted their <hi>Repreſentative,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this View of the Caſe is as <hi>Scriptural</hi> as it is <hi>reaſonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT might perhaps, be not unreaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd from hence, That every <hi>Permiſſion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and Inſtitution</hi> given him in Innocence, had a <hi>Reference</hi> to his <hi>Offspring,</hi> and was given to <hi>him</hi> in <hi>their</hi> Name; as, The <hi>Permiſſion</hi> to <hi>eat of the Fruits and Products of the Earth:</hi> The <hi>Inſtitution of Marriage,</hi> and of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> on the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Day: The <hi>Injunctions</hi> to be <hi>fruitful,</hi> and <hi>multiply;</hi> to <hi>dreſs</hi> and <hi>till</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> to <hi>rule over other Creatures.</hi>
