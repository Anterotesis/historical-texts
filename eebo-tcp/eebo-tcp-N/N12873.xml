            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>SINCE</hi> preaching this Sermon, I have been told that ſome in the miniſtry, who heard it, have murmured againſt the doctrine. I would hereby call upon theſe Gentlemen to ſtand forth, and before the world vindicate the contrary if they can; withal aſſuring them, that if it ſhall pleaſe God to ſpare my life, I will carefully conſider what they have to ſay for their School Divinity; which to me appears as different from the divinity of the Bible, as the worſhip ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> differed from that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>JEHOVAH.</hi>

            <p>EVERY ſtep of Chriſt's humiliation was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome diſcoveries of his glory to ballance them; for even when he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf God did in ſome meaſure exalt him, as an earneſt of his future exaltation. When wrapped in ſwaddling clothes, and laid in a manger, who could think him the Son of God? But ſee him now attended with a choir of angels, and we ſhall ſay, ſurely in can be no other but the Son of God; concerning whom it was ſaid, when he was brought into the world, <hi>Let all the angels of God worſhip him,</hi> Heb. i. 6. Our context acquaints us with the notice given of the arrival of this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from Heaven, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to certain ſhepherds, by the angel of the Lord, at whoſe preſence they were ſore afraid. But the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016277_0004_0F9C1BA419FD59D0"/>
angel giving firſt a <hi>ſupercedeas</hi> to their fears, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them with abundant matter of joy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, ver. 10, <hi>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to you,</hi> and not to you only, <hi>but to all people, for to you,</hi> you men, <hi>is born this day in the City of David,</hi> the place foretold <hi>by the prophets, the Saviour even Chriſt the Lord; and as he is the ſaviour of all, it is not to be kept ſecret, but publiſhed for the joy of all people.</hi> No ſooner had the angel delivered his meſſage, but ſuddenly a multitude of the heavenly hoſts appear to praiſe God, and congratulate men on this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn occaſion, as in the text; they give God the glory of this work; for his kindneſs and love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it, and his wiſdom contrived it; his other works are for his glory, but the redemption of the world is for his glory in the higheſt, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt!</hi> They congratulate men on this occaſion, ſince by Chriſt, the enmity that ſin had raiſed between God and them was ſlain, and a peaceable correſpondence reſettled; <hi>On earth peace, good-will to men.</hi> From the ſacred text I ſhall lay down the following doctrines to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered at this time, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God deſigned the mediation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for all men equally.</p>
            <p>By the mediation of Chriſt, I mean, all that was incumbent on him to do and ſuffer, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and man, in order to put all men into a capacity of being juſtified, pardoned, reconciled to, and having peace with God, upon their converſion from ſin, and turning to the Lord. So that all men may upon their fulfilling the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016277_0005_0F9C1BA7AFAE5C20"/>
to be performed on their part, have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſt in the bleſſing of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>That God thus deſigned the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt for all men equally, I ſhall endeavour to prove at this time, and then ſhut up the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by a practical improvement. And our doctrine will appear in a clear and ſtrong light from the following conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The frequent, clear and expreſs manner in which the ſcriptures teach us that God would have all men be ſaved; <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1. Tim. 2.4.</note> and that he is the Saviour of all men; <note n="(b)" place="bottom">1. Tim. 4.10.</note> not willing that any ſhould periſh; <note n="(c)" place="bottom">2.

Tim. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.6.</note> and by the favour of God taſted death for every man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Heb. 2.9.</note> Theſe are but a few of the ſcripture texts which expreſly affirm God willing the ſalvation of all men; yet there are thoſe that tell us, that God's willing the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all, and Chriſt dying for all, intends no more, than that Chriſt died for ſome of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and God wills that ſome of all nations ſhould be ſaved. Not conſidering that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their limitation, it might be more truly and properly ſaid, that God would have all men be damned, ſince according to them, he has already paſſed a decree which renders the damnation of the greateſt part of men unavoidable: And that Chriſt died for none, ſince according to them, thoſe for whom he died are none, compared with the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016277_0006_0F9C1BA903511B18"/>
greater number, for whom they ſay he did not die. If any ſhould ſay, that Chriſt died for his friends and for his ſheep, but all are not his friends or his ſheep, therefore he died not for all: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is no where ſaid that Chriſt died only for his ſheep and his friends; we may therefore retort the argument, and ſay, he that died for his friends and enemies, for the ſheep that heard his voice, and for the loſt ſheep that did not hearken to his voice, died for all: But Chriſt died for friends and enemies, for when we were enemies Chriſt died for us; <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Rom. 5.8.</note> and for his loſt ſheep, for he came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt; therefore he died for all. <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Mat. 18.11.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The truth of our doctrine will further appear by thoſe numerous ſcriptures which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſt the ſaviour of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the world; <note n="(i)" place="bottom">John 1.19.</note> This is Chriſt the Saviour of the world; <note n="(k)" place="bottom">John 4.42.</note> The bread of God is he which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

But if theſe places do not fully prove that Chriſt was given of God to be the Saviour of the whole world, there is no reaſon to ſay ſo. But Papiſts muſt be in the right and Proteſtants in the wrong. It is truly ſurpriſing that any who call themſelves Proteſtants ſhould tell us, that by the world, in theſe ſcriptures, we are to underſtand the world of the elect, who are but a ſmall remnant. Since then it might be more truly and properly ſaid, that God ſo hated the world, as that he ſent not his ſon into the world to ſave the world but to condemn it. Should any ſay that Chriſt prayed not for the world in 17th of John, but for the elect only, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died not for the world but for the elect only, I would aſk, how Chriſt came to make it our duty to pray for all men, yea, for our very enemies, and he himſelf neglect to do it? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is evident that that very prayer in the 17th of John, was made by Chriſt out of love to the world; for he prays for his apoſtles in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, for this declared end, that the world might know and believe in him. See ver. 21.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>3. That Chriſt in that chapter as expreſsly prays for the world, as he does for his apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The mediation of Chriſt will appear to be univerſal, if we conſider thoſe places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016277_0008_0F9C1BABC192B1D8"/>
which either expreſly ſay, or by plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence aſſert, that Chriſt died for them that periſh; for if he died for them that periſh, and for them that do not periſh, he doubtleſs died for all. That Chriſt died for them that do not periſh will be granted, and that he died for ſome that periſh is eaſily proved from ſcripture, which gives the ſame reaſon to affirm that he died for all that do ſo. See the following ſcriptures. <hi>And through thy knowledge ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died.</hi>

               <note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">Rom. 14.15.</note> The author to the Hebrews tells us, that if we ſin wilfully, there would remain no more ſacrifice for ſin; ſeeing ſuch would be guilty of trampling under foot the Son of God, and counting the blood of the covenant, by which they were ſanctified, an unholy thing. <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Heb. 10.26, 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> But how could it be ſaid that no further ſacrifice for ſin remains to them for whom no ſacrifice was ever offered or intended? How were they ſanctified by the blood of that covenant from which they were from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world excluded? Or how can they neglect this great ſalvation, for whom it never was intended?

Further to prove the extent of Chriſt's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, I would propoſe to be conſidered; the obligation lying upon all to whom the goſpel comes to believe in Chriſt: For if it be true, that it is the duty not only of ſome few, but of all to whom the goſpel comes, to believe in Chriſt, and own him for their ſaviour, it muſt be true that he came into the world to be the ſaviour of all men. But what ſay the ſcriptures? <hi>This is the work,</hi> i. e. <hi>the will of God, that you ſhould believe in him whom he hath ſent</hi>

Theſe, are but a few of the many texts of ſcripture, ſhewing it the duty of all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt; all which are plainly inconſiſtent with the doctrine of a reſtrained redemption to ſome few choſen perſons; for thoſe obliged to believe in Chriſt, are obliged to believe to the ſaving of their ſouls, <hi>that believing they might have eternal life</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Heb. 10.39. and John <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0.31.</note>. But all to whom the goſpel comes are obliged to believe in Chriſt; either
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016277_0010_0F9C1BAD1DE86AF8"/>
therefore, Chriſt has purchaſed eternal life for all, or thoſe that periſh are obliged to believe a lie: But to ſay that it is the will of God that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould believe a lie, or that the Holy Ghoſt convinces men of ſin, becauſe they believe not what is falſe, is blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the ſcriptures declare, that God would have all men be ſaved, that Chriſt is the Saviour of the whole world, that he died for thoſe that periſh, and that it is the duty of all to whom the goſpel comes to believe in him; our doctrine, viz. that God deſigned the mediation of Chriſt for all men equally, is well founded on the word of God, and muſt ſtand or tall with the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>But this doctrine will appear ſtill plainer, if we ſpend a few moments in viewing the arguments from reaſon for this great goſpel truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 1. If God intended not the death of Chriſt for the ſaving of any but the elect, then he never deſigned the ſalvation of the far greater part of thoſe to whom the goſpel is revealed. But if ſo, why is that time in which, by the revelation of the goſpel, this reprobating, this damning doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine was brought to light, ſtiled the time when the goodneſs and love of God our ſaviour appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mankind? Why, pray, do the angels ſing as in the text? Why is he ſtiled a God rich in mercy? Why is it ſaid that his tender mercies are over all his works? Why does the Apoſtle ſay, that God loved us firſt, before we loved him; when according to this doctrine, God hated the greateſt part of us before we hated him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us, not with his bleſſing, but with ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016277_0011_0F9C1BAE59B71588"/>
to an eternal curſe? Why does God ſay that he delights in mercy? Why is the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called a revelation of the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God? We appeal to all reaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whether it be a righteous thing to condemn men to eternal miſery for that which it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their power to avoid?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 2. If Chriſt died for none but the elect, then he never intended to ſave any whom he doth not actually ſave. But why then does he ſay to the unbelieving Jews, <hi>How often would I have gathered you as a hen doth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not</hi>; and pathetically wiſh, that they had known in their day the things belonging to their peace. One may as well hope to reconcile light and darkneſs, as theſe words of Chriſt with his intention to die only for them who ſhall actually be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 3. If Chriſt died for the elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then the greateſt part of thoſe to whom the goſpel comes are not bound to believe in him; for had not the Saviour come into the world, they could not have been obliged to believe in him; but ſurely, it is the ſame thing to have no Saviour come at all, as to have none for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 4. If Chriſt's mediation reſpects the elect only, then none can be condemned for unbelief, becauſe they tranſgreſs no law of God by their unbelief; for ſurely none will ſay, that God commands men to believe in Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for whom he never intended ſalvation by Chriſt. But why then does Chriſt tell the Jews, that if they did not believe he was the Chriſt they ſhould die in their ſins?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016277_0012_0F9C1BAED93CB568"/>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 5. If Chriſt is a mediator for the elect only, then none can be rationally exhorted to believe in him. Not they who are not elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for Chriſt is no Saviour for them; not the elect, for he that knows himſelf to be one of that number, hath believed already, and if he does not know that he has believed, he cannot know that Chriſt died for him, or that it is his duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 6. If Chriſt is not a mediator for all, then God has not provided means ſufficient for the ſalvation of all; thoſe therefore that are condemned at laſt, will be condemned for that which is no ſin: For ſurely it is no ſin in the creature, not to do that which none but God can do; but none but God can provide the means of ſalvation, and ſo every unbeliever will have a juſt excuſe, and ſufficient plea why he ſhould not be puniſhed, even becauſe he never had the means of faith. If any ſhould ſay that we all had ſtrength ſufficient in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore may be dealt with as if we had it ſtill; I anſwer, it is falſe to ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had power to repent of ſin and believe in Chriſt; and what he had not he could not loſe for himſelf or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. <hi>Adam</hi> had never any more power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt than we have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 7. The doctrine that teaches that Chriſt died for the elect only, is deſtructive of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the acts of piety and virtue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be rejected with abhorrence by all that fear God. The apoſtle exhorts that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016277_0013_0F9C1BB022577930"/>
thanks be made for all men: But if Chriſt did not die for all, and God would not have all men be ſaved, theſe duties are abſolutely impoſſible, nay, they would be very ſinful. Again, it is ſaid to be our duty to love the Lord our God; but what motive has a reprobate to love God, whom he has ſhut out from his mercy, and left to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without remedy? And it is ſaid to be our duty to fear God; but in order hereto, we muſt be perſuaded that there is forgiveneſs with him; without this there can be no religious fear of God.</p>
            <p>It would be eaſy to enlarge, but I muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and ſhould now proceed to apply the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but it will perhaps be thought that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further ſhould be ſaid in anſwer to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought by ſome againſt the doctrine of univerſal redemption, as I have ſtated it in this diſcourſe. And the arguments againſt this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine are of two kinds; firſt from ſcripture, and ſecondly from reaſon <note n="*" place="bottom">What is now offered under theſe two heads, was omitted when the ſermon was preached for want of time, but thought beſt that it ſhould be added now.</note>. As to thoſe pretended to be founded on ſcripture, they are very few; and no wonder, as there is not a text in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſays expreſsly or by neceſſary conſequence, that Chriſt died not for all, againſt thoſe many that affirm this in expreſs terms. But to ſhew how vain their pretence to ſcripture is, who deny the generality of Chriſt's mediation, I will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate thoſe their arguments that have not as yet been mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſay, thoſe for whom Chriſt died may ſay, <hi>Who ſhall condemn us?</hi> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> viii.
<pb facs="unknown:016277_0014_0F9C1BB0CF3B46D8"/>
34. But all men cannot ſay ſo, therefore Chriſt died not for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is no ſuch propoſition in the Bible as this, that all for whom Chriſt died may ſay <hi>who ſhall condemn us,</hi> but only the perſons there ſpoken of might ſay this, who were the ſons of God by adoption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſay, all thoſe for whom God deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his ſon, he together with him will freely give all things according to <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 32. But there are many to whom God will not give all things; therefore, for none of theſe did God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up his ſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is no ſuch propoſition in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this, to all thoſe for whom God delivered up his ſon, he will give all things; the text cited reſpects only us, <hi>i. e.</hi> the adopted ſons of God, who have the ſpirit dwelling in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſay, thoſe who by the death of Chriſt are reconciled to God, ſhall be ſaved by his life, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 10. If therefore all men are reconciled to God by the death of Chriſt, all muſt be ſaved by his life; but all will not be ſaved by him, therefore all are not reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If it be allowed that all reconciled to God ſhall be ſaved, it is falſe to ſay, that all for whom Chriſt died are reconciled to God, for Chriſt died for them when ungodly and enemies, that they might be reconciled to God: Chriſt did not purchaſe actual reconciliation for any, but conditionally for all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſay, thoſe for whom Chriſt died he loved with the greateſt love, this being a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016277_0015_0F9C1BB18EAD9D38"/>
of the greateſt love, according to <hi>John</hi> xv. 13. but thus Chriſt loved not all, for he doth not apply the benefits of his death to all, therefore he died not for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is no ſuch aſſertion in the Bible, that thoſe for whom Chriſt died, he loved with the greateſt love: Chriſt only ſaith, that one man ſhews no greater love than this to another; but this he could not ſay of the love of his father, and of his own love to us, for God commended his love to us, in that <hi>when we were ſinners Chriſt died for us, the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now conſidered all pretended from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt our doctrine. I ſhall next take a brief view of what is objected from rational accounts to the univerſality of Chriſt's redemption.</p>
            <p>Objection 1. <hi>It is not reaſonable to believe that Chriſt died in vain, but if he died for all he muſt have died in vain with reſpect to moſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To ſay that Chriſt died to no purpoſe, or to no good end, is a great abſurdity; but to ſay, he died in vain eventually for them who will not repent and believe in him, is none at all. For all thoſe acts of divine grace whoſe efficacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the will of man, are too often in vain through man's wickedneſs. <hi>Moſes</hi> magnifies the divine goodneſs, in giving his word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and yet by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>in vain hath he made it, the pen of the ſcribe is in vain.</hi> And again, <hi>In vain have I ſmitten them, they have refuſed to receive correction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But a general will that all men ſhould be ſaved, carries ſome marks of imperfection in it,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016277_0016_0F9C1BB3F7206188"/>
as it repreſents God wiſhing ſomething which he will not accompliſh; now an all-perfect being can wiſh nothing but what he can execute; and if it be fit for him to wiſh it, it muſt be fit for him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Hark, what ſay the ſcriptures, for thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt reſort! <hi>Oh, that my people had hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to me and Iſrael had walked in my ways. O that thou hadſt harkened to my commandments. Oh, that they were wiſe that they would conſider their latter end! What could I have done more to my vineyard? How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings. Oh, that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace.</hi> Will any now ſay, that God wills nothing but what he thinks fit to execute; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which is, that there is no truth nor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in theſe pathetic wiſhes, yea, that he is not willing any ſhould obey his will, that do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, that he is not unwilling thoſe ſhould ſin, whom he does not reſtrain therefrom; that he is not willing any ſhould repent that do not repent, and that thoſe that die in their iniquity do nothing contrary to the will of God. Now, will any one that fears God make an objection, of which theſe are the plain but dreadful conſequences?</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>If Chriſt died for all men, and all are not ſaved, the wiſdom of God muſt be defective and imperfect; for to fall ſhort of what a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, argues a deficiency in point of wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If God can intend nothing but what he performs, then when he forbid ſin, he did not intend that any perſon ſhould abſtain from it who
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016277_0017_0F9C1BB557DDBDC0"/>
doth not actually do ſo: Or, when he commands repentance, holineſs and obedience, he does not intend that any perſon ſhould repent, be holy or obedient, who is not actually ſo: Surely men will never abide by ſuch reaſoning.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. <hi>If Chriſt died for all men, and all men are not ſaved, then is not God omnipotent, ſince he could not apply to them the benefit he was willing ſhould be procured for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Was it for want of power in Chriſt that he could do no mighty works in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or was it the unbelief of his countrymen? It is not for want of ability or will in God that men go without his grace, but wholly owing to the unwillingneſs of men to receive it. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life. I would have purged Jeruſalem, but ſhe would not be purged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>No man willingly pays a price of redemption for a captive, which he certainly knows the miſerable man will never be the better for; Chriſt therefore paid no price of redemption for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, who will never be the better for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This objection depends entirely on this propoſition, viz. that God and Chriſt never did, or could do, that to any perſons which they knew they would never be the better for. But what can be ſaid more openly falſe than this? Did he not ſend his ſpirit to ſtrive with the old world, and allow them 120 years to repent in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he knew they would be no better for it? And does he not reveal his goſpel to men, and ſend his ambaſſadors to call them to faith and repentance, whom he knows will never be the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016277_0018_0F9C1BB6B2F958D0"/>
better for it? Is not the goſpel a ſavour of death to many?</p>
            <p>This is all that I have ſeen advanced againſt our doctrine, worth taking notice of; and from hence we may ſee how weak the attempt that is made againſt it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now as propoſed, ſhut up the diſcourſe with a practical improvement; and this in way of addreſs to the reſpective characters in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. And firſt to my brethren in the miniſtry here preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reverend Sirs,</hi> As God had no other prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end in ſending his ſon to be the ſaviour of the world, or in giving him up to death, but the glorifying himſelf in the ſalvation of men; ſo in putting us into the miniſtry, and making us his ambaſſadors to a loſt world, he had the ſame end; for we are to be workers together with him, and to this very end, that he may be glorified in the ſalvation of thoſe to whom we come preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glad tidings of ſalvation; to open to men the goſpel way of life, and bring them heartily to approve thereof, and yield themſelves unto the Lord; in a word, to perſuade them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſin, Satan and the world, and chuſe God for their God, Chriſt for their Saviour, religion for their buſineſs, and Heaven for their home; is our work, and ſhould be our great concern faithfully to do. Our own ſalvation, certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on our being faithful to him that has call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, by exerting ourſelves to the uttermoſt to glorify God; in promoting religion among men we ſhall be ſo, and if we are faithful, we ſhall undoubtedly be in a meaſure ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:016277_0019_0F9C1BB6CF500758"/>Now the doctrine we have been hearing will greatly aſſiſt us in our work of ſaving men, while the contrary doctrine tends greatly to hinder, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs and ſtop us in this good work. This will fully appear if we conſider a few things, as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The doctrine of a general redemption layeth the greateſt obligations on men to fear and ſerve the Lord; for if God thus loved us firſt, ſurely we are bound to love him; if Chriſt thus bought us with the price of his blood, we ought to glorify him with our ſouls and bodies which are his. God's mercifully providing a ſaviour for all, aſſures every one that there is forgiveneſs with him, and this is the only foundation for religion among ſinners, and affords the moſt powerful argument for their yielding themſelves to him; of this St. Paul was aware, and therefore ſays, <hi>I beſeech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice holy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> But how can one be moved to ſerve God in conſideration of his great mercy to him, who may doubt whether ever God intended mercy for him? And if the redemption of Chriſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects only an elect remnant, may not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part doubt of God's mercy and good will to them? Or how can we urge men from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God's great mercy to them, to yield themſelves to him, if we may doubt whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God intended mercy for them? And doubt ſo we muſt, if Chriſt's redemption be not general.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The doctrine of univerſal redemption tends to promote the glory of God far beyond the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016277_0020_0F9C1BB7D3DB9E40"/>
contrary doctrine: For if to redeem any doth magnify his goodneſs, to redeem many doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, but to redeem all doth advance it to the higheſt pitch. Therefore the angels ſing <hi>glory to God in the higheſt!</hi> The more are benefited the greater is the glory of the benefactor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The doctrine of a general redemption doth beſt inſtruct us how to imitate the divine goodneſs ourſelves, in ſeeking and procuring as much as in us lies the good of all men. We have men to deal with of very different characters and tempers, and in order to ſave men, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all things to all men, pleaſe all for their good, for edification, and often deny ourſelves that we may ſave others. Now what ſo powerful to excite us hereto, as to conſider that Chriſt our maſter has taſted death for every man, and God our father moſt earneſtly deſires the ſalvation of every man? Further, we are to teach and exhort all, to whom we come preaching the kingdom of God, <hi>to love their enemies, bleſs thoſe that curſe them, do good to thoſe that hate them, and pray for thoſe who deſpitefully uſe them,</hi> &amp;c. that they may be the children of their heavenly father: But our doctrine furniſhes us with the moſt powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to preſs this extenſive charity on our people; nor could we have a face to urge them to love all, if we thought the bowels of God's love and mercy were confined to a few, leſt they ſhould exceed their pattern: For if God's love and mercy be as ſome pretend, limited to a few, then to love all, would not be to be like, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:016277_0021_0F9C1BB91A78DEE8"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our doctrine is of great uſe to us in carrying on the Lord's work, as it adminiſters juſt ground of comfort to the greateſt ſinners when under awakenings. We have ſome times to deal with ſinners who, under the terror of God's threatenings and the convictions of their own conſciences, are crying out <hi>O miſerable men that we are, what ſhall we do?</hi> Would to God it were oftener the caſe. Now when ſuch as theſe apply to us, it would be but little comfort, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none at all; to tell them that Chriſt died on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the elect, and that God will only give grace and mercy to a ſmall remnant of men; ſince then the odds againſt them would be great, that they are not of that little number, and ſo their hope but little if any at all: But if we can aſſure them that Chriſt taſted death for every man, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the ſins of the whole world; that he is interceding now in heaven for them, that God will graciouſly admit of the return of every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal to him, and while a great way off, will, like the father of the prodigal, run to meet them with ſupplies of grace and ſtrength; that he exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoiceth at the return of every loſt ſheep, has told us as he lives he takes the greateſt pleaſure in it, and that he has been thus long ſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in particular, becauſe unwilling they ſhould periſh: How will this excite joy, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and praiſe in the poor trembling creatures, and ſtir them up to follow on to know the Lord!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The doctrine of univerſal redemption gives life and energy to all our exhortations to ſinners to turn and live, whereas the contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016277_0022_0F9C1BB9DD5B4628"/>
robs them of their ſtrength: For if God did not will the ſalvation of all, if Chriſt did not die for all, our exhortations to our whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to believe and repent would be vain and ſinful; for then we ſhould exhort many, perhaps moſt, to do what God was not willing they ſhould do, and ſhould inform them that he wills what he doth not. We could not put the queſtion to them, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> if we knew nothing to the contrary but that it is the will and decree of God that they ſhould die; nor could we blame them for neglecting the great ſalvation, if we had no aſſurance it was deſigned for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But our doctrine enables us, with a good face, to enquire of ſinners, why they deſpiſe the riches of that goodneſs which was deſigned to lead them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, why they will die when God is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing they ſhould die. It would be eaſy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, but I forbear, not being ſo vain as to think of inſtructing you, Sirs, in any thing before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you, but only to ſtir you up, together with myſelf, to that faithfulneſs now in the Lord's work, which will be our comfort in the preſent time, and give us boldneſs in the day of Chriſt, for whoſe coming let us be conſtantly looking, that he may appear to our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now addreſs myſelf to him who is this day to be ſeperated to the work of the Chriſtian miniſtry in this place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> It is at your requeſt that I perform this public part to day, you will therefore excuſe a free addreſs. The important day, Sir, is now advanced, in which you are renewedly to give
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016277_0023_0F9C1BBA9020EBE8"/>
up yourſelf to God and this people. The work you are engaging in is one of the greateſt and beſt in the world; my deſire and prayer is, that you may be faithful and ſucceſsful in it, and if I can ſuggeſt any thing that will have a tendency to forward and aſſiſt you in it, I ſhall readily do it. And in the firſt place, take heed to <hi>yourſelf,</hi> look to the furniture of <hi>your own</hi> mind, and ſee that <hi>you</hi> have an inward ſtore, are furniſhed with the gifts and graces of God's ſpirit, and eſpecially that the ſpirit of love dwells richly in <hi>you, love to God and love to men</hi>; this will be as oil to the wheels of <hi>obedience,</hi> this will make <hi>your work eaſy</hi> and <hi>pleaſant,</hi> and you <hi>may taſte the comfort of your labours as you go along</hi>: But without this <hi>your work</hi> will be <hi>your burden,</hi> and you will <hi>drag on heavily</hi> in it: Nor can it be expected that you will be <hi>faithful in your work</hi> unleſs <hi>your heart</hi> is in it. Take heed alſo to <hi>your doctrine,</hi> that in <hi>doctrine you ſhew uncorruptneſs, gravity, ſound ſpeech that cannot be gainſayed.</hi> That you may do ſo, take <hi>your ſermons out of the Bible,</hi> never teach <hi>for doctrine</hi> the <hi>commandments of men</hi>; take nothing from others upon truſt, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what is ſaid with the ſcriptures, and reject whatever does not agree with God's word, <hi>let who will ſay it</hi>; call no man maſter or father on earth.</p>
            <p>Take heed alſo to this flock of which you are now to take the charge, feed them with the ſincere milk of the word, go before them in a holy converſation, give them an example of love to God and man, of humility, fear and heavenly
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016277_0024_0F9C1BBBCBEC5288"/>
mindedneſs in the day of proſperity; of meekneſs, patience and truſt in God in the day of adverſity: O how happy and comfortable for you, if able to ſay without bluſhing, in time to come, ſo walk as ye have me for an example. That you may be thus happy, let them never ſee any thing in you unworthy the man; the chriſtian, or the miniſter: When you viſit them or receive viſits from them, ſee that your diſcourſe is profitable and uſeful, learn the art to make every thing tend to the uſe of edification; always remember that you are ſent here to lead this flock home to Heaven; live for them, pray, preach and watch for them, bear them on your heart then when you go in and out before the Lord, and take ſpecial care of the young ones, the lambs of the flock; often addreſs them on the great affairs of eternity, in public and private; <hi>you are young yourſelf,</hi> and perhaps <hi>young ones</hi> will hear a word <hi>from you that may do them good.</hi> To <hi>quicken you</hi> to <hi>lay out yourſelf</hi> to ſave this flock, often call to mind that ineſtimable price with which <hi>they were bought,</hi> even the blood of the ſon of God. The ſouls now to be committed to <hi>your charge,</hi> are of ſuch worth that the Lord Jeſus willingly laid down his life for them. <hi>Do you love the Lord Jeſus?</hi> then you will count nothing too much to do to ſave the price of his precious blood, but will feed his ſheep, and feed his lambs. Your work is great, but to encourage you, remember, if <hi>you are faithful</hi> your reward will be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably great: And as your work is great, ſo the difficulties attending of it are great; the flock of

God which you are about to take the overſight of is large, <hi>many</hi> are the ſouls to be committed to <hi>your charge</hi>; O remember their worth! have a tenderneſs for <hi>every one of them,</hi> they are the price of your maſter's blood: Your private applications will require much time, pains and ſkill; your preparations for the ſanctuary, and your public miniſtrations, beſpeak hard ſtudy and much labour; beſide you are to expect in the courſe of your miniſtry, to meet with much difficulty from the frowardneſs and obſtinacy, the pride and prejudice, the paſſions and luſts of men; the wickedneſs of ſome, and weakneſs of others, you may expect will bring you much trouble, <hi>nor may you expect to find the end of your troubles until death ſhuts up the ſcene.</hi> It is not with pleaſure, <hi>dear Sir,</hi> that I mention theſe things to <hi>you,</hi> it is not to diſcourage or caſt a gloom on <hi>your mind,</hi> or <hi>increaſe your burden</hi> now when entering on your work; no <hi>Sir,</hi> it is <hi>to point you forward to that rock, where alone you will find ſtrength and relief, and to prevent your being offended when troubles come</hi>: Go forth to your work in the name and ſtrength of the Lord Jeſus; this day enter into his vineyard and join your fellow-labourers, in reliance upon his grace; we that have entered before you, bid you welcome, and tell you, that you have to ſerve the beſt of maſters, who is able and will ſupport you in all your tribulations, have your eyes to him, make ſupplication to him, caſt your burden upon him, for verily he is our ſtrength and our redeemer: Let your ſufferings be for righteouſneſs ſake, for
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016277_0026_0F9C1BBDA547EE18"/>
your inviolable attachment to truth and duty, and in the aſſurance of this, be patient in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in goodneſs reſolute, and if ſtorms gather round and ſwell to a tempeſt, look forward to the crown at the end of the race, and for the <hi>joy ſet before you</hi> endure the croſs and deſpiſe the ſhame.</p>
            <p>With God I leave you, to his grace I <hi>commend you,</hi> may he keep you from falling, and preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding joy.</p>
            <p>The addreſs turns to the Lord's flock in this place. <hi>Beloved in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> The great and good ſhepherd of the ſheep has ſhewn his mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this his flock, in leading you to the choice of one to break the bread of life to you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining him to accept an invitation to ſettle with you in the chriſtian miniſtry, who is now to be <hi>ſet over you in the Lord</hi>: Brethren, receive him as one of the aſcenſion gifts of our dear Lord, and may he come to you in the fulneſs of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel bleſſings. I truſt you are in a good meaſure ſenſible of the greatneſs of his work, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that attend it; wherefore pray for him brethren, ſtrengthen and encourage him in his work; you may expect to get much good by your miniſter, if <hi>you are much in prayer</hi> for him; but if by hard uſage, groundleſs jealouſies and complaints, you weaken his hands, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his heart, you muſt not expect to profit by the word he preaches, but it will doubtleſs prove a <hi>ſavour of death to you</hi>; be careful that you never become an enemy to him becauſe he <hi>tells you the truth</hi>; dont you expect that he bears an open teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

againſt all wickedneſs, and encourages and promotes religion and virtue among you? When therefore he ſays unto the wicked; <hi>O wicked man thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> do not be angry with him, for neceſſity is laid upon him, and woe to him if he neglect to warn the wicked: When he tells <hi>prayerleſs families</hi> and <hi>prayerleſs perſons,</hi> that God will pour out his wrath on them, believe it and reform, when he tells ſuch as turn their backs on the Lord's table, that in ſo doing they <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deny Chriſt,</hi> believe him and do ſo no more; when he tells ſuch as neglect baptiſm for their children, that they are liable to be diſowned by Chriſt for want of his mark, and in danger of periſhing with their houſes for want of an ark, believe him and reform; when he tells you that you were <hi>every one</hi> bought with the precious blood of Chriſt, that you are not <hi>your own,</hi> but his that bought you, that you are bound to glorify and ſerve him, and that your not doing ſo, but living in ſin, is againſt the will of God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the ſalvation of <hi>every one of you,</hi> though you are trampling under foot the blood of his dear ſon, which was ſhed for all. Do not object hereto, thoſe popiſh opinions of the abſolute elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a definite number to eternal life, and Chriſt's dying only for them. Theſe are doctrines mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifed into the world by dreaming monks about the ninth century, and in their conſequences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of all religion.</p>
            <p>In a word, when he tells you, that God will be to each one <hi>of you</hi> as <hi>you are to one another,</hi> that <hi>the meaſure you mete to others, God will meaſure

to you again,</hi> that <hi>you muſt do as you would be done by,</hi> or you cannot be Chriſt's diſciples, that it is vain to cry <hi>Lord! Lord!</hi> if you do not the things that Chriſt has commanded, believe him and turn your feet into wiſdom's ways, and let your whole converſation be directed by the goſpel of Chriſt, as you hope for ſalvation through him. Brethren it is my earneſt deſire and prayer that your miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>may be a bleſſing to you and your children</hi> for a great while yet to come; that you may be a kind, charitable and comfortable people to him; that your triumphing ſouls may be his crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day: And that it may be ſo, ſee that you live in love and peace, love God, love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, love your miniſter, and be at peace among yourſelves. Love is the bond of perfectneſs, the Hebrew word which we tranſlate <hi>Salem,</hi> ſignifies in that language both peace and perfection: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſet love and peace abound in your Salem, and this will render you as perfect and happy as this ſtate of trial will admit of, and intitle you to that bleſſed world of love and peace which awaits all that fear God. To which happy ſtate and place, may you and your miniſter at laſt arrive, and there find every good beginning of grace here, made perfect in glory.</p>
            <p>One word to this great aſſembly, and I have done. <hi>Dear friends,</hi> As this is the firſt, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it will be the laſt opportunity that ever I ſhall have of ſpeaking to many here preſent, or ſeeing you again in this world; and ſince I am now to take leave of you for time, not expecting to ſee many of you again until the Heavens be

no more, you will allow me to ſpeak to you with all the freedom, concern, zeal and earneſtneſs of a <hi>dying man,</hi> who is to ſpeak his laſt, to ſpeak for <hi>eternity!</hi> and eſpecially when you conſider that the ſubject I ſhall now addreſs you upon, does not relate to the periſhing things of this world, but to the all-important concerns of <hi>your never dying ſouls,</hi> and the world to come; and being a chriſtian people, I muſt ſuppoſe you believe the goſpel, and are expecting thoſe events therein foretold, big with your eternal fate, will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear like dying men, who believe a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, and expect ſoon to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the judge of all the earth, how you have heard and attended to me, while endeavouring to <hi>perſuade you</hi> to love and ſerve God, from the conſideration of the great things that have been done <hi>by God your father,</hi> in chooſing <hi>you in Chriſt</hi> before the foundation of the world, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of viſible church privileges, that you might be holy here, and happy forever hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; by Chriſt your Saviour, in giving up his life that you might live through him, and of what he is doing now in Heaven, while plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>your behalf</hi> the merits of his precious blood; by the holy and bleſſed Spirit, in knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door, and ſtriving with you, in order to apply the benefits of Chriſt's redemption <hi>to you.</hi> But notwithſtanding all that has been done, is it not true of <hi>many</hi> that hear me, that to this day they have never been perſuaded to accept <hi>the mercy that is fully offered?</hi> And yet a long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering God ſtill waits to be gracious, and is now
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016277_0030_0F9C1BC2D2A0E7D8"/>
calling to <hi>you</hi> to turn and live! Can you find it in your hearts to ſlight God's electing love, by neglecting the goſpel ſalvation, and abuſe his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in waiting, by continuing ſtill in ſin? Can you ſet light by thoſe precious ſouls, and follow courſes that will end in their deſtruction, when the ſon of God prized them at ſuch a rate as to die for them? Can you think of grieving the bleſſed ſpirit of God, who is ſtriving <hi>to apply the benefits of Chriſt's redemption to you,</hi> by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in ſin? <hi>O the black ingratitude that ſuch are guilty of!</hi> Bluſh, O Heavens, and be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed O earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be deſolate and afraid ye mountains, at ſuch wretched, brutiſh, barbarous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! But conſider now at laſt, of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is that you beſtir in the affair of <hi>your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; time is ſhort, death, judgment and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity near, the preſent moment is all that we can call our own; <hi>now,</hi> therefore, <hi>is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> Now, this moment life and death are ſet before you, <hi>and you are to have as you chooſe; to reap in eternity as you now ſow</hi>; God has done all that he can to <hi>ſave you,</hi> all now depends upon you; if <hi>you ſtretch forth the withered hand</hi> it ſhall be reſtored, or otherwiſe not: <hi>If you look you ſhall ſee,</hi> or otherwiſe remain blind. God never abſolutely elected any perſon to eternal life, nor has Chriſt by his death abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely purchaſed pardon and life for any one, but conditionally for all, having by his death put all men in a capacity of being juſtified and pardoned, upon their turning from ſin to God; God is ready, Chriſt is ready, behold Heaven is ready,

Can you heſitate a moment which to chooſe, whether Heaven or Hell, life or death, God's favour or his wrath, the bleſſed ſociety of ſaints and angels, or the curſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of devils and damned ſpirits? O how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable will you be found at laſt, if you ſhould periſh after all that has been done for your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? <hi>Why then will ye die?</hi> God <hi>your maker</hi> is loath you ſhould die, Jeſus Chriſt <hi>your Saviour</hi> has died that you might live, and is now interced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you in Heaven. <hi>O turn ye, turn ye! for why will ye die?

Lord we yield ourſelves captives to thy rich grace and free mercy; we throw down our weapons of rebellion, and ſubmit ourſelves conquered by thy love, we come unto thee for thou haſt the words of eternal life; other lords have had dominion over us, but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them, and will ſerve Jehovah and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Thus do and live, abide by this reſolution, and the Lord will be with you; and though we ſee one another no more until the laſt great day, you ſhall then be found among Chriſt's ſheep, and the judge will ſay unto you, <hi>well done good and faithful ſervants, enter into the joy of your Lord.</hi> Which God grant for Jeſus ſake.</p>
