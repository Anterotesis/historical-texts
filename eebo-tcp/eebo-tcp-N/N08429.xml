            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH publiſhers of receipts have been always very numerous, yet it has ſo happened, that the leaſt able have hitherto undertaken this taſk, as the moſt eaſy and likely to anſwer any mercenary views; which ſeems to have been the reaſon that more able perſons have neglected it as an under part of their profeſſion. Nevertheleſs, I have perſuaded myſelf, that I ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a work, neither entirely void of uſe, nor foreign to the duties of my profeſſion, if I made the public partakers of the principal helps againſt moſt diſeaſes, which I had either learned by long experience, or ſelected from the writings of the moſt eminent phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. As theſe receipts are publiſhed chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the uſe of perſons reſiding in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whoſe convenience or abilities, will not
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010783_0003_0F86F0C35A7DC8B8"/>
allow of the attendance of a phyſician or apothecary, I have ſtudied plainneſs in my ſtile, and in my directions, with regard to the treatment of diſeaſes, that I might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this treatiſe as uſeful as poſſible.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE favourable reception this work has met with, as is ſufficiently ſhewn by the remarkable quick ſale of the firſt large impreſſion, has induced the editor (to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the credit of what is really beneficial to the public, and add weight to the receipts) to publiſh the authorities from whence thoſe receipts were taken; and to make it ſtill more uſeful, has added the ſigns of diſeaſes, and ſome plain and conciſe directions for bleeding: he begs leave to remark, that although Dr. Theobald hath in general given no more than one receipt for the cure of one diſorder, yet he has been careful to ſelect ſuch, <hi>only,</hi> as upon long experience were found to be the beſt; and that although receipts are given for diſeaſes which are ſeldom cured, (as an apoplexy, conſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet if it is in the power of medicine to remove any of theſe complaints, there is the greateſt reaſon to imagine, that the remedies directed in this pamphlet will effect a cure.</p>

This is a certain and infallible cure; but care muſt be taken to adminiſter it only in the intervals of the fits; and it muſt be repeated for two or three days, about ten days after the firſt cure, or elſe the diſorder will frequently return. In obſtinate caſes, removing into a drier air has been found of great ſervice for perſons of robuſt conſtitutions after taking the ipecacoanha vomit. Dr. Mead directs a drachm of powder of myrrh to be taken an hour before the ague firſt comes on in a glaſs of ſack.</p>

Firſt, the wet cloaths ſhould be ſtripped off, and the body ſtrongly rubbed with dry coarſe cloths, and put as ſoon as poſſible into a well heated bed; and this rubbing muſt be continued a conſiderable time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Some perſon ſhould force his own warm breath into the drowned perſon's lungs, and alſo the ſmoke of tobacco by means of a pipe or funnel introduced into the mouth, ſtopping the ſufferer's noſtrils cloſe at the ſame time. If a ſurgeon can be procured, the jugular vein, or any large vein in the neck, ſhould be opened, and ten or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010783_0026_0F86F0DB4B8D36E0"/>
twelve ounces of blood taken away. This vein is to be preferred, becauſe it is ſeldom that any other vein will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any quantity of blood under theſe circumſtances. The ſmoke of tobacco ſhould alſo be thrown up into the bowels by the fundament, by introducing the ſmall end of a tobacco pipe well lighted up, the bowl of it wrapped up in a paper in which ſeveral holes are pricked, and through theſe the breath is to be ſtrongly forced. Two pipes, may be thus lighted and applied, the one to the anus, and the other to the mouth, at the ſame time. The ſtrongeſt volatiles ſhould alſo be applied to the patient's noſtrils. It is uſeleſs, and even dangerous, to pour much liquid of any kind into the mouth, as long as the patient ſhews no ſigns of life; but as ſoon as he diſcovers any motion, he ſhould take five or ſix ſpoonfuls of a ſtrong decoction of carduus benedictus ſweetned with honey; and, if nothing elſe can be had, ſome warm water, with the addition of a little common ſalt. Laſtly, notwithſtanding we diſcover ſome tokens of life, we ſhould not ceaſe to continue our aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſince they ſometimes irrecoverably expire after theſe firſt appearances of recovering.</p>
               <p>Having pointed out the moſt effectual means of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering drowned perſons, I ſhall juſt mention thoſe which it is the general cuſtom to uſe in the firſt hurry.

The method of rolling them in an empty hogſhead is dangerous, and loſes a deal of important time. The hanging them up by the feet is alſo dangerous, and ſhould be diſcontinued, ſince the froth, which is one of the cauſes of their death, is too thick and viſcid to diſcharge itſelf by its own weight, and this poſture tends to increaſe the over-fulneſs of the head and lungs. The covering the perſon with hot aſhes, hot ſand, or hot ſalt, has often ſucceeded, and may be tried, but ſhould not make the aſſiſtants leſs attentive to the other methods already directed to be uſed for the recovery of the drowned perſon.</p>

               <head>Directions for preſerving Health, and attaining long Life.</head>
               <p>HEALTH has been ever eſteemed the firſt of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and conſequently every endeavour towards its preſervation, deſerves encouragement. This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion induces me to publiſh the following remarks, from a thorough conviction of the truth they contain; which ought, with every honeſt man, to outweigh every timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of its reception, and give him courage to offer, at all riſques, what, by well-grounded experience, appears to him, (from its nature) of general utility to mankind.</p>
               <p>The air, which is a fluid elaſtic ſubſtance that ſurrounds us on all ſides, penetrates our bodies, and yet is ſo fine, that it eſcapes the ſight, is rarified by heat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed by cold: it is ſo neceſſary, that an animal cannot live a moment without it; it ſerves for reſpiration or breathing, and is ſuſceptible of different qualities; it may be hot, moiſt, cold, dry, ſerene, pure, and temperate. It is ſubject to variations more or leſs ſudden, and to be mixed with impure, corrupted, infectious vapours, which are prejudicial to health. The ſudden changes of the air are dangerous; whence proceed a great number of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which reign in the ſpring and autumn. Towards the approach of winter, hoſpitals, priſons, places where armies are encamped, places where lead is melted, and the earth juſt thrown up, near dunghills, &amp;c. are unhealthy, on account of the bad exhalations. Too hot an air occaſions malignant and putrid fevers: a cold and moiſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the air produces coughs, pleuriſies, rheumatiſms, agues, &amp;c. for inſtance, agues are common in the Fens of Cambridgeſhire and Lincolnſhire, and the Hundreds of Eſſex, on account of their marſhy ſituation, and the moiſt vapours which weaken the fibres of the body, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the pores of the ſkin, and conſequently diminiſh the diſcharge of the ſkin, called inſenſible perſpiration. Hence it appears, that, to preſerve health, dunghills ſhould never be placed too near the dwelling-houſe, ſince the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted vapours which are continually exhaling from them, cannot ſail being in time prejudicial, and cauſing malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fevers; for though thoſe who are uſed to them, do
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010783_0057_0F86F10123F093A8"/>
not preceive their offenſiveneſs, yet the cauſe does not ceaſe its unwholſome activity.</p>
               <p>From what has been obſerved with reſpect to hoſpitals and jails, the neceſſity of daily opening the windows of a bedchamber muſt clearly appear, to prevent the bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which ariſe from ſoul and confined air; and why houſes ſhould be built rather raiſed above the level of the earth, than ſunk beneath its ſurface; and the expoſure of the front ſhould be to the ſouth-eaſt, this being the moſt wholeſome aſpect.</p>
               <p>Our conſtitution, from the loſs it daily ſuſtains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be repaired by aliment and drink; hence a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their general kinds and qualities is neceſſary, in order to make a proper choice thereof.</p>
               <p>The principal and moſt general food is bread, made of wheat, barley, rye, or oats: wheaten bread is moſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; barley is dry; rye and oats laxative. The cruſt is moſt eaſy of digeſtion; the crumb more oily and heavy; though other mealy ſubſtances, beans, peaſe, potatoes, &amp;c. nouriſh much, but are windy, heavy, and viſcid, and their conſtant uſe is apt to cauſe obſtructions, unleſs a great deal of exerciſe is uſed. Rice is emollient and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; but nuts, almonds, and cheſnuts, &amp;c. though they abound with nutritious particles, are hard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
               <p>Pulpy, tart fruits, which abound with juice, eaten ripe, are refreſhing, cooling, quench thirſt, and are eaſy of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; ſuch as ſtrawberries, raſberries, currants, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, gooſeberries, cherries, apples, pears, appricots, peaches, nectarines, &amp;c. Remark, contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prejudice which generally prevails, that fruits are hurtful in the bloody flux, and even occaſion this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they may be eaten with great ſafety in the bloody flux, and are indeed the real preſervatives againſt it, as is confirmed by the experience of the moſt eminent phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: the cauſe of this diſorder being an exceſs of fleſh meats, too moiſt a ſtate of the air, a ſucceſſion of cold ſhowers to violent heats, and uncleanlineſs. In fact, this diſorder has been obſerved leſs frequent, and leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when fruits were plenty and cheap; ſo that to eſcape this diſtemper when it is riſe, ripe fruits are to be eaten in plenty, and the quantity of fleſh meats are to be leſſened conſiderably.</p>

Chocolate nouriſhes greatly, ſtrengthens the ſtomach, helps digeſtion, and ſoftens ſharp humours; whence it is proper for weak ſtomachs and conſumptive perſons. Broths and ſoups abound with a ſoft, moiſtning, nutritious jelly, whence they are great reſtoratives. Meat that is roaſted, contains an excellent nouriſhing juice, the moiſt parts being diſſipated by the fire. Things that are tried, are only proper for ſtrong ſtomachs.</p>
               <p>Drink reſtores the fluid parts of the body, and helps di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; the principal and moſt ſalutary is water, of which the ſofteſt is beſt, which is known by its lathering eaſily with ſoap; but taken in too great quantities, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes and weakens the ſtomach, and cauſes many diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Wine in moderation ſtrengthens the ſolids, and promotes digeſtion; but if uſed in exceſs, as well as bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, rum, and all other ſpirituous liquors, hardens the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, weakens the nerves, deſtroys the appetite, and cauſes gout, ſtone, and other chronic diſeaſes; that malt liquor is the wholeſomeſt which is the lighteſt and cleareſt; for then it does not offend the ſtomach, but paſſes readily

through the emunctories or ſtrainers of the body, and particularly by urine; whence the beſt beer does not make the head ach nor grow ſour on the ſtomach, nor cauſe wind. The making wholeſome beer depends greatly on the ſoftneſs of the water, the proper boiling of the ingredients, and a due working of the wo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t; for all thick, muddy, or ſtale beer, not ſufficiently boiled, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders the head, cauſes wind in the ſtomach, obſtructions, the ſtrangury, aſthmas, cholics, and ulcers in the legs. Tea, uſed in moderation, promotes perſpiration, or the diſcharge by the ſkin, ſtrengthens the ſtomach, and helps digeſtion; but that kind of tea which is called hyſon, is improper for perſons who have weak nerves or ſubject to hyſteric diſorders. Coffee, drank after dinner, is thought to quicken digeſtion, and allay the fumes of wine; but if uſed in exceſs, it agitates the blood, cauſes watching, and promotes hemorrhages or bleedings from the noſe, or other parts.</p>
               <p>Spices, pepper, &amp;c. are pernicious, when uſed to create an appetite; whence made diſhes are bad; for the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite cauſed by the quality and difference of the victuals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites perſons to eat more than the ſtomach can well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; which cauſes indigeſtion, and frequently dangerous and fatal diſorders. With reſpect to diet, the ſureſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preſerving health, is to live on plain, ſimple food, lightly ſeaſon'd, in that quantity which, by experience, nature has been found to require. Perfect digeſtion is the beſt rule for regulating a meal, which is known from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being more lively and briſk after a meal than before. Hiſtory furniſhes us with many examples of perſons, who, by temperance, has lived to a very advanced age, though of weakly conſtitutions naturally; wherefore thoſe that are deſirous of life and health, ſhould imitate their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living; ſince exceſſes in eating and drinking are both extremely dangerous.</p>
               <p>Strong, robuſt, young people, who uſe much exerciſe, ought to eat more than others, and may be free with the groſſer kinds of food; for their ſtomachs being ſtrong, the lighter foods would digeſt too eaſily, and be diſſipated too ſoon. Perſons of a weak conſtitution, or who are juſt recovered from a diſeaſe, ſhould uſe ſoft, light foods, agreeable to the ſtomach. Children, whoſe ſtomachs are weak, and veſſels fine, ought to uſe a light, thin, ſoft

Nurſes ſhould obſerve an exact diet, and ſhun violent paſſions of all kinds; for they diſturb digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and communicate their bad effects to the child. When children are weaned, they ſhould not be accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſpirituous liquors, or ſtrong food, eſpecially ſalt or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

At all times of life, but eſpecially in old age, the conſtant uſe of ſalt and ſmoaked meats tends to harden and ſtiffen the ſolid parts of the body, inſtead of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good nouriſhment; being hard of digeſtion: in old age the fluids are more thick, ſecretious, more ſlow, and the ſolids harder than in youth; therefore they require a more ſoft, moiſtning diet, eaſy of digeſtion, and not too much at a time, eſpecially of a night.</p>
               <p>All great changes ought to be brought about inſenſibly, for cuſtom is a ſecond nature, and an acquired habit is hard to be left off. Many perſons enjoy a good ſtate of health when their meat and drink are very indifferent, by being accuſtomed thereto; and are apt to be ſick, when they attempt to change their manner of life. Cuſtom confines us to certain hours, but hunger points out the beſt time of eating. In age, where ſtrength is wanting, and in youth, wherein there is a great diſſipation, when much is not eaten at a time, ſomething taken between the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not improper. It is neceſſary to obſerve, that when the ſtomach is bad, perſons ſhould not begin to eat again, till the laſt meal is digeſted.</p>
               <p>Perſons who are much fatigued ſhould reſt before eating; and, in caſes of diſtreſs and ſorrow, the food ſhould be now light, and ſmall in quantity, becauſe the ſtomach is weak at thoſe times.</p>
               <p>The ſtomach will admit of groſſer food in winter than ſummer. Thoſe who eat in a hurry, without much chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are ſubject to indigeſtion; for digeſtion depends in part on well chewing the food, and thereby intimately

mixing it with the ſpittle; for this reaſon light foods are moſt proper for children, and old perſons who have loſt their teeth.</p>
               <p>Vegetables are more difficult of digeſtion than animal food, therefore improper for weak ſtomachs. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, light food, ſuch as veal, lamb, chicken, fiſh, are the food which beſt agree with delicate conſtitutions. On the contrary, ſtronger habits are moſt ſubject to be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

In ſuch ſtrong ſtomachs, it is neceſſary to mix vegetables with the animal food, that the fermentation of the one may oppoſe the too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate digeſtion of the other by its acidity. Hence it is obvious, that weak ſtomachs ſhould abſtain from vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which require a greater degree of vital heat than even beef or mutton, to be converted into proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This, I hope, will ſatisfactorily explain the terms of eaſy and difficult digeſtion. The ſtomach, which can bear beef and water, cannot bear roaſted pig and water, from too great a power of digeſtion, not from any defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in thoſe faculties; therefore beef and mutton are more eaſy of digeſtion than lamb, or any of the white meats; and the contrary in weak ſtomachs. Surfeits, from lobſters, crabs, &amp;c. are of the kind which riſe from a too ſudden change of theſe ſubſtances in the ſtomach; therefore they ſhould be always eaten with vinegar or lemon juice. In fact, butter is no bad preſervative againſt ſurfeits in this inſtance; the oil blending with the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

It is beneficial to vary the ſcenes of life; to be ſometimes in the country, ſome-times in town; to go to ſea, to hunt, to be at reſt now and then; but more frequently to uſe exerciſe, becauſe a ſedentary life brings on many indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and renders the body weak and inactive; while, on the other hand, exerciſe and labour ſtrengthen it. But moderation is to be obſerved in all theſe things, and too much fatigue to be avoided; for too frequent and violent exerciſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſtate, in conſumptions, dropſies, cholics and nervous diſorders.</p>
               <p>In old age there is ſeldom ſufficient ſtrength to uſe bodily exerciſe, though ſo very requiſite for health; wherefore frictions with the fleſh-bruſh are neceſſary, at this time of life, to promote perſpiration, which ſhould be done by the perſon himſelf if poſſible.</p>
               <p>I have already taken notice, that cold ſtops the pores of the ſkin, and diminiſhes both ſweat and perſpiration. To avoid this inconvenience, the winter cloathing ſhould be put on pretty early in the ſeaſon, and be left off late; beſides care muſt be taken not to paſs too ſuddenly from hot into a cold air, and to forbear drinking any thing cold, when the body has been violently heated.</p>
               <p>The paſſions and affections of the mind, <abbr>viz.</abbr> joy, fear, anger, &amp;c. produce very ſenſible effects, and when too much given way to, have a very bad effect on health, for they affect the ſtomach, hinder digeſtion, and chylification; whence ariſe many terrible diſorders: wherefore it is beſt to keep them in bounds as much as poſſible, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an inward ſerenity, calmneſs, and tranquility.</p>
               <p>Exceſſive venery muſt be avoided, ſince the action of coition is very impetuous, and comes near to a convulſion. The animal heat is greatly leſſened thereby, the habit of body weakened wonderfully, and the whole nervous ſyſtem largely injured.</p>

               <head>RULES for nurſing SICK PERSONS.</head>
               <p>It is a great miſtake, to ſuppoſe that all diſtempers are cured by ſweating; and that, to procure ſweat, ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010783_0063_0F86F10C58506D20"/>
muſt take hot medicines, and keep themſelves very hot; for ſweating carries off the thinner part of the blood, leaving the remainder more dry, thick and inflamed, which muſt evidently increaſe the diſorder; for, inſtead of forcing out the watery part of the blood, we ſhould rather endeavour to increaſe it, by drinking freely of barley-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, balm tea, lemonade, or any other diluting liquor made luke warm. What has been already ſaid on the head of ſoul confined air, ſhews the abſurdity of ſtifling the ſick perſon with the heat of a cloſe apartment, and a load of bed-cloaths; for theſe two cauſes are ſufficient alone to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a fever, even in an healthy perſon. By letting in a little freſh air now and then into a ſick perſon's room, and leſſening the bed-cloaths, you will almoſt always perceive the fever and oppreſſion in ſome meaſure abate. Inſtead of venice treacle, ſaffron, gaſcoign powder, and other heating medicines, in all feveriſh diſorders, the belly ſhould be kept moderately open; whilſt thoſe medicines juſt mentioned render the body coſtive, and muſt neceſſarily have a bad effect.</p>
               <p>Fevers are aggravated by giving the ſick perſons food through fear of their dying of weakneſs; which food in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the diſorder, and renders it fatal. This fear is groundleſs; perſons in a fever may be ſupported, even for ſome weeks, with liquids only; and are ſtronger at the expiration of that time than if they had taken more ſolid nouriſhment; for, from the firſt attack of a fever, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſolid food is taken, even ſoup, eggs, biſcuit, &amp;c. corrupts in the ſtomach. If a man in perfect health was to eat ſtinking meat, rotten eggs, four broths, &amp;c. he would be ſeized with vomiting, load at the ſtomach, a purging, fever, and eruptions of the ſkin.</p>
               <p>The ſame articles, even in the ſoundeſt ſtate, given to a perſon in a fever, are quickly putrified, by the heat and diſeaſed matter already in his ſtomach, and in a few hours produce the ſame effects. Is it then poſſible to expect the leaſt ſervice from them? No: as long as a ſick perſon has a bad humour in his ſtomach, his weakneſs increaſes, in proportion to the food he receives; for this food being corrupted by the infected matter already there, proves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of affording the leaſt nouriſhment; on the contrary, becomes an additional cauſe of the diſtemper. Beſides, to heat and cram the ſick perſon, is wholly oppoſite to what
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010783_0064_0F86F10DA18DFF10"/>
nature herſelf indicates: the burning heat of which they complain, the dryneſs of the lips, tongue, and throat, the high colour of their urine, their earneſt longing after cooling things, the pleaſure and benefit they receive from the admiſſion of freſh air into their chamber, are ſo many proofs that we ought to cool them moderately, by refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diluting liquors, ſuch as balm tea, lemonade, &amp;c. to promote an eaſy diſcharge of the vitiated humours. Thoſe who have the care of ſick perſons, ſhould particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly attend to this obſervation, that as long as there is any taſte of bitterneſs, ſickneſs, or deſire of reaching; bad breath, heat, and feveriſhneſs, with offenſive ſtools, and high-coloured urine made in a ſmall quantity only; ſo long all fleſh meats, ſoups, eggs, and all kind of food compoſed of any of them, and all heating medicines, wine, &amp;c. are ſo many abſolute poiſons.</p>
               <p>If the ſick perſon has not two motions for ſtool in the twenty four hours; if the urine is high coloured, the fever runs high, the pain of the head and loins conſiderable, a glyſter of warm water with ſweet oil, and a little common ſalt, ſhould be given once in a day. As long as the patient has ſtrength for it, he ſhould fit up out of bed an hour daily, and longer if he can bear it; but he ſhould not be raiſed whilſt in a ſweat. His linen ſhould be changed every other day, taking care that the clean linen is well aired; for nothing conduces more to continue the fever and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headedneſs, than confining the ſick conſtantly to their bed, and preventing their changing their foul linen.</p>
               <p>Perſons recovering from diſtempers, require great care and attention; in proportion to the abatement and decline of the fever, their quantity of food may be gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; and when the fever is entirely gone, the ſick perſon may venture on a little white meat, ſuch as chicken, rabbit, whitings, flounders, or other flat fiſh; but ſalmon, eels, carp, ſkait, haddock, and the like, are not to be ventured on 'till the recovery is abſolutely perfected: Soups, new-laid eggs, and a little wine diluted with water; but theſe are to be uſed with great moderation, becauſe the ſtomach, being extremely weakened by the diſeaſe, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable only as yet of a ſmall degree of digeſtion; and if the quantity of nouriſhment exceeds its power ever ſo little, it will not digeſt, but become putrid, and delay the recovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:010783_0065_0F86F10F4BA7BBF0"/>
To procure a compleat and perfect termination of acute diſeaſes, obſerve the following rules:</p>
               <p>Let perſons recovering, as well as thoſe who are ſick, take very little food at a time, and take it often.</p>
               <p>Let their meal conſiſt of one kind of food only, and let them chew their food well.</p>
               <p>Leſſen their quantity of drink; the beſt in general is wine and water; three parts water, to one part wine; for too great a quantity of liquids prevent the ſtomach from recovering its tone, and increaſes the tendency to a ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the legs.</p>
               <p>Riding on horſeback, as often as they are able, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary: the propereſt time for this exerciſe is in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>They ſhould eat nothing, or at moſt but very little, in the evening, as perſons in this ſtate are ſeldom quite ſo well towards night. Their ſleep will be the leſs diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this caution: ſeven or eight hours, at moſt, are as much as ſhould be allotted for lying in bed.</p>
               <p>A ſtool is not abſolutely neceſſary every day; but if the coſtiveneſs exceeds the ſecond day, a glyſter ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered; or ſooner, if the perſon feels uneaſy, is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or has the head-ach.</p>
               <p>If after ſome time they ſtill continue very weak, and their ſtomach is diſordered, and they have, from time to time, a little irregular fever, they ſhould take a tea-cup full of the decoction of the Peruvian bark, three or four times in a day, which may be prepared by boiling an ounce of the beſt bark in powder, in a quart of water, 'till two thirds are waſted away, and then adding to the remainder a gill of red wine.</p>
               <p>Labouring men muſt by no means return to work too ſoon after their recovery, left it prevent their ever getting perfectly well, and entirely recovering their loſt ſtrength.</p>

with advantage, as well as thoſe in which it is highly prejudicial. In all inflammatory diſeaſes, it ſhould by no means be omitted, as in the pleuriſy, and peripneumony, during the firſt days; but ſo ſoon as the ſymptoms of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration appear, expectorating medicines are the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means from which to expect relief, and the uſe of the lancet muſt be totally forbid. In the apoplexy, epilepſy, bloody-flux and inflammation of the bowels, bleeding muſt be repeated according to the exigence of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms: it is alſo uſeful, ſometimes to promote ſuppuration in large abceſſes, where nature is too much oppreſt by the violence of the inflammation. In inflammations of the eyes, bladder, or womb, iſchiatic pains, rheumatiſms, coughs, pleuriſy, head-achs, quinſeys, aſthmas, hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hages, and nephritic complaints, bleeding is of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſervice; but in every diſorder proceeding from a relaxed ſtate of the ſolid parts, and impoveriſhed ſtate of the blood, attended with a cachectic habit of body, ſuch as dropſies, jaundice, gout, &amp;c. bleeding muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from with the utmoſt caution, as it will, inſtead of relieving, greatly aggravate thoſe diſtempers.</p>

               <p>TAKE two ſcruples of calcined egg-ſhells, three times in a day, in a glaſs of any convenient liquor, drinking, after each doſe, a third part of the following decoction: Take two ounces of Caſtile ſoap, diſſolve it in a quart of ſoft water, and ſweeten it, according to your taſte, with honey or loaf ſugar. If this decoction is made in a copper veſſel, care muſt be taken that it is well tinn'd. The taking of theſe medicines muſt be continued for ſome time after the complaint ceaſes, left any part of the ſtone ſhould remain, which being rough and unequal, might occaſion exquiſite pain. It is common, after a few days uſe of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, to have an increaſe of pain in making water; at which time, a ſoft diet, emollient drinks, and reſt, are proper. For common drink, milk and water, or a decoction of marſhmallow roots, parſley, and liquorice, may be uſed; but if the perſon has been uſed to ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, ſmall punch, made without acid, may be drank ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. Artichoaks, aſparagus, ſpinnage, lettuces, ſucco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, parſley, turneps, carrots, potatoes, radiſhes, peas, &amp;c. may be ſafely uſed; but onions, leeks and celiery, are to be preferred to all other vegetables.</p>
               <p>The patient ought to drink no more of any liquor than is ſufficient to quench his thirſt, and he ſhould hold his water, as long as he can without great uneaſineſs, that it may have the longer time to act on the ſtone. If theſe medicines occaſion coſtiveneſs, it will be neceſſary now and then, at diſcretion, to take a doſe of Glauber's ſalt and manna.</p>
