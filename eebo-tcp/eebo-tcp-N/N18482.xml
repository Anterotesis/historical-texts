            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. FOR many Years I have had a Deſire of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tting down and laying together, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hinking, or Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might aſſiſt ſerious Perſons, who have not the Advantage of Learning, in underſtanding the New Teſtament. But I have been continually deterred from attempting any Thing of this Kind, by a deep Senſe of my own Inability: Of my Want not only of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſuch a Work, but much more of Experience and Wiſdom. This has often occaſioned my laying aſide the Thought. And when by much Importunity I have been prevailed upon to reſume it, ſtill I determined to delay it as long as poſſible, that (if it ſhould pleaſe GOD) I might finiſh my Work and my Life together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But having lately had a loud Call from GOD, to ariſe and go hence, I am convinced that, if I attempt any Thing of this Kind at all, I muſt not delay any longer. My Day is far ſpent, and (even in a natural Way) the Shadows of the Evening come on apace. And I am the rather induced to do what little I can in this Way, becauſe I can do nothing elſe: Being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by my preſent Weakneſs, from either Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or Preaching. But, bleſſed be GOD, I can ſtill read, and write, and think. O that it may be to his Glory!</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will be eaſily diſcerned, even from what I have ſaid already, and much more from the Notes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they were not principally deſigned for Men of Learning; who are provided with many other Helps: And much leſs for Men of long and deep Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Ways and Word of GOD. I deſire to ſit at their Feet, and to learn of them. But I write chiefly for plain, unlettered Men, who underſtand only their Mother-Tongue, and yet reverence and love
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023976_0004_0FC2A545B6DC3468"/>the Word of GOD, and have a Deſire to ſave their Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In order to aſſiſt theſe in ſuch a Meaſure as I am able, I deſign firſt to ſet down the Text itſelf, for the moſt Part, in the common <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, which is in general (ſo far as I can judge) abundantly the beſt that I have ſeen. Yet I do not ſay it is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being brought in ſeveral Places nearer to the Original. Neither will I affirm, That the <hi>Greek</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies from which this Tranſlation was made, are always the moſt correct. And therefore I ſhall take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as Occaſion may require, to make here and there a ſmall Alteration.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am very ſenſible this will be liable to Objections: Nay, to Objections of quite oppoſite Kinds. Some will probably think, the Text is altered too much; and others, that it is altered too little. To the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I would obſerve, That I have never knowingly, ſo much as in one Place, altered it, for Altering's Sake: But there, and there only, where, Firſt, The Senſe was made better, ſtronger, clearer, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Context: Secondly, Where the Senſe being equally good, the Phraſe was better or nearer the Original. To the latter, who think the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too few, and that the Tranſlation might have been nearer ſtill, I anſwer, This is true; I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it might. But what valuable End would it have anſwered, to multiply ſuch trivial Alterations, as add neither Clearneſs nor Strength to the Text? This I could not prevail upon myſelf to do: So much the leſs, becauſe there is, to my Apprehenſion, I know not what, peculiarly ſolemn and venerable in the Old Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of our Tranſlation. And ſuppoſe this to be a miſtaken Apprehenſion, and an Inſtance of human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; yet is it not an excuſable Infirmity, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with what we have been long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to, and to love the very Words, by which GOD has often conveyed Strength or Comfort to our Souls?</p>
            <p n="6">6. I have endeavoured to make the Notes as ſhort as poſſible, that the Comment may not obſcure or ſwallow up the Text: And as plain as poſſible, in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of my main Deſign, To aſſiſt the unlearned Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:023976_0005_0FC2A549771549B0"/>For this Reaſon I have ſtudiouſly avoided, not only all curious and critical Enquiries, and all Uſe of the learned Languages, but all ſuch Methods of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and Modes of Expreſſion, as People in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Life are unacquainted with: For the ſame Reaſon, as I rather endeavour to obviate than to propoſe and anſwer Objections, ſo I purpoſely decline going deep into many Difficulties, leſt I ſhould leave the ordinary Reader behind me.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I once deſigned to write down, barely what occurred to my own Mind, conſulting none but the inſpired Writers. But no ſooner was I acquainted with that great Light of the Chriſtian World (lately gone to his Reward) <hi>Bengelius,</hi> than I entirely changed my Deſign, being throughly convinced, it might be of more Service to the Cauſe of Religion, were I barely to tranſlate his <hi>Gnomon Novi Teſtamenti,</hi> than to write many Volumes upon it. Many of his excellent Notes I have therefore tranſlated. Many more I have abridged; omitting that Part which was purely critical, and giving the Subſtance of the reſt. Thoſe various Readings likewiſe which he has ſhewed to have a vaſt Majority of ancient Copies and Tranſlations on their Side, I have without Scruple incorporated with the Text: Which after his Manner I have divided all along (tho' not omitting the common Diviſion into Chapters and Verſes, which is of Uſe on various Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts) according to the Matter it contains, making a larger or ſmaller Pauſe, juſt as the Senſe requires. And even this is ſuch an Help in many Places, as one who has not tried it can ſcarcely conceive.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I am likewiſe indebted for ſome uſeful Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s <hi>Theological Lectures:</hi> And for many more to Dr. <hi>Guyſe,</hi> and to the <hi>Family Expoſitor</hi> of the late pious and learned Dr. <hi>Doddridge.</hi> It was a Doubt with me for ſome Time, whether I ſhould not ſubjoin to every Note I received from them, the Name of the Author from whom it was taken; eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had tranſcribed ſome, and abridged many more, almoſt in the Words of the Author. But upon farther Conſideration, I reſolved to name none, that nothing might divert the Mind of the Reader from keeping
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023976_0006_0FC2A5566C385BB8"/>cloſe to the Point in View, and receiving what was ſpoke, only according to its own intrinſic Value.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I cannot flatter myſelf ſo far (to uſe the Words of one of the above-named Writers) as to imagine that I have fallen into no Miſtakes, in a Work of ſo great Difficulty. But my own Conſcience acquits me of having deſignedly miſrepreſented any ſingle Paſſage of Scripture, or of having written one Line, with a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of inflaming the Hearts of Chriſtians againſt each other. GOD forbid that I ſhould make the Words of the moſt gentle and benevolent JESUS, a Vehicle to convey ſuch Poiſon. Would to GOD that all the Party Names, and unſcriptural Phraſes and Forms, which have divided the Chriſtian World, were forgot: And that we might all agree to ſit down together, as humble, loving Diſciples, at the Feet of our common Maſter, to hear his Word, to imbibe his Spirit, and to tranſcribe his Life in our own!</p>
            <p n="10">10. Concerning the Scriptures in general, it may be obſerved, the Word of the Living GOD, which directed the firſt Patriarchs alſo, was, in the Time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> committed to Writing. To this were added, in ſeveral ſucceeding Generations, the inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the other Prophets. Afterwards, what the Son of GOD preached, and the HOLY GHOST ſpake by the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts wrote. This is what we now ſtile the <hi>Holy Scripture:</hi> This is that <hi>Word of</hi> GOD <hi>which remaineth for ever:</hi> Of which, tho' <hi>Heaven and Earth paſs away, one Jot or Tittle ſhall not paſs away.</hi> The Scripture therefore of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> is a moſt ſolid and precious Syſtem of Divine Truth. Every Part thereof is worthy of GOD; and all together are one entire Body, wherein is no Defect, no Exceſs. It is the Fountain of heavenly Wiſdom, which they who are able to taſte, prefer to all Writings of Men, however wiſe, or learned, or holy.</p>
            <p n="11">11. An exact Knowledge of the Truth was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in the inſpired Writers with an exactly regular Series of Arguments, a preciſe Expreſſion of their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a genuine Vigour of ſuitable Affections. The Chain of Argument in each Book is briefly exhibited in
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:023976_0007_0FC2A55B2FF85D70"/>the Table preſixt to it, which contains alſo the Sum thereof, and may be of more Uſe, than prefixing the Argument to each Chapter; the Diviſion of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> into Chapters, having been made in the dark Ages, and very incorrectly; often ſeparating Things that are cloſely joined, and joining thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſtinct from each other.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In the Language of the Sacred Writings, we may obſerve the utmoſt Depth, together with the utmoſt Eaſe. All the Elegancies of human Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſink into nothing before it: GOD ſpeaks not as Man, but as GOD. His Thoughts are very deep; and thence his Words are of inexhauſtible Virtue. And the Language of his Meſſengers alſo is exact in the higneſt Degree: For the Words which were given them, accurately anſwered the Impreſſion made upon their Minds: and hence <hi>Luther</hi> ſays, <q>Divinity is nothing but a Grammar of the Language of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> To underſtand this throughly, we ſhould obſerve the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> which lies on every Word; the holy <hi>Affections</hi> expreſt thereby, and the <hi>Tempers</hi> ſhewn by every Writer. But how little are theſe, the latter eſpecially, regarded? Tho' they are wonderfully diffuſed thro' the whole <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and are in Truth a continued Commendation of Him, who acts, or ſpeaks, or writes.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is, all thoſe Sacred Writings in which the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> or Covenant is deſeribed. The former Part of this contains the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles: The latter, the Revelation of JESUS CHRIST. In the former is, firſt, the Hiſtory of JESUS CHRIST, from his Coming in the Fleſh, to his Aſcenſion into Heaven; then, the Inſtitution and Hiſtory of the Chriſtian Church, from the Time of his Aſcenſion. The Revelation delivers what is to be, with regard to CHRIST, the Church, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, till the Conſummation of all Things.</p>

The <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood it of a temporal Kingdom, the Seat of which they ſuppoſed would be <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the expected Sovereign of this Kingdom, they learned from <hi>Daniel</hi> to call <hi>the Son of Man.</hi>

If he had only forbidden, the being <hi>angry without a Cauſe,</hi> there was no manner of need of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Declaration, <hi>I ſay unto you;</hi> for the Scribes and Phariſees them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſaid as much as this. Even they taught, Men ought not to be angry <hi>without a Cauſe.</hi> So that this <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> does not <hi>exceed</hi> theirs.

Were this plain and neceſſary Diſtinction thoroughly<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023976_0029_0FC2A5BD013105F0"/>underſtood, remembered, practiſed. <hi>Raca</hi> means, a ſilly Man, a Trifler. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay, thou fool</hi>—Shall revile or ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach any Man. Our LORD ſpecified three Degrees of Murder, each liable to a ſorer Puniſhment than the other: Not indeed from Men, but from GOD. <hi>Hell-fire</hi>—In the Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> (whence the Word in the Original is taken) the children were uſed to be burnt alive to <hi>Molocb.</hi> It was afterwards made a Receptacle for the Filth of the City, where continual Fires were kept to conſume it. And it is probable, if any Criminals were burnt alive, it was in this accurſed and horrible Place. Therefore both as to its former and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter State, it was a fit Emblem of Hell. It muſt here ſignify a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of future Puniſhment, as much more dreadful than thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the two former Caſes, as Burning alive is more dreadful than either Strangling or Stoning.</p>

                              <hi>Therefore ye ſhall be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect</hi>—So the Original runs, referring to all that Holineſs, which is deſcribed in the foregoing Verſes, which our LORD in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter recommends as Happineſs, and in the Cloſe of it as Perfection. </p>
                           <p>And how wiſe and gracious is this, To ſum up, and as it were, ſeal all his Commandments with a Promiſe! Even the proper Promiſe of the Goſpel, That He will <hi>put</hi> thoſe <hi>Laws in our Minds, and writs them in our Hearts!</hi> He well knew, how ready our Unbelief would be, to cry out, This is impoſſible! And therefore ſtakes upon it all the Power. Truth, and Faithfulneſs of Him, to whom all Things are poſſible.</p>

None but GOD can give Men Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to preach his Word. <hi>Go not</hi>—Their Commiſſion was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined now, becauſe the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was deferred till after the more plentiful Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt on the Day of <hi>Penticoſt.

                              <hi>Caſt out devils</hi>—It is a great Relief to the Spirits of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, ſinking under a Dread, that poſſibly the Goſpel may be true, to find it obſerved by a learned Brother, that the Diſeaſes therein aſcribed to the Operation of the Devil, have the very ſame Symptoms, with the natural Diſeaſes of Lunacy, Epilepſy, or Convulſions; whence he readily and very willingly concludes, that the Devil had no Hand in them. </p>
                           <p>But it were well to ſtop and conſider a little. Suppoſe GOD ſhould ſuffer an evil Spirit to uſurp <hi>the ſame power</hi> over a Man's Body, as the Man himſelf has naturally; and ſuppoſe him actually to exerciſe that Power; could we conclude the Devil had no Hand therein, becauſe his Body was bent in the very ſame Manner, wherein the Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might have bent it naturally?</p>
                           <p>And ſuppoſe GOD gives an evil Spirit a greater Power, to affect immediately the Origin of the Nerves in the Brain, by irritating them to produce violent Motions, or ſo relaxing them that they can produce little or no Motion; ſtill the Symptoms will be thoſe of over tenſe Nerves, as in Madneſs, Epilepſies, Convulſions; or of relaxed Nerves, as in paralytic Caſes. But could we conclude thence, that the Devil had no Hand in them? Will any Man affirm that GOD cannot or will not, on any Occaſion whatever, give ſuch a Power to an evil Spirit? Or that Effects, the like of which may be produced by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes, cannot poſſibly be produced by preternatural? If this be poſſible, then he who affirm it was ſo, in any particular Caſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtly charged with Falſehood, merely for affirming the Reality of a poſſible Thing. Yet in this Manner are the Evangeliſts treated<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023976_0052_0FC2A6381BC60FC8"/>by thoſe unhappy Men, who above all Things dread the Truth of the Goſpel, becauſe, if it is true, they are of all Men the moſt miſerable.</p>

Great Croſſes are Occaſions of great Improvement: And the little ones, which come daily, and even hourly, make up in Number, what they want in Weight.

Every Event therefore declares to us the Will of GOD, to which thus declared, we ſhould heartily ſubmit. We ſhould renounce our own to embrace it; we ſhould approve and chuſe what his Choice warrants as beſt for us. Herein ſhould we exerciſe ourſelves continually; this ſhould be our Practice all the Day long. We ſhould in Humility accept the little Croſſes that are diſpenſed to us, as thoſe that beſt ſuit our Weakneſs. Let us bear theſe little Things, at leaſt for GOD's Sake, and prefer his Will to our own in Matters of ſo ſmall Importance. And his Goodneſs will accept theſe mean Oblations; for He depiſeth not the Day of ſmall Things.</p>

                           <p>More largely this obſcure Text might be paraphraſed thus:</p>
                           <p>As every Burnt-offering was ſalted with Salt, in order to its being caſt into the Fire of the Altar, ſo every one who will not part with his Hand or Eye, ſhall fall a Sacrifice to divine Juſtice, and be caſt into Hell-fire, which will not conſume, but preſerve him from a Ceſſation of Being. And on the other Hand, every one who denying himſelf and taking up his Croſs, offers up himſelf as a living Sacrifice to GOD, ſhall be ſeaſoned with Grace, which like Salt will make him ſavoury, and preſerve him from Deſtruction for ever.</p>
                           <p>As <hi>Salt is good</hi> for preſerving Meats, and making them ſavoury, ſo it is good that ye be ſeaſoned with Grace, for the purifying your Hearts and Lives, and for ſpreading the Savour of my Knowledge, both in your own Souls, and wherever ye go. But as Salt if it loſes its Saltneſs is fit for nothing, ſo ye, if ye loſe your Faith and Love, are fit for nothing but to be utterly deſtroyed. See therefore that Grace abide in you, and that ye no more contend, <hi>Who ſhall be greateſt?</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> THere was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain prieſt named Zacharias, of the courſe of Abia: and his wife <hi>was</hi> of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters 
of Aaron, and her name <hi>was</hi> Eliſabeth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord

before God, in the order of his courſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of the prieſt's office, his lot was to burn the incenſe, going into the temple of the 
Lord. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> And the whole multitude of the People were praying without, at the time of the incenſe, 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, ſtanding on the right ſide of the altar of incenſe.
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:023976_0209_0FC29D7E897831C0"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> And Zacharias ſeeing <hi>him</hi> was troubled, and fear 
fell upon him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> But the angel ſaid to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Eliſabeth ſhall bear thee a ſon, and thou ſhall 
call his name John. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And thou ſhalt have joy and exultation, and many ſhall rejoice at his birth. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> For he ſhall be great before the Lord, and ſhall drink neither wine nor ſtrong drink; and he ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, even from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's 
womb. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> And many of the children of Iſrael 
ſhall he turn to the Lord their God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> And he ſhall go before him in the ſpirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt; to make

ready a people prepared for the Lord. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> And Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias ſaid to the angel, Whereby ſhall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife advanced 
in Years. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> And the Angel anſwering, ſaid to him, I am Gabriel, that ſtand in the preſence of God, and am ſent to ſpeak to thee, and to ſhew thee 
theſe glad tidings. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> And behold, thou ſhalt be dumb, and not able to ſpeak, till the day that theſe things are done, becauſe thou believedſt not my words, which ſhall be fulfilled in their ſeaſon. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried ſo long in the temple. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> And coming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſpeechleſs. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> And when the days of his miniſtration were accompliſhed, he went to his own houſe. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> And after theſe days, his wife Elizabeth conceived,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> And the angel ſaid to her, Fear not, Mary: for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> For with God, nothing ſhall be impoſſible. 
And Mary ſaid, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> And the angel departed from her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> And Mary aroſe in thoſe days, and went with haſte

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> And when Eliſabeth heard the ſalutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Eliſabeth 
was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> And cried with a loud voice and ſaid, Bleſſed <hi>art</hi> thou among women,

Mary ſaid, My ſoul doth magnify the Lord, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> And 
my ſpirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> For he hath regarded the low eſtate of his handmaid: for behold from henceforth all generations ſhall

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> Now Eliſabeth's full time came, that ſhe ſhould

But they held their peace. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And he took him and

                           <hi>This thy brother was dead and is alive</hi>—A thouſand of theſe delicate Touches in the inſpired Writings, eſcape an inattentive Reader. In the 30th Verſe the elder Son had unkindly and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſaid, <hi>This thy ſon.</hi> The Father in his Reply mildly reproves him, and tenderly ſays, <hi>This thy brother.</hi> Amazing Intimation, that the beſt of Men ought to account the worſt Sinners their Brethren ſtill; and ſhould eſpecially remember this Relation, when they ſhew any Inclination to return. </p>
                        <p>Our LORD in this whole Parable ſhews, not only that the Jews had no Cauſe to murmur at the Reception of the Gentiles (a Point which did not at that Time ſo directly fall under Conſideration) but that if the Phariſees were indeed as good as they ſancied themſelves to be, ſtill they had no Reaſon to murmur at the kind Treatment of any ſincere Penitent. Thus does He condemn them, even on their own Principles, and ſo leaves them without Excuſe.</p>
                        <p>We have in this Parable a lively Emblem of the Condition and Behaviour of Sinners in their natural State. Thus, when inriched by the Bounty of the great common Father, do they ungratefully run from him (ver. 12.) Senſual Pleaſures are eagerly purſued, till they have ſquandered away all the Grace of GOD (ver. 13.) And while theſe continue, not a ſerious Thought of GOD can ſind a Place in their Minds. And even when Afflictions come upon them (ver. 14.) ſtill they will make hard Shifts, before they will let the Grace of GOD, concurring with his Providence, perſuade them to think of a Return (ver. 15, 16)</p>
                        <p>When they ſee themſelves naked, indigent, and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>one, then they recover the Exerciſe of their Reaſon (ver. 17.) Then they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Bleſſings they have thrown away, and attend to the Miſery they have incurred. And hereupon they reſolve to return to their Father, and put the Reſolution immediately in Practice (ver. 18, 19.)</p>
                        <p>Behold with Wonder and Pleaſure, the gracious Reception <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſind, from divine, injured Goodneſs! When ſuch a Prodigal comes to his Father, He ſees him afar off (ver. 20.) He pities, meets, embraces him, and interrupts his Acknowledgments, with the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his returning Favour (ver. 21.) He arrays him with the Robe of a Redeemer's Righteouſneſs, with inward and outward Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, adorns him with all his ſanctifying Graces, and honours him with the Tokens of adopting Love (ver. 22.) And all this he does with unutterable Delight, in that he who was loſt is now found (ver. 23, 24.)</p>
                        <p>Let no elder Brother murmur at this Indulgence, but rather wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Prodigal back into the Family. And let thoſe who have been thus received, wander no more, but emulate the ſtricteſt Piety of thoſe who for many Years have ſerved their heavenly Father, and not tranſgreſſed his Commandments.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name <hi>was</hi> John. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The ſame came for a teſtimony, to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> He was not the light, but <hi>was ſent</hi> to teſtify of the

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And the word was made fleſh, and tabernacled among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> The next day he ſeeth Jeſus coming toward him, and ſaith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh

me; for he was before me. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> And I knew him not, but that he might be manifeſted to Iſrael, 
therefore am I come baptizing with water. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> And John teſtified, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from heaven as a dove, and it abode upon him. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> And I knew him not, but he that ſent me to baptize with water, he had ſaid to me, On whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and abiding on him, this is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Again, the next day, John was ſtanding, and two of his diſciples. And looking upon Jeſus

the two diſciples heard him ſpeak, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Jeſus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> And Jeſus turning and ſeeing them 
following, ſaith to them, What ſeek ye? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> They ſaid to him, Rabbi (that is, being interpreted, Maſter) where dwelleſt thou? He ſaith to them, 
Come and ſee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> They came and ſaw where he dwelt and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John <hi>ſpeak,</hi> 
and followed him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> He firſt findeth his own brother Simon, and ſaith to him, We have found the Meſſiah (which is, being interpreted, the Chriſt.) 
And he brought him to Jeſus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> And Jeſus looking upon him, ſaid, Thou art Simon, the Son of Jonah; thou ſhalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, Peter.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> The day following he was minded to depart into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and ſaith to him,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> Jeſus ſaw Nathanael coming toward him, and ſaith of him, Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no 
guile. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> Nathanael ſaith to him, Whence knoweſt thou me? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou waſt under the fig-tree, 
I ſaw thee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> Nathanael anſwered and ſaith to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art 
the king of Iſrael. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to him, Becauſe I ſaid to thee, I ſaw thee under the fig-tree, believeſt thou? Thou ſhalt ſee greater things than 
theſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> And he ſaith to him, Verily, verily I ſay to you, Hereafter ye ſhall ſee the heaven opened, and the angels of God aſcending and deſcending on the Son of man.</p>

When all Things began to be made by the Word: In the Beginning of Heaven and Earth, and this whole Frame of created Beings, <hi>the Word exiſted,</hi> without any Beginning. He was when all Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be, Whatſoever had a Beginning. <hi>The Word</hi>—So termed <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. and frequently by the Seventy, and in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe. So that St. <hi>John</hi> did not borrow this Expreſſion from <hi>Philo,</hi> or any Heathen Writer. He was not yet named <hi>Jeſus, or Chriſt.</hi> He is <hi>the Word</hi> whom the Father begot or <hi>ſpoke</hi> from Eternity; by whom the Father <hi>ſpeaking</hi> maketh all Things; who <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to us. We have, in the 18th Verſe, both a real Deſcription of the Word, and the Reaſon why He is ſo called. <hi>He is the only begotten Son of the Father, who is in the boſom of the Father, and hath declared him. And the Word was with God</hi>—Therefore diſtinct from GOD the Father. The Word rendered <hi>with</hi> denotes a perpetual Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency as it were of the Son to the Father, in Unity of Eſſence. He was <hi>with</hi> GOD alone; becauſe nothing beſide GOD had then any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>And the Word was God</hi>—Supreme, Eternal, Independent. There was no Creature, in reſpect of which He could be ſtiled GOD in a relative Senſe. Therefore He is ſtiled ſo in the abſolute Senſe. The Godhead of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> being clearly revealed in the Old Teſtament (<hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. 6. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> i. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxiii. 1.) the other Evangeliſts aim at this, To prove that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a true Man, was the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> But when at length ſome from hence began to doubt of his Godhead, then St. <hi>John</hi> expreſly aſſerted it, and wrote in this Book as it were a Supplement to the Goſpels, as in <hi>the Revelation,</hi> to the Prophets.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſaith to her, Woman, what <hi>is it</hi> to me and thee? 
Mine hour is not yet come. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> His mother ſaith to

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his bretheren, and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and they tarried there not many days. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> For the paſſover of the Jews was nigh, and Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem, 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And found in the temple them that ſold oxen, and ſheep, and doves, and 
the changers of money ſitting. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> And having made a ſcourge of ruſhes, he drove all out of the temple, both the ſheep and the oxen, and poured out the 
changers money, and overthrew the tables, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> And ſaid to them that ſold doves, Take theſe things hence; make not my Father's houſe an houſe of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to them, Deſtroy this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I will raiſe it up in three days. Then

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> When therefore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembered that he had ſaid this; and they believed the ſcripture, and the word which 
Jeſus had ſaid. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Now when he was in Jeruſalem at the Paſſover, on the feaſt day, many believed in his name, beholding the miracles which he did. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> But Jeſus did not truſt himſelf to them, becauſe 
he knew all men, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> And needed not that any ſhould teſtify of man; for he knew what was in man.</p>

                     <p>When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees had heard, Jeſus maketh and baptizeth more 
diſciples than John <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (Tho' Jeſus himſelf baptized 
not; but his diſciples) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> He left Judea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted 
again into Galilee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And he muſt needs go 
thro' Samaria. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Then cometh he to a city of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave 
to his ſon Joſeph. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Now Jacob's well was there. Jeſus therefore being wearied with the journey, ſat thus by the well. It was about the ſixth hour. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. 
Jeſus ſaith to her, Give me to drink. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> (For his 
diſciples were gone to the city to buy meat. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> ) Then ſaith the Samaritan woman to him, How doſt thou, being a Jew, aſk drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews have no dealings with the 
Samaritans. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to her, If thou hadſt known the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldſt have aſked of him, and he would have given thee
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:023976_0335_0FC2CB78DFAB4CC0"/>living water? The woman ſaith to him, Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: 
whence then haſt thou that living water? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himſelf drank thereof, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 
and his cattle? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water, will thirſt 
again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> But whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, will never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him, will become in him a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> The woman ſaith to him, Sir, give me this water, 
that I thirſt not, neither come hither to draw. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Jeſus ſaith to her, Go, call thy huſband, and come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The woman anſwered and ſaid, I have no 
huſband. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Jeſus ſaid to her, Thou haſt well ſaid, 
I have no huſband; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> For thou haſt had five huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and he whom thou now haſt, is not thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: 
this thou ſaidſt truly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> The woman ſaith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain: but ye
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:023976_0336_0FC2CB7F8AC654D0"/>ſay, that in Jeruſalem is the place where men 
ought to worſhip. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Jeſus ſaith to her, Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor at Jeruſalem, worſhip the 
Father. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Ye worſhip ye know not what; we know what we worſhip; for ſalvation is from the Jews. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and <hi>in</hi> truth; 
for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> God <hi>is</hi> a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip in 
ſpirit and <hi>in</hi> truth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> The woman ſaith to him, I know that the Meſſiah is coming, who is called Chriſt:
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:023976_0337_0FC2CB8065B81CD8"/>
when he is come, he will tell us all things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Jeſus 
ſaith to her, I that ſpeak to thee am <hi>He.</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman. Yet none ſaid, What ſeekeſt thou? Or, Why talkeſt thou with her?</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> The woman then left her water-pot, and went 
to the city, and ſaith to the men, Come, ſee a man who told me all things that ever I did: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> Is not this 
the Chriſt? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> In the mean time his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, 
Maſter, eat. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> But he ſaid to them, I have meat to 
eat that ye know not of. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> The diſciples ſaid one to 
another, Hath any man brought him to eat? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Jeſus ſaith to them, My meat is, to do the will of him that 
ſent me, and to finiſh his work. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Say ye not, There are yet four months, and the harveſt cometh? Lo, I ſay to you, Lift up your eyes, and ſurvey the fields,
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:023976_0338_0FC2CB84528CB010"/>
for they are white already to the harveſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal, that both he that ſoweth and he that reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth 
may rejoice together. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> And herein is the ſaying 
true, One ſoweth, and another reapeth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> I have ſent you to reap that whereon you have beſtowed no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: others have laboured, and ye are entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their labour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> And many of the Samaritans out of the city be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him, for the ſaying of the woman teſtifying, 
He told me all that ever I did. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> So when the Samaritans were come to him, they beſought him to 
tarry with them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> And he abode there two days. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> And many more believed, becauſe of his word, And ſaid to the wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r we have heard him ourſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> After the two days, he departed thence, and went 
into Galilee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> (Now Jeſus himſelf had teſtified,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> xiii. 57.</note> That 
a prophet hath not honour in his own country. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> ) And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, having ſeen all the things that he did in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem at the feaſt. For they alſo had come to the feaſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> So he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain 
nobleman, whoſe ſon was ſick at Capernaum. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> When
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:023976_0339_0FC2CB88B59018E0"/>he heard that Jeſus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and beſought him to come down and 
heal his ſon, for he was at the point of death. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> Jeſus ſaid to him, Unleſs ye ſee ſigns and wonders, ye will 
in no wiſe believe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> The nobleman ſaid to him, Sir 
come down, ere my child die. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Jeſus ſaid to him, Go; thy ſon liveth. And the man believed the word that 
Jeſus ſpake to him, and he went. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told <hi>him,</hi> ſaying, 
Thy ſon liveth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> Then he aſked of them the hour when he amended. And they ſaid to him, Yeſterday 
at the ſeventh hour the fever left him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> So the father knew <hi>it was</hi> at the ſame hour, in which Jeſus had ſaid to him, Thy ſon liveth. And himſelf believed, 
and his whole houſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> This ſecond miracle again Jeſus wrought, being come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>

waiting for the moving of the water. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For an angel went down at certain times into the bath, and the water was troubled: and whoſoever went in firſt, after the troubling of the water, was made whole, whatſoever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe 
he had. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And a certain man was there, who had

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The infirm man anſwered him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the bath, when the water is troubled; and the while I am coming, another ſteppeth down

I work. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Therefore the Jews ſought the more to kill him, becauſe he not only broke the ſabbath, but alſo ſaid that God was his own Father, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

                     <p>After theſe things Jeſus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, becauſe the Jews 
ſought to kill him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now the Jews' feaſt of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles 
was nigh. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> His brethren therefore ſaid to him, Depart hence and go into Judea, that thy diſciples <hi>there</hi> alſo may ſee the works which thou 
doſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For no man doth any thing in ſecret, but deſireth to be publickly known: if thou doſt theſe things, ſhew thyſelf to the world. (For neither 
did his brethren believe on him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ) Jeſus ſaith to them, My time is not yet come: your time is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways 
ways ready. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The world cannot hate you, but me 
it hateth; becauſe I teſtify of it, that its works are evil. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Go ye up to the feaſt; I go not up to this 
feaſt yet; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>y time is not yet fully come. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Having ſaid theſe things to them, he abode in Galilee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But when his brethren were gone up, then he alſo went up to the feaſt, not openly, but as it 
were privately. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Then the Jews ſought him at the 
feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him: for ſome ſaid, He is a good man, others
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:023976_0352_0FC2CBC26638B6B8"/>
ſaid, Nay; but he ſeduceth the people. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, no man ſpake openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Now at the middle of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the temple and taught. And the Jews mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> ſaying, How doth this man know letters, 
having never learned? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Jeſus anſwered them and ſaid, My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent 
me. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> If any man be willing to do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, 
or whether I ſpeak of myſelf. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory; but he that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the glory of him that ſent him, the ſame is 
true, and there is no unrighteouſneſs in him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Did not Moſes give you the law? Yet none of you 
keepeth the law. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Why ſeek ye to kill me? The people anſwered and ſaid, Thou haſt a devil. 
Who ſeeketh to kill thee? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel at it.
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:023976_0353_0FC2CBC400573FF0"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Moſes gave you circumciſion, (not that it is of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but of the fathers) and ye circumciſe a man 
on the ſabbath. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> If a man receive circumciſion on the ſabbath, that the law of Moſes may not be broken: Are ye angry at me, becauſe I entirely

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Then ſaid ſome of them of Jeruſalem, Is not this he whom they ſeek to kill? And lo he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth 
boldly, and they ſay nothing to him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Do the 
rulers know indeed, that this is the Chriſt? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we know this man, whence he is: but when Chriſt cometh, none knoweth whence he is: 
Then cried Jeſus in the temple as he taught, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Do ye both know me, and know whence I am? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> And yet I am not come of myſelf, but he 
that ſent me is true, whom ye know not. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath ſent 
me. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Then they ſought to ſeize him; but no man laid hands on him, becauſe his hour was not yet 
come. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> And many of the multitude believed on him, and ſaid, When Chriſt cometh, will he do 
more miracles than theſe which this man hath done? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> The Phariſees heard the multitude whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:023976_0354_0FC2CBC591E2EB20"/>ſuch things concerning him, and the Phariſees and the chief prieſts ſent officers to ſeize 
him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> Then ſaid Jeſus to them, Yet a little time I am with you, and <hi>then</hi> I go to him that ſent me. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Ye ſhall ſeek, and ſhall not find me, and where I am 
ye cannot come. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Then ſaid the Jews among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Whither will he go, that we ſhall not find him? Will he go to the diſperſed among the 
Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> What ſaying is this that he ſaid, Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find <hi>me?</hi> And where I am, ye cannot come?</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> On the laſt, the great <hi>day</hi> of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let

ſaid, Certainly this is the prophet. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> Others ſaid, 
This is the Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> But ſome ſaid, Doth Chriſt 
come out of Galilee? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> Hath not the ſcripture ſaid, That Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of David, and from<note n="*" place="bottom">Micah <hi>v. 2.</hi>
                        </note> Bethlehem, the town where David was? 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> So there was a diviſion among the people concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> And ſome of them would have ſeized 
him; but no man laid hands on him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> So the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers came to the chief prieſts and Phariſees; and they ſaid to them, Why have ye not brought 
him? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> The Officers anſwered, Never man ſpake 
like this man. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> The Phariſees anſwered, Are ye 
alſo deceived? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> Hath any of the rulers believed 
on him, or of the Phariſees? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> But this populace, 
who know not the law, are accurſed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> Nicodemus (he that came to him by night, being one of them) ſaith to them, Doth our law judge a man before it hear him, and know what he doth? 
They anſwered and ſaid to him, Art thou alſo a Galilean? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> Search and ſee, that out of Galilee

ariſeth no prophet. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> And every man went to his own houſe. But Jeſus went to the mount of Olives.</p>

He is a prophet. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his ſight, till they had called the parents of

                     <head>XI.</head>
                     <p>Now one Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of 
Mary and her ſiſter Martha, was ſick. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (It was <hi>that</hi> Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his Feet with her hair, whoſe brother 
Lazarus was ſick. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ) Therefore <hi>his</hi> Siſters ſent to him, ſaying, Lord, behold he whom thou loveſt is 
ſick. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Jeſus hearing <hi>it,</hi> ſaid, This ſickneſs is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of 
God may be glorified thereby. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now Jeſus loved 
Martha, and her ſiſter, and Lazarus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> So after he had heard that he was ſick, he abode ſtill two days 
in the place where he was. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Then after this he ſaith to the diſciples, Let us go into Judea again. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The diſciples ſay to him, Maſter, the Jews but now ſought to ſtone thee, and goeſt thou thither 
again? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Jeſus anſwered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light of this world.</p>
                     <pb n="374" facs="unknown:023976_0373_0FC2CC1C66D63708"/>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But if any man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, 
becauſe the light is not in him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Thus he ſpake, and after that he ſaith to them, Our friend 
Lazarus ſleepeth; but I go to awake him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Then the diſciples ſaid, Lord, if he ſleep, he will recover. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Jeſus ſpake of his death; but they thought he had 
ſpoken of the natural reſt in ſleep. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Then ſaid Jeſus 
to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> And I am glad for your ſake I was not there, that ye may believe: 
but let us go to him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Then ſaid Thomas called Didymus, to his fellow-diſciples, Let us alſo go, that we may die with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> When Jeſus came, he found he had been now 
four days in the tomb. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> (Now Bethany was near 
Jeruſalem, about fifteen Furlongs off. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> ) And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to 
comfort them concerning their brother. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> When Martha heard that Jeſus was coming, ſhe went and 
met him; but Mary ſat in the houſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Then ſaid Martha to Jeſus, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my 
brother had not died. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> But I know even now, that whatſoever thou wilt aſk of God, God will give <hi>it</hi> 
thee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Jeſus ſaith to her, thy brother ſhall riſe 
again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Martha ſaid to him, I know that he ſhall
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:023976_0374_0FC2CC204B6E50B8"/>riſe again in the reſurrection at the laſt day. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Jeſus ſaid to her, I am the reſurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, tho' he 
die, yet ſhall he live; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> And whoſoever liveth and believeth in me, ſhall not die for ever. 
Believeſt thou this? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> She ſaith to him, Yea, Lord, I believe thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God, who 
was to come into the world. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Having ſaid this ſhe went and privately called Mary her ſiſter, ſaying, 
the Maſter is come, and calleth for thee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> As ſoon as ſhe heard <hi>it</hi> ſhe aroſe quickly and came to 
him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Jeſus was not yet come into the town, but 
was at the place where Martha had met him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> The Jews then who were with her in the houſe and comforted her, ſeeing Mary, that ſhe aroſe up quickly and went out, followed her, ſaying, She 
is going to the tomb, to weep there. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> When Mary was come where Jeſus was, and ſaw him, ſhe fell at his feet, ſaying to him, Lord, if thou hadſt 
been here, my brother had not died. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> When Jeſus therefore ſaw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned deeply, 
and troubled himſelf, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> And ſaid, Where have ye laid him? They ſay to him, Lord, come and ſee.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Jeſus wept. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> Then ſaid the Jews, Behold, how he 
loved him! <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> And ſome of them ſaid, Could not this perſon who opened the eyes of the blind, have even cauſed that this man ſhould not have died?
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:023976_0375_0FC2CC225A79F058"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> Jeſus again groaning in himſelf, cometh to the 
tomb. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> It was a cave, and a ſtone lay upon it. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith, Take away the ſtone. Martha, the ſiſter of the deceaſed, ſaith to him, Lord, by this time 
he ſtinketh; for he hath been <hi>buried</hi> four days. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Jeſus ſaith to her, Said I not to thee, if thou wouldeſt believe, thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God? Then they took away the ſtone <hi>from</hi> where the dead lay. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> And Jeſus lifted up his eyes and ſaid, Father, I 
thank thee, that thou haſt heard me. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> And I knew that thou heareſt me always: but I ſpake this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the people who ſtand by, that they may 
believe that thou haſt ſent me. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> And having ſpoken thus, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus come 
forth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes, and his face was wrapt about with a napkin. Jeſus ſaith to them, Looſe him, and let him go.</p>
                     <pb n="377" facs="unknown:023976_0376_0FC2CC2F29E15BF8"/>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> Many therefore of the Jews who were come to Mary, and had ſeen the things, which Jeſus had 
done, believed on him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> But ſome of the went to the Phariſees, and told them what things Jeſus 
had done. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> Then the chief prieſts and elders aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a council and ſaid, What do we? For this 
man doth many miracles. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will 
come and ſubvert both our place and nation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high-prieſt that year, ſaid to them, Ye know nothing, 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Nor conſider, it is expedient for us, that one man ſhould die for the people, and that the whole nation 
periſh not. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> He ſpake not this of himſelf, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high-prieſt that year, he propheſied, that Jeſus 
ſhould die for the nation: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> And not for that nation only, but that he might alſo gather into one all the 
children of God that were ſcattered abroad. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:023976_0377_0FC2CC32D4333FD8"/>from that day, they conſulted together to put him to death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> Jeſus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country, near the wilderneſs, to a city called Ephraim, and there 
continued with his diſciples. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> And the paſſover of the Jews was nigh; and many went up to Jeruſalem, 
to purify themſelves. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> Then ſought they for Jeſus, and ſaid one to another, ſtanding in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feaſt? 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> Now both the chief prieſts and Phariſees had given order, That if any man know where he was, he ſhould ſhew <hi>it,</hi> that they might apprehend him.</p>

                     <p>Now before the feaſt of the paſſover, Jeſus knowing his hour was come, to paſs out of this world, to the Father, having loved his own who

were in the world, loved them to the end. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And while they were at ſupper (the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iſcariot, <hi>the ſon</hi> of 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Simon, to betray him) Jeſus knowing the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come forth from God, and going to God, 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Riſeth from ſupper, and layeth aſide his garments, 
and taking a towel, girded himſelf. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> After that, he poured water into the baſon, and began to waſh the feet of the diſciples, and to wipe <hi>them</hi> with the 
towel wherewith he was girded. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Then cometh he to Simon Peter, who ſaith to him, Lord, doſt thou 
waſh my feet? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to him, 
What I do, thou knoweſt not now; but thou ſhalt know hereafter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Peter ſaith to him, Thou ſhalt never waſh my feet. Jeſus anſwered him, If 
I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter ſaith to him, Lord, not my feet only, 
but alſo <hi>my</hi> hands and <hi>my</hi> head. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Jeſus ſaith to him, He who hath been bathed, needeth only to waſh <hi>his</hi> feet, and is clean all over: and ye are clean; 
but not all. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> For he knew who would betray him: therefore he ſaid, Ye are not all clean.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> So after he had waſhed their feet, and taken his garments, ſitting down again, he ſaid to them, 
Know ye what I have done to you? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Ye call me Maſter and Lord; and ye ſay well; for <hi>ſo</hi> I am. 
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> If I then, your Lord and Maſter, have waſhed your feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one another's

may do as I have done to you. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Verily, verily I ſay unto you, the ſervant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is ſent greater than he that ſent 
him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> If ye know theſe things, happy are ye, if

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Peter therefore beckoneth to him, to aſk who it was 
of whom he ſpake. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> He then, leaning on the breaſt of Jeſus, ſaith to him, Lord, who is it? 
Jeſus anſwered, It is he to whom I ſhall give the ſop when I have dipped it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> And having dipped the ſop, he giveth it to Judas Iſcariot, <hi>the ſon</hi> of 
Simon. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> And after the ſop, then Satan entered into 
him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Then ſaid Jeſus to him, What thou doſt, do quickly. Now none at the table knew, why 
he ſaid this to him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> But ſome thought, as Judas had the purſe, that Jeſus had ſaid to him, Buy what we have need of againſt the feaſt, or, Give 
ſomething to the poor. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> He then having received the ſop, went out immediately. And it was night when he went out.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Jeſus ſaith, Now is the Son of man glorified,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples,

now, I will lay down my life for thy ſake? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> Jeſus anſwered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my ſake? Verily, verily I ſay to thee, the cock ſhall not have crowed, till thou haſt denied me thrice.</p>

                     <p>After theſe things Jeſus manifeſted himſelf again to the diſciples at the ſea of Tiberias; he 
manifeſted <hi>himſelf</hi> thus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <hi>ſons</hi> of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedee, 
and two other of his diſciples. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Simon Peter ſaith to them, I go a fiſhing. They ſay to him, We alſo go with thee. They went out and entered into the veſſel, but caught nothing that 
night. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> When the morning was come, Jeſus ſtood on the ſhore; but the diſciples knew not that it 
was Jeſus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Then Jeſus faith to them, Children, have ye any meat? They anſwered him, No. 
And he ſaid to them, Caſt your net on the right ſide of the veſſel, and ye ſhall find. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> They caſt therefore, and now they were not able to draw it, 
for the multitude of fiſhes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Then the diſciple whom Jeſus loved ſaith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter hearing that it was the Lord, girt on his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coat (for he was ſtript) and threw himſelf into 
the ſea. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> And the other diſciples came in the veſſel
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:023976_0413_0FC2C85C56246948"/>(for they were not far from land, about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred 
cubits) drawing the net <hi>full</hi> of fiſhes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> When they came to land they ſee a fire of coals there, and 
fiſh laid thereon, and bread. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Jeſus ſaith to them, 
Bring of the fiſhes which ye have taken now. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter went on board, and drew the net to land, full of great fiſhes, an hundred and fifty and three; and tho' there were ſo many, the net was 
not broken. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Jeſus ſaith to them, Come ye <hi>and</hi> dine. And none of the diſciples preſumed to aſk him, Who art thou? Knowing that it was the 
Lord. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Jeſus then cometh and taketh bread, and 
giveth to them, and fiſh likewiſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> This was the third time that Jeſus ſhewed himſelf to his diſciples, after he was riſen from the dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> When they had dined, Jeſus ſaith to Simon Peter, Simon, <hi>ſon</hi> of Jonah, loveſt thou me more than theſe <hi>do?</hi> He ſaith to him, Yea, Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I love thee. He ſaith to him, Feed my 
lambs. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> He ſaith to him again, the ſecond time, Simon, <hi>ſon</hi> of Jonah, loveſt thou me? He ſaith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee. 
He ſaith to him, Feed my ſheep. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> He ſaith to him the third time, Simon, <hi>ſon</hi> of Jonah, loveſt thou me? Peter was grieved, becauſe he ſaid to him the third time, Loveſt thou me? And he ſaid to him, Lord, thou knoweſt all things; thou knoweſt that I love thee. Jeſus ſaith to him, Feed my ſheep:
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:023976_0414_0FC2C8696C93E168"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, when thou waſt young, thou didſt gird thyſelf, and walk whither thou wouldeſt: but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch out thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry <hi>thee</hi> whither thou wouldeſt not. 
This he ſaid, ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorify God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> And having ſaid this, he ſaith to 
him, Follow me. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Peter turning about, ſeeth the diſciple whom Jeſus loved following, who alſo leaned on his breaſt at ſupper, and ſaid, Lord, 
who is he that betrayeth thee? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Peter ſeeing him, ſaith to Jeſus, Lord, and what <hi>ſhall</hi> this man <hi>do?</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Jeſus ſaith to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, 
what <hi>is it</hi> to thee? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Follow thou me. Then went this ſaying abroad among the brethren, that that diſciple ſhould not die. Yet Jeſus did not ſay to him, That he ſhould not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <hi>is it</hi> to thee?</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> This is the diſciple who teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things: and we know that his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony 
is true. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> And there are alſo many other things which Jeſus did, which, if they were to be written particularly, I ſuppoſe that even the world itſelf would not contain the books that were written.</p>

If here and there a generous Heart ſees and emulates it, be it ſo; but he is not ſolicitous that Men ſhould admire it. It was addreſſed to his beloved Maſter, and it was enough that He underſtood it.</p>
