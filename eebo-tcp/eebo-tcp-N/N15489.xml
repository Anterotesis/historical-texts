            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THEY who have read Mr. Littlepage's late Publications againſt Mr. Jay, have doubtleſs obſerved, that all his Charges reſt on no other Evidence whatever, than his BARE ASSERTIONS. As it is impoſſible to prove Negatives, the only queſtion that preſents itſelf is, whether any and what credit is due to his Aſſertions? Although Mr. Jay flatters himſelf that his Character affords a ſatisfactory Anſwer to this Queſtion, to all who know and wiſh not to miſrepreſent it; yet, as there is reaſon to believe that this Young Man's Ebullitions have not been entirely ſpontaneous, nor deſigned to ſerve merely his own Purpoſes, it is thought expedient
<pb facs="unknown:019735_0004_0FACA531A5D72240"/>to lay before the Public all the Letters which have paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Jay and him.</p>
            <p>They will enable the Reader to perceive how far his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has been influenced by candour and delicacy, and whether it exhibits thoſe marks of conſiſtency and ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are neceſſary to create and ſupport an Opinion of his veracity. A compariſon of thoſe Letters with his late Publications, will determine whether the Aſſertions and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts contained in both, correſpond with each other, or whether they are ſo contradictory and repugnant as to have no claims to Credit: For Truth being immutable, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably ſpeak the ſame Language, and all its Accounts and Relations forever harmonize and agree.</p>

               <p>PROBABLY you may be ſurpriſed at this letter, when you are informed that it comes from the perſon, whom Mr. <hi>T. Adams</hi> recommended to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in Philadelphia: The anxiety which that worthy friend has always diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for my intereſt, will ever claim my warmeſt gratitude; and I am far from eſteeming his recommendation of me to you, as a trivial inſtance of friendſhip. You were, (I doubt not) ſurpriſed at not hearing from me in America: I was, all ſhe laſt ſummer, in a very ill ſtate of health; but never had the leaſt idea that my Guardian had neglected to inform you of my ſituation, and return the thanks due to your generoſity: Soon after my recovery, I was much chagrined at receiving a meſſage from Mr. <hi>Fleming,</hi> of Virginia, that <q>you were to ſail immediately; but if my friends choſe to ſend me to Europe, you would take care of me.</q> I then prevailed on my Guardian, to let me follow you; and, in a ſhort time, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board a ſhip bound to Bourdeaux, but was driven into this port by diſtreſs of weather, about the middle of February. For ſome time after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, I could hear nothing of you; and had the greateſt reaſon to believe the Confederacy loſt; but at length was informed of your ſafe arrival in Spain: I acquainted Doctor <hi>Franklin</hi> with my ſituation, and he adviſed me to write to you, and remain in France, till you inſtructed me how to proceed: This I ſhould have done before, had I certainly known where to direct. I ſhall be much obliged to you to write to me as ſoon as poſſibly, as I find it very expenſive in this country.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019735_0006_0FACA533278942F8"/>Be pleaſed to direct your letter to the care of Mr. <hi>Bonfield,</hi> in Bourdeaux, where I ſhall reſide till it comes to hand. I have the honor to be, with the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Sir, your grateful, and much obliged humble ſervant,</p>

                  <p>ON my arrival here, about an hour ago, your favor of the 10th of March was delivered to me. The poſt for France will paſs thro' this place this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I have therefore juſt time to congratulate you on your ſafe arrival, and to aſſure you, that I ſhall be happy in every opportunity of facilitating the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the objects of your voyage. This will at preſent be more in my power here than elſewhere; I therefore adviſe you, to come to Madrid without delay:— Mr. <hi>Bonfield</hi> will direct you as to the manner of doing it in the moſt convenient and leaſt expenſive manner—the latter merits attention. I have reaſon to believe this country to the full as expenſive as the one you are in:—This is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, however, rather as a diſadvantageous circumſtance, than an unſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obſtacle,—the more prudence will be neceſſary. Perhaps your being driven to Nantz may have expoſed you to difficulties on the ſubject of ſupplies; if ſo, you may draw upon me for the expences of your journey. I am, dear Sir, your moſt obedient ſervant,</p>

               <p>YOUR favor of the 3d of April, reached me a few days paſt at Nantz. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived but yeſterday in this city, and have now the agreeable proſpect of being with you in a ſhout time.

                  </gap>, whoſe affairs would not permit him to leave the place ſooner; tho' it was really inconvenient to me for ſeveral reaſons; as my expectation; of departing every day, obliged me to take temporary lodgings in a Hotel, which unavoidably incurred a double expence, and prevented me from ſtudying the language with neceſſary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. I am exceedingly obliged to you for your offer of ſupplies, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately bad letters of credit to Nantz: I was at firſt apprehenſive of being obliged to go to Paris, to M. <hi>Beaumarchais;</hi> but the gentlemen, to whom I was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, have offered to advance whatever may be neceſſary for the expences of my journey. The only opportunity that at preſent ſeems to occur for my getting to Madrid with conveniency, is, in the company of an Envoy from the Court of Hungary to Spain, who is daily expected in Bourdeaux. Should I be diſappointed in this, fortune muſt direct me. My moſt reſpectful compliments to your Lady, (who I have heard is with you.)

               <p>MR. <hi>Bonfield</hi> yeſterday informed me, that he had received a letter from you, with permiſſion for me to remain ſome time longer in France: My peculiar ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince my arrival in this country, has unfortunately prevented me from an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious application to acquire the French language grammatically. I have bad little or no ſociety with the natives of France, who were unacquainted with the Britiſh language; and all that I have as yet attained, is a ſuperficial knowledge of a few words, ſufficient perhaps for a traveller.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of your laſt letter to Mr. <hi>Bonfield,</hi> I ſhall this day leave Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, and reſide at the country ſeat of a gentleman, ſome leagues diſtant; where it will be leſs difficult to acquire the French pronunciation.

It gives me pleaſure to hear you are in a French gentleman's family.—You will there have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of learning pronunciation as well as grammar.

               <p>YOUR favor, of the 16th of June, agreeably interrupted my application to the barren rudiments of the French language: All the polite aſſiduities of the worthy family in which I reſide, have been able to render my ſituation little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a pleaſing hermitage. Unacquainted with the principles of their tongue, without ſociety, or even one companion; you may ſuppoſe, I feel rather ſenſibly the change from diſſipation and the amuſements of a populous city. The memoirs of Noailles are not to be procured in this place; but as your advice was in general terms, I preſume any productions of the ſame kind, are to be underſtood as equally inſtructive. My preſent ſtudy is the hiſtory of France; tho' I have lately peruſed ſome of Voltaire's works, and a few moral and political performances of Marmontelle.—I find the French language extremely difficult, both from irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and redundancy: to acquire in a few months a ſufficient collection of elegant words in a foreign language, is an evident impoſſibility, and was never my expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: I flatter myſelf, that my preſent knowledge of its fundamental principles, will enable me hereafter, to read with ſome degree of ſatisfaction its moſt uſeful authors: If you have no objection, I would proceed immediately to Madrid. Be pleaſed to write to me and let me know your ſentiments. I am, with the greateſt reſpect, Sir, your humble ſervant,</p>

                  <p>IT is with infinite regret that I muſt acquaint you with my preſent diſagreeable ſituation.—A few days after the date of my laſt (the 15th ult.) I was ſeized with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent intermitting fevers, which continuing for ſome time with encreaſing fervour, obliged me to leave my happy reſidence in the country, and return to this city; not only on account of the inconvenience which my diſeaſe unavoidably occaſioned to the hoſpitable family, whom I but too much incommoded, but for the benefit of medicine and Phyſicians; all the ſervice, however, which theſe two powerful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of mortality have been able to render me, is, to convert an irregular fever into an obſtinate periodical quartan; which has incredibly reduced me. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete

This is, unfortunately, the day of my fever, and its approach obliges me to reſign my pen.</p>

                  <p>I find myſelf much indiſpoſed from my yeſterday's fever, which continued all the night paſt. But as the poſt for Spain, this day leaves Bourdeaux, neceſſity obliges me to conclude. Your favor, of the 19th inſtant, was this moment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to me: The warmth of ſincere friendſhip glows in every line. The object, which you have ſo ſtrikingly exhibited to my view, muſt undoubtedly be animating to every mind endued with ſenſibility: But the happineſs of being in any degree uſeful to my country, is a ſummit to which my ambition dare not aſpire:—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious diſſidence forbids me to hope it.—To my friends I may, perhaps, be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; at leaſt, inability ſhall be the only obſtacle. Your deſire I perceive is, that I ſhould remain ſome time longer in France, for the more perfect attainment of the language. Unfortunately, my reſidence in a French family, was but of ſhort duration; I am now amidſt Americans and Engliſh: However, during my ſhort retreat in the country, I acquired a ſufficiency for the neceſſities of travelling, and common converſation: Their authors I have read with tolerable facility, and ſome degree of taſte. This, joined with ſome more weighty reaſons, will, I hope, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your conſent for me to proſecute my long protracted journey to Madrid, as ſoon as my health will permit.

I ſhould have ſent him to you before your departure from Philadelphia, but was prevented, by his falling into a bad ſtate of health, from which he did not recover in time. Incloſed you will find ſome of his performances, by which you may judge of his genius for poetry.

I ſhall, with great pleaſure, make the neceſſary advances; though, I think it would be will, that I ſhould be informed of the limits to which you would chuſe they ſhould be reſtricted. On the 26th of September laſt, he drew a bill on me for 2008 livres, which I have paid. From the ſpecimens you ſend me, I think highly of his talent for poetry, which though not to be neglected, ought not, in my opinion, to be the firſt object of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I alſo think, he ought to read men as well as books, and that the expence of doing it, is only putting money at intereſt. My endeavours ſhall not be wanting, to fix and confirm thoſe liberal principles of morality and honor, which I find he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready imbibed, and to extend his ambition beyond the limits of this life.

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING you friendly endeavors to diſſuade me from my intention of accompanying the Duke of <hi>Crillon</hi> in the enſuing campaign, I find my inclination, honor, and let me add, my intereſt, too nearly concerned to admit the moſt diſtant idea of deſiſting. Perfectly convinced, however, of the <hi>generous and candid motives</hi> which influence your conduct, I think it indiſpenſibly incumbent upon me to explain to you in the moſt ſerious manner my reaſons for perſevering.</p>
               <p>In this unhappy aera of war and commotion, politicians and ſoldiers are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary: at a diſtance from my native country, and conſequently incapable of ſerving it immediately in a military line, I think it ſtill my duty to embrace every opportunity of acquiring a degree of experience, which may one day prove beneficial. Your partiality to my abilities induces you to ſuppoſe polities my proper ſphere: Friendſhip ſeems more prevalent than judgment in that conjecture: My preſent object is the attainment of the Spaniſh language: the alternative is to retire to ſome village, or ſpend a few months in the army; thel atter is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more agreeable, <hi>leſs expenſive,</hi> and more conſiſtent with my future plans of life.—Here, ſir, permit me to call your attention to ſome <hi>minute particulars, relative only to myſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither your friendſhip nor my own caution can, I find, protect me from the <hi>machinations of a powerful and inſidious enemy:</hi> to his malicious inſinuations I can alone impute that univerſal coldneſs, with which every perſon in the leaſt influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>him,</hi> continually avoids me. Suſpicions to the prejudice of my character are infuſed into the minds of all who appear diſpoſed to treat me with civility. <hi>Attempts have been, and are daily and hourly made, to irritate, and render me diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with you;</hi> and at the ſame time to <hi>ſeduce me</hi> into purſuits which would tend to leſſen your good opinion of my <hi>honor and morals.</hi> The moſt infamous falſhoods
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019735_0014_0FACA539248019D8"/>have been reported even to yourſelf,<note n="*" place="bottom">On a certain occaſion here alluded to, Mr. Littlepage mentioned a circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Mr. Carmichael's attempting to lead him into very improper connections, which Mr. Jay thought extraordinary and improbable, as well becauſe be could not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mr. Carmichael capable of it, as becauſe Mr. Carmichael had expreſſed to him ſome apprehenſions of Mr. Litt'epage's being led into them, from ſome recent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which had occurred, and reſpecting which Mr. Carmichael had acted a part, which, as he repreſented it, was both honorable and friendly to Mr. Littlepage.—Mr. Jay mentioned this to Mr. Littlepage as a fact, very inconſiſtent with the one he was then telling him. Mr. Littlepage denied the whole of it in the moſt poſitive and expreſs terms, and inſiſted that Mr. Carmichael had related this without any foundation, and for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Juſtly incenſed and diſguſted at this unprovoked and inhumane treatment; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the moſt honorable and ardent deſire of exculpating myſelf from aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions equally odious and illſounded, and of obtaining ſome degree of reſpect amongſt my preſent deluded acquaintances, I have formed the deſign of entering, if poſſible, into the family of his grace of <hi>Crillon,</hi> and ſerving as a volunteer in the intended expedition from <hi>Cadiz.</hi> The connexions which I may there form; the reputation which only a decent line of conduct will inevitably procure; may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, convince the world that <hi>malice,</hi> not candor, could injure me.

               <p>Whether I ſhall ſucceed, or not, is as yet uncertain; but whatever may be the event, <hi>thoſe conſiderations,</hi> maturely weighed, will, I hope, induce you to think more favorably of the deſign of your Excellency's moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

The converſations I had with your friend Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> on the ſubject, invariably led me to ſuppoſe, that law and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics were to be your objects; and I conſidered your coming to Europe, as deſigned for the purpoſe of facilitating the attainment of them, by giving you opportunities of acquiring two uſeful languages, and of applying to ſuch purſuits and ſtudies, an might conduce to qualify you for the bar, and for public employments. My know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of you perſuades me that your friends were wiſe in propoſing theſe objects to your attention, and therefore, tho' <hi>I admire the ſpirit</hi> which actuates you on this occaſion, I cannot forbear diſapproving your permitting it, to carry you out of the ſphere propoſed for you to move in.

               <p>THE only letter which I have as yet had the pleaſure of receiving from you, is the one which Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi> brought with him from America, and is dated the 20th of November, 1779. In October, 1780, Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi> reached Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, and on the 21ſt of November following, I had the honor of writing to you and Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> informing you of his arrival, and the objects which I adviſed him to purſue; and which, from converſations with Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> I had reaſon to think, were perfectly conſiſtent with his, and your views. I alſo thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019735_0017_0FACA53B62DC54E8"/>in mentioning the expences he had incurred, to requeſt that you would fix the limits within which they ſhould in future be confined.</p>
               <p>From that time to this, he has been conſtantly in my family, and conſequently ſubject to few expences. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is time has, in my opinion, been upon the whole uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpent; and had his application been equal to his talents, his progreſs might have been ſtill greater.</p>
               <p>As the Court paſs the ſpring at Aranjuez, a royal ſeat, about ſeven leagues diſtance from here, I removed my family there. About a fortnight ago, the public were informed, that the Duke de <hi>Crillon,</hi> to whom I had formerly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Mr. <hi>Littlepage,</hi> was appointed to command an expedition, to ſail from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz, but for what place is ſtill unknown.</p>
               <p>Some days afterwards, Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi> ſurprized me, by a propoſal to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Duke as a Volunteer on this expedition, and ſtrongly ſolicited my conſent and aſſiſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. I uſed every argument to diſſuade him from it, but in vain; he ſeveral time renewed his application, and preſſed it with earneſtneſs, and I as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told him, that my opinion of the plan remained fixed, and that as I did not approve of it, I could not patronize it. At length he wrote me a letter on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in which he repeated his former arguments, to ſhew the expediency of the plan; and alſo urged the tendency it would have to enable him, more eaſily to from uſeful connections, in doing which he had experienced obſtacles from the malevolence of one of his acquaintances.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, for your ſatisfaction, inſert the <hi>firſt</hi> part of this letter, and my anſwer.</p>

                     <p>In the unhappy aera of war and commotion, politicians and ſoldiers are equally neceſſary. At a diſtance from my native country, and conſequently incapable of ſerving it immediately, in a military line; I think it ſtill my duty to embrace every opportunity of acquiring a degree of experience, which may one day prove bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial: Your partiality to my abilities enduces you to ſuppoſe polities my proper ſphere: Friendſhip ſeems more prevalent than judgment in that conjecture. My preſent object is the attainment of the Spaniſh language,—the alternative is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to ſome village, or ſpend a few months in the army; the latter is infinitely more agreeable, leſs expenſive, and more conſiſtent with my future plans of life.</p>

                     <p>I Have conſidered your letter of to day, with all the attention due to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and delicacy of the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The general reaſons you urge for reſolving to perſevere in the plan of accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Duke of <hi>Crillon,</hi> on the expedition in queſtion, are the ſame which we before fully diſcuſſed in converſation. I muſt candidly aſſure you, that my opinion remains unaltered. It cannot be neceſſary to repeat the reaſons which I aſſigned to you for with-holding my conſent and approbation. The converſations I had with your friend, Col. <hi>Adams,</hi> on the ſubject, led me to ſuppoſe, that law and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics were to be your objects; and I conſidered your coming to Europe, as deſigned for the purpoſe of facilitating the attainment of them; by giving you opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of acquiring two uſeful languages, and of applying to ſuch purſuits and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as might conduce to qualify you for the bar, and for civil employments. My knowledge of you, perſuades me, that your friends were wiſe in propoſing theſe objects to your attention; and therefore, though I admire the ſpirit which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates you on this occaſion, I cannot forbear diſapproving your permitting it to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you out of the ſphere propoſed for you to move in.</p>
                     <p>You was recommended to my care—I promiſed that you ſhould receive it:— Hence it became my duty to aſſiſt you in the attainment of the objects before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but not to encourage or approve your purſuing different ones.</p>
                     <p>I know that you ought, and I adviſe you, ſteadily to follow wherever your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may lead you, without being deterred by dangers or evils of any kind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and were it your duty to go on the propoſed expedition, I ſhould ceaſe to eſteem you if you ſuffered any perſonal conſideration to reſtrain you. You ſeem to admit that your duty does not require you to take this ſtep, and, I think, you would do well to conſider how far it will authorize it. This is a delicate ſubject, and yet the relations you ſtand in to your country, your family and your friends, ought to be well weighed, before you embark in a meaſure that may affect each of them. But you know my ſentiments on all theſe points, having before dwelt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely on them. All I can do is to give you my advice; this I have done fully and candidly."</p>

               <p>When Mr.<hi>Littlepage</hi> offered his ſervices to the Duke, he promiſed to take him into his family, if the permiſſion of the Court could be obtained.

               <p>But whatever might be the light in which this project appeared to me, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Spaniards were much pleaſed with the idea of a young American gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's offering to go as a Volunteer in their ſervice.—Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi> was much ſpoken of, and commended; and ſo popular did his application ſoon promiſe, an indeed begin to be, that ſome, on whoſe attachment he had no great reaſon to rely, and who at firſt treated the project with redicule, profeſſed to be convinced of its proving advantageous, and let ſlip no opportunity of appearing to patronize cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally both it and him. He certainly gained much perſonal credit by it, and there were gentlemen of weight and diſtinction who adviſed me very ſeriouſly to give my conſent to his going, and to ſupport his application for permiſſion, adding, that it would ſerve the American cauſe, &amp;c. I anſwered theſe gentlemen, that, on this occaſion, I could act in no other capacity than that of Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi>'s friend; and that no conſideration of convenience, either to the public or myſelf, would ever
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019735_0020_0FACA53DA3B7DC20"/>prevail upon me to depart from what I conceived to be the ſpirit of the truſt you had repoſed in me.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi>'s idea was, in caſe he obtained permiſſion, to ſet out in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Duke, who daily expected to depart, and by that means avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable expences; but it unfortunately happened that he did not get it 'till after much delay, and after the Duke was on the road to Cadiz. It was not 'till Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt that he was informed that his requeſt was granted. I adviſed him, before the Duke's departure, to take ſuch explicit arrangements with the Duke, as that no matters of expence might be leſt unſettled, in caſe he ſhould have leave to go, (which I confeſs I did not think very probable) but this was omitted. When the King's permiſſion was ſignified to him, it was too late; and no other alternative was leſt him, than either to decline accepting a favor he had ſtrongly ſolicited, or ſet out poſt for Cadiz, and arrange this buſineſs there as well as he could. The former could not be done conſiſtent with his honor, and the latter required ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences which I feared would be very diſagreeable to you. This dilemma reduced me to a very delicate ſituation—preſuming however, that you would prefer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to the diſhonor, I conſented to furniſh him with as much money as might be neceſſary for his journey and outfit, and propoſed the pay of a Spaniſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of foot, as a reaſonable allowance for his ordinary expences. This did not correſpond with his ideas—he choſe rather to be left at liberty to draw upon me for ſuch ſums as he might from time to time find neceſſary, aſſuring me at the ſame time, that I might rely on his obſerving the moſt rigid oeconomy. He expreſſed his apprehenſions that a Captain's pay, which is twenty-two dollars and one half of a dollar per month, would probably be inſufficient, and therefore wiſhed to be provided accordingly.</p>
               <p>I told him that unlimited credit always appeared to me improper, eſpecially in caſes where I was acting for others, that if Captains could live on this allowance, it would alſo be in his power; and that, if he ſhould be admitted into the Duke's family, even leſs might be ſufficient. That therefore, notwithſtanding my conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in his prudence, I could not think of going further; but hoped that he would endeavour, if poſſible, to live within that allowance, and be cautious of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the bounty of his friends inconvenient to them.</p>
               <p>I accordingly furniſhed him with money ſufficient to go to Cadiz, and provide againſt caſualties on the road, and with credit there on Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> for as much as, with what would probably remain of the former ſum, would be neceſſary to fit him out; and alſo the amount of a Spaniſh Captain's pay for ſix months: which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>vance apeared the more neceſſary, as many are of opinion the Duke is going to South America. For my own part I doubt it; but yet, as it may be the caſe, I could not think of letting him run the riſque, without ſome money to be-friend him. I alſo thought it prudent not to exceed <hi>ſix months,</hi> as before that time, I might expect to receive your orders for my government in future.—He left us yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday.</p>

The Ambaſſador of France being on the moſt intimate footing with the Duke, and it being of importance to Mr. <hi>Littlepage,</hi> that the Duke ſhould have every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to favor him with his friendſhip and protection, I gave him the following letter to deliver to the Ambaſſador at Aranjuez, viz.</p>

                     <p>"MR. <hi>Littlepage</hi> informs me, that he has obtained permiſſion to accompany the Duke de <hi>Crillon,</hi> on the intended expedition. Although his embarking in this buſineſs is <hi>contrary to my advice and approbation;</hi> I, nevertheleſs, wiſh he may reap every advantage he promiſes himſelf from it.

               <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you a ſhort, but accurate account of an affair, which muſt from its nature be no leſs unexpected than intereſting to you. How far my conduct upon this occaſion may coincide with your ſentiments, is not certain; but, however that may be, I flatter myſelf, you will do me the juſtice to believe, that it was directed by the pureſt motives, and moſt diſintereſted regard to what I thought right. If Mr. <hi>Littlepage's</hi> plan ſhould meet with your approbation, no inconveniences can reſult either to him or you, from my having <hi>in vain</hi> adviſed him againſt it. But if, on the contrary, your ſentiments reſpecting it ſhould correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with my own, I hope you will further agree with me in opinion, that he ſtill merits your care and attention, and that a fine ſoil ought not to be neglected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all its natural productions are not equally eſtimable.—It demands only a greater degree of prudent, and perhaps patient cultivation.</p>
               <p>I muſt again take the liberty of remarking, that, in my opinion, your allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to him for expences, ought to be reſtricted to ſome fixed limits:—Your letter to me leaves them without bounds, and conſequently leaves us both to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable differences in ſentiment on a very delicate ſubject.</p>
               <p>It is with equal chearfulneſs, that I now repeat the aſſurances I before gave you, of my readineſs to be uſeful to Mr. <hi>Littlepage,</hi> whenever it may be in my power. I will with pleaſure and without heſitation, make him from time to time ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of money as may be neceſſary, and conſiſtent with ſuch orders as I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from you:—And I muſt requeſt the favor of you, to ſend me immediately, and by different opportunities, expreſs and particular directions about it.</p>
               <p>The annexed account of what I have already advanced, and engaged to pay,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019735_0022_0FACA53F238EA940"/>will ſhew how neceſſary it is, that theſe matters be ſpeedily arranged, and regular remittances made; which may be done without difficulty or riſque by bills of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. The extent of my own expences here, renders punctual reimburſements indiſpenſible; and leſt unexpected occurrences, ſimilar to the preſent, ſhould again tempt Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi> into deviations from the line you may chuſe he ſhould obſerve, I really think that the ſooner you give him and me your ſentiments and orders about it, the better.</p>
               <p>The object of the expedition is, as I ſaid before, unknown; but the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion is, that it is not very diſtant, and will ſoon be decided. If no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſhould happen to Mr. <hi>Littlepage,</hi> I expect he will return in the fall, and I hope, before that time, to have the pleaſure of receiving an anſwer to this letter. Whatever intelligence I may in the mean time receive of, or from him, ſhall be immediately communicated to you. He has promiſed me to write to you and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> before he leaves Cadiz. I ſhall tranſmit this letter to the Delegates of Virginia, in Congreſs, and requeſt the favor of them to forward it to you.

               <p>A LETTER which I this day received from Mr. Harriſon informs me, to my inexpreſſible ſurpriſe and concern, that your Excellency has proteſted my bills!— your long ſilence is no longer a myſtery. I mean not to reproach you; your conduct may not deſerve the appellation of ungenerous or cruel; it is, indeed, unexpected. Permit me, ſir, to recal your attention to ſome circumſtances which both preceded and were ſubſequent to my engaging in this unfortunate enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>When I firſt communicated to you my intention of making this campaign, you endeavored to diſſuaded me from it for two reaſons—"as being contrary to the <hi>deſigns of my friends,</hi> and from <hi>perſonal danger:</hi>" For the firſt I look upon myſelf to be reſponſible: judge whether I ought to have been influenced by the latter.—
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019735_0026_0FACA54224D5A060"/>You never objected the expence 'till after I had received the permiſſion of his Majeſty; 'twas then too late! My reputation, my honor, my all was at ſtake!— Why, in the name of humanity, why was not that mentioned, even hinted in the moſt diſtant manner, before? I expoſtulated with you, warmly perhaps, I hope not indecently, on that ſubject, as well as with regard to the credit you allowed me on Mr. <hi>Harriſon;</hi> that, you reſtricted to <hi>ſix months pay for a captain of foot!</hi> This, ſir, as I afterwards informed you, was a fatal regulation for me: a captain of cavalry in the Spaniſh ſervice has forty reals a day, and forage; a volunteer aid de camp, in which capacity I have the honor to ſerve, has nothing and pays both for his horſe and forage.</p>
               <p>As to the 150 dollars on Mr. H. you aſſured me it was not from ſuſpicions of my making an improper uſe of <hi>unlimited credit,</hi> but to juſtify you to my friends, ſhould they diſapprove my conduct; that it was by no means your deſign I ſhould be diſtreſſed; on the contrary, ſhould that happen, I might draw on you as my exigencies ſhould require. 'Twas, ſir, in conſequence of this, that I ventured to draw on Mr. <hi>Harriſon.</hi> I appeal to him whether I expended one penny unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your conduct, perhaps, is influenced by apprehenſions of loſs, as you do not poſſeſs an opulent fortune.—I ear not, fir;</hi> 'tis true, I have obligations to ſome few valuable friends, but they ſhall never ſuffer: The generoſity of an affectionate parent and a worthy deceaſed relation, <hi>have left me above dependence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You, ſir, was the cauſe of my leaving my friends and country; they confided me to your protection and ſupport!—enough!—their expectations are anſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I mean not to ſollicit your farther aſſiſtance—that were meanneſs indeed!—mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs oſ which I am incapable!—No, ſir!—except the duplicate of this which I ſhall ſend by the next poſt, you ſhall never more be troubled by your Excellency's moſt obedient and reſpectful, &amp;c.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE received your letter of the 8th inſtant.</p>
               <p>I have paid Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> the money he advanced to you, as far as my letter of credit to him in your favor extended. Your bill upon me, <hi>drawn without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> for a ſum beyond the limits of that credit, I did not accept.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:019735_0027_0FACA542E3260430"/>
It is true, ſir, that I was ſo far the cauſe of your leaving your friends, as my offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive you into <hi>my family, care, and protection, in caſe they ſhould think proper to ſend you to Europe,</hi> might have been inducements. This offer was diſintereſted, and in my opinion as generous as my circumſtances and my duty to thoſe who ſtand in the neareſt of all relations to me, would permit.</p>
               <p>I then underſtood that your principal funds conſiſted in the generoſity of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy uncle, and one or two other friends; and I had ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the ſupplies with which they might be willing to furniſh you, would, tho' equal to your neceſſary expences, be nevertheleſs ſuch, as to <hi>require</hi> a conſtant attention to oeconomy; for I remember, that on ſpeaking with Colonel Fleming, ſhortly before I left Philadelphia, about the probability of your following me, he told me that <hi>the difficulty of providing funds</hi> for the purpoſe, would be the <hi>principal obſtacle;</hi> but this being a matter without my province, I could only deſire him to aſſure your friends, <hi>that in caſe they ſhould conclude to ſend you, they might depend on my taking care of you.</hi> Hence I have conſtanly thought myſelf particularly bound, ever ſince your arrival, to take care that <hi>theſe funds,</hi> ſo far as the diſpoſition of them might depend upon me, ſhould be confined to their <hi>proper objects,</hi> and not diverted to ſuch <hi>foreign ones</hi> as might, from time to time, ſpring up in a warm and youthful fancy. I neither conſidered myſelf, nor did I ſuppoſe that you would conſider me, merely in the light of <hi>your bancker.</hi>—I expected to receive you under my <hi>direction,</hi> as well as <hi>protection;</hi> and that the expences, which your friends might be willing to be at on your account, ſhould be regulated, in a certain degree, by <hi>my judgment,</hi> as well as <hi>your's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A moment's reflection ought to convince you, that <hi>no ſelfiſh</hi> conſiderations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced me to undertake this taſk. You was repreſented to me as a young gentleman whoſe talents and diſpoſition merited better opportunities of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than thoſe you had; and my regard for a riſing genius oppoſed by difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, prompted me to patronize you, <hi>tho' a perfect ſtranger to me,</hi> and no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with any of my family.</p>
               <p>With this view it was that my houſe and patronage were at firſt offered to you, and hence it was that I have, from time to time, taken the liberty of adviſing you with reſpect to the books and ſtudies moſt proper for you, in my opinion, to read and to purſue. You may remember alſo, that in a converſation about your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, brought on by Mr. De Francy's letter, I ſhewed you your uncle's letter to me, remarking it's too great want of particularity on that head, and expreſſing my wiſhes that it had been more explicit; for that as I was ignorant of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of your funds, it was impoſſible to determine the proper extent of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, which I thought the more neceſſary, becauſe, in my judgment, the plan of your education ſhould be more or leſs extenſive, in proportion as you might be more or leſs able to ſupport the expence of it. I mention theſe circumſtances to remind you, that I early conſidered myſelf in another light than that of your <hi>bancker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:019735_0028_0FACA543A6884DB8"/>
When you firſt mentioned to me your plan of going a volunteer with the Duke de Crillon, and requeſted me to ſpeak to him upon the ſubject, I well remember that <hi>the expence of it</hi> became one of the topics of the converſation which then enſued; and I am <hi>ſurpriſed</hi> you ſhould forget that you urged the <hi>cheapneſs</hi> of the plan as an argument to reconcile me to it. You obſerved particularly to it, that if you ſhould be admitted into the Duke's family, you would have ſcarce any <hi>other expence</hi> than that of <hi>regimentals;</hi> and that it would not only be a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious and agreable, but alſo a leſs <hi>expenſive</hi> way of learning Spaniſh, than that of going to a country village, as Mr. Vaughan had done, and as you would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be alſo inclined to do.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of that, and all other converſations which I have ever had with you or others on the ſubject of this project, <hi>I pointedly diſapproved of it;</hi> and tho' many reaſons for my diſapprobation were ſubmitted to your conſideration, it ſeems that all except two have eſcaped your memory, viz. <hi>"as being contrary to the deſigns of your friends, and from perſona! danger."</hi> For the <hi>firſt,</hi> you ſay, you looked upon yourſelf to be reſponſible; and I will add, that ſo far as I might be concerned in it, I conſidered myſelf as reſponſible both to your friends and to my own judgment.—As to the circumſtance of <hi>perſonal danger,</hi> you deſire me to judge whether you ought to have been influenced by it? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> forbear remarks on the repetition of this queſtion, it wants explanation, and you will find, that, as well as an anſwer to it, in the following paragraph of a letter I wrote you on this ſubject, the 15th June laſt, viz. "I know that you ought, and I adviſe you ſteadily to follow wherever your duty may lead you <hi>without being deterred by danger, or evils of any kind whatever:</hi> and were it your duty to go on the propoſed expedition, I ſhould ceaſe to eſteem you, if you ſuffered <hi>any perſonal conſideration</hi> to reſtrain you. You ſeem to admit that your duty does not require you to take this ſtep—and I think you will do well to conſider how far it will <hi>authoriſe</hi> it.—This is a delicate ſubject; and yet the relations you ſtand in to your country, your family, and your friends, ought to be well weighted, before you embark in a meaſure that may affect each of them. But you know my ſentiments on all theſe points, having before dwelt minutely on them. All I can do, is to give you my advice—this I have done freely and candidly."</p>
               <p>The objections you mention are only <hi>two</hi> of the reaſons which I urged againſt your project—They were accompanied with thoſe others which naturally ariſing from the ſubject, muſt preſent themſelves to all who conſider it with attention. It would be as unneceſſary to enumerate them now, as it proved uſeleſs to urge them at firſt. Beſides, the manner in which you refer to my objections, ſeems to be more with a view of ſhewing what they <hi>were not,</hi> than what they <hi>were</hi>—for if I underſtand you right, you mean to infer from theſe <hi>two</hi> being the <hi>ſole</hi> reaſons for my diſſent, that the <hi>expence</hi> of the plan could not have been one of them, and therefore that I ought either to have afterwards furniſhed you with <hi>as much</hi> money as you might have occaſion for in the execution of it, or have told you that I
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019735_0029_0FACA54462E09E90"/>would not ſupply you with <hi>any.</hi>—There is a difference, ſir, between advancing <hi>no more</hi> at all, and advancing <hi>as much</hi> as a young gentleman may pleaſe <hi>to aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for,</hi> beyond the probable extent of his funds.—There are alſo ſome matters of fact which I wiſh to recal to your memory; and that this may be done with leſs riſque of miſtake and confuſion, it may not be amiſs to conſider the whole time in which the buſineſs of this project was in agitation, as coming within <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> periods:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The time which paſſed between your <hi>firſt</hi> mentioning it to me, and your acquainting me with your determination <hi>to perſiſt</hi> in purſuing it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my diſapprobation.</item>
                  <item>2. The time which paſſed between this determination, and the grant of your requeſt by the court.</item>
                  <item>3. The time ſubſequent to the grant of your requeſt, including your departure for, and arrival at Cadiz.</item>
               </list>
               <p>During the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe periods I flattered myſelf with being able to convince you, that your project, being ill adapted to <hi>your ſituation,</hi> and little calculated to promote your <hi>proper</hi> views, ought to be relinquiſhed—it was then ſufficient only ſo far to touch upon the matter of <hi>expence,</hi> as it gave occaſion to <hi>general</hi> remarks. At <hi>that</hi> time it had not become reaſonable nor neceſſary to tell you, <hi>I would not advance you any money in caſe you perſiſted,</hi> for I could not preſume that <hi>you would perſiſt againſt my advice and conſent.</hi> Such a <hi>threat</hi> would have been too harſh and indelicate, to have had a good effect; and would have been very diſtant from the manner in which I always had treated, and always wiſhed to treat you.</p>
               <p>On the commencement of the <hi>ſecond</hi> period, the ſtate of the whole affair was changed. The moment you ceaſed to reſpect my opinion and conſent, it became <hi>your</hi> buſineſs, and ceaſed to be <hi>mine,</hi> to provide for the means of executing a ſcheme you had <hi>reſolved to adopt againſt my approbation.</hi> So that if I had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obſerved the moſt profound ſilence reſpecting the expence, and all other articles connected with this project, you would have had no ſort of right to complain.</p>
               <p>But, ſir, altho' my advice had hitherto been neglected, I again took an occaſion of troubling you with it; for on hearing that the Duke had, on your application, conſented to take you into his family, provided you could obtain the leave of the court to go, I thought it a good opportunity of calling your attention to a matter, about which your expectations appeared to be rather too ſanguine, I mean <hi>the expence.</hi> I adviſed you, in ſo many words, immediately to take ſuch explicit arrangements with the Duke, as that <hi>no matters of expence</hi> might be leſt unaſcertained, in caſe you ſhould obtain the permiſſion in queſtion. I expected that the propriety of this advice would certainly ſtrike you; and not doubting but that you would mention to me the reſult of your converſation with him on this ſubject, I ſuſpected it would afford me <hi>new arguments</hi> to prevail upon you to deſiſt.</p>
               <p>But this advice, however proper, met with <hi>no attention:</hi> You applied to the Court for leave to accompany the Duke, and permitted him to ſet out for Cadiz,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019735_0030_0FACA5452F1C16D0"/>without having ſaid a word to him about the expence you might expect to incur.</p>
               <p>Here aroſe the following queſtion of prudence, viz. Whether it would be beſt for me to tell you plainly, that I would not ſupply you with any money, in caſe you ſhould obtain leave to go, and thereby oblige you to abandon, from <hi>neceſſity,</hi> a ſcheme which you could not be perſuaded to relinquiſh from <hi>reaſon.</hi>—. On conſidering this queſtion, I ſaw that the neceſſity and conſequently the propriety of this ſtep, muſt depend entirely on the <hi>probability</hi> of your obtaining the leave of the Court. A little time and conſideration convinced me that probability was decidedly againſt your obtaining it: For,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. You was a proteſtant, and it was ſaid that no officers of that profeſſion were to be found in the Spaniſh ſervice.</item>
                  <item>2. You was a citizen of North-America, whoſe independence had not been acknowledged by this court.</item>
                  <item>3. I had made no ſecret of my diſapprobation, and in a letter of the 17th June, informed the miniſter of ſtate, that I could take no part in your application, the truſt repoſed in me by your friends, as well as my <hi>prive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te judgment,</hi> oppoſing it.</item>
                  <item>4. The Duke himſelf had told you, he did not believe that your requeſt would be granted.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The concluſions, deducible from theſe circumſtances, need not be ſpecified— The language of them made the ſame impreſſion upon you, that it did upon me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and it was not long before we both became perſuaded that your application would prove fruitleſs, and in all probability die away without further notice.</p>
               <p>There not being therefore the leaſt appearance of neceſſity for the ſtep in queſtion, it would have been very improper to take it, eſpecially as it would have unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here the laſt period begin. The Duke had gone to Cadiz, and you was to follow him immediately. You reflected that money would be neceſſary, and

                  <hi>you propoſed to draw bills upon me, as your occaſions ſhould require,</hi> aſſuring me that you would only draw for as much as might be abſolutely neceſſary.—This propoſition did not appear to me in the <hi>moſt proper light,</hi> tho' I did not tell you ſo. You had no money in my hands, nor any pecuniary demands upon me; and this was at leaſt an <hi>unuſual</hi> way of applying for favors. As this project was adopted without my approbation, and purſued againſt my advice, I might with great juſtice have refuſed to furniſh any money for its execution. But, ſir, I ſaw and I felt the unhappy dilemma to which you had imprudently brought yourſelf; without money, you could not proceed, and without proceeding your would ſuffer diſgra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I alſo conſidered what was due to your friends, whom you had thus ſubjected to the diſagreeable alternative of either ſeeing you reſign with an ill grace, or ſubmit to the expence of preventing it. The latter was more conſiſtent with my own judgment and feelings, and therefore I preſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>How much</hi> you ſhould be allowed, then became a neceſſary queſtion, as well as a difficult one; becauſe in determining it, reſpect was to be had to the <hi>abilities and inclination</hi> of your friends, which I could only <hi>conjecture;</hi> to <hi>your ideas of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> which were very <hi>vague,</hi> and to your <hi>proper and unavoidable expences</hi> which we neither knew, nor had then time to enquire about; and which would greatly depend on your <hi>being admitted,</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> into the Duke's family. As to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>unlimited credit,</hi> I declined it; not from doubts of the ſincerity of your aſſurances, but becauſe it would in itſelf have been improper.</p>
               <p>I could eaſily ſuppoſe, that either in the capacity of a volunteer-gentleman-ſoldier, or as a volunteer aid de camp to the Duke, you might ſpend a great deal of money, and yet ſpend much leſs than ſome others in the ſame ſituation: But I could alſo ſuppoſe that a ſum which, meaſured by their fortunes, would be very moderate, would, if compared with <hi>your funds,</hi> be very extravagant: <hi>Their</hi> expences, therefore, could furniſh no rule for <hi>your's.</hi> Admitting alſo, for the ſake of argument, that this project was capable of affording you not only much pleaſure, but alſo much advantage; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the expence of it exceeded your means to ſupply, your attention ſhould return, as ſoon as poſſible, to objects more within the limits of your power and circumſtances. Had you followed my advice, and previouſly aſcertained the expences incident to the place promiſed you by the Duke, your way would have been plain and obvious.</p>
               <p>I had ſeveral months before written to your uncle <hi>to fix the ſum</hi> beyond which he would not chuſe that your expences ſhould extend, and I purpoſed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to repeat that requeſt, as his anſwer would relieve me from the riſque of all differences with you on ſo delicate a ſubject in future, I thought it moſt prudent to make you ſuch an allowance <hi>in the mean time,</hi> as I had reaſon to think fully adequate to <hi>your real wants,</hi> tho' perhaps not to <hi>your deſires.</hi> For this, however, ſome <hi>ule</hi> was neceſſary, and I could find none better than the allowances on which <hi>the Spaniſh officers appeared to live decently.</hi> I thought that if you was enabled to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019735_0032_0FACA546A3C7F920"/>live in the ſtile of a <hi>Spaniſh captain of foot,</hi> until the inſtructions of your uncle ſhould arrive, you would have reaſon to be ſatisfied. I therefore agreed to allow you <hi>the ſame pay,</hi> and to advance you the amount of it <hi>for ſix months.</hi> Over and above this, I agreed not only to pay off your little debts here, which I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found to amount to fifty odd hard dollars, but alſo to furniſh you with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for your expences between this and Cadiz, and for regimentals, &amp;c. In ſhort, I gave you at ſetting out 127 pieces of eight <hi>in hand,</hi> and a credit on Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> for 150 more, which you accordingly received on your arrival. I alſo authoriſed you, <hi>in caſe you ſhould be taken priſoner, and not otherwiſe,</hi> to draw upon me for ſufficient to relieve you from the diſtreſſes in which ſuch an event might involve you. I acknowledge that you expoſtulated with me warmly, tho' not indecently, on the ſubject of this proviſion, and that you was diſcontented with it, tho' in my opinion, without reaſon. I thought it was doing as much as, all things conſidered, could prudently be done for you. I did not know how far your uncle might either find it convenient, or be diſpoſed to defray even theſe expences, eſpecially conſidering the amount of thoſe which he had already incurred on your account; and I thought it my duty to pay ſome regard to his convenience, as well as to your's.</p>
               <p>A few days after your arrival at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> you wrote me the following letter:</p>

               <p>This requeſt was afterwards repeated almoſt in the ſame words, in your letter of the 6th July, in which you alſo mention ſome articles of news, and inform me, that tho' your quartan had returned the laſt poſt-day, you was then recovered.</p>
               <p>You now complain that theſe letters were never anſwered.—It is true, that tho' I have ſince written to you, viz. on the 10th day of September laſt, yet <hi>I never id take any notice of theſe letters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have known many gentlemen with ten times your allowance, in daily diſtreſs for want of money; and yet it would not have been proper to indulge them with more.</p>
               <p>You informed me, that unleſs your allowance <hi>was doubled,</hi> you might be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely diſtreſſed. This I knew to be very <hi>poſſible,</hi> but ſtill the inſufficiency of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019735_0033_0FACA54764CF0110"/>your allowance for your <hi>neceſſary</hi> expences could not <hi>thence</hi> be argued. From what could I argue it? You mentioned no facts—you ſent me no eſtimate— you did not aſſign a ſingle reaſon for your apprehenſions. You informed me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the expences of your journey, and others unavoidably to be incurred, greatly exceeded your expectations; but how was I to divine either the one or the other? or with what propriety could you expect that I would be guided by your opinion or apprehenſions, further than they might <hi>appear</hi> to be well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? —I would have encreaſed your allowance, <hi>if evidently incompetent;</hi> but that incompetency was firſt to be manifeſted. The obvious impropriety of ſuch ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, unexplained applications for money, <hi>in ſuch caſes,</hi> affords a ſufficient anſwer to them; and I ſhould indeed have ill anſwered the expectations of your friends, if I could have given them no better reaſons for advancing you money on their account, than that <hi>you had aſked for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your requeſt to <hi>double your allowance,</hi> being accompanied with no facts or reaſons to ſhew its propriety, I could continue to judge of it only from the general appearance of things. I conſidered that you had ſet out with an ample ſupply of cloaths, and with money to purchaſe regimentals, &amp;c. That you had alſo been furniſhed with money for your journey, and thereby enabled to enter the Duke's family with <hi>ſix months pay of a Captain untouched in your pocket.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conſidered that your admiſſion into his family and to his table, had actually realized thoſe expectations, from which you had before argued the <hi>cheapneſs</hi> of your plan; and that tho' you might aſſociate with gentlemen of <hi>fortune</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> yet that, not being equal to them in the <hi>one,</hi> you ought not to follow them in the <hi>other.</hi> I could perceive without any difficulty, that if you meant to keep pace in expence with many of your companions, your allowance would prove very inadequate, and I had my fears that this in a certain degree might be the caſe; for tho' you had been at the expence<note n="*" place="bottom">This included the whole expence for horſes to Cadiz.</note> of an order for poſt-horſes to carry you from hence to Cadiz, yet it ſeems the "<hi>extreme heat of the weather obliged</hi> you and a fellow-traveller to <hi>hire a coach</hi> on the way." This, no doubt, was a more <hi>agreeable</hi> way of going, and yet (unleſs made neceſſary by ſickneſs, which I have not heard was the caſe) it was travelling rather like a gentleman who needed not to regard expence, than like one whoſe funds did not admit of ſuch indulgences. You may ſay, perhaps, that it made no great difference in the expence; if ſo, it was a ſlender reaſon for encreaſing your allowance—and if, on the contrary, it was conſiderable, it ought to have been avoided.</p>
               <p>Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, at this <hi>late</hi> day, you inform me that you are obliged to find not only your own horſe, but even forage for him. This is undoubtedly a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in favor of increaſing your allowance; but ſurely, ſir, you could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I ſhould be influenced by this circumſtance, before it had come to my knowledge.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:019735_0034_0FACA548247DB878"/>
Thus, ſir, I have, by a full and temperate anſwer, treated your letter with a degree of reſpect, which it would not probably have received from many others.— I forbear making any remarks on its improprieties, being perſuaded that they are to be conſidered, rather as the incautious violences of a generous mind, revolting againſt narrow, tho' neceſſary reſtraints, than as the virulent efforts of a bad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to give unmerited pain. I flatter myſelf that ſome future moment of diſpaſſionate ſelf-examination, and a more impartial review of my uniform con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards you, will yet make room for reflections and ſenſations of <hi>another kind.</hi> My doors, my heart, and my purſe, are ſtill as open to you as ever. I rejoice to hear that you have been left above <hi>dependence,</hi> and I adviſe you to take care that <hi>that conſideration</hi> does not reduce you to it. In whatever ſituation you may think proper to place yourſelf, my beſt wiſhes will ſtill attend you; and I ſhall be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with opportunities of indulging the inclination I yet have to give you further proofs of the diſintereſted regard with which I am, ſir,</p>

               <p>Having received no anſwer to my letter of the 8th ult. I conjecture it muſt have miſcarried, I have therefore taken the liberty to encloſe <hi>a duplicate</hi> to the Ambaſſador of France, for its more certain conveyance.</p>

I arrived in this iſland the 19th of Auguſt; ſuppoſe it at preſent to be only three months. My ſervant at 5 reals a day for his wages—his maintenance during two months as much, but finding myſelf cheated, I diſcarded him and got another for 12 dollars per month, 42 dol.—A houſe for two months, at ten dollars per month, 20.—<hi>

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR letter of the 26th of <hi>October</hi> reached me yeſterday.—To begin with it—</p>
               <p>That your offers to patronize me <hi>were generous and diſintereſted,</hi> I ſhall ever acknowledge with <hi>gra itude.</hi> Can you — that there was any deſign in the acceptance of them to prejudice "you," or the neareſt of all relations to you?" The thought's injurious.—That an oeconomical attention was to be obſerved in the regulation of my expences, is certain: from this, ſir, I flatter myſelf I have not deviated. Sent at a very early time of life to France, <hi>with letters of unlimited credit,</hi> my conſtant endeavors were to live with frugality and decency My wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy uncle had permitted me to ſpend ſome months at Paris (conſult your letter from him) a tender regard for his <hi>"convenience"</hi> induced me to relinquiſh it as too expenſive a plan. You yourſelf, ſir, have expreſs'd your ſatisfaction of my conduct on that head, as well as my expences in general, till <hi>"this affair."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That my reſources are principally from the generoſity of an uncle and other friends, is not altogether fact. I am, ſir, a younger ſon of an honorable family: the profuſion of my father, too certainly left his deſcendants by his <hi>firſt</hi> marriage in diſtreſſed circumſtances. At his union with my mother, <hi>her</hi> father prudently diſpoſed of her fortune in ſuch a manner that it could only be inherited by her children: the death of my father entitled her to a third part of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>anded pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, during life, that ſhe reſigned in conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>deration of poſſeſſing a ſmaller <hi>real</hi> eſtate, which ſhe generouſly ſettled upon me at her ſecond marriage; the one half to be ſold, and which has actually been ſold by my uncle to defray the expences of my education; the other half to devolve to me at the death of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and huſband. Some years paſt a diſtant relation died and left a valuable tract of land of about 10,000 acres, to be divided between four brothers-in-law any myſelf: this, Sir! with the land and ſome ſlaves which I ſhall poſſeſs at my mother's deceaſe, will ſurely enable me to indemnify my uncle for generouſly advancing me the neceſſary ſums for my travels, &amp;c. &amp;c. even <hi>"after this affair."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A reliance on the ſincerity of your friendſhip, joined to the remonſtrances of Mr. Adams, prevailed on him to ſend me to Europe, to your <hi>care and "direction,"</hi> provided with no funds but a letter to you—'tis not ſufficiently explicit—you ſay perhaps ſo: 'twas intended as <hi>requeſt</hi> to a <hi>friend,</hi> not an <hi>order</hi> on a "Banker." If he expected that I ſhould only be received into your houſe, &amp;c. &amp;c. how in the name of heaven was I to have ſubſiſted?—think better on it. I ſtill affirm that you was the cauſe of my leaving my friends and country: 'till your offers, my uncle never entertained the moſt diſtant idea of ſending me to Europe? I never conſidered you in the light of my "Banker!" Sir! you wrong both your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and me by ſo degrading an appellation—you have no money of mine in your hands:—I was confided ſolely to your friendſhip:—Could my worthy uncle
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019735_0037_0FACA54A64C99658"/>but know that for ſome inaccuracy in his letter, I am at this moment reduced to ſell my cloaths for ſubſiſtence; what would be his feelings?</p>
               <p>I find you have miſ underſtood ſome parts of my letter: in my firſt converſation in regard to this expedition, <hi>I certainly did mention the expence:</hi> but remember, Sir! you was far from <hi>objecting</hi> to it:—I again affirm it!—you agreed with me, that in all <hi>probability</hi> the expence would not be <hi>conſiderable,</hi> we were both deceived!— as a proof be pleaſed <hi>to examine my letter to you of the 15th of June, where you will find this paragraph:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Neither in your reply, nor in converſation, did you ever ſeem to think the expence very <hi>important,</hi> 'till my permiſſion was obtained.</p>
               <p>Our different reaſons had not eſcaped my memory, Sir! I only mentioned the two alluded to as thoſe of moſt conſequence: I muſt confeſs, that as your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in my opinion with regard to the expence induced me to perſevere in it beyond a poſſibility of retracting, I think it afterwards became an obligation upon you to ſupply me with a ſufficiency to go through with it in a <hi>decent</hi> manner; there is a difference, Sir, between advancing a <hi>competency,</hi> or barely enough to carry a Gentleman to the ſcene of action, where he muſt either <hi>ſtarve,</hi> or diſhonor himſelf eternally by <hi>ignominious</hi> retreat. As to the propriety of your objecting the expence in the firſt or ſecond period, which you ſtate, it depended entirely on your own judgment. I remember your deſiring me to come to an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Crillon about it; but here, Sir! ſome circumſtances have eſcaped your memory: you may very unjuſtly accuſe me of neglecting your advice: I waited on him when he informed me that he had mentioned the affair to Count de Florida Blanca, and very candidly declared his belief of its being impracticable.—I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to you, and as you obſerve, we very ſoon agreed that the affair was finiſhed and would die away: why then do you accuſe me of permitting the Duke to ſet out for Cadiz, without ſaving a word to him of expences which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared, and <hi>both</hi> of us believed would never be incurred? <hi>after our various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and my letter of the 15th of June,</hi> I am ſurpriſed to ſee this ſentence in vom letter,—</p>
               <p>"But the warmth and enthuſiaſm inſpired by a deſire of ſharing the eclat of a brilliant coup de main hurried you too far." <hi>I muſt refer to the aforeſaid letter, and to ſome "minute particulars" therein.</hi> Remember your own opinion on that ſubject—my ſituation. Remember my laſt requeſt, and your promiſe to juſtify me to my friends, to inform them generouſly of the many unforeſeen delays which impeded my application, and obliged me to incur heavy expence, viz. the journey to Cadiz, which I flattered myſelf to have made with the Duke: <hi>was not that letter of the 15th of June written at your own requeſt, to ſerve as a proof
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019735_0038_0FACA54B23C04860"/>of thoſe "minute particulars" in defence of both our characters?</hi> is all this ſo ſoon forgotten? I find myſelf deſcribed by you as a ſharper, baſely endeavouring to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I yeſterday had a letter from him? he declines aſſiſting me any farther! I cannot blame him; I was wrong to aſk it; the proſpect of want obliged me! I have deceived him, but I was deceived myſelf! I told him that your reſtricting me to 150 dollars was from a perſuaſion that it would be enough; that a proof of its inſufficiency would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to extend it; in ſhort gave him every aſſurance that he would ſuffer no inconvenience from it; I believe it, Sir! You ſuſpect me of ſpending my money by a ridiculous vanity of being thought equal to men of ten times my fortune? you ought to have known me better. Sickneſs, Sir, in fact obliged me to hire a coach at Cadava, through the extreme heat of the weather, was a very ſufficient reaſon; perhaps, Sir, you never rode poſt through Andaluſia in the latter end of June</p>

               <p>A reaſon which I could better explain <hi>verbally</hi> than by letter, prevented me from going to the Duke's for ſome time, except when on guard; this with my long <hi>illneſs,</hi> ſwelled my tavern and apothecary's account, together with my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for breakfaſting ſince my arrival, to 33 dollars. Some neceſſary move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables for my lodgings coſt me 16. I gave 11 for a large ſurtout, being obliged ſo be out in the night and in bad weather, and as the one mentioned in the other account is rather a genteel riding coat, than a proper ſhelter from an inclement ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>There, Sir, is exactly the 150 dollars—I, at preſent, as already obſerved, ſubſiſt by the ſale of ſuch parts of my equipage as I can beſt ſpare; for pride will not let me beg.</p>
               <p>Should this eſtimate ſo far ſatisfy you, as to induce you to incommode your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf farther on my account, I beg, that it may be employed in repaying Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon—I can ſtarve with pleaſure rather than ſuffer a ſtain on reputation or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty; he has but too much reaſon to think lightly of <hi>both,</hi> ſince you have actually <hi>renounced</hi> me!</p>
               <p>Thus, Mr. <hi>Jay!</hi> by an accurate and juſt ſtate of my expences, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to convince you that I am not the <hi>imprudent boy</hi> you ſeem to ſuppoſe me. You alſo ſhould be cautious of giving unmerited pain; take care how you inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate from ignorance of facts, things which may be prejudicial to the one, whoſe character in a manner, depends upon your good or ill report of him.

                     <hi>Madrid,</hi> 
                     <date>December 29, 1781.</date>
                  </dateline>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS ſilence is ſometimes liable to be miſinterpreted, it is proper that I ſhould ſo far reply to your letter of the 7th inſtant, as to correct ſome of the principal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in it.</p>
               <p>I have never thought nor intimated, that my offers to patronize you were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with deſign to prejudice me, and conſequently your remark on that head is premature.</p>
               <p>It is true that I did approve of your not going to Paris, and (as far as I could judge) "of your expences in general, till this affair"—juſtice demands this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion—I am ignorant of your having had <hi>unlimited credit in France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That you came to Europe, deſtitute of other funds than a letter to me, <hi>I did not know.</hi> I expected, on your arrival, and from time to time afterwards, to furniſh money for your neceſſary expences; but, I alſo expected, that funds had been, or would be provided, to reimburſe theſe advances from time to time.</p>
               <p>Whether your Uncle had any thoughts of ſending you to Europe until after my offers, is a ſubject on which I have no other information than <hi>your letter.</hi> I know that your Guardian, Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> had ſuch thoughts.—It was from him I firſt <hi>heard</hi> of you, and it was from his account of you, and his ſignifying a deſire that I ſhould take you with me, under my immediate care, that theſe offers were made.</p>
               <p>I never conſidered your Uncle's letter in the light of an order on a Banker and am at a loſs to conceive what ſhould have miſled you into ſuch an opinion. My remark on the want of preciſion in that letter, aroſe from his having omitted to limit your expences, and having thereby left me expoſed to diſagreeable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with you on that head.</p>
               <p>I never did concur with you in opinion as to the expences which would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attend your project; nor did I ever give you reaſon to think ſo. I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed agree <hi>that if, as you flattered yourſelf,</hi> the Duke ſhould receive you in ſuch a manner into his family, as to leave you expoſed to no other expences than for cloaths and pocket money, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe expences would not be conſiderable; but <hi>I doubted this being the caſe; I told you ſo;</hi> and in order to reduce the matter to a certainty, I advi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed you to aſcertain it by ſpeaking fully to the Duke on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I gave you this advice, immediately on being informed that he had promiſed to take you into his family, and not after the delays of the Court and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had rendered it improbable that your requeſt for leave to accompany him, would be granted.</p>
               <p>But admitting for a moment, that I really did acquieſce in your opinion of theſe expences, the inferences you attempt to draw from thence are nevertheleſs falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.—Suppoſe that my Nephew now with me, ſhould aſk my conſent to go to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:019735_0043_0FACA54EE4FD96D8"/>
                  <hi>Peru</hi> to learn Spaniſh, and that I ſhould refuſe it, without giving him any other reaſon, than that I thought he might learn Spaniſh full as well at <hi>Madrid</hi> as at <hi>Peru.</hi> —Suppoſe further, that he ſhould <hi>perſiſt</hi> in going.—Would he have the leaſt ſhadow of right to conſider me as chargeable with his <hi>expences,</hi> merely becauſe I had not made <hi>that</hi> an objection to his voyage? ſurely not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You refer me for the reaſons which induced you to go on this expedition, to your letter of the 15th of June, and "to ſome minute particulars therein:" and alſo to my opinion on them. I well remember the contents of that letter, but I know of no other opinion on thoſe minute particulars, conſidered as reaſons for your project,</hi> than what I thus expreſſed in my <hi>anſwer to that letter,</hi> viz. "That in my opinion you ought not at any rate to let them drive you to ſuch extremities." But I am ſtill of opinion that you was more ſtrongly urged into this project<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y the imagined brilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy of it, than by any ſerious conſiderations; although you have doubtleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded yourſelf to think other wiſe.</p>
               <p>You remind me of your requeſt and a promiſe on my part to <hi>juſtify</hi> you to your friends. I did not promiſe to <hi>juſtify</hi> you in this affair, to your friends, nor to any body elſe. I promiſed to ſtate the facts fully and candidly to your friends—I have done ſo, in a letter to your Uncle of the 25th of June laſt; and that letter will ſhew my regard both for you and for truth.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that your letter to me of the 15th of June, was written at my requeſt, <hi>I made that re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I know nothing of my having deſcribed you as a ſharper.</p>
               <p>You <hi>now</hi> ſay, that the moſt prevalent reaſon with you to make this campaign, was a firm belief that I was of your opinion with regard to its utility; "and that it appeared to you that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that on your expatiating on the advantages which would accrue to you from this project—you ſay I anſwered "yes, if you eſcape with whole bones, or ſome ſuch remark."—The matter you appear to allude to might have been more accurately ſtated*.</p>
               <p>Among the advantages which you thought would reſult from this project, you often inſiſted upon this, viz.—That by bringing you acquainted with many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel people in the army, it would, on your return to Madrid, facilitate your form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many reſpectable and agreeable acquaintances.—It is true I admitted that this might be the caſe;—and I alſo obſerved, <hi>at the ſame time,</hi> that ſuppoſing it to be an advantage, yet that it was not of ſufficient importance to render it adviſeable for you to encounter the hazards and inconveniences of a voyage and expedition whoſe object was then unknown, and which many conjectured would be to South America; from whence you might not return in leſs than two or three years, if at all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> inſtance you adduce is, that I expreſſed my apprehenſions to you one day, that a certain Gentleman "would be glad to have a handle againſt me, either by imputing my <hi>oppoſition</hi> to a <hi>wrong motive,</hi> or elſe making me from <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reaſons</hi> act contrary to what <hi>my duty obliged me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember this circumſtance, and you have ſtated it right in ſubſtance. But it ſeems to me that this circumſtance, inſtead of leading you to conclude and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I was <hi>in favor</hi> of your ſcheme, not only afforded proof of any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it, but alſo of my being influenced to that oppoſition by a ſenſe of duty, and not by <hi>political reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although I oppoſed your plan upon the moſt <hi>diſintereſted principles,</hi> yet as experience had taught me to expect little, fair or friendly, from the Gentleman in queſtion, I did apprehend that he would endeavour to infuſe an opinion of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from motives of a <hi>private or perſonal</hi> nature; and though I do not remember to have explained this <hi>ſo you,</hi> yet I was not without ſuſpicions, that he would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to aſcribe it to a deſire of detaining you as <hi>a private Secretary</hi> in the room of Mr. <hi>Liningston,</hi> who you know had at that very time, ſeriouſly propoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to America; or to <hi>a diſinclination</hi> to make the extraordinary advances of monkey, which the expences of this project might demand—and the fact is, that this certain Gentleman did inſinuate <hi>

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:019735_0045_0FACA550638FE5A8"/>inconſiſtency of finally conſenting from <hi>political reaſons,</hi> to a meaſure which I had before declared that <hi>my judgment,</hi> as well as my duty to you and your friends, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me to agree to, or countenance.—For although that Gentleman had <hi>at firſt warmly oppoſed</hi> your intention of going with the Duke, yet when he found that it became <hi>popular,</hi> he profeſſed to be convinced of its utility, and even <hi>ſtimulated you</hi> to perſevere in it.</p>
               <p>And although that Gentleman had, without any reſpect to my ſentiments, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patronized this project, evidently with a view to draw me into the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned inconſiſtency, <hi>he adviſed you</hi> to ſolicit my permiſſion, <hi>for him to ſpeak to</hi> the Miniſter of State <hi>in favor</hi> of your application, pretending that without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it would not be proper or delicate for him to interfere—but this ſnare did not ſucceed.</p>
               <p>That ſame Gentleman perceiving that the Spaniards, (among whom he had againſt his better knowledge, and not for the beſt purpoſes, repreſented you as a young Gentleman of an opulent fortune) were pleaſed with your plan of going a Volunteer in the Spaniſh ſervice, expatiated much and often on its advantages, and treated my oppoſition to it with an <hi>air of myſtery,</hi> calculated to infuſe the ſame ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion into others <hi>which eh expreſſed to you,</hi> viz. that I had <hi>other reaſons</hi> for my oppoſition than thoſe which I aſſigned to you.—What theſe reaſons ſhould be, he never to my knowledge explained, but left you and others to your own conjectures. Hence the propriety of my conduct upon that occaſion, was <hi>drawn into queſtion,</hi> as well as <hi>diſcuſſion.</hi>—I found myſelf expoſed by this oppoſition, to illiberal doubts and invidious ſurmiſes.—And the pain of ſuch a ſituation naturally afforded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to relieve myſelf from it, by withdrawing this oppoſition. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements were the <hi>political reaſons</hi> which I apprehended that this ſame Gentlemen wiſhed to make me ſubmit to act from, and be governed by.</p>
               <p>I, nevertheleſs, preferred obeying the obligations of what I thought my duty, to the temporary conveniences of deviating from it; for I do repeat, and ſhall <hi>as long as I live</hi> declare, that I am not conſcious of having ever in thought approved, or by word or deed led you to think, that I approved of this project.—On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I did conſtantly, openly and ſtrongly <hi>object to it,</hi> and endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you from it.—I never harboured in my heart the moſt diſtant wiſh that you would act contrary to that advice, nor ever gave you <hi>the leaſt ſhadow of a reaſon to eſpouſe ſuch an opinion.</hi>

               <p>YOURS of the 13th ult. was yeſterday delivered to me: in a correſpondence between two perſons, where the one is ſuſpected of ungenerous <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>duties</hi> of <hi>friendſhip;</hi> and the other deems himſelf equally <hi>diſhonored</hi> and <hi>ill treated;</hi> the moſt guarded expreſſions are too often offenſive; it is not therefore ſurpriſing that the warm, undiſguiſed expoſtulations of the <hi>injured</hi> (at leaſt in his <hi>own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>) ſhould be conſtrued into "<hi>inſult</hi> and <hi>indecency.</hi>" Men of honor, Mr. <hi>Jay,</hi> have no ſuperiors but <hi>benefactors;</hi> whilſt you thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>My ſituation in your family <hi>was as happy as you could render it, but the malice of a man, too well known to you, embitter'd it,</hi> and I though myſelf fortunate in an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of emerging from obſcurity, and obtaining ſome degree of knowledge and reputation—<hi>policy,</hi> not <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> influenced me: I foreſaw that your <hi>duty</hi> as a Guardian, and your tenderneſs for me as a <hi>friend,</hi> would inevitably induce you to oppoſe ſo dangerous an enterprize; your other reaſons I had coolly and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately weighted in my own mind—<hi>the principal</hi>

                  <hi>objection was the expence,</hi> for which I was entirely dependent on your generoſity, and when I mentioned it to you, it was with a pre-determination to have receded on the leaſt hint of your thinking it burthenſome. I could not have "complained of a refuſal, becauſe it was not <hi>then</hi> preceded by a right to <hi>demand.</hi>"—Your acquieſcence, I <hi>thought,</hi> gave me that right, you confirmed me in that idea by declaring it to be your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to furniſh me with a <hi>competency;</hi> the ſum ſtipulated I found <hi>inſufficient,</hi> and therefore ventured to borrow in your name the <hi>reſidue:</hi> you ſuſpected me of extravagance, but it would ſurely have been more conſiſtent with your former friendly conduct towards me, to have permitted me to make my defence, before you gave ſo fatal a ſtab to my reputation; you might have informed <hi>Harriſon,</hi> that being reſponſible to my friends for my conduct, you could not advance ſo large a ſum <hi>above what you had judged ſufficient,</hi> without being firſt ſatisfied with regard to the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of my having expended it—you might then have demanded an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it from <hi>me;</hi> hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Having never before experienced from you the leaſt ſhadow of unfriendly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I knew not to what cauſe to impute a charge ſo unexpected!—<hi>Avarice is by no means your charactereſtic;</hi> I cannot ſuſpect you of a premeditated deſign to ruin me; even ſuppoſing me to have been actuated by the enthuſiaſm ſo natural to youth of acquiring military reputation, it was no <hi>ignoble</hi> motive, and ought at leaſt to have pleaded for indulgence in the breaſt of a friend, ſuch as I eſteemed <hi>you!</hi> My <hi>banker,</hi> perhaps, would have refuſed to aſſiſt me beyond the limits of his letter, but I flattered myſelf that other conſiderations would have influenced the man, whom I gloried in acknowledging my friend and benefactor! The <hi>ſuſpicions</hi> which occaſioned the laſt ſentence in my letter of the 25th of November were briefly theſe: That you regarded me as an <hi>unprincipled</hi> profligate, who would not ſcruple to ſacrifice his ſincereſt friends by involving them in difficulties and diſtreſs, to gratify a few idle and romantic ſchemes! and that<note n="†" place="bottom">This chaſm and the one in the laſt paragraph were made by the ſeal on breaking the wax which covered the words now wanting.</note>

               <p>Having already diſpoſed of every thing which I could poſſibly ſpare, I muſt at length have recourſe to the generoſity of my acquaintances, though a Britiſh bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let would be a far more welcome alternative! <hi>Harriſon,</hi> in compaſſion, has offered me 100 dollars more; but any extremity would be more acceptable to me than farther obligations to one whom I have already too much incommoded.</p>

               <p>I SHALL endeavor to anſwer your letter of the 29th December, as coolly and diſpaſſionately as the intruding reflections on my ſituation will permit.</p>
               <p>My credit in France was for my <hi>expences,</hi> the regulation of which was left to <hi>my prudence.</hi> That I had no funds in Europe but my uncle's letter to you, I have repeatedly declared, particularly in our converſation about <hi>de Francy</hi>'s affair, and in ſettling my little accounts with Col. <hi>Livingston,</hi> at his return from Bordeaux. <hi>That my uncle will find expedients to reimburſe your advances, cannot be doubted:</hi> The expreſs methods I know not, and have <hi>often</hi> told you ſo! He did not explain it to me before my departure, nor have I <hi>ever bad</hi> the leaſt intelligence from him ſince.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> is not my guardian; conſequently, whatever plans of educations he might form for me could only be the wellwiſhes of a diſintereſted friend. Your frequent repetition of the word <hi>banker,</hi> in your letter of 26th October, occaſioned the obſervation of which you expreſs ſurpriſe. I muſt ſtill inſiſt on your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in my opinion with regard to the expence; at leaſt your extreme delicacy in <hi>not objecting</hi> it, betrayed me into a <hi>belief</hi> of your acquieſcences, and that fatal error, by urging me to <hi>perſevere,</hi> has reduced me to inextricable miſery!</p>
               <p>Your advice about arrangements with <hi>Crillon,</hi> was <hi>precedent</hi> to his promiſe of receiving me into his family: He requeſted me to wait a <hi>verbal</hi> anſwer to any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the interim mentioned it to the miniſter; during this interval, your counſel was given, but the <hi>firſt,</hi> and indeed <hi>only</hi> time I ſaw him afterwards, he candidly informed me that my requeſt was impracticable; though ſhould it be granted, he would with pleaſure receive me into his houſehold. <hi>His</hi> declaration, Sir, cruſhed my hopes, and not the <hi>ſubſequent delays of the court,</hi> which <hi>we both</hi> regarded only as little ſtrokes of fineſſe to let the affair die away.</p>
               <p>Your ſuppoſition with regard to your nephew, is not entirely jeſt; his early age confines him to objects leſs aſpiring than thoſe which ought to influence me:— I am arrived at a period when I ought to think (in the vulgar phraſe) of <hi>making my way in the world</hi>—to <hi>learn Spaniſh,</hi> was not the only advantage which allured me to this dangerous enterprize; <hi>one</hi> amongſt many others was to attain the great object of my voyage to Europe, viz. Of acquiring a degree of experience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which might at my return recommend me to my countrymen, as one not <hi>unworthy</hi> or <hi>incapable</hi> of ſerving them, and I am happy to find myſelf, <hi>not ſingular,</hi> in my hopes on that head. <hi>Your opinion</hi> on the <hi>"minute particulars"</hi> alluded to, was, that we were <hi>both</hi> expoſed without a poſſibility of vindication, to the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Did you not declare that your friendſhip for me would not permit you to ſee me <hi>diſhonored</hi> by a reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>want of money;</hi> could I believe theſe profeſſions, corroborated by ſo many <hi>former</hi> proofs of friendſhip, to be <hi>inſincere,</hi> and did not my reliance on them <hi>juſtify</hi> me in borrowing a <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> in <hi>your name,</hi> to preſerve myſelf from that <hi>diſhonour?</hi> 6th. Did not your peremptory <hi>refuſal</hi> to repay what a <hi>ſtranger</hi> had generouſly lent me on aſſurances of my credit with you, ſubject me to <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſurmiſes?</hi> 7th.

               <p>I HAVE had the honor of your letter of the 26th ult. and a duplicate of the ſame from Mr. Gautier, at Barcelona. The extremity of my diſtreſs had already reduced me to the ſevereſt curſe of poverty the neceſſity of importuning my friends; to avoid which I had once reſolved to enter into the French ſervice, where an admiſſion would not have exacted an apoſtacy from my religion, but the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pittance of a French ſubaltern I found abſolutely inſufficient for ſubſiſtence; and as the only alternative, inſtead of ſupplicating my <hi>military companions,</hi> I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed one hundred hard dollars from an Engliſh merchant, for which I gave him a bill on Mr. Harriſon agreeable to the offer of that truly generous friend, although nothing but the moſt poignant diſtreſs could have induced me to accept it. In conſequence of your letter, I ſhall take the liberty to draw upon you for the ſum limited, without incommoding Harriſon. I impatiently expect an anſwer to my letter of the 5th of February, the army is ordered immediately to Gibraltar, and it is paſt a doubt, will ſeriouſly attack that place; for my own part I am ſtill unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with regard to my <hi>future peregrinations;</hi> experience has too well initiated me into the Spaniſh mode of beſieging, to admit of a belief that Gibraltar will be the work of a day!

               <p>I can be furniſhed with letters to the firſt nobility in Rome, particularly from my worthy friend General Borgheſi; theſe conſiderations, joined to the pleaſure and <hi>inſtruction</hi> which I promiſe myſelf from the journey, induce me to think ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly of it. I could wiſh to undertake nothing of the kind without your ap-approbation, but the time will not admit of my waiting for an anſwer to this, as, (ſhould I go) I ſhall probably be at Rome <hi>before this can poſſibly reach you.</hi> Be pleaſed to preſent my reſpects to Mrs. <hi>Jay</hi> and the family.

He <hi>warmly</hi> ſollicited Mr. <hi>Jay's</hi> permiſſion to ſtay at <hi>Madrid</hi> till he could <hi>again write</hi> to his friends, and receive their anſwer. After great ſollicitation, Mr. <hi>Jay</hi> yielded to this, and it was concluded, tho' not without much altercation <hi>as to the time,</hi> that he might ſtay <hi>until the firſt of March then next.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prevent all <hi>further</hi> diſputes about the <hi>quantum</hi> of ſupplies, Mr. <hi>Jay</hi> told him that the amount of them, during that interval, muſt alſo be fixed; and after much converſation on that point, it was at length agreed, that Mr. <hi>Jay</hi> ſhould advance him at the rate of fifty guineas a year, Mr. <hi>Jay</hi> conſenting that he ſhould keep the room he then occupied in his houſe. As his mind run not a little on making an excurſion to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jay,</hi> in the moſt pointed terms, expreſſed his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of it, and told him plainly, that this allowance ſhould ſtop from the time he might go on that expedition.</p>

Matters being thus ſettled, Mr. <hi>Littlepage</hi> immediately wrote the following letter to his guardian, which, as a proof of his earneſtneſs in the buſineſs, he ſhewed to Mr. <hi>Jay,</hi> and gave him a great number of copies to forward from <hi>France,</hi> reſerving ſome to ſend on from <hi>Spain.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>Since my laſt to you of the 25th ult. Mr. Jay has received a ſummons to France, and will in conſequence leave Madrid immediately: <hi>As no object private or political, could juſtify my undertaking ſo expenſive a journey under my preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi> eſpecially conſidering Mr. <hi>Jay's</hi> uncertain ſtay there, <hi>I have reſolved with his concurrence to remain here till the month of March next,</hi> when I ſhall return to America, if your ſurprizing and unaccountable ſilence ſtill continues. The hurry and precipitation of my departure from Virginia ſufficiently excuſed you for not taking at <hi>that time</hi> explicit and regular arrangements for the means of my ſupport here; <hi>two years and an half</hi> have ſince elapſed, and nothing further has been determined on that intereſting point, nor have I ever had the leaſt intelligence from you, or any of my friends in America. What are your intentions or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations with regard to me? Can you ſuppoſe that I am to ſubſiſt forever on advances from Mr. <hi>Jay</hi> without the ſmalleſt appearance of remittances or reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements to him? His ſituation on that head is extremely embarraſſing, nor is my own leſs ſo: by a liberal allowance he may exceed <hi>your</hi> ideas of my neceſſities, and too cloſe reſtrictions are painful to us both, and indeed prejudicial to me. Such has been Mr. <hi>Jay's</hi> ſituation ever ſince my arrival in Europe, continually in hopes of being relieved by letters from you, and as often diſappointed. Delays are pardonable; but abſolute neglect is unjuſtifiable. Cannot you as leaſt inform Mr. <hi>Jay</hi> of the reaſons which have hitherto prevented you from making him remittances, and your future expectations on that head! As to the ſum he has already advanced <hi>he declares himſelf to be by no means preſſing for the re-payment of it:</hi> nor does he wiſh you to diſtreſs yourſelf on that account, but to take your meaſures relative to it, in any manner moſt commodious to yourſelf;—he will advance as my exigencies may require not exceeding fifty guineas per year, from the time of his departure, <hi>till next March,</hi> when as I have before obſerved, if you do not furniſh me with adequate ſupplies, and him with proper inſtructions, I muſt abandon all the hopes I have formed in the political line, and return to Virginia Reflect ſeriouſly on my ſituation, and the conſequences which may follow a further delay on ſo preſſing an occaſion. After near three years reſidence at this Court in the family of an American Miniſter with <hi>the friendſhip and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that Miniſter</hi> to recommend me in America, my political projects cannot ſurely be deemed chimerical. I am as yet too young to expect a public employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:019735_0056_0FACA558A4A87DB0"/>a ſhort time will remove that objection, and in the interim I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt opportunities of inſtructing myſelf in the politics of this country, and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope in general. The mutual intere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts of Spain and America will require that an eternal political intercourſe ſhould exiſt between the two nations, and as a candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for an employment of that kind, I poſſeſs inconteſtible advantages. To elucidate this, a ſhort review of my paſt conduct here, may not be unneceſſary. On my arrival at this place, I ſo and my ſituation very different from the ideas I had previouſly formed of it. The in deciſion of the Court with reſpect to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, ſtrongly influenced the conduct of individuals, which, <hi>joined to ſome more private reaſons,</hi> (by no means however proceeding from Mr. <hi>Jay</hi> rendered all connection or even intercourſe with Spaniards, difficult, and <hi>to me</hi> really impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>My political purſuits were in conſequence greatly impeded, if not abſolutely fruſtrated, as the firſt ſtep in that line was to render myſelf <hi>known</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and by attracting <hi>attention</hi> acquire <hi>conſequence.</hi> Eight months experience too well convinced me of the impracticability of ſucceſs on my firſt plan, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think ſeriouſly of abandoning it, when an occaſion offered which I thought meritted attention. Immenſe preparations were making for an expedition to be commanded by the Duke de <hi>Crillon,</hi> and ſaid to be againſt Gibraltar or Minor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Policy ſuggeſted to me that ſome efforts on the occaſion might be of utility in the attainment of my grand object, as it would inevitably remove the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I had experienced in forming connections here. Reconſideration but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in the idea, and in conſequence I demanded the King's permiſſion to attend the Duke de <hi>Crillon</hi> as a Volunteer. This ſtep occaſioned great ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and effectually anſwered my purpoſe in <hi>attracting attention.</hi> To the ſurprize of every body my requeſt was granted, and I ſerved the campaign in the Mediterranean as Volunteer Aid de Camp to the Commander in Chief. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſiege of Mahon I aſſidiouſly endeavoured, both from real eſteem and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to recommend myſelf to the Spaniards, in which I ſo happily ſucceeded, that at my return I found every political obſtacle removed, and nothing now remains but to proſecute my plan under every advantage that my moſt ſanguine hopes could promiſe.</p>
               <p>Such is my ſituation and ſuch my views in Europe, which will be all rendered abortive by a further delay on your part. Conſider the conſequence; if I do not receive letters from you by the <hi>month of March next,</hi> I ſhall no longer have the means of ſubſiſtence, and muſt return to you, where I ſhall be in the ſame ſituation as before my voyage to Europe, at the expence of all this time and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. What buſineſs or profeſſion can I poſſibly be qualified to purſue in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca? In ſhort, affairs are now brought to a criſis,—procraſtination will but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe difficulties.—Take your reſolution and inform me of it immediately, or I muſt abandon all.</p>

                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:019735_0057_0FACA55963797B60"/>
I ſhall ſend twelve different copies of this letter to America, directed to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Harriſon. There can be no difficulty in tranſmitting your anſwer; make a dozen copies of it, ſend ſome to Mr. <hi>Robert Livingston,</hi> Secretary for foreign affairs, at Philadelphia, to be ſent to Mr. <hi>Jay;</hi> others to the houſe of <hi>Harriſon,</hi> at Alexandria in your ſtate, for their Agent, Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> at Cadiz, to whom I alſo requeſt you would remit as ſoon as poſſible the 200 dollars which he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly lent me on an occaſion which I have already explained to you.

               <p>I AM equally ſurprized and chagrined to find that you have taken no explicit arrangements with Mr. <hi>Carmichael,</hi> reſpecting the payment of my allowance, and conſequently leſt me expoſed to the diſagreeable neceſſity of borrowing money on my own credit, for which I can only give an order upon you, at the riſque of a refuſal either on his part to ſupply me, or on yours to refund it. You have taken no notice of the <hi>ſeparate ſum,</hi> which I repeatedly requeſted from you to purchaſe ſome neceſſaries, viz. linnen, a ſuit of cloths, &amp;c. &amp;c. for which my allowance of 20 dollars per month is by no means ſufficient. As the hurry, &amp;c. of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for your journey doubtleſs cauſed this inadvertency, I <hi>requeſt that you would immediately rectify it,</hi> by a letter to me or to Mr. <hi>Carmichael.</hi> Fifty dollars is I think the leaſt that can be advanced on the occaſion, as I have not more than half a dozen ſhirts tolerably decent, and but one old ſuit of regimentals, which has ſerved me for more than twelve months. My quarters amount is but 60 dollars, and ſhould I appropriate it to clothing myſelf I ſhall abſolutely want ſubſiſtence.— This will doubtleſs reach you at Bourdeaux, <hi>from whence I expect an anſwer without delay.</hi> I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Bondfield</hi> delivered me your letter of the 23d ult, this morning. When
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:019735_0058_0FACA55A23A93A08"/>you recollect that I authoriſed you to apply to Mr. <hi>Carmichael</hi> for a quarter part of your allowance of 50 guineas a year, you will find that there was not much room for <hi>ſurpriſe or chagrin</hi> at my having omitted to repeat it to him in the hurry of preparing for my journey. I was perſuaded that he would not ſcruple your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity; but would readily pay it, and deduct it from the money he will receive on the ſale of my mules. I cannot conceive <hi>why</hi> you ſhould fear a deviation from my word.</p>
               <p>As to the ſum you wanted to purchaſe cloathes, I really did forget it, and I am content that he pay you fifty hard dollars for that purpoſe on my account. I have not time at preſent to write to him on the ſubject, but this letter will be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient voucher.</p>
               <p>You will remember that your future ſupplies muſt be drawn from America, and that the allowances before mentioned will ceaſe after the firſt day of March next.</p>

               <p>YOUR profeſſions, and indeed <hi>proofs</hi> of friendſhip to me have ever appeared too <hi>diſintereſted to admit the moſt diſtant doubt of their ſincerity;</hi> I cannot therefore impute your <hi>oppoſition</hi> to my deſign of continuing in the army, to <hi>any other motive than a real friendly regard to what you think my intereſt.</hi> Your declaration at our parting, that ſuch a proceeding ſhould by no means be conſidered as done by your concurrence, I naturally accounted for upon the principles on which I ever wiſh to conſider your conduct; but your unexpected menace to withdraw from me in conſequence of it, even the pittance ſtipulated for my ſupport in Spain, I muſt own ſenſibly touched me; eſpecially as that reſolution was taken at a time, when I had undoubted intelligence of my being actually nominated for the ſiege of Gibraltar. My reception at Court was flattering enough, though my intention of quitting the ſervice occaſioned univerſal ſurpriſe, and ſome of my moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends, who from their ſituations could beſt be ſuppoſed to know the diſ-diſpoſition of both the Court and people, after informing me of the conjectures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion, candidly adviſed me either to leave Spain, or finiſh in the military line what I had happily commenced. Infinite conſiderations induced me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the latter alternative as moſt honorable and indeed advantageous.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt.

                  </gap>, Sir, but the moſt urgent neceſſity could have prevailed upon to accept of their offers, however friendly and diſintereſted, and if you knew the weight of an obligation on a generous mind, even to thoſe in whom peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:019735_0060_0FACA55BA3067DE0"/>render it almoſt a duty, you would be the leſs ſurprized at my reluctance to ſolicit relief from you <hi>after ſo many repeated refuſals, and a cold reſervedneſs</hi> to which I cannot be inſenſible<note n="*" place="bottom">This aſſertion is not forunded on fact.</note>. After that warmth of friendſhip and unlimitted confidence which but lately exiſted between us, the world cannot but form infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences infinitely to my diſadvantage at ſo unexpected a reverſe.</p>
               <p>Your eſtabliſhed character and reputation in the world will never admit a belief that you could renounce a young man, of whom you had declared your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the friend and patron, from no motive but, at worſt, an indiſcretion natural enough to the impetuoſity of youth; and who could not brook the idea of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting himſelf to the ſmalleſt imputation by refuſing an honorable military poſt, to which a King had appointed him, <hi>unſolicited;</hi> that, however, is paſt, <hi>the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign is now finiſhed</hi> and I am at liberty to act as my own diſcretion or <hi>your advice</hi> (which I once more requeſt) ſhall determine me.</p>
               <p>I had thoughts of making intereſt with the Count de <hi>Artois,</hi> who had more than once expreſſed an inclination to ſerve me, <hi>to demand letters for me from the Spaniſh Court to Congreſs,</hi> but the General having ordered me on board the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined fleets when they left Gibraltar bay, to give him an accurate account of their manoeuvres. I but yeſterday returned here, and find his Highneſs has already taken his departure; however, I ſhall go to camp in a few days, to demand my congé, and <hi>make application to the Miniſtry, thro' the medium of the Duke de Crillon, who I think cannot decently refuſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince de Maſſerano is very deſirous of my accompanying him to Paris, where by the connections I have had the good fortune to form during this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, I have reaſon to think I could be genteely placed in the French ſervice:— of that, however, I think but little. <hi>I again requeſt your advice</hi> with regard to <hi>my future conduct,</hi> and <hi>what I have to expect from you:</hi> are you as yet decided with reſpect to returning to Madrid, or not?</p>
               <p>Incloſed I ſend you a copy of my journal of the manoeuvres of the Britiſh and combined fleets, in the action of the 20th, off Cape Spartel. My moſt reſpectful compliments to Mrs. Jay.</p>

               <p>I HAVE received your letter of the 29th ult. as well as a former one of the 10th June laſt, but the one you mention to have written on the 12th of June never came to my hands,</p>

               </p>
               <p>The marquis de la Fayette is arrived at Cadiz, and informed me the other day by the Count de Crillon, that he is deſirous for me to accompany him to America: I ſhall in conſequence repair immediately to Cadiz, to take explicit arrangements with him for that purpoſe.</p>

Mr. Adams wrote a letter to Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Jay, propoſing Mr. <hi>Thaxter,</hi> who was his private Secretary, as a proper perſon to carry the Dennitive Treaty of Peace to Congreſs, and mentioning the reaſons why he thought that mark of attention was due to him, Mr. Adams told Mr. Jay, that Dr. Franklin, on reading it, ſaid, <hi>"be had no objections,"</hi> and Mr. Jay on being informed of this, and perfectly concurring in opinion with Mr. Adams relative to Mr. Thaxter, alſo conſented.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt of September, 1783, Mr. Littlepage waited on Mr. Jay, and told him, that the matter of his carrying the Treaty to America now reſted ſolely with him, for that on applying to Dr. Franklin for his note, the Doctor anſwered, <hi>"he had no predilection for Mr. Adams's Secretary, and if it would do him (Mr. Littlepage) a pleaſure, he ſhould have his vote."</hi> Mr. Jay obſerved that there muſt be ſome miſtake in the buſineſs, for that Mr. Franklin had told Mr. Adams, <hi>"he had no objections to Mr. Thaxter's being the perſon,"</hi> and further added, that for his own part, he really thought, as Mr. Thaxter had long been in the diplomatic department, he certainly ought on ſuch an occaſion to be preferred to <hi>one who had never been in it.</hi> Mr. Littlepage inſiſted on his having the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>octor's promiſe, and went away to appearance much diſatisfied.</p>
               <p>On the 2d September, Mr. Jay received as inſolent a letter from. Mr. Littlepage, as could well be penned;—it reproached him in very indecent language, for having told him that Mr. Franklin was for Mr. Thaxter, when on the contrary, he had promiſed to vote for <hi>him,</hi> it charged him with this as a palpable falſehood; it reproached him in general terms for ill uſage; it aſſerted that Mr. Jay hadgiven him reaſon to expect his vote; it contained a challenge, and among other abuſive paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, inſinuated that Mr. Jay had declined bringing him to Paris, merely to leave him as a ſpy on Mr. Carmichael, at Madrid.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, and not long after the receipt of this letter, Mr. Adams came in, and ſhortly
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:019735_0064_0FACA55EA375BE58"/>afterwards a ſervant informed Mr. Jay, that Mr. Littlepage wanted to ſee him; he was admitted, and deſired Mr. Jay to ſpeak with him in private, to which Mr. Jay replied, that he could have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, which Mr. Jay had any objections to his ſaying before Mr. Adams. Mr. Jay ſhewed Mr. Adams the letter, and that gentleman gave his opinion of it in very explicit and proper terms to Mr. Littlepage, adding that <hi>he himſelf</hi> had told Mr. Jay, that Dr. Frank in had no objections to Mr. Thaxter's being appointed, and that the Doctor had told him ſo. A converſation then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued between Mr. Jay and Mr. Littlepage, relative to the other very exceptionable paſſages in his letter: Mr. Jay poſitively denied the truth of the hardy aſſertions contained in it, and with reſpect to the reaſons of his having remained at Madrid, referred him to his own letter to his uncle, of the 15th of May, 1782, and aſked him how he could reconcile what he <hi>now</hi> inſinuated, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that letter;—he confeſſed that they <hi>did not "run parallel:"</hi> after a little further diſcuſſion, he began to appear ſenſible of the impropriety of his conduct, in ſhort, <hi>he aſked Mr. Jay's pardon for what he had written, he deſired it might be all forgotten, and for that purpoſe, requeſted Mr. Jay's permiſſion to burn the letter, which</hi> (Mr. Jay conſenting to) <hi>he then immediately burnt:</hi> He then gave Mr. Jay his hand, and took his leave: Mr. dams was in the room from the time Mr. Littlepage came into, and ſome time after, the time Mr. Littlepage want away; and to the well known can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and integrity of that Honorable Gentleman Mr. Jay appeals, for the truth and proof of theſe facts.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time after this, Mr. Jay was well informed, that Mr. Littlepage had ſpoken of this tranſaction, and had ſaid <hi>that the diſpute was accommodated, on Mr. Jay's making certain admiſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From that time forwards, Mr. Jay avoided as much as poſſible, all manner of intercourſe and correſpondence with that young man: Nor does he recollect to have written to, or received a ſingle line further from him, during the courſe of that year, except the following note when in London, and to which he did not return any anſwer, viz.—</p>

               <p>In the ſpring of 1784, Mr. Carmichael came to Paris, to aſſiſt in ſettling the public accounts. When that buſineſs was finiſhed, and Mr. Jay was juſt about ſetting out for America, he expreſſed to Mr. Jay the uneaſineſs he experienced from the coolneſs which had unhappily ſubſiſted between them, and wiſhed that its further continuance might be removed by a free and friendly explanation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; they accordingly went into it with great temper, and diſcuſſed a variety of matters, which do not relate to the preſent ſubject. Mr. Jay neither mentioned nor ſhewed to him Mr. Littlepage's letter of 15th June, 1782, nor any of its contents. In the courſe of the conferrence, Mr. Carmichael mentioned him, and intimated that he had good reaſon to believe that Mr. Littlepage had played a double game between them; for that after Mr. Jay had left Madrid, he had taken him into his houſe, and lent him money; and that he had told him many things <hi>to Mr. Jay's diſadvantage,</hi> which appeared to him <hi>very extraordinary and improbable;</hi> and among others, <hi>"that Mr. Jay had left b m at Madrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to be a ſpy upon him, (Mr. Carmichael; and had given him a cypher to enable him to convey his advices more ſafely and ſecurely."</hi> Mr. Jay aſſured Mr. Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, that it was a moſt impudent falſhood, and <hi>he</hi> did not heſſitate to ſay, that he really believed it to be ſo.

               <p>Mr. Jay left Paris in May 1784, and came to America. He afterwards heard that Mr. Littlepage had returned to Virginia, but neither wrote to him, nor received any letters from either him or his guardian.</p>

Mr. Jay therefore, without any previous notice or ceremony, commenced an action againſt him.

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>SUPPOSE Mr. Jay to be as capable of inventing, as Mr. Littlepage confeſſes himſelf to have been of certifying, falſe facts; is it probable that Mr. Jay would have (eſpecially conſidering his profeſſional knowledge of ſuch ſubjects) contrived that letter of 15th June, 1781, ſo very injudiciouſly, as that it ſhould repreſent his witneſs to be a perſon highly incenſed againſt the man whom his teſtimony was deſigned to depreciate? Would he, in ſuch a caſe, have invented, and brought into ſtrong light, reſentments of his witneſs againſt the adverſe party? or would he not rather have given his witneſs the appearance of an indifferent perſon, diſpaſſionately giving evidence merely from regard to juſtice and to truth?</p>
               <p>If <hi>that letter</hi> was of Mr. Jay's invention, and written at his inſtigation, how did it happen that Mr. Littlepage, ſo often in the courſe of his ſubſequent letters, written during his abſence, ſhould not only refer to it as true, but alſo mention additional facts and circumſtances againſt Mr. Carmichael, which exactly correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with the motives and conduct imputed by him to that gentleman in this?</p>
               <p>How did it happen that Mr. Littlepage did never, in any of thoſe moments of chagrin and vexation in which he wrote his ſeveral rude and abuſive letters to Mr. Jay, even ſo much as intimate, that Mr. Jay had made him write and atteſt falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods?</p>
               <p>Is it to be preſumed that common ſenſe, if not common honeſty, would not have reſtrained Mr. Jay from thus raſhly putting himſelf in the power of a perſon ſo inconſiderate, ſo volatile, and ſo young?</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Jay ſo committed himſelf, how is it to be accounted for, that he ſhould, from firſt to laſt, for now near five years, have perſevered in one ſtedfaſt,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019735_0078_0FACA56922B4FAB0"/>inflexible line of conduct; and by repeatedly croſſing and diſappointing Mr. Littlepage's favorite with is and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>s leaving him to ſuffer for his rudeneſs and indelicacy, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſtimulate him to indulge his propenſity to pour forth reproaches?</p>
               <p>How did it happen, that, if Mr. Littlepage poſſeſſed Mr. Jay's confidence in the degree he pretends, that none of Mr. Jay's letters to him contain the leaſt mark of it? They ſay nothing of Mr. Carmichael, but what ſprung from the letter in queſtion: nor any thing of Mr. Livingſton, but that he was gone to America— not even a hint of his reaſons for going, nor of the circumſtances inducing or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Jay had wiſhed to leave Mr. Littlepage at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to watch Mr. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michael, why did he <hi>adviſe and preſs him</hi> to go to <hi>America,</hi> as Mr. Littlepage himſelf admits? How did it happen that none of their ſubſequent letter; even alluded to ſuch a deſign, or contained even an obſcure hint relative to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
               <p>If ſuch an explanation as littlepage pretends, really did take place between him and Mr. Carmichael, whereby he was led toentertain the opinion which he ſays he <hi>thenceforth</hi> entertained of Mr. Jay; how are we to account for his ſubſequent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of 10 June, 29 Oct. 5 and 29 Dec. 1782, in which he expreſſes ideas the moſt oppoſite that can be to ſuch an opinion? Why did he afterwards ſolicit Mr. Jay's favor and influence at Paris, by his letter of 16th July 1783, and when Mr. Jay then acted directly contrary to his wiſhes and requeſt, why did he aſk Mr. Jay's pardon in the preſence of Mr. Adams, for the expreſſions he uſed on that occaſion?</p>
               <p>How did it happen that here in America Mr. Jay ſhould continue to keep him at a diſtance, and hold ſuch a conduct towards him, as inſtead of betraying appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and prudential pliancy, rather invited offence and crimination?</p>
               <p>Does all this look as if Mr. Jay was conſcious of having put himſelf in the power of this young man? Or that Mr. Littlepage could with truth ſay any thing injurious to the character which Mr. Jay, from his youth, and for years, ſpent under the public eye, and in the public ſervice, has invariably maintained?</p>
               <p>In ſhort, after a full inveſtigation of Mr. Littlepage's behaviour and practices, as delineated in his letters and publications, can any other concluſion be drawn, than that <hi>Hic niger eſt, hune tu Romane caveto.</hi>
