            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Sir, it is now five years since you, supposing me a fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for your purposes, relieved me and a suffering family from poverty, and gave me a share in your business by way of securing my services.</p>

                     <p>I did, Sir; and would have lost my life before I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the cause of humanity. The profession of a lawyer may be exercised in the fullest conformity to the rules of universal justice and expansive benevolence, as we know by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of many around us: it is such as you who bring upon it the vulgar sarcasms of the undiscriminating and thoughtless. For myself, soon disgusted with your manner of living, and your manner of practice, I should have thrown off the lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive connexion, but for the persuasions of a beloved wife, who, having felt the rude and 'numbing grasp of poverty, anxiously sought to guard our children from it. For her and them I labour'd—that is past—for she and they—are—dead—<hi>(struggling to repress his feelings)</hi>—Pshaw—this is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

                     <p>Yes, they are dead, Mr. Whitely; and I can sympathize with you. My poor Beckky too—I, too, have had my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; I, too, have lost a wife; torn from me, and from my daughter—</p>

                     <speaker>WHITELY.</speaker>
                     <p>She was a loss—but a loss had not virtue to feel. Tell not me of your affliction: you rejoiced in her death; nor do I believe it ever gave you pain, except, perhaps, a momentary pang, from the remembrance of your conduct towards her.</p>

                     <p>She was, indeed, a loss to her daughter. Poor girl! denied the advantages of that wealth which you accumulate but to misuse, you keep her, though now a woman, at an obscure country boarding-school, that her presence may not check the secret indulgences of those sensual pleasures, in which you seek for happiness.</p>

You are a wretch, whose every moment of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity depends upon the strength of the cob-web veil woven by your own hypocrisy. You start from the eye of inquiry. You tremble at the breath of truth. Detection, a phantom, painted by your own fears, is for ever before your eyes.

                     <p>Ha, ha! no, pardon me there. Tom is wild—is often enticed or hurried into scenes of vicious dissipation; but he has no prejudices; no fixed habits; his mind is not encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with one cloud which may intercept a single ray of science. And what I love the dear lad for most, is, that during the five years I have known him I do not believe that a falshood has passed his lips. And that is rather an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary circumstance, considering his connection with us, brother Semblance.</p>

                     <p>His present extravagances I can trace to his disrelish for the study and practice of the law, as taught by you, his master and guardian; and the very bad example you set him.</p>

                     <p>Do not continue to deceive yourself—I am pretty certain that Tom knows you, for what you are—a hypocrite.

                     <p>Among my brethren, Sir: mankind are all brothers, you know, Sir. The fact is, I came home late, and finding the door bolted, I would not knock, for fear of disturbing you. Hey, Sir? considerate. For you might not have been long in bed yourself, you know.</p>

                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>I mean, Sir, to insist on your doing me the favour to pack up your <hi>alls</hi> and leave my house immediately.</p>

                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>Very luminously, Sir. A brazen head could not have spoken more oracularly. But, as I am young, Sir; as I am an orphan and <hi>your</hi> ward; as I have need of experienced wisdom to counsel me, and upright virtue to be constantly before my eyes for an example; I trust you will not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighty reasons, turn me adrift upon life's stormy sea, without ballast or provisions, and in my present shattered trim.</p>

                     <p>Reasons, Sir! well, you shall have them. First, it is my will: you understand me, Sir. You would not stay in my house in spite of my teeth, as well as kiss my servant in spite of her's? Secondly, you are a libertine.</p>

                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>I am a miserable sinner, guardy; but what are the-faults you have, principally, to reproach me with?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>Wine, gaming, women,</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>Wine! did you ever know me guilty of excess?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, a clerk ought to drink nothing but water. Do you ever see any thing else at my table?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Sir; nor did you ever see me drink any thing else at your table. But, when among my friends, would you have me refuse a glass or two, when offered by the hand of hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? Who can make a crime of a trifling point of gaiety like this?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>"Gaiety!" It is from gaiety, too, that you play cards, I suppose?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>I play sometimes to please my friends, and sometimes from a weak wish to stifle thought and drown the remembrance of my disagreeable situation in your service, and your injurious treatment of your amiable daughter.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>And when I do play, I make a point of playing well; for I never allow myself to be outdone in any thing.</p>

                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>And it is out of regard to my daughter, that you have a smile, bow, nosegay, or sonnet, for every girl in the parish.</p>

                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not know that it is a crime to admire beauty, or to cultivate a talent for expressing my thoughts with elegance and truth.</p>

                     <p>Truth in a sonnet! talent! admiration of beauty! Sir, Sir, you will get more by engrossing one plea, than by all the sonnets that ever dribbled from the brains of love-sick boys, or fame-sick ladies, since the time of Petrarch and Laura. I admire your talents, Sir; I acknowledge your superabundant merit; so, Sir, please to walk out of my house.</p>

                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>What, Sir, after having promised repeatedly that I should be your successor in business!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>Strike that out from your memorandum-book, and put down this in its stead; "I will never have for my successor a gentleman of spirit, who <hi>drinks</hi> from innocent gaiety; <hi>games</hi> from his love to my daughter; and kisses all the girls in the neighbourhood in spite of their teeth, by way of cultivating his talents."</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>And what then, Sir?</p>

                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>

                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>When I have seen a fine woman, I have said to myself, to-morrow those cheeks will be wrinkled; those sparkling eyes extinguished; those lilies and roses faded; and, certainly, this frail head shall not be able to turn mine.</p>

                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>Never, Sir, never. What can be the pleasure of a game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? Has his soul one moment of calm or self-enjoyment? If he gains, his gain is always below desire; if he loses, rage and despair take possession of his soul. The feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity are banished from the gamester's heart; he thirsts for the ruin of his nominal friend, who equally burns with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to ruin him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>How impressive is truth, even from the lips of falshood! Well, Sir, but at least the table has its pleasures for you?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SEMBLANCE.</speaker>
                     <p>Rather say its poisons. When I am tempted by good cheer, sparkling wine, seducing society, I represent to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the consequences of excess, an aching head, disordered stomach, clouded reason, loss of time—this saves me—I eat just enough to support my strength; my health is always equal; my ideas always pure and luminous. But all this is so easy, Sir, that there is even no merit in the practice.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>I acknowledge, Sir, the truth of your observations; nor shall you find me backward in the practice. You are now, Sir, old; you know me capable of business; you know my pretensions to your daughter; give me her hand and put me into your practice, and you shall see in my conduct a pattern to all husbands and all attornies.</p>

                     <p>That's a very impertinent thought of your's. To reduce a young fellow, like me, full of health and animation, beneath the level of a whining spinster, like you, deprived by educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your natural vigour, and by the laws of society of your natural rights. Go in; wipe your eyes; be a good girl, and defy the devil: I'm your friend.</p>

                     <p>Now then to business. I am an Englishman, d'y'see, and my name's George Grapple. I was born and bred to the sea; and have serv'd on board man of war or frigate from the time I knew a cabouse from a compass. I was appointed to the command of the <hi>Pretty Betsey,</hi> of 26 guns, and order'd to cruize off your coast, where I had not been two days, when I fell in with a French frigate of 34 guns, whom I 'spied by day-break bearing down upon us, with a crowd of canvass; we bore up to meet her with merry hearts, prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for action; and we were soon at it, yard-arm and yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm. All my masts were shot by the board, and I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for it but grappling. I order'd it, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd by shouts; when a volley of hand-granades set fire to my forecastle, and in a minute we were all in flames. I got out my long-boat to save my men, and the gallant French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as soon as they saw our distress, ceas'd firing, and came to our assistance in their's. I saw my brave men safe from the fire; but for myself, I remain'd on my quarter-deck, with my eye fixed on the colours of my country, resolv'd to go to the bottom with my own <hi>Pretty Betsey.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>In the mean time, a young French officer who had quitted his ship to come to our succour, seeing my resolution, threw
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032066_0034_0FF10D4BF1A34A68"/>
his pistols and cutlass into the sea, and, leaping on board my vessel, advanced towards me through fire and smoke, with a white handkerchief waving in his hand, beseeching me to save myself. I had scarcely time to notice the young devil, when, seizing me in his arms, he leaped with me into the sea, and, before we 'roſe to the water's surface again, my ship blew up and disappeared for ever. Here's a health to the young <hi>Sansculotte.</hi>

                     <p>With all my heart. <hi>(Drinks.)</hi> Truly, captain, that was a hotter <hi>action</hi> than ever I was engaged in; though I have made many a defendant sweat.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>Hotter, but not more destructive, old boy. Those who are born to be hung are in no danger of drowning. Myself and the Frenchman pop'd up again among the damnedest dashing and splashing of water that ever I saw, occasioned by the ship's explosion. However, we both swam like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Carey's chickens, and were soon safe on board the French frigate, who brought us to-day into your harbour, and I am come in the same trim in which I fought my ship, to lay my complaints before you. You see I did'n't fight in my fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weather suit.</p>

                     <p>No, dam'me, he's a man. But to go on with my story. As good luck would have it, I brought off with me my pocket-book well lined; and learning that my deliverer was a mere volunteer, and of no fortune, I wanted to share with him: but no, he will not take a guinea. From the time of our meeting we have never parted. We love one another entirely. He is the best lad that ever step'd between the

                     <p>As I said, this Frenchman and myself were inseparable. Yesterday he proposed a game at piquet; I accepted—and now I come to my cause of complaint—I played with such success that I won five-and-twenty louis.</p>

                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TOM.</speaker>
                     <p>We play'd, cash on the table. Well, Sir, in rising from the game, we perceived a card under the table. I insisted, that, in consequence, the game was false, and he had not lost. He maintained the contrary, and would not receive the money again. We grow warm. I threw the money out at the cabin windows, and he the cards. I could have fought him, but that he sav'd my life: so there's no way to attack him but by law; and damn me but I'll throw away ten thousand guineas but he shall take the five-and-twenty.</p>
