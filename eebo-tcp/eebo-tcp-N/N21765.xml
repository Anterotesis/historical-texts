            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE reason why a book of this kind although so much want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did not sooner appear, may be—because they who have been versed in science and literature, have not had practice and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the arts; and they who have had practice and experimental knowledge, have not had time to acquire science and theory, those necessary qualifications for compleating the system, and which are not to be found in any one man. Sensible of my deficiences in both, I should not have undertaken it, was I not interested in the explanation of my own inventions. I have applied to such books and men of science as I expected assistance from, in forming a system of theory; and to practical mill-wrights and millers for the practice; but finding no authors who had joined practice and experience with theory, (except Smeaton whom I have quoted) finding many of their theories to be erroneous, and losing the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the late ingenious William Waring, the only scientific character of my acquaintance, who acknowledged that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigated the principles and powers of water acting on mill-wheels, I did not meet the aid I expected in that part.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is not safe to conclude that this work is without error—but that it contains many, both theoritical, practical, and grammatical; is the most natural, safe, and rational supposition. The reader whose mind is free and unbiassed by the opinion of others, will be most likely to attain the truth. Under a momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary discouragement, finding I had far exceeded the prescribed limits, and doubtful what might be its fate, I left out several ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive draughts, of mills, &amp;c.—But since it went to press the prospects have become so encouraging that I may hope it will be well received: Therefore I request the reader, who may prove any part to be erroneous, can point out its defects, propose amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or additions; to inform me thereof by letter; that I may be enabled to correct, enrich, and enlarge it, in case it bears ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lition, and I will gratefully receive their communications: For if what is kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

practitioners in America could be collected in one work, it would be precious indeed, and a sufficient guide to save thousands of pounds from being uselessly expended. For a work of this kind will never be perfected by the abilities and labours of one man.</p>
            <p>The practical part received from Thomas Ellicott will doubtless be useful, considering his long experience and known genius</p>
            <p>Comparing this work with other original, difficult works, with equally expensive plates, the price will be found to be low.</p>

                              <p>In the course of this work, I shall shew, that a quadruple impulse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces only double velocity: See art. 7 and 46. We should follow philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers only in the paths of truth; because, if all men are subject to err<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even the most eminent philosophers may have erred.</p>
                              <p>If a theory will not agree with practice, we may suspect it is not true; and the theory of the momentum or force of bodies in motion, being as their velocities simply, does not agree with practice, with respect to the effects they produce, either in circular motion, art. 30, falling bodies, art. 9, spouting fluids, art. 45, wind on mill-sails, art. 69, therefore we have reason to suspect that this theory may not be true, in every respect.</p>
                           </note>; therefore a quadruple resistance is requisite to destroy double velocity in a body, by axiom 3d.</p>

                     <p>Elasticity is that strength or power, which any body or quantity of matter, being confined or compressed, has to expand itself; such as a spring that is bent or wound up, heated air or steam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in a vessel, &amp;c. and by it many mechanical operations are performed.</p>
                     <p>Elasticity, in the full sense of the word, here means every species of repulsion.</p>
                     <p>The limits of the prodigious power of repulsion, which takes place between the particles of heated air and steam, are not yet known. Their effects are seen in the explosion of gunpowder, the burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cracking of wood in the fire, &amp;c. In short, in every instance, where steam could not find room to expand itself, it has burst the vessel that confined it, endangering the lives of those who were near it.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <p>A worthy and ingeuius young man, having prepared a vessel of wrought iron, about 3 inches diameter, and 9 inches long, partly filled with water, had put it into a smith's fire, and was trying some experiments, when the aperture. by which the steam was meant to issue, got stopped by some means (as is supposed) and the vessel burst with noise like a cannon, carried off his right arm, and left it laying across one of the upper beams of the shop, and otherwise desperately wounded him. This prodigious power is applied to raise water out of coal-mines, &amp;c. from great depths, in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising quantities, and to turn mills; it may (in my opinion) be applied to many other useful purposes, which it is not yet applied to.</p>

                           <p>This doctrine of the momentum of bodies in motion, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of motion, being as their velocities simply, was taught by Sir Isaac Newton, and has been received by his followers to this day; which appears to be true, where the whole force is instantaneously spent or communicated; therefore I have changed the term to instant momentum. I have tried the experiment, by causing different weights to strike each other with different velocities, both on the principle of pendulums, and by causing them to move in horizontal circles; and, in both cases, 4lbs. with velocity 1, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced 2lbs. with velocity 2; their momentums each were 4: so that the theory appears to be proved to be true. Yet I think we have reason to doubt its being true in any other sense; because it does not agree with prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. All the bodies we put in motion, to produce effects, produce them in proportion to the squares of their velocities, or nearly, as will appear in the course of this work: But I fear I shall draw on me the ridicule of some, if I should doubt a theory long established; but I think we should follow others only in the paths of truth. Doubtless Sir Isaac meant the force to be instantly spent: and I have understood that the Dutch and Italian philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have held and taught, these 100 years past, that the momentum of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in motion, is as the squares of their velocities; and I must confess it appears to be really the case, with respect to the effects they produce; which is generally as their quantity or weight multiplied into the squares of their velocities. I found it impossible to reconcile the theory of the force of bodies in motion, being as their simple velocities, to the laws of circular motion, art. 13, where a double velocity produces a quadruple central force; of falling bodies, art. 9, where the velocity is as the square root of the impulse or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance fallen, and the effects as the squares of the velocities; of projectiles, where a double velocity produces a quadruple random, art. 12; of bodies descending on inclined plains, art. 10, where the velocities are as the square roots of the perpendicular descents, and the effects as the squares of their velocities; of spouting fluids, art. 45, where their velocities are as the square roots of their perpendicular heights or pressures, and their effects as the squares of their velocities, with equal quantities; of wind on mill-falls, art. 69, where the effects are as the cube of the velocity of the wind; because here the quantity is as the velocity, and the effect of equal quantities being as the squares of the velocity, amounts the effects to be as the cubes.</p>
                           <p>But when I discovered that a quadruple impulse was requisite to give double velocity, both in falling bodies and spouting fluids, and, by axiom 3, the power that produced a motion in a body, and the power that destroyed said motion, were equal, I concluded that the effects produced by bodies in motion, were as the squares of their velocities; and then I found the whole theory to agree with practice. Hereafter I shall say, that the effective mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, or force of bodies in motion, is as the squares of their velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>

5. If a perfect elastic body be let fall 4 feet,<note place="margin">Art. 8.</note> to strike a perfect elastic plain,<note place="margin">A double velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city produces a quadruple effect.</note> by the laws of falling bodies, art. 9, it will strike the plain with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of 16, 2 feet per second, and rise, by its re-action, to the same height from whence it fell, in half a second: If it falls 16 feet, it will strike with a velocity of 32, 4 feet, and rise 16 feet in one second. Now, if we call the rising of the body the effect, we shall find that a double velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, in this case, produces a quadruple effect in double time. Hence it appears, that a body moving through a resisting medium, with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble velocity, will continue in motion a double time, and go 4 times the distance; which will be a quadruple effect.<note n="*" place="bottom">We should pay no regard to time, in calculating the effective force of bodies in motion. Because, if 1lb of matter move with 1 degree of velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, it will produce a certain effect (before it ceases moving) in an unknown time. Every other pound of matter, moving with equal velocity, will produce an equal effect in equal time. But if each pound of matter move with double velocity, it will produce 4 times the effect, but requires a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time; which difference in time no way affects the sum total of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the matter put in motion to move any practical machine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should totally leave time out of this calculation, seeing it tends to lead us into errors.</note>

IF A and B, fig. 3,<note place="margin">Fig. 3.</note> fig. 3, be two columns of matter in motion, meeting each other, and equal in non-elasticity, quantity, and velocity, they will meet at the dotted line e e, destroy each other's motion, and remain at rest, provided none of their parts separate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if A is elastic, and B non-elastic, they will meet at ee, but B will give way by battering up, and both will move a little further; that is, half the distance that B shortens.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But if B is a column of fluid, and, when it strikes A, flies off in a lateral perpendicular direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then whatever is the sum total of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentums of these particles laterally, has not been communicated to A; therefore A will continue to move, after the stroke, with that said momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But with what proportion of the striking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity the fluid, after the stroke, will move in the lateral direction, I do not find determined; but, from small experiments I have made (not fully to be relied on) I suppose it to be more than one half; because water falling 4 feet, and striking a horizontal plain, with 16,2 feet velocity, will cast some few drops to the distance of 9 feet (say 10 feet, allowing one foot to be lost by friction, &amp;c.) which we must suppose take their direction at an angle of 45 degrees; because it is shewn, in Martin's philosophy, page 135, Vol. I, that a body projected at an angle of 45 degrees, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the greatest possible horizontal randum; also, that a body falling 4 feet, and reflected with its acquired velocity 16,2 feet, at 45 degrees,

will reach 16 feet horizontal randum,<note place="margin">Art. 8.</note> or 4 times the distance of the fall. Therefore, by this, 1-4 of 10 feet, equal to 2,5 feet, is the fall that will produce the velocity that produced it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city 12,64 feet per second, about 3-4 of the strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing velocity.</p>

<note place="margin">6-10ths of power lost by non-elasticity.</note> as proved in art. 67; by experiment, and demonstrated by art. 46; then the ratio of the force of this side velocity, 12,64 feet per second, is to the force of forward velocity, as 160 to 256, more than half (about, 6) of the whole force is here lost by non-elasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This side force cannot be applied to produce any further forward force, after it has struck the first obstacle; because its action and re-action ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance each other afterwards: which I demonstrate by fig. 27.</p>
                     <p>Let A be an obstacle, against which the column of water G A, of quantity 16 and velocity per second 16, strikes; as it strikes A, suppose it to change its direction, at right angles, with 3-4 ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity, and strike B B; then change again, and strike forward against C C, and backwards against D D; then again in the side direction E E; and again in the forward and backward directions all of which counteract each other, and balance exactly.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, if we suppose the obstacle A to be the float of an undershot water-wheel, the water can be of no further service, in propelling it, after the first impulse, but rather a disadvantage; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the elasticity of the float will cause it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in a certain degree, and not keep fully up with the float it struck, but re-act back against the float following; therefore it will be better to let it escape freely as soon as it has fully made the stroke, but not sooner, as it will require a certain

                        <p>Therefore, the instant resistance is as the squares of their velocities, and will soon amount to the whole force of gravity, and reduce the motion to be uniform. This is the reason why hail and rain falls with such mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate force; whereas if it was not for the resistance of the air, they would prove fatal to those they fall upon. Compare this with the effect of wind on mill-sails, proved by experiment, to be as the cubes of the velocity, Art. 69, and with the effects of spouting fluids, proved to be as the cubes of their velocities, with equal apertures.

                        <p>Again, consider that the solid content of bodies decreases, as the cubes of their diameters, while their surfaces decrease only as the squares of their diameters; Consequently the smaller the body, the greater the resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in proportion to its weight: and this is the reason why heavy bodies, reduced to dust, will float in the air; as, likewise, feathers, and many other bodies of great surface and little matter. This seems to show, that air is, perhaps, as heavy as any other matter whatever, of an equal degree of fineness or smallness of particles.</p>
                        <p>These are the laws of falling bodies supposing them to fall in vacuo, or in an unresisting medium; and without considering that gravity increases, as the square of the distance from the center of gravity of the attracting power decreases (4. law of gravity, art. 2;) because any small distance, such as comes in our practice, will make no sensible difference. But as they fall in the air, which is a medium of great resistance, the instant resistance is as the opposing surfaces of the falling body, and as the squares of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities, their motion will greatly differ from these laws, in falling great distances, or with light bodies; but in small distances, such as 30 feet or less, and heavy bodies, the difference will be imperceptable in common practice.</p>

                  <p>By the impulse,<note place="margin">Of projectiles.</note> or projectile force, the body will pass over equal distances, A B, B C, &amp;c. in equal times, by 1st general law of motion, art. 7, and, by gravity, it descends through the spaces A G, G H, &amp;c. which are as the squares of the times, by 3d law of falling bodies, art. 9. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by these forces compounded, the body will describe the curve A Q, called a parabola; and

this will be the case in all directions,<note place="margin">Art. 12.</note> except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular; but the curve will vary with the elevation, yet it will still be what is called a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabola.</p>
                  <p>If the body is projected at an angle of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees elevation, it will be thrown to the greater horizontal distance possible; and, if projected with double velocity, it will describe a quadruple ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                        <p>I may here observe that the whole planetary system is governed by these laws of circular motion and central forces. Gravity acting as the string, and is the centripetal force; and as the power of gravity decreases, as the square of the distance increases, by the 4th law of gravity, art 2; and as the centripetal and centrifugal forces must always be equal, in order to keep the body in a circle. Hence apears the reason why the planets most remote from the sun have their motion so slow, while those near him have their motions swift; because their celerities must be such as to create a centrifugal force equal to the attraction of gravity.</p>
                        <p>I may here observe, that modern philosophers begin to doubt the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of inertia, as defined by Newton, to be different and independent from gravity, but seem to conclude that they are both one thing; but when we consider that the whole force of gravity is exerted as centripetal force, to keep the heavenly bodies in a circle. It cannot be that same power, cause or principle, that causes the bodies to continue their motion, unless one cause can produce two effects each equal to itself, contrary to axiom 4. Again we may consider, that gravity decreases, as the squares of the distance of the body from the attracting power increases, but inertia is the same every where; and if we suppose the body to be removed out of the sphere of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of gravity,<note place="margin">Attempt to prove the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertia.</note> there will be no gravity at all, yet inertia will act in its full power, to continue the motion or rest of a body, by axiom 1 and 2.

                     <p>A Lever is a bar of iron, wood, &amp;c. one part of which is supported by a prop, and all other parts turn or move on that prop, as their centre of motion; and its length, on each side of the prop, is called its arms: the velocity or motion of every part of these arms, is directly as its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from its centre of motion, by 3d law of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion.</p>
                     <p>The Lever—Observe the following laws:</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The power is to the weight, as the distance the weight moves is to the distance the power moves, respectively.<note n="†" place="bottom">That is, the power multiplied into its distance moved, is equal to the weight multiplied into its distance moved.</note>

                        <p>Let A B C, fig. 8,<note place="margin">Fig. 8.</note> represent a lever; then, to compute its power, divide the distance of the power P from its centre of motion B C 12, by the distance of the weight W, A B 1; and the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is 12: the power is increased 12 times by the engine; which, multiply by the power applied 1, produces 12, the power of the engine at A, or the weight W, that will balance P, and hold the engine in equilibrio. But suppose the arm A B to be continued to E, then, to find the power of the engine, divide the distance B C 12, by B E 6; and the quotient is two; which multiplied by 1, the power applied, produces 2, the power of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or weight w to balance P.</p>

Or divide the velocity of the power P equal 6,<note place="margin">Art. 17,</note> by the velocity of the weight w equal 3; and the quotient 2, multiplied by the power 1, produces 2, the power of the engine at E.

Suppose a mallet of 10lb. strike with 5 velocity, its effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive momentum 250; but if it strike with 10 ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity, then its effective momentum is 1000. The effects produced by the strokes will be as 250 to 1000; and all the force of each stroke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what may be destroyed by the friction of the wedge, is added in the wedge, until the sum of these forces amount to more than the resistance of the body to be split, therefore it must give way; but when the wedge does not move the whole force is destroyed by the friction. Therefore the less the inclination of the sides of the wedge, the greater resistance we can overcome by it, because it will be easier moved by the stroke.</p>

This proves that the ratio of the friction to the weight decreases, as the weight increases: the reason of which decrease of proportion I take to be as follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Great part of the friction arises from the cohesion of the parts, even the grease put on to destroy the cohesion,<note place="margin">The ratio decreases as the weight and velocity increases.</note> has a cohesion of its own; and this cohesion of parts or of the grease, will not increase with the weight or velocity.—Again, if we allow the friction to be occasioned by the weight of the body having to be raised over the prominent parts of the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing surface, it is evident, that when it is raised by being started, that it has not to be raised again; therefore the greater the velocity, the less proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will this resistance (occasioned by the raising of the body) bear to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity.</p>

Upon these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I compute the friction of the gudgeons of a well hung water-wheel, as follows: <abbr>viz.</abbr> As the diameter of the wheel is to the diameter of the gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, so is 1-20 part of the weight of the wheel, to the weight that will ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the friction.</p>
                              <p>EXAMPLE.</p>
                              <p>Suppose a wheel 15 feet diameter, with gudgeons 3 inches diameter, and weighing 4000lb. by supposition; then,<note place="margin">Not more than 1-1000 part in great machines and great weights.</note> say as 15 feet is to 3 inches, so is 4000|20 to 3,3lb. the weight on the periphery of the wheel that will ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the friction of 4000lb.: which is less than 1-1000 part of the weight. But note that for the same reasons, that friction does not increase with the velocity in direct proportion, neither will it decrease in direct proportion with the velocity of the rubbing surface of the gudgeon: hence we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude again that the friction is more than 1-1000 part. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the friction of the gudgeons, well set on good stones or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>WHEEL-CARRIAGES,<note place="margin">Rollers appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reduce friction.</note> pullies, and such wheels as have large axles in proportion to their diameters, have much friction. There has been a late discovery, in England, of applying the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the roller to them; which may be so done as almost totally to destroy the friction.</p>
                     <p>The easiest method possible, of moving heavy bodies horizontally, is the roller.</p>
                     <p>Let A B, fig. 15,<note place="margin">Fig. 15.</note> represent a body of 100 tons weight (with the underside perfectly smooth and even) set on two rollers, perfectly hard, smooth, and round, rolling on the horizontal plain C D,<note place="margin">No friction in rollers.</note> perfectly hard, smooth, and even; it is evident that this body is supported by two lines perfectly perpendicular, and, if globes were used instead of rollers, the least force would move it in any horizontal direction; even a spider's web would be sufficient, giving it time to overcome the visinertia of the body: But as perfect hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, smoothness, &amp;c. are not attainable, a little friction will still remain.</p>
                     <p>This principle is, or may be, applied to wheel-carriages, in the following manner:</p>
                     <p>Let the outside ring B C D, fig. 16,<note place="margin">Fig.16.</note> represent the box of a carriage-wheel, the inside circle A the axle, the circles a a a a a a the rollers round the axle between it and the box, and the inner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ring a thin plate for the pivots of the rollers to run in, to keep them at a proper distance from each other. When the wheel turns the rollers pass round on the axle, and on the inside of the box, and we may say without friction, because there is no rubbing of the parts past one another.<note n="*" place="bottom">To explain this, let us suppose the rollers aaaaaa to have cogs, and the shaft A, and box to have cogs also, the rollers gearing into the shaft and into the inside of the box.

4-9 of the power that would hold it in equilibrio,<note place="margin">Art. 34.</note> and then its velocity will be just 1-3 of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est velocity of the moving power.</p>
                     <p>To explain this, they suppose the water-wheel, fig.17,<note place="margin">Fig. 17.</note> to be of the undershot kind, 16 feet dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, turned by water issuing from under a 4 feet head, with a gate 1. foot wide, 1 foot high drawn; then the force will be 250lbs. because that is the weight of the column of water above the gate, and its velocity will be 16,2 feet per second, as shall be shewn under the head of Hydraulics; then the wheel will be moved by a power of 250lbs. and if let run empty, will move with a velocity of 16 feet per second; but if we hang the weight W to the axle (of 2 feet diameter) with a rope, and continue to add to it until it stops the wheel, and holds it in equilibrio, the weight will be found to be 2000lbs. by the rule, art. 19; and then the effect of the machine is nothing, because the velocity is nothing: But as we decrease the weight W, the wheel begins to move, and its velocity increases accordingly; and then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the weight multiplied into its velocity, will increase until the weight is decreased to 4-9 of 2000=888,7, which, multiplied into its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance moved or velocity, will produce the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est effect, and the velocity of the wheel will then be 1-3 of 16 feet, or 5,33 feet per second. So say those who have treated of it.</p>
                     <p>This will appear plainer to a young learner,<note place="margin">Theory of maximums explained by application of an elevator.

                     <p>When the load, at equilibrio, is 2000, then the maximum load is 888,7=4/9; of 2000, when the effect is at its greatest, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 591,98, as appears in the 6th column, and then the velocity of the wheel is 5,333 feet per second, equal to 1-3 of 16, the velocity of the water, as appears in the 5th line of the scale: but as there is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent error in the first principle of this theory,<note place="margin">Old theory doubted.</note> by counting the instant force of the water on the wheel to be as the square of its striking velocity, therefore it cannot be true. See art. 41.</p>
                     <p>I then calculate upon this principle, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That the instant force of striking fluids is as their velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city simply, then the load that the machine will carry, with its different velocities, will be as the velocity simply, as appears in the 7th column, and the load, at a maximum, is 1000lb=½ of 2000, the load at equilibrio, when the velocity of the wheel is 8 feet=½ of 16 the velocity of the water per second; and then the effect is at its greatest, as shewn in the 8th column, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 1000, as appears in the 4th line of the scale.</p>
                     <p>This I call the new theory,<note place="margin">New theory.</note> (because I found that William Waring had also, about the same time, established it, see art. 38) <abbr>viz.</abbr> That when
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028644_0060_0FDA2A1FB89AD458"/>
any machine is charged with just 1-2 of the load that will hold it in equilibrio,<note place="margin">Art. 35.</note> its velocity will be just 1-2 of the natural velocity of the moving power, and then its effect will be at a maximum, or greatest possible.</p>
                     <p>This appears to be the way by which this great error has been so long overlooked by philosophers, and which has rendered the theory of no use in practice, but led many into expensive errors, thereby bringing great discredit upon philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>

                     <p>BUT although I know that the velocity of the wheel, by this new theory is much nearer prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice than the old, (tho' rather slow) yet I am led to doubt the theory, for the following reasons, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I consider that there are 16 cubic feet of water, equal 1000lbs. expended in a second, which multiplied by its perpendicular descent, 4 feet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the power 4000. The ratio of the power and effect by the old theory is as 10 to 1,47, and by the new as 4 to 1; as appears in the 9th co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of the scale; which is a proof that the old theory is a great error, and sufficient cause of doubt that there is yet some error in the new. And as the subject is of the greatest consequence in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical mechanics. Therefore I proceed, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to discover a true theory, and will shew my work in order, that if I establish a theory it may be the easier understood, if right; or detected, if wrong.</p>

                        <p>In the search, I constructed Fig 18,pl. II. which represents a simple wheel with a rope passing over it and the weight P, of 100 lbs. at one end to act by its gravity, as a power to produce effects, by hoisting the weight w at the other end.</p>
                        <p>This seems to be on the principles of the lever, and overshot wheel; but with this exception, that the quantity of descending matter, acting as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will still be the same, although the velocity will be accelerated, whereas in overshot wheels, the power on the wheel is inversely, as the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the wheel.</p>

By this scale it appears,<note place="margin">Art. 37.</note> that when the power P falls freely without any load, it descends 40 feet in five equal parts of time, but when charged with 3,5lbs.=1/2 P, which was 7lbs. it then took up 10 of those parts of time to descend the same distance; which seems to shew, that the charge occupies its proportional part of the whole velocity, which was wanted to be known, and the maximum ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as in the last scale.<note n="*" place="bottom">Since writing the above, I have seen Atwood's Treatise on Motion, wherein he gives a set of accurate experiments, to prove (beyond doubt) that the conclusion I have drawn is right, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That the charge occupies its proportional part of the whole velocity.

                     <p>IT appears, that we have applied wrong prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in our search after a true theory of the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imum velocity and load of undershot water-wheels, or other engines moved by a constant power, that does not increase or decrease in quantity on the engine, as on an overshot water-wheel, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity varies.</p>
                     <p>Let us suppose water to issue from under a head of 16 feet, on an undershot water-wheel; then, if the wheel moves freely with the water, its velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city will be 32, 4 feet per second; but will bear no load.</p>
                     <p>Again, suppose we load it, so as to reduce its motion to be equal the velocity of water spouting from under 15 feet; it appears evident that the load will then be just equal to that 1 foot of the head, the velocity of which is checked; and this load multiplied into the velocity of the wheel, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 31, 34×1=31,34 for the effect.</p>
                     <p>This appears to be the true principle, from which we must seek the maximum velocity and load, for such engines as are moved by one constant power; and on this principle I have calculated the following scale.</p>

In this scale,<note place="margin">Art. 41.</note> let us suppose the aperture of the gate to be a square foot; then the greatest load that will balance the head, will be 16 cubic feet of water, and the different loads will be shewn in cubic feet of water.</p>
                     <p>And then it appears, by this scale, that when the wheel is loaded with 10,66 cubic feet of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, just 2-3 of the greatest load, its velocity will be 18,71 feet per second, just ,577 parts of the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the water, and the effect produced is at a maximum, or the greatest possible, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 199,44.</p>
                     <p>To make this more plain,<note place="margin">Fig. 19.</note> let us suppose A B, plate II, fig. 19, to be a fall of water 16 feet, which we wish to apply to produce the greatest effect possible, by hoisting water on its side oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the power applied; first, on the undershot principle, where the water acts by its impulse on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now let us suppose the water to strike the wheel at I, then, if we let the wheel move free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any load, it will move with the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the water, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 32,4 feet per second, but will produce no effect, if the water issue at C; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be 32,4 cubic feet of water expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under 16 feet perpendicular descent. Let the weight of a cubic foot of water be represented by unity or 1, for ease in counting; then 32,4×16 will shew the power expended, per second, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 518,4; and the water it hoists multiplied into its perpendicular ascent, or height hoisted, will shew the effect. Then, in order to obtain effect from the power, we load the wheel; the simplest way of doing which, is, to cause the tube of water C D to act on the back of the bucket at I; then, if CD be equal to AB, the wheel will be held in equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio; this is the greatest load, and the whole of the fall AB is balanced, and no part left to give the wheel velocity; therefore the effect=0. But if we make C D=12 feet of A B, then from 4 to A=4 feet, is left unbalanced, to give velocity to the wheel, which is now loaded with 12 feet, and

water any distance,<note place="margin">Art. 41.</note> effect=o. Therefore the maximum is somewhere between C and D. Then suppose we open gates of 1 foot area, at different heights, the velocity will shew the quantity of cubic feet raised; which multiplied by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular height of the gate from C, or height raised, gives the effect as before, and the maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum as before. But here we must consider, that in both these cases, the water acts as a perfect definite quantity, which will produce effects equal to elastic bodies, or equal to its gravity (see art.59) which is impracticable in practice: Whereas when it acts by percussion only, it communicates only half of its original force, on account of its non-elasticity, the other half being spent in splashing about (see art. 8); therefore the true effect will be 33/100,(a little more than 1-3) of the moving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; because nearly 1-3 is lost to obtain velocity, and half of the remaining 2-3 is lost by non-elasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. These are the reasons, why the effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by an undershot wheel is only half of that produced by an overshot wheel, the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar descent and quantity of water being equal. And this agrees with Smeaton's experiments (see art.68); but if we suppose the velocity of the wheel to be 1-3 that of the water-10,8, and the load to be 4-9 of 16, the greatest load at equilibrio; which is-7, 111, as by old theory, then the effect will be 10,8×4-9 of 16-76,79 for the effect, which is quite too little, the moving power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 32,4 cubic feet of water, multiplied by 16 feet descent-518,4, the effect by this theory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing less than , 15/100 of the power, about half equal to the effect by experiment, which effect is set on the outside of the dotted circle in the fig.(19.) The dotted lines join the corner of the parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, formed by the lines that represent the loads and velocities, in each experiment or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, the areas of which truly represent the effect, and the dotted line A a d x, meeting the

                     <p>BEFORE I dismiss the subject of maximums, I think it best to consider, whether this doctrine will apply to the motion of the overshot wheels. It seems to be the general opinion of those, who consider the matter, that it will not; but, that the slower the wheel moves, provided it be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious enough to hold all the water, without losing any until it be delivered at the bottom of the wheel, the greater will be the effect, which appears to be the case in theory (see art. 36); but how far this theory will hold good in practice, is to be considered. Having met with the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous James Smeaton's experiments, where he shews, that, when the circumference of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wheel, of 24 inches diameter, (head 6 inches) moved with about 3,1 feet per second (although the greatest effect was diminished about 1/20 of the whole) he obtained the best effect, with a steady, regular motion. Hence he concludes about 3 feet to be the best velocity for the circumference of overshot mills. See art. 68. I undertook to compare this theory of his, with the best mills

Hence appears the reason why some wheels cast their water, which is always the case, when the head is not sufficient to give it velocity enough to enter the buckets. But this depends also much on the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the buckets, and direction of the shute into them. It, however, appears evident that the head of water above the wheel, should be nicely adjusted, to suit the velocity of the wheel. Here we may consider, that the head above the wheel acts by percussion, or on the same principles with the undershot wheel, and, as we have shewn (art. 41) that the undershot wheel should move with nearly 2-3 of the velocity of the water, it appears, that we should allow a head over the wheel, that will give such velocity to the water, as will be to that of the wheel as 3 to 2. Thus the whole descent of the water of a mill-seat should be nicely divided,<note place="margin">The whole descent must be nicely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween head and fall.</note> between head and fall, to suit each other, in order to obtain the best effect, and a steady-moving mill. First find the velocity that the wheel will move with, by the weight of the water, for any diameter you may suppose you will take for the wheel, and divide said velocity into two parts; then try if your head is such, as will cause the water to come on with a velocity of 3 such parts, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due allowances for the friction of the water, according to the aperture. See art. 55. Then, if the buckets and direction of the shute be right, the wheel will receive the water well, and move to the best advantage, keeping a steady, regular motion when at work, loaded or charged with a resistance equal to 2-3 of its power, (art. 41. 42.)</p>

                     <p>THIS doctrine of maximums is very interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is to be met with in many occurrences through life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It has been shewn, that there is a maximum load and velocity for all engines, to suit the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and velocity of the moving power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is also a maximum size, velocity and feed for mill-stones, to suit the power; and velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for rolling-screens, and bolting-reels, by which the greatest work can be done in the best manner, in a given time.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A maximum degree of perfection and close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with which grain is to be manufactured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to flour, so as to yield the greatest profit by the mill in a day or week, and this maximum is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually changing with the prices in the market, so that what would be the greatest profit at one time, will sink money at another. See art. 113.</p>

                     <p>SPOUTING Fluids observe the following laws:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Their velocities and powers, under equal pressures, or equal perpendicular heights, and equal apertures, are equal in all cases.<note n="*" place="bottom">It makes no difference whether the water stands perpendicular above the aperture, or incliningly (see plate III, fig. 22.) providing the perpendicular height be the same; or whether the quantity be great or small, providing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their velocities under different pressures or perpendicular heights, are as the square roots of those pressures or heights; and their perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

heights or pressures,<note place="margin">Art. 45.</note> are as the squares of their velocities.<note n="*" place="bottom">This law is similar to the 4th law of falling bodies,<note place="margin">Foundation of the rule for finding the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under any head.</note> their velocities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the square root of their spaces passed through; and by experiment it is known, that water will spout from under a 4 feet head 16,2 feet per se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and from under a 16 feet head, 32,4 feet per second, which is only double to that of a 4 feet head, although there be a quadruple pressure. Therefore by this law we can find the velocity of water spouting from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any given head; for as the square root of 4 equal 2 is to 16,2 its veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so is the square root of 16 equal 4, to 32,4 its velocity. And again, as 16,2 squared, is to 4 its head, so is 32,4 squared, to 16 its head; by which ratio we can find the head that will produce any velocity.</note>

                     <p n="3">3. Their quantities expended through equal apertures, in equal times, under equal pressures, are as their velocities simply.<note n="†" place="bottom">It is evident that a double velocity will vent a double quantity.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Their pressures or heights being the same, their effects are as their quantities expended.<note n="‡" place="bottom">If the pressure be equal, the velocity must be equal; and it is evident, that double quantity with equal velocity will produce a double effect.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p>Let us suppose two large wheels, one of 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. Again, suppose we open a gate of 1 square foot at A 16 under 16 feet head, it will strike the large wheel at k, with velocity 32, its instant force or pressure being 16 cubic feet of water, it will require 16 cubic feet resistance, from the head C 16, to stop or balance it. In this case the

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028644_0093_0FDA1FEACA6F0D10"/>

                     <p n="3">3. Again, suppose the head C 16 to be raised to E, 16 feet above 4, and a gate drawn ¼ of a square foot, then the instant pressure on the float I of the small wheel, will be 4 cubic feet, pressing on ¼ of a square foot, and will exactly balance 4 cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic feet, pressing on 1 square foot, from the head A 16; and the wheel will be in equilibrio, (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the water cannot escape until the wheel moves as before) although the one has power of velocity 32, and the other only 16 feet per se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Their loads at equilibrio are equal, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their loads at a maximum velocity and charge, will be equal, but their velocities differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                     <p>Then, to try their effects, suppose, first, the wheel to move by the 4 feet head, its maximum velocity to be half the velocity of the water, which is 16, and its maximum load to be half its greatest load, which is 4, by Waring's theory; then the velocity 16|2 × by the load 4|2=16, the effect of the 4 feet head, with 16 cubic feet expended; because the velocity of the water is 16, and the gate 1 foot.</p>
                     <p>Again, suppose it to move by the 16 feet head and gate of ¼ of a foot; then the velocity 32|2X by the load 4|2=32, the effect, with but 8 cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic feet expended, because the velocity of the water is 32, and the gate but ¼ of a foot.</p>
                     <p>In this case the instant forces are equal, each being 4; but the one moving a body only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

A double velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, with equal instant pressure, produces a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect, which seems to be according to the Newtonian theory. And in this sense the

                     <p>But when we consider, that in the above case, it was the quantity of matter put in motion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> water expended, that produced the effect, we find that the quantity 16, with velocity 16, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced effect 16; while qu. 8, with velocity 32 produced effect 32. Here the effects are as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> quantities, multiplied into the squares of their velocities; and this I call the effective momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums.</p>
                     <p>Again, if the quantity expended under each head, had been equal, their effects would have been 16 and 64, which is as the squares of their velocities, 16 and 32.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Again, suppose both wheels to be on one shaft, and let a gate of ½ of a square foot be drawn at 16 C, to strike the wheel at k, the head being 16 feet, the instant pressure on the gate will be 2 cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic feet of water, which is half of the 4 feet head with 1 foot gate, from A 4 striking at I; but the 16 feet head, with instant pressure 2, acting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the great wheel, will balance 4 feet on the small one, because the lever is of double length, and the wheels will be in equilibrio. Then, by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring's theory, the greatest load of the 16 feet head being 2, its load at a maximum will be 4 and the velocity of the water being 32, the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imum velocity of the wheel will be 16. Now the velocity 16×1=16, the effect of the 16 feet head, and gate of 1/8 of a foot. The greatest load of the 4 feet head being 4, its maximum load <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the velocity of the water 16, and the velocity of the wheel 8, now 8×2=16, the effect. Here the effects are equal: and here again the effects are as the instant pressures, multiplied into their simple velocities; and the resistances that would instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stop them, must be equal thereto, in the same ratio.</p>

But when we consider,<note place="margin">Art. 47.</note> that in this case, the 4 feet head expended 16 cubic feet of water, with velocity 16, and produced effect 16; while the 16 feet head expended only 4 cubic feet of water, with velocity 32, and produced effect 16, we find, that the effects are as their quantities, multiplied into the squares of their velocities.</p>
                     <p>And when we consider, that the gate of ⅓ of a square foot, with velocity 32, produced effects equal to the gate of 1 square foot, with velocity 16, it is evident, that if we make the gates equal, the effects will be as 8 to 1; that is, the effects of spouting fluids, with equal apertures, are as the cubes of their velocities; because, their instant forces are as the squares of their velocities by 6th law.</p>

Then fill the vessel with water by the tube H, and it will press upwards against the leather, and raise it in a convex form, requiring just as much weight to press it down, as will be equal to the weight of water in the tube H. Or if we set a glass tube over the hole at o, and pour water therein, we will find that the water in the tube o, must be of the same height of that in tube H, before the leather will subside, even if the tube O be much larger than H; which shews, that the pressure upwards is equal to the pressure downwards; because, the water pressed up against the leather with the whole weight of the water in the tube H. Again, If we fill the vessel by the tube I, it will rise to the same height in H that it is in I; the pressure being the same in every part of the vessel as if it had been filled by H; and the pressure on the bottom of the vessel will be the same, whether the tube H be of the whole size of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, or only one quarter of an inch diameter. For suppose H to be 1-4 of an inch diameter, and the whole top of the vessel of leather as at o, and we pour water down H, it will press the leather up with such force, that it will require a column of water of the whole size of the vessel, and height of H, to cause the leather to subside.

                        <p>Given, the head 16 feet, gate 4 feet wide, 25 of a foot drawn, required the effect on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershot wheel, per second. The measure of the effect to be the quantity, multiplied into its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance moved, (velocity) or into its perpendicular ascent.</p>
                        <p>Then, by theorem I. (art. 50) 4X,25=1 square foot, the area of the gate ×16=16 the cubic feet pressing; but, for the sake of round numbers, we call each cubic foot 1, and although 32,4 cubic feet strike the wheel per second, yet, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of non-elasticity, only 16 cubic feet is the load at equilibrio, and ⅔ of 16 is 10,666, the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imum load.</p>
                        <p>Then, by theorem II. the velocity is 32, 4,,577 of which is=18,71, the maximum velocity of the wheel X 10,66, the load=199,4, the effect.</p>
                        <p>This agrees with Smeaton's observations, where he says, (art. 67) "It is somewhat remarkable, that though the velocity of the wheel, in relation to the velocity of the water, turn out to be more than 1/3, yet the impulse of the water, in case of the maximum, is more than double of what is assigned by theory; that is, instead of 4/8; of the column, it is nearly equal to the whole column." Hence I conclude, that non-elasticity does not operate so much against this application, as to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028644_0100_0FDA2BD42BCEC860"/>
reduce the load to be less than ⅔. And when we consider, that 32,4 cubic feet of water, or a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn 32,4 feet long, strike the wheel while it moves only 18,71 feet, the velocity of the wheel being to the velocity of the water as 577 to 1000. May not this be the reason why the load is just 2/3 of the head, which brings the effect to be just ,38 (a little more than 1/3 of the power.) This I admit, because it agrees with experiment, altho' it be difficult to assign the true reason thereof. See annotation, art. 42.</p>
                        <p>Therefore ,577 the velocity of the water=18,71, multiplied by 2/3 of 16, the whole column, or instantaneous pressure, pressing on the wheel—art. 50—which is 10,66, produces 199,4, the effect. This appears to be the true effect, and if so the true theorem will be as follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

Now it is evident from the principles of hydrostatics, shewn by the paradox (art. 48, and the 1st law of spouting fluids art. 45.) that the impulse and pressure will be equal from each penstock respectively. Although the one be an inclined plain, and the other a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular their forces are equal, because their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular heights are; (art. 48) therefore the wheel will remain at rest, because each side of the float is pressed on by a column of water of equal size and height, as represented by the lines on each side of the float. Then suppose we shut the penstock F G, and let the water down the circular one rx, which is close to the point
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028644_0104_0FDA2AA9AF4B8B40"/>
of the buckets; this makes it obvious, from the same principles, that the wheel will be held in equilibrio, if the columns of each side be equal. For, although the column in the circular pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock is longer than the perpendicular one, yet, because part of its weight presses on the lower side of the penstock, its pressure on the float is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>WATER, by its pressure, and the pressure of the atmosphere,<note place="margin">Fig. 20.</note> may be conveyed under val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and over hills, to supply a family, a mill, or a town.<note place="margin">To convey water under valleys and over hills.</note> See fig. 20. pl. III. F H is a canal for conveying water to a mill-wheel. Now let us suppose F G 16 H to be a tight tube or trunk—the water being let in at F, it will descend from F to G, and its pressure at F will cause it to rise to H, passing along if permitted, and may be conveyed over a hill by a tube, acting on the principle of the syphon. (art. 56) But where some have had occasion thus to convey water under any obstacle for the convenience of a mill, which often occurs in practice they have gone into the following expensive error: They make the tube at G 16 smaller than if it had been on a level, because, say they, a greater quantity will pass through a tube, pressed by the head G F, than on a level. But they should consider that the head G F is balanced by the head H 16, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity through the tube G 16 will only be such that a head equal to the difference between the perpendicular height of G F and H 16 would give it; (see art. 41, fig. 19) therefore it should be as large at G 16 as if on a level.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. By a perfectly definite quantity, we mean a quantity passing along a close tube so confined, that when it strikes the float it has not liberty to escape in any lateral direction.</p>

                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Definite quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity applied.</note> The float being struck by definite quantity, with liberty to escape freely in every side direction, it acts as the most perfect non-elas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic body; therefore (by art. 8) it communicates only a part of its force, the other part being spent in the lateral direction. Hence it appears, that in the application of water to act by impulse, we should draw the gate as near as possible to the float-board, and confine it as much as possible from escaping sideways as it strikes the float; but, taking care at the same time, that we do not bring the principle of the Hydrostatic Paradox into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (art 48).</p>
                     <p>What proportion of the force of the water is spent in a lateral direction is not yet determined, but see Art. 8.</p>

But if they will consider well the principles of gravity act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on falling bodies (art. 9) they will find, that, if the velocity of a falling body be ever so great, the action of gravity is still the same to cause it to move faster, so that, although an overshot wheel may move before the power of the gravity, of the water thereon, yet no impulse downwards can give a wheel such velocity, as that the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the water acting thereon can be lessened thereby.<note n="*" place="bottom">If gravity could be either decreased by velocity downwards, or increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by velocity upwards, then a virtical wheel without friction, either of gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons or air, would require a great force to continue its motion; because, its velocity would decrease the gravity of its descending side, and increase it on its ascending side, which would immediately stop it: whereas it is known, that it requires no power to continue its motion, but what is necessary to overcome the friction of the gudgeons, &amp;c.</note>

                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:028644_0114_0FDA2AD24BFD7D10"/>
Hence may appear the reason why breast-wheels generally run quicker than overshots, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fall after the water strikes be not so great.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is generally more head allowed to breast-mills than overshots, and the wheel will incline to move with nearly 2/3 the velocity of the water, spouting from under the head, (art. 41).</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the water was permitted to fall freely after it issues from the gate, it would be accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the fall, so that its velocity at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est point, would be equal to its velocity, had it spouted from under a head equal to its whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular descent. This accelerated velocity of the water, tends to accelerate the wheel; hence, to find the velocity of a breast-wheel, where the water is struck on in a tangent direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in fig. 31, 32, I deduce the following.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. That 87,5 cubochs of power per second will turn a 5 feet stone 104 revolutions in a minute, and grind 3,8 bushels an hour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That 4,69 cubochs of power is required to every superficial foot of a mill-stone, when their mean circles move with a velocity of 18,37 feet per second. Or,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That for every 36582 feet of the face of stones that pass each other we may expect 3,8lb. will be ground, when the stones, grain, &amp;c. are in the state and condition, as were the above stones in the experiments.</p>

Having now laid down in art.<note place="margin">Art. 63.</note> 61, 62, and 63, a theory for measuring the power of any mill-seat, and for ascertaining the quantity of that power that mill-stones of different diameters will require, by which we can find the diameter of the stones to suit the power of the seat: and, having fixed on six cubochs of that power per second to every superficial foot of the mill-stone, as requisite to move the mean circle of the stone 18 feet per second, when in the act of grinding with moderate and sufficient feed, and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the passing of 34804 feet per minute to grind 5lb. in the same time, which is the effect of the five feet stone in the table, by which, if right, we can calculate the quantity that a stone of any size will grind with any velocity.</p>
                        <p>I have chosen a velocity of 18 feet per second, for the mean circle of all stones, which is slower than common practice, but not too slow for making good flour. See art. 111. Here will appear the advantage of large stones over small ones; for if we will make small stones grind as fast as large ones, we must give them such velocity as to heat the meal.</p>

Much expence may be often-times saved, by making the canal deep where it cannot easily be got wide enough, and wide where it cannot easily be got deep enough. Thus, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we have determined it to be 4 feet deep and 6 feet wide, then the area of its section will be 24.—Let fig. 36, pl.

Then, if there be rocks at G, so that we cannot without great expence obtain more than 3 feet width, but 8 feet depth at a small expence: then 8×3=24, the section required.

One disadvantage however arises in having canals too shallow in places, because the water in very dry seasons, may be too low to rise over them; but if the water was always to be of one height, the disadvantage would be but little. The cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent will keep the deep places open; light sand or mud will not settle in them.

                           <p>First let the wheel be put in motion by the water, but without any weight in the scale; and let the number of turns in a minute be 60: now

it is evident,<note place="margin">Art. 67.</note> that was the wheel free from fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and resistance, that 60 times the circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the wheel would be the space through which the water would have passed in a minute; with that velocity wherewith it struck the wheel: But the wheel being incumbered with friction and resistance and yet moving 60 turns in a minute, it is plain that the velocity of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must have been greater than 60 circumferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before it met with the wheel. Let the cord now be wound round the cylinder but contrary to the usual way, and put as much weight in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Let the weight be increased so as to make 64½ turns in a minute without the water, then try it with the water and the weight as before, and suppose it now makes the same number of turns with the water, as without, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 64½, hence it is evident, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It is somewhat remarkable,<note place="margin">Art. 67.</note> that though the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the wheel in relation to the water turns out greater than 1-3 of the velocity of the water, yet the impulse of the water in case of the maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum is more than double of what is assigned by theory; that is, instead of 4/9 of the column it is nearly equal to the whole column.<note n="*" place="bottom">This observation of the author I think a strong confirmation of the truths of the theory established art. 41; where the maximum velocity is made to be, 577 parts of the velocity of the water, and the load to be 2-3 the greatest load: For if the gate had been drawn near the floats, the greatest load would probably have been 14lb. 1 oz. or as 3 to 2, of the maximum load.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>It must be remembered, therefore, that in the present case, the wheel was not placed in an open river where the natural current after it has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated its impulse to the float, has room on all sides to escape, as the theory supposes; but in a conduit or race, to which the float being adapted, the water cannot otherwise escape than by mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with the wheel. It is observable, that a wheel working in this manner as soon as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meets the float, it receiving a sudden check rises up against the float, like a wave against a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed object, insomuch, that when the sheet of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not a quarter of an inch thick, before it meets the float, yet this sheet will act upon the whole surface of a float, whose height is three inches; consequently, was the float no higher than the thickness of the sheet of water, as the theory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so supposes, a great part of the force would be lost by the water dashing over the float.</p>

What remains of the theory of undershot wheels, will naturally follow from a comparison of the different expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments together.</p>

                           <p>Now the heads being equal if the effects are proportioned to the water expended, we shall have by maxim I. as 161:355::328:723; but 723 falls short of 785, as it turns out in experiment, according to No. 25 by 62. The effect therefore of No. 25, compared with No. 8, is greater than according to the present maxim, in the ratio of 14 to 13.</p>
                           <p>The foregoing example with four similar ones are seen at one view in the following table.</p>
                           <note place="bottom">If the true maximum velocity of the wheel be, 577 of the velocity of the water, and the true maximum load be 2-3 of the whole column, as shewn in art.42; then the effect will be to the power in the ratio, of 100 to 38, or as 10 to 3,8, a little more than appears by this table of experiments, in column 9 and 10: the difference is owing to the disadvantageous application of the water on the wheel in the model.</note>

On comparing column 2 and 4, table I, it is evident, that the virtual head bears no certain proportion to the head of water, but that when the aperture is greater or the velocity of the water issuing therefrom less, they approach nearer to a coincidence: and consequently, in the large opening of mills and sluices, where great quantities of water are discharged from moderate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It will appear in the course of the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, that the effect of the gravity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending bodies, is very different from the effect of the stroke of such as are non-elastic, though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by an equal mechanical power.</p>

The alterations of the machinery already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,<note place="margin">Art. 68.</note> to accommodate the same for experiments on overshot wheels, were principally as follows.</p>
                     <p>Plate XII. The sluice I b being shut down, the rod H I was taken off. The undershot water wheel was taken off the axis, and instead thereof an overshot wheel of the same size and diameter was put in its place. Note, this wheel was 2 inches deep in the shroud or depth of the bucket, the number of buckets was 36.</p>
                     <p>A trunk for bringing the water upon the wheel was fixed according to the dotted lines fg, the aperture was adjusted by a shuttle, which also closed up the outer end of the trunk, when the water was to be stopped.</p>

                        <p>In these experiments the head being 6 inches, and the height of the wheel 24 inches, the whole descent will be 30 inches: the expence of water was 14½ strokes of the pump in a minute, where of 12 contained 80lb. therefore the water ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in a minute, was 96⅔lb. which multiplied by 30 inches, gives the power =2900.</p>
                        <p>If we take the 20th experiment for the maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, we shall have 20¾ turns a minute, each of which raised the weight 4½ inches, that is 93,37 inches, in a minute. The weight in the scale was 19lb. the weight of the scale 10½ oz. the counter-weight 3 oz. in the scale, which with the weight of the scale 10½ oz. makes in the whole 20½lb. which is the whole resistance or load, this multiplied by 93,37 makes 1914 for the effect.</p>
                        <p>The ratio therefore of the power and effect will be as 2900:1914, or as 10:6,6 or as 3 to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>But if we compute the power from the height of the wheel only, we have 96⅔lb.×24 inches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <p>We have already seen in the preceding observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that the effect of the same quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, descending through the same perpendicular space, is double, when acting by its gravity upon an overshot wheel, to what the same produces when acting by its impulse, upon an undershot. It also appears that by increasing the head from 3 to 11 inches, that is, the whole descent, from 27 to 35, or in the ratio of 7 to 9 nearly, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is advanced no more than in the ratio of 8,1 to 8,4; that is, as 7:7,26, and consequently the increase of the effect is not 1/7 of the increase of the perpendicular height. Hence it follows that the higher the wheel is in proportion to the whole descent, the greater will be the effect; because it depends less upon the impulse of the head, and

more upon the gravity of the water,<note place="margin">Art. 68.</note> in the buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets: and if we consider how obliquely the water issuing from the head must strike the buckets, we shall not be at a loss to account for the little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that arises from the impulse thereof; and shall immediately see of how little conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence his impulse is to the effect of an overshot wheel. However, as every thing has its limits, so has this: for thus much is desirable, that the water should have somewhat greater velocity, than the circumference of the wheel, in coming thereon: otherwise the wheel will not only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by the buckets striking the water, but thereby dashing a part of it over, so much of the power is lost.</p>
                           <p>The velocity that the circumference of the wheel ought to have being known, the head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to give the water its proper velocity is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily found, by the common rules of Hydrostatics and will be found much less than what is comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> spent in producing the effect, and the remainder only giving motion to the falling body: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the slower a body descends, the greater will be the portion of the action of gravity applicable to the producing a mechanical effect. Hence we
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028644_0161_0FDA2B6708BC2138"/>
are led to this general rule,<note place="margin">Art. 68.</note> that the less the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the wheel, the greater will be the effect thereof. A confirmation of this doctrine, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the limits it is subject to in practice, may be deduced from the foregoing specimen of a set of experiments.</p>
                           <p>From these experiments it appears, that when the wheel made about 20 turns in a minute, the effect was near upon the greatest; when it made 30 turns, the effect was diminished about 1/20; part; but, that when it made 40, it was diminished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ¼ when it made less than 18¼, its motion was irregular; and when it was loaded so as not to admit its making 18 turns, the wheel was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by its load.</p>
                           <p>It is an advantage in practice, that the velocity of the wheel should not be diminished farther than what will procure some solid advantage in point of power; because, as the motion is slower, the buckets must be made larger; and the wheel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more loaded with water, the stress upon every part of the work will be increased in proportion: the best velocity for practice therefore will be such, as when the wheel here used made about 30 turns in a minute; that is, when the velocity of the circumference is a little more than 3 feet in a second.</p>
                           <p>Experience confirms, that this velocity of 3 feet in a second, is applicable to the highest overshot wheels as well as the lowest; and all other parts of the work being properly adapted thereto, will produce very nearly the greatest effect possible. However, this also is certain, from experience, that high wheels may deviate further from this rule, before they will loose their power, by a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven aliquot part of the whole, than low ones can be admitted to do: for a wheel of 24 feet high may move at the rate of 6 feet per second without loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

any considerable part of its power: and,<note place="margin">Art. 68.</note> on the other hand, I have seen a wheel of 33 feet high that has moved very steadily and well, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity but little exceeding 2 feet.<note n="*" place="bottom">Probably this wheel was working forge of furnace bellows, which have deceived many by their slow regular motion.</note>

                     <p>IN trying experiments on wind-mill sails, the wind itself is too uncertain to answer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: we must therefore have recourse to artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial wind.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>From the foregoing table the following maxims deduced.</p>
                        <p>MAXIM I. The velocity of wind-mill sails, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unloaded or loaded, so as to produce a maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, is nearly as the velocity of the wind, their shape and position being the same.</p>
                        <p>This appears by comparing the respective num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of columns 4 and 5, table V, wherein those numbers 2,4 and 6, ought to be double of No. 1,3 and 5, and are as nearly so as can be expected by the experiments.</p>
                        <p>MAXIM II. The load at the maximum is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but somewhat less than as the square of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the wind, the shape and position of the sails being the same.</p>
                        <p>This appears by comparing No. 2,4 and 6, in column 6, with 1, 3 and 5, wherein the former ought to be quadruple of the latter (as the veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is double) and are as nearly so as can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>MAXIM III. The effects of the same sails at a maximum are nearly, but somewhat less than, as the cubes of the velocity of the wind.<note n="*" place="bottom">This confirms the 7th law of spouting fluids.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It has been shewn maxim I, that the velocity of sails at a maximum, is nearly as the velocity of the wind; and by maxim II, that the load at the maximum is nearly as the square of the same ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity. If those two maxims would hold precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would be a consequence that the effect would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

MAXIM IV. The load of the same sails at the maximum is nearly as the squares of,<note place="margin">Art. 69.</note> and their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as the cubes, of their number of turns in a given time.</p>
                        <p>This maxim may be esteemed a consequence of the three preceding ones.</p>
                        <p>[These 4 maxims agree with and confirm the 4 maxims concerning the effects of spouting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>WHAT has been said in the first part, was meant to establish theories and easy rules—In this part I mean to bring them into practice, in as concise a manner as possible, referring only to the articles in the first part, where the reasons and demonstrations are given.</p>
                  <p>This part is particularly intended for the help of Young and Practical Millwrights, whose time will not permit them fully to investigate the principles of theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which requires a longer series of studies than most of them can possibly spare from their business; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall endeavour here to reduce the substance of all that has been said, to a few tables, rules, and short directions, which, if found to agree with practice, will be sufficient for the practitioner.</p>
                  <p>There are but two principles by which water acts on mill-wheels, to give them motion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Percussion and Gravity.</p>
                  <p>That equal quantities of water, under equal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular descents, will produce double the power by
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:028644_0170_0FDA2B87C289F2B8"/>
gravity that it will by percussion, has been shewn in articles 8 and 68.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, when the water is scarce, we ought to endeavour to cause it to act by gravity, as much as possible, paying due regard to other circumstances noted in article 44, so as to obtain a steady motion, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>UNDERSHOT wheels move by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion or stroke of the water, and are only half as powerful as other wheels that are moved by the gravity of the water. See art. 8. Therefore this construction ought not to be used, except where there is but little fall or great plenty of water. The undershot wheel, and all others that move by percussion, should move with a velocity nearly equal to two thirds of the velocity of the water. See art. 42. Fig. 28. plate iv. represents this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                     <p>For a rule for finding the velocity of the water, under any given head, see art. 51.</p>
                     <p>Upon which principles,<note place="margin">Principles on which is founded the undershot table.</note> and by said rule, is formed the following table of the velocity of spouting water, under different heads, from one to twenty-five feet high above the centre of the issue; to which is added the velocity of

the wheel suitable thereto,<note place="margin">Principles on which is founded the undershot table.</note> and the number of revolutions a wheel of fifteen feet diameter (which I take to be a good size) will revolve in a minute; also, the number of cogs and rounds in the wheels, both for double and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle gears, so as to produce about ninety-seven or one hundred revolutions for a five feet stone per minute, which I take to be a good mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>That the reader may fully understand how the following table is calculated, let him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by art. 42, the velocity of the wheel must be just 577 thousandth parts of the velocity of the water; therefore, if the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the water, per second, be multiplied by, 577 the product will be the maximum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the wheel, or velocity that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the greatest effect, which is the third co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn in the table.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The velocity of the wheel per second, multiplied by 60, produces the distance the circumference moves per minute, which, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by 47,1 feet, the circumference of a 15 feet wheel, quotes the number of revolutions of the wheel per minute, which is the fourth column.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That by art. 20 and 74, the number of revolutions of the wheel per minute, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the number of cogs in all the driving wheels, successively, and that product divided by the product of the number of cogs in all the leading wheels, multiplied successively, the quotient is the revolutions of the stones per minute, which is the ninth and twelfth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns.</p>

4. The cubochs of power required to drive the stone,<note place="margin">Principles on which is founded the undershot table.</note> being, by art. 61, equal to 111,78 cubochs per second, which, divided by half the head of water, added to all the fall (if any,) being the virtual or effective head by art. 61 quotes the quantity of water, in cubic feet, required per second, which is the thirteenth column.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The quantity required, divided by the velocity with which it is to issue, quotes the area of the aperture of the gate—fourteenth column.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The quantity required, divided by the velocity of the water proper for it to move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the canal, quotes the area of a section of the canal—fifteenth column.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Having obtained their areas, it is easy, by art. 65, to determine the width and depth, as may suit other circumstances.</p>

Note, that five feet fall is the least that a single gear can be built on,<note place="margin">CHAP.1.</note> to keep the cog-wheel clear of the water, and give the stone sufficient motion.</p>
                     <p>Although double gear is calculated to fifteen feet fall, yet I do not recommend them above ten feet, unless for some particular conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, such as two pair of stones to one wheel, &amp;c. &amp;c. The number of cogs in the wheels are even, and chosen to suit eight, fix, or four arms, so as not to pass through any of them, this being the common practice. But when the motion cannot be obtained without a trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that will cause the same cogs and rounds to meet too often, such as 16 into 96, which will meet every revolution of the cog-wheel, or 18 into 96, which will meet every third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution—I advise rather to put in one more or less, as may best suit the motion, which will cause them to change oftener. See art. 82.</p>
                     <p>Note, that the friction at the aperture of the gate will greatly diminish both the veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power of the water in this application, where the head is great, if the gate be made of the usual form, wide and shallow. Where the head is great, the friction will be great. See art. 55. Therefore the wheel must be narrow, and the aperture of the gate of a square form, to evade the friction and loss that may be under a wide wheel, if it does not run close to the sheeting.</p>

                        <p>HAVING levelled your mill-seat carefully, and finding such fall and quantity of water as determines you to make choice of an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot wheel; for instance, suppose 6 feet fall, and about 45 cubic feet of water per second, which you find as directed in art. 53; cast of about 1 foot for fall in the tale-race, below the bottom of the wheel, if subject to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, leaves you 5 feet head; look for 5 feet head in the first column of the table, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it are all the calculations for a 15 feet water-wheel and 5 feet stones; in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth column you have 44,7 cubic feet of water; which shews you have enough for a 5 feet pair of stones; and the velocity of the water will be 18 feet per second, the velocity of the wheel 10,38 feet per second, and it will revolve 13,22 times per minute. And if you choose double gear, then 66 cogs in the master cog-wheel, 24 rounds in the wallower, 48 cogs in the counter cog-wheel, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> revolutions in a minute; if single gear, 112 cogs and 15 rounds give 98,66 revolutions in a minute; it will require 44,7 cubic feet of water per second; the size of the gate must be 2,48 feet, which will be about 4 feet wide and, 62 feet deep, about 7 1-4 inches deep; the size of the canal must be 29,8 feet; that is, about 3 feet deep, and 9,93 or nearly 10 feet wide. If you choose single gear, you may make your water-wheel much less, say
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028644_0177_0FDA2B99ADA14640"/>
7 1-2 feet, the half of 15 feet, then the cog-wheel must have half the number of cogs, the trundle-head the same, the spindle will be longer, husk lower, and the mill full as good; but, in this case, it will not do, because a cog-wheel of 66 cogs would reach the water; but where the head is 10 or 12 feet, it will do very well.</p>
                        <p>If you choose stones, or water-wheels, of other sizes, it will be easy, by the rules by which the table is calculated, to proportion the whole to suit, seeing you have the veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the periphery of a wheel of any size.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>One advantage large wheels has over small ones is, they cast off the back-water much better. The buckets of the low wheel will lift the water much more than those of the high wheel; because, the nearer the water rises to the centre of the wheel, the nearer the buckets approach the horizontal or lifting position.</p>
                              <p>Fig. 28 is an undershot wheel. Some prefer to slant the forebay under the wheel, as in the figure, that the gate may be drawn near the floats; because (say they) the water acts with more power near the gate, than at a distance; which appears to be the case, when we consider, that the nearer we approach the gate, the nearer the column of water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to be what is called a perfect definite quantity. See art. 59.</p>
                              <p>Others again say, that it acquires equal power in descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the shute (it will certainly acquire equal velocity, abating only for the friction of the shute and air). When the shute has a considerable descent, the greater the distance from the gate, the greater the velocity and power of the water; but where the descent of the shute is not sufficient to overcome the friction of the air, &amp;c. then the nearer the gate,<note place="margin">Best to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the water down a long shute to the wheel, in high heads.</note> the greater the velocity and power of the water; which argues in favour of drawing the gate near the floats. Yet, where the fall is great, or water plenty, and the expence of a deep penstock considerable, the small difference of power is not worth the expence of obtaining. In these cases, it is best to have a shallow penstock, and a long shute to convey the water down to the wheel, drawing the gate at the top of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A TUB MILL has a horizontal water-wheel,<note place="margin">Tub Mills described.</note> that is acted on by the percussion of the water altogether; the shaft is verticle, carrying the stone on the top of it, and serves in place of a spindle; the lower end of this shaft is set in a step fixed in a bridge-tree, by which the stone is raised and lowered, as by the bridge-tree of other mills; the water is shot on the upper side of the wheel, in a tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent direction with its circumference. See fig. 29, plate IV, which is a top view of the tub-wheel, and fig. 30 is a side view of it, with the stone on the top of the shaft, bridge-tree, &amp;c. The wheel runs in a hoop, like a mill-stone hoop, projecting so far above the wheel as to prevent the water from shooting over the wheel, and whirls it about until it strikes the buckets, because the water is shot on in a deep narrow column, 9 inches wide and 18 inches deep, to drive a 5 feet stone, with 8 feet head—so that all this column can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter the buckets until part has passed half way round the wheel, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

may strike them at right angles.<note place="margin">CHAP.1.</note> See fig. 30. As soon as it strikes it escapes under the wheel in every direction, as in fig. 29.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>Note, that in fig. 30, I have allowed the gate to be drawn inside of the penstock, and not in the shute near the wheel, as is the common practice; because the water will leak out much along side of the gate, if drawn in the shute. But here we must consider, that the gate must always be full drawn, and the quantity of water regulated by a regulate in the shute near the wheel; so that the shute will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly full, and pressed with the whole weight of the head, else a great part of the power may be lost.</p>
                           <p>To shew this more plain, suppose the long shute A, from the high head (shewn by dotted lines) of the undershot mill, fig. 28, be made tight by being covered at top, then, if we draw the gate A, but not fully, if the shute at bottom be large enough to vent all the water that issues through the gate, when the shute is full to A, then it cannot fill higher than A; therefore, all that part of the head above A is lost, it being of no other service than to supply the shute, and keep it full to A, and the head from A to the wheel is all that acts on the wheel.</p>
                           <p>Again, when we shut the gate, the shute cannot run emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because it would leave a vacuum in the head of the shute at A; therefore the pressure of the atmosphere resists the water from running out of the shute, and whatever head of water is in the shute, when the gate is shut, will balance its weight of the pressure of the atmosphere, and prevent it from acting on the lower side of the gate, which will cause it to be very hard to draw—For, suppose 11 feet head of water to be in the shute when the gate was shut, its pressure is equal to about 5lb. per square inch; then, if the gate be 48 by 6 inches, which is equal to 288 inches, this multiplies by 5, is equal to 1440 lb. the additional pressure on the gate.</p>

                           <p>Again, if the gate be full drawn, and the shute be not much larger at the upper than lower end, all these evils <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> take place to cause the loss of power. To remedy all this, put the gate H at the bottom of the shute to regulate the quantity of water by, and make a valve at A to shut on the inside of the shute, like the valve of a pair of bellows, which will shut when the gate A is drawn, and open when the gate shuts, to let air into the shute; this plan will do better tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The reader will with difficulty understand what is here said, unless he be acquainted with the theory of the pressure of the atmosphere, vacuums, &amp;c. See these subjects, touched on in art. 56.</p>

The disadvantages of these wheels are,<note place="margin">CHAP.1.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The water does not act to advantage on them, we being obliged to make them so small to obtain velocity to the stone (in most cases) that the buckets take up a third part of their diameter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The water acts with less power than on undershot wheels,<note place="margin">Tub mills act with less power than undershots.</note> as it is less confined at the time of striking the wheel, and its non elastic principle takes place more fully. See art. 8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is with difficulty we can put a sufficient quantity of water to act on them to drive them with sufficient power, if the head be low; therefore I advise to strike the water on in two places, as in fig. 29; then the apertures need only be about 6 by 13 inches each, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of 9 by 18, and will act to more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and then, in this case, nearly all the buckets will be acted on at once.</p>
                     <p>Their advantages are,</p>
                     <p>Their exceeding simplicity and cheapness,<note place="margin">They are preferable to others, with plenty of water.</note> having no cogs nor rounds to be kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; their wearing parts are few, and have but little friction; the step-gudgeon runs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, therefore, if well fixed, will not get out of order in a long time; and they will move with sufficient velocity and power with 9 or 10 feet total fall, and plenty of water; and, if they be well fixed, they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

much more water than undershot wheels; therefore they are vastly preferable in all seats with plenty of water, and above 8 feet fall.</p>
                     <p>In order that the reader may fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how the following table is calculated, let him consider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That as the tub-wheel moves altogether by percussion,<note place="margin">Should move 2-3 the velocity of the water</note> the water flying clear of the wheel the instant it strikes, and it being better, by art. 70, for such wheels to move faster in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of slower than the maximum velocity; therefore, instead of ,577 we will allow them to move ,66 velocity of the water;<note place="margin">Rules To find the velocity of the water.</note> then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying the velocity of the water by ,66 gives the velocity of the wheel, at the centre of the buckets; which is the 3d column in the table.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And the velocity of the wheel per second,<note place="margin">Its diameter</note> multiplied by 60, and divided by the number of revolutions the stone is to make in a minute, gives the circumference of the wheel at the centre of the buckets; which circumference, multiplied by 7, and divided by 22, gives the diameter from the centre of the buckets, to produce the number of revolutions required; which are the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th columns.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The cubochs of power required,<note place="margin">The quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of water required.</note> by art. 63, to drive the stone, divided by half the head, gives the cubic feet of water required to produce said power; which are the 8th and 10th columns.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The cubic feet of water,<note place="margin">The size of the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> divided by the velocity, will give the sum of the apertures of the gates; which are the 9th and 11th co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns.</p>

the motion of an overshot wheel,<note place="margin">CHAP. I.</note> whose dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter is equal to the fall below the point of impact, and their power will be equal.</p>
                     <p>This structure of a wheel,<note place="margin">Fig. 31,</note> fig. 31, I take to be a good one, for the following reasons, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The buckets,<note place="margin">Wheel of new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</note> or floats, receive the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion of the water at right angles, which is the best direction possible.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It prevents the water from flying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the centre of the wheel, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting against the bottom of the buckets, and retains it in the wheel, to act by its gravity in its descent, after the stroke.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It admits air, and discharges the water freely, without lifting it at bottom; and this is an important advantage, because, if the buckets of a wheel be tight, and the wheel wades a little in back-water, they will lift the water a considerable distance as they empty; the pressure of the atmosphere prevents the water from leaving the buckets freely, and it requires a great force to lift them out of the water with the velocity of wheel; which may be proved by dipping a common water-bucket into water, and lifting it out, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom up, with a quick motion, you have to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ft not only the water in the bucket, but it appears to suck a deal more up after it; which is the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere, see art. 56. This shews the necessity of air-holes to let air into the buckets, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may have liberty to get out freely.</p>
                     <p>Its disadvantages are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It loses the water much, if it is not kept close to the sheeting. And,</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="20" facs="unknown:028644_0188_0FDA2BC47842C178"/>
2. It requires too great a part of the total fall to be used as head, which is a loss of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, one foot fall being equal in power to two feet head, by art. 8.</p>

                     <p>On these principles, to suit the application of water, as represented by fig. 32, I have calculated the following table for breast mill.

                     <p n="1">1. That all the water above the point of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,<note place="margin">Principles on which the breast mill table is founded.</note> called head, acts wholly by percussion and all below said point, called fall, acts wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

2. That half the head, added to the whole fall,<note place="margin">CHAP. I.</note> constitutes the virtual or effective descent, by art. 61; which is the 4th column.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That if the water was permitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend freely down the circular sheeting,<note place="margin">Rules</note> after it passes the point of impact,<note place="margin">To find the velocity of a breast wheel</note> its velocity would be accelerated, by art. 60, to be, at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est point, equal to the velocity of water spout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from under a head equal to the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent: therefore the maximum velocity of this wheel will be a compound of the velocity to suit the head and the acceleration after it passes the point of impact. Therefore, to find the velocity of this wheel, I first multiply the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the head, in column 5, by ,577 (as for the undershot mills) which gives the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city suitable to the head; I then (by the rule for determining the velocity of overshots) say, as the velocity of water descending 21 feet, equal to 37,11 feet per second, is to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the wheel 10 feet per second, so is the acceleration of velocity, after it passes the point of impact, to the accelerated velocity of the wheel; and these two velocities added, gives the velocity of the wheel; which is the 6th column.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The velocity of the wheel per second,<note place="margin">Its number of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> multiplied by 60, and divided by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the wheel, gives the revolutions per minute: 7th column.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. The cubic feet,<note place="margin">Area of the canal.</note> divided by the velocity of water allowed in the canal, suppose 1,5 feet per second, gives the area of the canal; column 12.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If the mill is to be double geared, take the revolutions of the wheel from column 7 of this table, and look in column 4 of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot table, art. 70, for the number of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions nearest to it, and against that number you have the gears that will give a 5 feet stone the right motion.</p>

                        <p>HAVING a seat with above 6 feet fall but not enough for an overshot mill, and the water being scarce, so that you wish to make the best use of it, leads you to the choice of a breast mill.</p>
                        <p>Cast off about 1 foot for fall in the tale-race below the bottom of the wheel, if much subject to back-water; and suppose you have then 9 feet total descent; look for it in the first column of the table, and against it you have it divided into 5,9 feet head above, and 3,1 feet fall below the point of impact, which is the highest point that the water can be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly struck on the wheel, leaving the head 3 feet deep above the shute; which is equal to 6,05 feet virtual or effective descent: the velocity of the water striking the wheel 18,99 feet, velocity of the wheel 12,07 feet, per second, will revolve 16 times in a minute; and, if single geared, 104 cogs, and 16 rounds, gives the stone 99,4 revolutions in a minute, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires 21,29 cubic feet of water per second; the area of a section of the canal must be 14,19 feet, about 3 feet deep, and 5 feet wide. If the stones be of any other size, it is easy to proportion the gears to give them any number of revolutions required.</p>
                        <p>If you wish to proportion the size of the stones to the power of your seat, multiply the cubic feet of water your stream affords per se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the virtual descent in column 4, and that product is the power in cubochs; then
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028644_0193_0FDA2BD858F290F0"/>
look in the table, in art. 63, for the size of the stone that nearest suits that power.</p>
                        <p>For instance, suppose your stream affords 14 cubic feet of water per second, then 14 multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by 6,05 feet virtual descent, produces 84,7 cubochs of power; which, in the table in art. 63, comes nearest to 4,5 feet for the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the stones; but, by the rules laid down in art. 63, the size may be found more exactly.</p>
                        <p>Note, 6 cubochs of power are required to every superficial foot of the stones.</p>

                     <p>The head above the wheel acts by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion,<note place="margin">Proper ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the water spouting on the wheel.</note> as on an undershot wheel, and we have shewn, art. 43, that the head should be such as to give the water velocity 3 for 2 of the wheel. After the water strikes the wheel it acts by gravity; therefore, to calculate the power, we must take half the head and add it to the fall, for the virtual descent, as in breast mills.</p>
                     <p>The velocity of overshot wheels are as the square roots of their diameters. See art. 43.</p>
                     <p>On these principles, I have calculated the following table for overshot wheels; and, in order that the reader may understand it fully, let him consider well the following premises:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the velocity of the water spouting on the wheel must be one and a half the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the wheel,<note place="margin">Rule for proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head to the wheel</note> by art. 43; then, to find the head that will give said velocity, say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the square of 16,2 feet per second, is to 4 feet, the head that gives that velocity, so is the square of the velocity required, to the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that will give that velocity—But, to this head so found, we must add a little by conjecture to overcome the friction of the aperture. See art. 55.</p>
                     <p>In this table, I have added to the heads o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> wheels from 9 to 12 feet diameter, 1 of a foot and from 12 to 20 I have added, 1 tenth more for every foot increase of diameter, and from 20 to 30 feet I have added ,05 more to every foot diameter's increase; which gives a 30 feet wheel 1,5 feet additional head, while a 9 feet
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028644_0195_0FDA2BE6F74C8E20"/>
wheel has only, 1 tenth of a foot, to overcome the friction. The reason of this great difference will appear when we consider that the friction increases as the aperture decreases, and as the velocity increases—But this much depends on the form of the gate, for if that be nearly square, there will be but little friction, but if very oblong, say 24 inches by half an inch, then it will be very great.</p>

IT appears,<note place="margin">Single gear does not suit overshot wheels, high or low.</note> that single gear does not much suit this construction; because, where the water-wheels are low, their motion is so flow that the cog-wheels (if made large enough to give sufficient motion to the stone, without having the trundle too small, see art. 23) will touch the water: And again, when the water-wheels are high, above 20 feet, the cog-wheels require to be so high, in order to give motion to the stone without having the trundle too small, that they become unwieldy, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>sk too high, spindle short, &amp;c. so as to be inconvenient. Therefore, single gear seems to suit overshots only where the diameter of the water-wheel is between 12 and 18 feet; and even with them, the water-wheel will have to run rather too fast, or the trundle be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ther too small, and the stones should be 6 feet diameter at least.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I have, in the preceding tables, allowed the water to pass along the canal with 1,5 feet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">3. Although I have calculated this table for the velocities of the wheels to vary as the square roots of their diameters, which makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

yet they will do to have equal velocity, and head, which is the common practice among mill-wrights. But, for the reasons I have mentioned in art. 43, I prefer giving them the velocity and head assigned in the table, in order to obtain steady motion.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Many have been deceived, by observing the exceeding slow and steady motion of some very high overshot wheels working forge or furnace bellows, concluding therefrom, that they will work equally steady with a very slow as with any quicker motion, not considering perhaps, that it is the principle of the bellows that regulates the motion of the wheel, which is different from any other resistance, for it soon becomes perfectly equable: therefore the motion will be uniform, which is not the case with any kind of mills.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Many are of opinion, that water is not well applied by an overshot wheel; because, say they, those buckets near above or below the centre, act on too short a lever. In en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to correct this error, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the fall of the overshot wheel, fig. 33. plate IV, into feet, by dotted lines. Now, by art. 53 and 54, every cubic foot of water on the wheel produces an equal quantity of power in descending each foot perpendicular, called a cuboch of power; because, where the lever is shortest, there is the greatest quantity of water within the foot perpendicular; or, in other words, each cubic foot of water is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> much longer time, and passes a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in descending a foot perpendicular, than where it is longest; which exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensates
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028644_0201_0FDA2BFA871DA7C0"/>
for the deficiency in the length of lever. And, considering that the upper and lower parts of the wheel does not run away from the gravity of the water, so much as the breast of the wheel, we must conclude, that the upper and lower feet of perpendicular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent (in theory) actually produce more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the middle two feet—But (in practice) the lower foot is entirely lost, by the spilling of the water out of the buckets. See this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, art 54.</p>

                        <head>Of Mills moved by Re-action.</head>
                        <p>WE have now treated of the four different kinds of mills that are in general use. There are others, the invention or improvements of the late ingenious James Rumsey, which move by the re-action of the water. One of these is said to do well where there is much back-water; it being small, and of a true circular form, the back-water does not resist it much. I shall say but little of these, supposing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors mean to treat of them; but may say, that there appears to me but two principles by which water can be applied to move mill-wheels, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Percussion and Gravity.</p>
                        <p>For the different effects of equal quantities of water, with equal perpendicular descents, applied by these different principles, fee art.8 and 68.</p>

                           <pb n="34" facs="unknown:028644_0202_0FDA2BFA8B21E638"/>
Water may be applied, by percussion two ways, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by action (which is when it strikes the floats of a wheel) and by re-action, which is when it issues from within the wheel, and, by its re-action, moves it round; and these two are equal, by 3d general law of motion, art. 7.</p>
                        <p>For the effects of centrifugal force, and the inertia of the water, on this application of re-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, see axioms I and II, art. 1; and art. 13. The principle of inertia will operate in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the quantity of water used; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this application will suit high heads better than low ones.</p>
                        <p>Water may be applied, by gravity, two ways, <abbr>viz.</abbr> either by spouting it high on the wheel, into tight buckets, as on common over-shots, or by causing the whole head of water to press on the floats, at the lower side of the wheel, which is so constructed that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot escape, but as the wheel moves, and at the same time keeping clear of the paradoxical principle mentioned in arts.48 and 59; which cannot be done, unless the floats are made to move on pivots, so as to fold in on one side of the wheel, and open out, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the weight of the water, on the other. And these two applications are equal in theory, as will appear plain by art. 54, fig. 20; yet they may differ greatly in practice.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the year 1786, I invented and made a model of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He has also applied this wheel to water-mills, which I did not intend to do. This may properly be called the Valve Wheel.</note>

                     <p>MATHEMATICIANS have laid down the following proportions for finding the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of a circle by its diameter, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter by the circumference given,<note place="margin">Rules</note>

The last proportion makes the diameter a little the largest; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it suits mill-wrights best for finding the pitch circle; because the sum of the distance, from centre to centre, of all the cogs in a wheel, makes the circle too short, especially where the number of cogs are few, because the distance is taken in strait lines, instead of the circle. In a wheel of 6 cogs only, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle will be so much too short, as to give the diameter 2/22 parts of the pitch or distance of the cogs too short. Hence we deduce the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

                     <p>THE principle of Spur Gears,<note place="margin">Principles of Spur Gears.</note> is that of two cylinders rolling on each other, with their shafts or axis truly parallel to each other.—Here the touching parts move with equal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity, therefore have but little friction. And to prevent these cylinders from slipping, we are obliged to indent them, or to set in cogs.—And here it appears to me,<note place="margin">The pitch of the driver should be the largest.</note> that the pitch of the driving wheel should be a little larger than the leading wheel, for the following reasons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If there is to be any slipping, it will be much easier for the driver to slip a little past the leader, than for the cogs to have to force the leader a little before the driver; which would be very hard on them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the cogs should bend any by the stress of the work (as they surely do; because 1lb. falling on a beam a foot square, will jar it,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028644_0218_0FDA2C2D9C74F538"/>
which cannot be done without bending it a little) this will cause those that are coming into gear to touch too soon,<note place="margin">Art. 79.</note> and rub hard at entering.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is much better for cogs to rub hard as they are going out of gear, than as they are coming in; because then they work with the grain of the wood; whereas at entering they work against it, and would wear much faster.</p>
                     <p>The advantage of this kind of gear is,<note place="margin">Their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note> we can make the cogs as wide as we please, so that their bearing may be so large that they will not cut each other, but only polish and wear smooth; therefore they will last a long time.</p>

2d. Their great friction and rubbing of parts.<note place="margin">Art. 80.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The cogs for small wheels are generally round, and put in with round shanks. Great care should be taken in boring the holes for the cogs, with a machine to direct the auger strait, that the distance of the cogs may be equal, without dressing. And all the holes of all the small wheels in a mill should be bored with one auger, and made of one pitch; then the miller may keep by him a quantity of cogs ready turned, to a gauge to suit the auger, and when any fail, he can drive out the old ones, and put in a new set, without much loss of time.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 40, plate V, represents a face cog-wheel working into a trundle; shewing the necessity of having the corners of the sides of the cogs sniped off in a cycloidical form, to give liberty for the rounds to enter between the cogs, and pass out again freely. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the sides of the cogs of the right shape to meet the rounds when they get fairly into gear,<note place="margin">Directions for forming the cogs.</note>as at c, there must be a circle described on the ends of the cogs, a little outside of the pitch circle, for the point of the compasses to be set in, to scribe the ends of the cogs; for if the point be set in the pitch circle, it will leave the inner corners too full, and make the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ones too scant. The middle of the cog is to be left strait from bottom to top, or nearly so, and the side nearly flat at the distance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the corners only being sniped off to make the ends of the shape in the figure;<note place="margin">Art. 80.</note> because when the cog comes into gear fully, as at c, there is the chief stress, and there the bearing should be as large as possible. The smaller the cog-wheel, the larger the trundle, and the wider the cogs, the more will the corners require to be sniped off. Suppose the cog-wheel to turn from 40 to b, the cog 40, as it enters, will bear on the lower corner, unless it be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently sniped off; when it comes to c, it will be fully in gear, and if the pitch of the cog-wheel be a little larger than that of the trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, the cog a will bear as it goes out, and let c fairly enter before it begins to bear.</p>
                     <p>Suppose the plumb line A B to hang directly to the centre of the cog-wheel, the spindle is (by many mill-wrights) set a little before the line or centre, that the working round or stave of the trundle may be fair with said line, and meet the cog fairly as it comes to bear; it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so causes the cogs to enter with less, and go out with more friction. Whether there be any real advantage in thus setting the spindle foot before the centre plumb line, does not seem determined.</p>

                  <p>The best form that I have seen for large gudgeons for heavy wheels, is made of cast iron. Fig. 6, plate XI, is a perspective view of one; a a a a, are four wings at right angles with each other, extending from side to side of the shaft. These wings are larger, every way, at the end that is farthest in the shaft, than at the outer end, for convenience in cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and also that the bands may drive on tight, one over each end of the wings. Fig. 4 is an end view of the shaft, with the gudgeon in it, and a band on the end; these bands, being put on hot, become very tight as they cool, and if the shaft is dry will not, get loose, but will if it is green; but by driving a few wedges along side of each wing, it can be easily fastened, by any ordinary hand, without danger of moving it much from the centre.</p>
                  <p>One great use of these wings is, to convey away the heat from the gudgeon to the bank, which are in contact with the air; and by
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028644_0231_0FDA2C5CAE45CF58"/>
thus distributing the heat through so much metal,<note place="margin">Art. 84.</note>with so large a surface exposed to the air, the heat is carried off as fast as generated; therefore can never accumulate to a degree sufficient to burn loose, as it will often do in common gudgeons of wrought iron. Wood will not conduct the heat as well as the wings of metal; therefore it accumulates in the small space of the gudgeon, to such a degree as to burn loose.</p>
                  <p>These gudgeons should be made of the best hard metal, well refined, in order that they may wear well, and not be subject to break; but of this there is but little danger, if the metal is good: should it prove to be the case, I propose to have wings cast separate from the neck, as represented by fig. 4; where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side light square shews a mortice for the steeled gudgeon, fig. 7, to be fitted into, with an iron key behind the wings, to draw the gudgeon in tight, if ever it should work loose; by which means it may be taken out, at any time, to repair.</p>
                  <p>This plan would do well for step gudgeons for heavy upright shafts, such as tub mills, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>When the neck is cast with the wings, the square part in the shaft need not be larger than the light square representing the mortice.</p>

This will glance logs, &amp;c. over the dam, without catching against any thing.&amp;If suitable stones cannot be had, I would recommend strong plank, or small logs, laid close together, with both ends pinned to the top logs of the wall, the upstream end being 3 feet lower than the other: But if plank is to be used, there need only be a strong frame raised on the foundation logs, to support the plank, or the timber it is pinned to. See a side view of this frame, fig. 45. plate IV. Some plank the breast to the front posts, and fill the hollow space with stone and gravel; but this may be omitted, if the foundation logs are sufficiently long upstream, under the dam, to prevent the whole from floating away. Stone first, and then gravel, sand and clay, are to be filled in above this frame, so as to stop the water. If the abutments are well secured, the dam will stand well.</p>

                     <p>THE principal things to be considered in building mill-walls, are,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Set the centre of gravity, or weight of the wall, on the centre of its foundation.<note n="†" place="bottom">It is a common practice to build walls plumb outside, and better them all from the inside; which throws the centre of their gravity to one side of their base. See art.14. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it settles any, it will incline to fall outwards. Mill-walls should be battered as much outside, as to be equal to the offsets inside, to cause the whole weight to stand on the centre of the foundation, unless it stand against a bank, as the wall next the waggon, in plate VIII. The bank is very apt to press the wall inwards, unless it stands battering. In this case, build the side against the bank plumb, even with the ground, and then begin to batter it inwards. The plumb rules should be made a little widest at the upper end, so as to give the wall the right inclination, according to its height; to do which, take a line, the length equal to the height of the wall, set one end, by a compass point, in the lower end of the plumb rule, and strike the plumb line; then move the other end just as much as the wall is to be battered in the whole height; and it will shew the inclination of the side of the rule that will batter the wall exactly right. This error of building walls plumb outside, is frequently committed in building the abutments of bridges; the consequence is, they fall down in a short time; because the earth between the walls is expanded a little by every hard frost, and tumbles the walls over.</note>

                                          <head>Concerning Lime, Mortar and Grout.</head>
                                          <p>I have, from my childhood, been well acquainted with the nature of lime and sand made into mortar, of all sorts that have been used in buildings in these countries, and tried nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous experiments with them. On which, together with what I have observed and learned from old experienced workmen, during the course of upwards of sixty years, I think I can safely affirm, that good mortar, that is made of pure and well burnt limestone, properly made up with sharp clean sand, free from any sort of earth, loam or mud, will, within some considerable time, actually petrify, and, as it were, turn to the consistency of a stone. I remember I had one of my remarks from an old Scotch mason; which I shall give you in his own identical words: that is,
<q>
                                                <l>When a hundred years are past and gane,</l>
                                                <l>Then gude mortar is grown to a stain (or stone.)</l>
                                             </q>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>I need not explain what I mean by sharp clean sand; but I shall give you this one caution, that it is better to put too much sand in your mortar, than too little. I know workmen choose to have their mortar rich, because it works pleasanter; but rich mortar will not stand the weather so well, nor grow so hard, as poor mortar will do. If it was all lime, it would have no more strength, in comparison, than clay.</p>

To prevent waste of what may spill out of these buckets, the strap, buckets and pullies, are all enclosed, and work in tight cases; so that what spills will descend to the place from whence it was hoisted. A B, in fig. 1, plate VI,<note place="margin">Plate VI.

                     <p>The Conveyer K I,<note place="margin">Conveyer.</note>fig. 1, is an endless screw of two continued spires, put in motion in a trough; the grain is let in at one end, and the screw drives it to the other, or collects it to the centre, as at y, to run into the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor (see plate VIII, 37—36—4, and 44—45) or it is let in at the middle, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each way, as 15—16, plate VIII.</p>

                     <p>Besides these conveying flights, half their number of others are sometimes necessary; which are called lifters, and set with their broadsides foremost, to raise the meal from one side, and let it fall on the other side of the shaft to cool: these are only used where the meal is hot, and the conveyer short. See 21—22, in plate VIII: which is a conveyer, carrying the meal from 3 pair of stones to the elevator, 23—24.</p>

                     <head>3. Of the Hopper-boy.</head>
                     <p>Fig. 12, plate VII,<note place="margin">Fig. 12. Of the Hopper-boy</note>is a Hopper-boy; which consists of a perpendicular shaft, AB, put in a slow motion, (not above 4 revolutions in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute) carrying round with it the horizontal piece CD, which is called the arms, and set, on the under side, full of small inclining boards, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flights, so set as to gather the meal towards the centre, or spread it from the centre to that part of the arm which passes over the bolting hopper; at which part, one board is set broad-side foremost, as E (called a sweeper) which drives the meal before it, and drops it into the hoppers HH, as the arms pass over them. The meal is generally let fall from the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, at the extremity of the arm, at D, where there is a sweeper,<note place="margin">Sweepers, their use.</note>which drives the meal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, trailing it in a circle the whole way round, so as to discharge nearly the whole of its load, by the time it returns to be loaded again: the flights then gather it towards the centre, from every part of the circle; which would not be the case, if the sweepers did not lay it round; but the meal would be gathered from only one side of the circle. These sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are screwed on the back of the arm, so that they may be raised or lowered, in order to make them discharge sooner or later, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                     <p>The extreme flight of each end of the arms are put on with a screw passing through its centre, so that they may be turned to drive the meal outwards; the use of which is, to spread the warm meal as it falls from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028644_0242_0FDA2C7AB2AECAE0"/>
in a ring round the hopper-boy, while it at the same time gathers the cool meal into the bolting hopper; so that the cold meal may be bolted, and the warm meal spread to cool, by the same machine, at the same time, if the miller chuses so to do. The foremost edge of these arms is sloped up, in order to make them rise over the meal, and its weight is nearly balanced by the weight w, hung to one end of a cord passing over the pulley P, and to the stay iron F. About 4 1-2 feet of the lower end of the upright shaft is made round, passing loosely through a round hole in the flight arm, giving it liberty to rise and fall freely, to suit any quantity of meal under it. The flight arm is led round by the leading arm LM, by a cord passing through the holes LM, at each end, and made fast to the flight arm DC. This cord is lengthened or shortened by a hitch-stick N, with two holes for the cord to pass through, the end of the cord being passed through a hole at D, and fastened to the end of the stick; this cord must reeve freely thro' the holes at the ends of the arms, in order that the ends may both be led equally. The flight arm falls behind the leader about 1-6th part of the circle. The stay-iron CFE, is a ring at F, which fits the shaft loosely, and is for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arm steady, and hanging the ends of an equal height by the screws. CE.</p>

                     <p>The Drill is an endless strap revolving over two pullies,<note place="margin">Drill.</note>like an elevator, but set nearly horizontal, and instead of buckets, there are small rakes fixed to the strap, which draw the grain or meal along the bottom of the case. See GH, in plate VI, fig. 1. The grain is let in at H, and discharged at G. This can sometimes be applied with less expence than a conveyer; if it is set a little descending, it will move grain or meal with ease, and will do well even a little ascending.</p>

The grain or meal falls from the elevator on the upper strap, at E, and by its own gravity and fall, sets the machine in motion, and it discharges the load over the lower pulley F. There are two small buckets to bring up what may spill or fall off the strap, and lodge in the bottom of the case.</p>

The spout is made to fit close, and play under a broad board, and the grain is let into it through the middle of this board, near the pin, so that it will always enter the spout.

                     <p>The grain is emptied into the garner g, from the waggon, as shewn in plate VIII; and, by drawing the gate A, it is let into the elevator AB, and elevated into the crane-spout B, which being turned into the mouth of the garner-spout BC, which leads over the top of a number of garners, and has, in its bottom, a little gate over each garner; which gates and garners are all numbered with the same numbers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively.</p>

garners are all made like hoppers,<note place="margin">Art. 91.</note> about 4 inches wide at the floor, and nearly the length of the garner; but as it passes through the next story, it is brought to the form of a spout 4 inches square, leading down to the general spout KA, which leads to the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; in each of these spouts is a gate number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; with the number of its garner; so that when we want to grind the parcel in garner 2, we draw the gate 2 in the lower spout, to let the wheat run into the elevator at A, to be elevated into the crane-spout B, which is to be turned over the rolling-screen, as shewn in plate VIII.</p>
                     <p>Under the upper tier of garners, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other tier in the next story, set so that the spouts from the bottom of the upper tier pass down the partitions of the lower tier, and the upper spouts of the lower tier pass between the partitions of the upper tier, to the garner-spout.</p>

                     <p>I must here observe, that in mills for grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parcels, the tail flour must be hoisted by a separate elevator to the hopper-boy, to be bolted over, and not run into the conveyer, as shewn in plate VIII; because then the parcels could not be kept separate.</p>
                     <p>The advantages of the machinery,<note place="margin">Advantages gained.</note> applied to a mill for grinding parcels, are very great.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because without them there is much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in moving the different parcels from place to place, all which is done by the machinery.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The meal, as it is ground, is cooled by the machinery, in so short a time, and bolted, that when the grinding is done, the bolting is also nearly finished: Therefore,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It saves room, because the meal need not be spread over the floor to cool, there to lay 12 hours as usual, and none but one parcel need be on the floor at once.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It gives greater dispatch, as the mill need never stop either stones or bolts, in order to keep parcels separate. The screenings of each parcel may be cleaned, as directed in art. 89, with very little trouble; and the flour may be nearly packed before the grinding is finished. So that if a parcel of 60 bushels arrive at the mill in the evening, the owner may wait till morning, when he may have it all finished; he may use the off all for feed for his team, and proceed with his load to market.</p>

The elevator and drill should be so made as to clean out at one revolution.<note place="margin">Art. 92.</note> The drill might have a brush or two, instead of rakes, which would sweep the case clean at a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and the shoe of the bolting-hopper should be short and steep, so that it will clean out soon.</p>
                     <p>The same machinery may be used for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-work, by having a cranespout at C, or a small gate, to turn the meal into the hopper-boy that tends the merchant bolt.</p>

                     <p>A drill is preferable to a conveyer for grist-mills, because they will clean out much sooner and better. The lower pulley of the elevator is twice as large in diameter as the pullies of the drill; the lower pulley of the elevator, and one pulley of the drill, are on the same shaft, close together, the elevator moves the drill, and the pulley of the drill being small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, gives room for the meal to fall into the buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of the elevator.</p>

This vacancy is to be filled up by a short board, guiding the buckets safely over the upper pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. The case must be as close to the points of the buckets, where they empty, as is safe, that as little as possible may fall down again. There is to be a long hole cut into the case at B, for the wheat to fall out at,<note place="margin">Fig. 1. pl. VI.</note> and a short spout guiding it into the crane-spout.

                        <p n="1">1. When the meal-elevator is set in motion to elevate the meal, the hopper-boy must be set in motion also, to spread and cool it; and as soon as the circle is full, the boults may be started; the grinding and boulting may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be carried on together regularly, which is the best way of working.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But if you do not choose to boult as you grind, turn up the feeding sweepers, and let the hopper-boy spread and cool the meal, and rise over it; and when you begin to boult turn them down again.</p>

If you choose to keep the warm meal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the cool, shovel about 18 inches of the outside of the circle in towards the centre, and turn the end flights, to drive the meal outwards, it will spread the warm meal out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and gather the cool meal in the boult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hopper. As soon as the ring is full with warm meal, rake it out of the reach of the hopper-boy, and let it fill again.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. To mix tail-flour or bran, &amp;c. with a quantity of meal that is under the hopper-boy, make a hole for it in the meal quite to the floor, and put it in; and the hopper-boy will mix it regularly with the whole.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If it does not keep the hopper full, turn the feeding sweeper a little lower, and throw a little meal on the top of the arm, to make it sink deeper into the meal. If the spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>PLATE X. fig. 2. The rice brought to the mill in boats, is to be emptied into the hopper 1, out of which it is conveyed, by the conveyer, into the elevator at 2, which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it into the garner 3; on the third floor it descends into the garner 4, that hangs over the stones 5, and supplies them regularly. The stones are to be dressed with a few deep furrows, with out little draught, and picked full of large holes; they must be set more than the length of the grain apart. The hoop should be lined inside with strong sheet-iron, and if punched full of holes it will do better. The grain is kept under the stone as long as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, by causing it to rise some distance up the hoop, to get out through a hole, which is to be made higher or lower by a gate, slid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bottom of it.</p>

The principle by which the grain is hulled,<note place="margin">Art. 103.</note> is that of rubbing them against one another with great force, between the stones, by which means they hull one another, without being broke by the stones, near as much as by the usual way.<note n="*" place="bottom">By trying many experiments, and with much labour, striving to invent a new machine for rubbing the dust off the grains of wheat, and breaking the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I discovered this principle; which I afterwards used with a common pair of bur mill-stones, properly dressed for grinding wheat, and always found it to succeed well, without breaking any good grains, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The light chaff, &amp;c. that does not pass through the sieve, will fall out at the tail, and if useless may also run into the water, and float away. There may be a fan put on the spindle, above the trundle, to make a light blast, to blow out the light chaff and dust, which should be conveyed out through the wall: and this fan may supersede the necessity of the shaking-sieve. The grain and heavy chaff are elevated into garner 7, thence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends into garner 8, and passes through the stones 9, which are to be fixed and dressed the same way as the others, and are only to rub the grain harder: the sharpness on the outside of the chaff (which nature seems to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the pupose) will cut off all the inside hull from the grain, and leave it perfectly clean; then, as it falls from these stones
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028644_0298_0FDA2E23F99CD338"/>
it passes through the wind of the fan 10,<note place="margin">Art. 103.</note> fixed on the spindle of the stones 9, which will blow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ut the chaff and dust, and drop them in the room 21: the wind should escape through the wall. There is a regulating board that moves on a joint at 21, so as to take all the grain into the conveyer, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it into the elevator at 11, which elevates it into the garner 12, to pass through the roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-screen 13, which should have wire of 3 sized mashes: first, to take out the dust, to fall into a part 17, by itself; second, the small rice into an apartment 16; the whole grains fall into garner 14, perfectly clean, and are drawn into barrels at 15. The fan 18 blows out the dust, and lodges it in the room 19, and the wind passes out at 20; the head rice falls at the tail of the screen, and runs into the hopper of the stones 5, to go through the whole operation again. Thus the whole is completely done by the water, by the help of the machinery from the boat, until ready to put into the barrel, without the least manual labour.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it may be necessary to make a few furrows in the edge of the stone, slanting, at an angle of about 30 degrees with a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar line, these furrows will throw up the grain next the stone, on the top of that in the hoop which will change its position continually, by which means it will be better cleaned: but this may probably be done without.</p>

                     <head>Art. 104.</head>
                     <p>THE end we have in view, in grinding the grain, is, to reduce it to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fineness, as is found by experience to make the best bread, and to put it in such a state, that the flour may be most effectually separated from the bran or skin of the grain, by means of sifting or bolting: and it has been proved by experience, that to grind the grain fine with dull mill-stones, will not answer said purpose well, because it kills or destroys that lively quality of the grain, that causes it
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028644_0302_0FDA201FF40828F0"/>
to ferment and raise in the baking:<note place="margin">Art. 104.</note> it also makes the meal so clammy, that it sticks to the cloth, and chokes up the mashes in bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence it appears, that it should be made fine with as little pressure as possible; and it is evident, that this cannot be done without sharp instruments. Let us suppose we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to operate on one single grain, I think it seems reasonable, that we should first cut it into several pieces, with a sharp instrument, to put it in a state, suitable for being passed between two plains, in order to be reduced to one regular fineness. The planes should have on their faces a number of little sharp edges, to-scrape off the meal from the bran, and be set at such a distance, as to reduce the meal to the required fineness, and no finer, so that no part can escape unground. The same rules or principles will serve for a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that will serve for one grain.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, to prepare the stones for grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the greatest perfection, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that their faces must be put in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they will first cut the grain into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces, and then pass it between them, in such a manner, that none can escape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ground to a certain degree of fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and at the same time scrape the meal off clean from the bran or skin.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The best way that I have yet found to effect this is,<note place="margin">The best way of facing and sharpening stones.</note> (after the stones are faced with the staff and the pick) to grind a few quarts of sharp fine sand; this will face them to fit each other so exactly, that no meal can pass between them, without being ground: it is also the best way of sharpening all the little
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028644_0303_0FDA20217A28DAE0"/>
edges on the face,<note place="margin">Art. 104.</note> that are formed by the pores of the stone, (but instead of sand, water may be used, the stones then face each other) so that they will scrape the meal off of the bran, without too much pressure being applied. But as the meal will not pass from the centre to the periphery or verge of the stones, soon enough, without some assistance, there must be a number of furrows,<note place="margin">There must be furrows in the stone.</note> to assist it in its egress; and these furrows must be set with such a draught, that the meal will not pass too far along them at once, without passing over the land or plain, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t it should get out unground. They should also be of sufficient depths, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit air enough to pass though the stones to carry out the heat generated by the friction of grinding;<note place="margin">Their use.</note> but if they have too much draught, they will not bear to be deep, for the meal will escape along them unground. These furrows ought to be made sharp at the feather edge (which is the hinder edge of the furrow, and the foremost edge of the land) which serves the purpose of cutting down the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; they should be more numerous near the centre, because there the office of the stone is to cut the grain, and near the periphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their office is (that of the two plains) to reduce the flour to its required fineness, and scrape the bran clean by the edges, formed by the numerous little pores with which the burr stone abounds.<note place="margin">Should be very hard near the eye.</note> However, we must consider, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In the central dress E A the furrows have all one draught,<note place="margin">Art. 105.</note> and if we could once determine how much is necessary exactly, then we might expect to be right, and I presume we will find it to be in a certain proportion to the size and velocity of the stone; because, the centrifugal force that the circular motion of the stone gives the meal, has a tendency to move it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and this force will be in inverse propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the diameter of the stones; their veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being the same by the 4th law of circular motion. E e is a furrow of the running stone, and we may see by the figure, that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows cross one another at the centre in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> I conceive to be right, because the centrifugal force is much less nearer the centre than the periphery. But we must also consider, that the grain, whole or but little broken, requires less draught and central force to send it out, than it does when ground fine; which shews, that we must here differ in practice from the theories laid down in art. 13, founded on the laws of circular motion and central forces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This ought to be carefully attended to by the maker, because the stone may be made to balance truly when at rest; yet, if every opposite part does not balance each other truly, the stone may be greatly out of balance when in motion, although truly balanced at rest: and this is the reason why the bush of some stones cannot be kept tight but a few hours, while others will keep tight several months, the spindles being good, and stones balanced when at rest. The reason why a stone that is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced at rest, will sometimes not be balanced in motion, is, that if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And 2ndly, to review all the moving gudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mill, to see whether any of them want grease, &amp;c. that he may know what care may be necessary for them during his watch; for want of this the gudgeons often run dry, and heat, which brings on heavy losses of time and repairs; for when they heat, they get a little loose, and the stones they run on crack; after which they cannot be kept cool. He should also see what quantity of grain is over the stones, and if there be not enough to supply them till morning, set the cleaning machines in motion.</p>
                     <p>All things being set right, his duty is very easy—he has only to see the machinery, the grinding, and bolting, once in an hour; he has therefore plenty of time to amuse himself in reading, &amp;c. rather than going to sleep, which is not safe.</p>

                     </gap> in this country; neither burr-stones, nor rolling screens being used; and but few of the best merchant mills had a fan. Many carried the meal on their backs, and bolted it by hand, even for merchant work; and I have frequently heard, that a little before my beginning the business, it had been customary, in many instances, to have the bolting mill some distance from the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mill, and there bolted by hand. It was counted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

when they got their bolting to go by water: after this, fans by hand, and standing screens took place; then bur-stones, rolling-screens, and superfine bolting cloths, with a number of other improvements. Some of the latest are, the Elevators, hopper-boys, &amp;c.—Invented by Oliver Evans, late of Delaware, tho' now of Philadelphia.</p>

                     </gap> in the work. For instance, see the mill-wrights table, in Ferguson's lectures, page 79.; where the cog-wheel is to have 127 cogs, about 15½ feet diameter; trundle 6 staves, and stones 6 feet: And in Imison's introduction to useful knowledge, page 31, the water-wheel is to be 18 feet, cog-wheel 254 cogs, about 31 feet diameter, much higher than the water-wheel;—staves in the trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle 6, and stones 4 2/1; feet. Besides, some have asserted, that water applied on an undershot wheel, will do 6 times as much as if applied on an overshot; others, that if applied on an overshot it will do 10 times as much as an undershot, the quantity and falls being equal: many other parts of their theories are equally wrong, in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. So that what knowledge I have gained, has been by steady attention to the improvements of our own country; I have wondered, that no person of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical knowledge in the art, has yet attempted to write a treatise on it, seeing it is a subject worthy attention,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028644_0360_0FDA2DF548E84600"/>

Mills are often laid under heavy taxes, being supposed to be very suitable; but if all the spare wheat was to be shipped, where would the miller's profit be.

The rubblings that falls at the tail of the sifting reel 39, falls into the hopper of the middlings' reel 42; and the bran falls at the tail into the lower story.

                  <head>THE Practical Mill-wright. Art. 1. OF UNDERSHOT MILLS.</head>
                  <p>FIG. 1, plate I, represents an undershot wheel 18 feet diameter, with 3 feet total head and fall. It should be 2 feet wide for every foot the mill-stones are in diameter; that is, 8 feet between the shrouds for a 4 feet, and 10 feet wide for a 5 feet stone. It should have three sets of arms and shrouds, on account of its great width. Its shaft should be at least 26 inches diameter. It requires 12 arms, 18 feet long, 3 1-2 inches thick, by 9 wide; and 24 shrouds 7 1-2 feet long, 10 inches deep, by 3 thick, and 32 floats 15 inches wide. Note, it may be geared the same as an overshot wheel, of equal diameter. Fig. 2 represents the forebay, with its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ills, posts sluice and fall: I have in this case allowed 1 foot fall and 2 feet head.</p>
                  <p>Fig. 3 represents an undershot wheel 18 feet diameter, with 7 feet head and fall. It should be as wide between the shrouds as the stone is in diameter. Its shaft should be 2 feet diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Requires 8 arms 18 feet long, 3 1-4 of an

inch thick,<note place="margin">Art. 1.</note> by 9 wide. And 16 shrouds, 7 1-2 feet long, 10 inches deep, by 3 thick. Note, it may be geared the same as an overshot wheel 13 feet diameter, because their revolutions per minute will be nearly equal.</p>
                  <p>Fig. 4 represents the forebay, sluice, and fall, the head and fall about equal.</p>
                  <p>Fig. 5 represents an undershot wheel 12 feet diameter, with 15 feet total head and fall. It should be 6 inches wide for every foot the stone is in diameter. Its shaft 20 inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter. Requires 6 arms 12 feet long, 3 by 8 inches; and 12 shrouds, 6 1-2 feet long, 2 1-2 inches thick, and 8 deep. It suits well to be geared to a 5 feet stone with single gears, 60 cogs in the cog-wheel, and 16 rounds in the trundle; to a 4 1-2 feet stone, with 62 cogs and 15 rounds; and, to a 4 feet stone, with 64 cogs and 14 rounds. These gears will do well till the fall is reduced to 12 feet, only the wheel must be less as the falls are less, so as to make the same number of revolutions in a minute: but this wheel requires more water than a breast mill, with the same fall.</p>
                  <p>Fig. 6 is the forebay, gate, shute and fall. Forebays should be wide proportionable to the quantity of water they are to convey to the wheels; and should stand 8 or 10 feet in the bank, and be firmly joined, to prevent the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from breaking through; which it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do, unless they be well secured.</p>

                  <head>Art. 2. Directions for making Forebays.</head>
                  <p>THE best way that I know for making these kind of forebays, is shewn in plate V, fig. 7. Make a number of solid frames, consisting of a fill, two posts, and a cap each; set them cross-wise, (as shewn in the figure) 2 1-2 or 3 feet apart; to these the plank are to be spiked, for there should be no sills lengthwise, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is apt to find its way along them. The frame at the head next the water, and one 6 or 8 feet downwards in the bank, should extend 4 or 5 feet on each side of the forebay in the bank; and be planked in front to prevent the water and vermin from working round. Both of the fills of these long frames should be well secured, by driving down plank edge to edge, like piles, along the upperside, from end to end.</p>
                  <p>The sills being settled on good foundations, the earth or gravel must be rammed well on all sides, full to the top of the sills. Then lay the bottom with good sound plank, well joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and spiked to the sills. Lay your shute, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the upper end a little above the point of the gate when full drawn, to guide the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a right direction to the wheel. Plank the head to its proper height, minding to leave a suitable sluice, to guide the water smoothly down. Fix the gate in an upright position—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ang and wheel and finish it off ready for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the water.</p>
                  <p>A rack must be made to keep off the floating trash that would break the floats and buckets of undershot, breast, and pitch-back wheels,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028644_0367_0FDA2E0233B80938"/>
and injure the gates.<note place="margin">Art. 2.</note> See it at the head of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, fig. 7, plate V. This is done by setting a frame 3 feet in front of the forebay, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sill 2 feet in front of it, for the bottom of the rack: in it the staves are put, made of laths, set edgewise with the stream, 2 inches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, their upper ends nailed to the cap of the last frame, which causes them to lean down steam. The bottom of the race must be planked between the forebay and rack, to prevent the water from making a hole by tumbling through the rack when choaked; and the sides be planked outside the posts to keep up the banks. This rack must be double as long as the forebay is wide, or else the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not come fast enough through it to keep the head up; for the head is the spring of motion of an undershot mill.</p>

                  <head>Art. 3. Of the Principle of Undershot Mills.</head>
                  <p>THEY differ from all others in principle, because the water looses all its force by the first stroke against the floats; and the time this force is spending, is in proportion to the difference of the velocities of the wheel and water, and the distance of the floats. Other mills have the weight of the water after the force of the head is spent, and will continue to move; but an undershot will stop as soon as the head is spent, as they depend not on the weight. They should be geared so, that when the stone goes with a proper motion, they will not run too fast with the water, so as not to receive its

force;<note place="margin">Art. 3.</note> nor too slow, so as to loose its power by rebounding and dashing over the buckets. This matter requires very close attention, and has puzzled our mechanical philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to find it out by theory. They give us for a rule, that the wheel must move just 1-3 the velocity of the water;—perhaps this may suit where the head is not much higher than the float boards, but I am fully convinced it will not suit high heads.</p>
                  <div type="experiments">
                     <head>Experiments for determining the proper Motion for Undershot Wheels.</head>
                     <p>I drew a full sluice of water on an undershot wheel with 15 feet head and fall, and counted its revolutions per minute; then geared it to a mill-stone, set it to work properly, and again counted its revolutions, and the difference was not more than one fourth slower. I believe, that if I had checked the motion of the wheel to be equal 1-3 the motion of the water, that the water would have rebounded the flew up to the shaft. Hence I conclude, that the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the water must not be checked by the wheel more than 1-3, nor less than 1-4; else it will loose in power: for although the wheel will carry a greater load with a slow, than swift motion, yet it will not produce so great effect, its motion being too slow. And again, if the motion be too swift, the load or resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it will overcome will be so much less, that its effect will be lessened also. I conclude, that about 2-3 the velocity of the water is the proper motion for undershot wheels, the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028644_0369_0FDA2E08B7C78A80"/>
water will then spend all its force in the distance of 2 float boards;<note place="margin">Art. 3.</note> notwithstanding, the learned authors have asserted it to be but 1-3. To confute them, suppose the floats 12 inches, and the column of water striking them, 8 inches deep; then, if 2-3 of the motion of this column be checked, it must instantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come 24 inches deep, and rebound against the backs of the floats, and the wheel would be wallowing in this dead water: whereas, when 1-3 of its motion is checked, it becomes only 12 inches deep, and runs off from the wheel smooth and lively.</p>

                  <p>OVERSHOT wheels receive their water on the top, being moved by its weight; and are much to be recommended where there is fall enough for them. Fig. 3 represents one 18 feet diameter, which should be about 6 inches wide for every foot the stone is in diameter. It should hang 8 or 9 inches clear of the tail water, because they draw it under them. The head in the penstock should be generally about 3 feet, which will spout the water about 1-3 faster than the wheel moves. Let the shute have about 3 inches fall, and direct the water into the wheel at the centre of its top.</p>
                  <p>I have calculated a table for gearing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot wheels, which will equally well suit any of the others of equal diameter, that have equal heads above the point where the water strikes the wheel.</p>
                  <p>Dimensions of this wheel, 8 arms 18 feet long, 3 by 9 inches; 16 shrouds 7 feet 9 inches long, 2 1-2 by 7, or 8 inches; 56 buckets, and shaft, 24 inches diameter.</p>

                  <p>Fig. 1 and 2, plate IV, represents a low overshot 12 feet diameter, which should be in width equal to the diameter of the stone. Its parts and dimensions are, 6 arms 12 feet long, 3 1-2 by 9 inches; 12 shrouds, 6 1-2 feet long, 2 1-2 by 8 inches; shaft 22 inches diameter, and 30 buckets.</p>

Fig. 3 represents a very high overshot 30 feet diameter,<note place="margin">Art. 6.</note> which should be 3 1-2 inches wide for every foot of the diameter of the stone. Its parts and dimensions are, 6 main arms, 30 feet long, 3 1-4 inches thick, 10 inches wide at the shaft, and 6 at the end; 12 short arms 14 feet long, of equal dimensions; which are fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the main arms near the shaft, as in the figure; for if they were all put through the shaft, they would make it too weak. The shaft should be 27 inches diameter, the wheel being very heavy and bearing a great load. Such high wheels require but little water.</p>

                  <p>AFTER trying many experiments, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the circumference of overshot wheels geared to mill-stones, grinding to the best advantage, should move 550 feet in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; and that of the stones 1375 feet in the same time; that is, while the wheel moves 12, the stone moves 30 inches, in the proportion of 2 to 5.</p>

                  <p>To find the diameter of the pitch circle, that the cogs stand in, multiply the number of cogs by the pitch, which gives the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; which, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by 7, and divided by 22, gives the diameter in inches; which, divided by 12, reduces it to feet and inches thus:</p>

                  <p>For the cog-wheel of 66 cogs, 4 1-2 pitch, we find to be 7 feet 10 11/22 inches, the diameter of pitch circle; to which I add 8 inches, for the outside of the cogs, makes 8 feet 6 1-2 inches, the diameter from out to out.</p>
                  <p>By the same rules I find the diameters of the pitch circles of the other wheels, to be as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

the same as the cog-wheel,<note place="margin">Art. 30.</note> into which it is to work, put two bands 3-4 of an inch wide, one on each side of the cogs, and a rivet between each cog to keep the wheel from spliting.</p>
                  <p>To proportion the cogs in the wheels to give the bolts the right motion, the common way is—</p>
                  <p>Hang the spur-wheel and set the stones to grind with a proper motion, and count the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of the upright shaft in a minute, and compare its revolutions with the revolutions that a bolt should have, which is about 36 revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions a minute. If the upright goes 1-6 more, put 1-6 less in the first driving-wheel than in the leader, suppose 15 in the driver the 18 in the leader: but if their difference be more (fast one half) there must be a difference in the next two wheels; observing, that if the motion of the upright shaft be greater than the bolt should be, then the driving-wheel must be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably less than the leader; but if it be slower, then the driver must be greater in proportion. The common size of bolting wheels is from 14 to 20 cogs; if less than 14 the head-blocks will be too near the shafts.</p>
                  <p>Common bolting wheels should be made of plank at least 3 inches thick, well seasoned, and are best to be as wide as the diameter of the wheel, and banded with bands near as wide as the thickness of the wheel, made ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of rolled iron, about 1-8 of an inch thick. Some make them of 2 inch plank, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and no bands: but this proves no saving, as they are apt to go to pieces in a few years. For hooping wheels see art. 19, and for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diameter of the pitch circle see art. 9.

By it we can find whether the house is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to contain all the works that are necessary to carry on the business; the builder or own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er understands what he is about, and carries on cheerfully without error; it directs the mason where to put the windows, doors, navel-holes, the inner walls, &amp;c. whereas, if there be no draught every thing goes on, as it were, in the dark; much time is lost and errors are committed to the loss of many pounds. I have heard a man say, he believed his mill was 500l. better, by having employed an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced artist, to draw him a draught to build it by. And I know by experience the great util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of them. Every master builder ought at least, to understand them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1st. If it be a new seat, view the ground where the dam is to be, and where the mill house is to stand, and determine on the height

of the top of the water in the head-race where it is taken out of the stream;<note place="margin">Art. 35.</note> and level from it for the lower side of the race down to the seat of the mill-house, and mark the level of the water in the dam there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2nd. Begin where the tail-race is to empty into the stream, and level from the top of the water up to the mill-seat, noticing the depth thereof in places as you pass along, which will be of use in digging it out.</p>
                  <p>Then find the total fall, allowing 1 inch to a rod for fall in the races, but if they are very wide less will do. Then, supposing the fall to be 21 feet 9 inches, which is sufficient for an overshot, mill, and the stream too light for an undershot, consider well what size stone will suit, for I do not recommend a large stone to a weak, nor a small one to a strong stream. I have proposed stones 4 feet diameter for light, and 4,6 for middling, and 5 or 5 feet 6 inches diameter for heavy streams. Suppose you determine on stones 4 feet, then look in table I, (which is for stones of that size) column 2, for the fall that is nearest 21 feet 9 inches, your fall, and you find it in the 7th example. Column 3 contains the head of water over the wheel 3 feet; 4th, the diameter of the wheel 18 feet; 5th, its width, 2 feet 2 inches, &amp;c. for all the proportions to make the stone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve 106 times in a minute.</p>
                  <p>Having determined on the size of the wheels and size of the house, heights of the stories to suit the wheels, and machinery it is to contain, and business to be carried on therein, proceed to draw a ground plan of the house, such as plate VI, which is 32 by 55 feet. See the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028644_0419_0FDA2F6C68303540"/>
of the plate.<note place="margin">Art. 35.</note> And for the second story, as plate VII, &amp;c. for the 3rd, 4th and 5th floors, if required, taking care to plan eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for the best, and so as not to clash one with another.</p>
                  <p>Draw an end view, as plate VIII, and a side view, as plate IX. Take the draught to the ground and stake out the seat of the house. It is commonly best to set that corner of an overshot mill that the water comes in at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest in the bank: but take great care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consider and examine every thing more than once whether it be planned for the best; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, much labour is often lost for want of due consideration, and by setting buildings in, and laying foundations on wrong places. This done, you may from the draughts make out the bills of scantling and iron work.</p>

                     <p>N. B. The above wheels are proposed as narrow as will well do on account of saving water; but if there is very plenty of it, the wheels may be made wider than directed in the table, and the mill will be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

                     <p>Of this I shall say but little they being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive and but little used.—They should be geared so as to give the saw about 120 strokes in a minute, when at work in a common log. The water-wheel is like that of another mill, whether of the undershot, overshot, or breast kind; the cog-wheel of the spur kind, and as large as will clear the water. The wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower commonly has 14 or 15 rounds, but so as to produce the right motion. On the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower shaft is a balance-wheel, which may be of stone or wood: this is to regulate the motion. There should be a good head above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-wheel to give it a lively motion, else the mill will run heavily.</p>
                     <p>The mechanism of a complete saw-mill is such as to produce the following effects, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. To move the saw up and down, with a sufficient motion and power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To move the log to meet the saw with an uniform motion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To stop of itself when within 3 inches of being through the log.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To draw the carriage with the log back by the power of water ready to enter again.</p>
                     <p>The mill is stopped as follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr> When the gate is drawn the lever is held by a catch, and there is a trigger, one end of which is within half an inch of the side of the carriage, on which is a piece of wood an inch and a half thick nailed, so that it will catch against the trigger as the carriage moves, which throws the catch off of the lever of the gate, and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fig. 2, The lever for communicating the motion from the saw-gate to the carriage, to move the log. It is 8 feet long, 3 inches square, tenoned into a roller 6 inches diameter, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from plate to plate, and working on gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons in them; in its lower side is framed a block 10 inches long, with a mortise in it 2 inches wide its whole length to receive the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the hand-pole, having in it seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holes for an iron pin, to join the hand-pole to it to regulate the feed, by setting the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole nearer the centre of the roller to give less, and farther off, to give more feed.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 3, The hand-pole or feeder, 12 feet long, and 3 inches square where it joins the block</p>
                     <p>Fig. 4, tapering to 2 inches at the lower end, on which is the iron hand 1 foot long, with a socket, the end of which is flattened steel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hardened, and turned down at each side half an inch to keep it on the rag-wheel.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 5, the rag-wheel. This has four cants 4½ feet long, 17 by 3 inches in the middle, lapped together to make the wheel 5 feet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, is faced between the arms with 2 inch plank, to strengthen the laps. The cramp or ratchet-iron is put on as a hoop near 1 inch square, with ratchet-notches cut on its outer edge, about 3 to an inch. On one side of the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028644_0434_0FDA2F801E9A51F0"/>
wheel are put 12 strong pins,<note place="margin">Art. 39.</note> 9 inches long, to tread the carriage back, when the backing works are out of order. On the other side are the cogs, about 56 in number, 3 inch pitch to gear into the cog-wheel on the top of the tub-wheel shaft, with 15 or 16 cogs. In the shaft of the rag-wheel are 6 or 7 rounds, 11 inches long in the round part, let in near their whole thickness, so as to be of a pitch equal to the pitch of the cogs of the carriage, and gear into them easily: the ends are tapered off outside and a band drove on them at each end, to keep them in their places.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 6 the carriage. Is a frame 4 feet wide from outsides, one side 29 feet long, 7 by 7 inches; the other 32 feet long, 8 by 7 inches, very straight and true, the interties at each end 15 by 4 inches, strongly tenoned and braced into the sides to keep the frame from racking. In the under side of the largest piece are set two rows of cogs, 2 inches between the rows, and 9 inches from the fore side of one cog to that of another; the cogs of one row between those of the other, so as to make 4½ inch pitch, to gear into the rounds of the rag-wheel. The cogs are about 66 in number; shank 7 inches long, 1¾ inch square; head 2¾ long, 2 inches thick at the points, and 2¼ inches at the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 7 the ways for the carriage to run on. These are strips of plank 4½ inches wide, 2 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es thick, set on edge, let 1½ inch into the top of the cross sills, of the whole length of the mill, keyed fast on one side, made very straight both side and edge, so that one of them will pass easily between the rows of cogs in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028644_0435_0FDA2E3B0E730920"/>
and leave no room for it to move side ways.<note place="margin">Art. 39.</note> They should be of hard wood well seasoned, and hollowed out between the sills to keep the dust from lodging on them.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 8, the fender posts. The gate with the saw plays in rabbits, 2½ deep and 4 inches wide, in the fender posts, which are 12 feet long, and 12 inches square, hung by hooked tenons, the front side of the two large cross beams in the middle of the frame, in mortises in their upper sides, so that they can be moved by keys to set them plum. There are 3 mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises two inches square through each post, within half an inch of the rabbits, through which pass hooks with large heads, to keep the frame in the rabbits: they are keyed at the back of the posts.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 9, the saw, which is 6 feet long, 7 or 8 inches wide when new, hung in a frame 6 feet wide from the outsides, 6 feet 3 inches long between the end pieces, the lowermost of which is 14 by 3 inches, the upper one 12 by 3, the side pieces 5 by 3 inches, 10 feet long, all of the best, dry, hard wood. The saw is fastened in the frame by two irons in form of staples, the lower one with two screw pins passing through the lower end, screwing one leg to each side of the end piece; the legs of the upper one are made into screws, one at each side of the end piece, passing thro' a broad flat bar that rests on the top of the end piece, with strong burs 1¾ inches square, to be turned by an iron span made to fit them. These straps are made of flat bars, 3 feet 9 inches long, 3 inches wide, ¾ thick before turned; at the turn they are 5 inches wide,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028644_0436_0FDA2E40736D5438"/>
square,<note place="margin">Art. 39.</note> and split, to receive the saw, and tug-pins, then brought nearer together, so as to fit the gate. The saw is stretched tight in this frame, by the screws at the top, exactly in the middle at each end, measuring from the outside; the top end standing about half an inch more forward than the bottom.</p>

The floats are fastened in with keys, so that they will drive inward when any thing gets under them, and not break. These wheels should be very heavy, that they may act as a fly or balance to regulate the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and work more powerfully.</p>

                     <p>See Plate XII. fig. 10,11,12,13,14.18. Fig. 10 is a plate or bar, with a hole in each end, through which the upper ends of the lug pins 11—11 pass, with a strong bur screwed on each, they are 17 inches long, 1⅓ inches square, turned at the lower end to make a round hole 1½ diameter, made strong round the hole.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 12 is a large flat link, passing thro' a mortise near the lower side of the end of the saw-frame. The lug pins pass one through each end of this link, which keeps them close to the gate sides.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Is a bar of iron 2 feet long 3½ inches wide, ½ inch thick, at the lower end, and 1⅓ at the upper end. It is split at the top and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the fig. to pass through the lug pins. At fig. 13 there is a notch set in the head of the pitman bar 14, 1½ inch long, nearly as deep as to be in a straight line with the lower side of the side pins made a little hollow, steel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made very hard.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 18, is an iron plate 1½ inch wide, half an inch thick in the middle, with 2 large nail-holes in each end, and a round piece of steel welded across the middle and hardened, made to fit the notch in the upper end of the pitman, pl. XIV. and drawn close by the lug pins, to the under side of the saw-frame and nailed fast. Now, if the bearing part of this joint be in a straight line, the lower end of the pitman may play without friction in the joint, because both the upper and lower parts will roll with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>This is by far the best plan for pitman irons. The first set I ever seen or heard of has been in my saw-mill 8 years, doing much hard work, and has not cost 3 minutes to adjust them; whereas others are frequently very troublesome.</p>
                     <p>Fig. 14, the tub-wheel for running the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage back. This is a very light wheel, 4 feet diameter, and put in motion by a motion of the foot or hand, at once throwing it in gear with the rag-wheel, lifting off the hand and clicks from the ratchet, and hoisting a little gate to let water on the wheel. The moment the saw stops, the carriage with the log begins to move gently back again.</p>

Some choose them with 4 horns, which fills the eye too much.</p>

                     <head>Of hanging the Saw.</head>
                     <p>First, set the fender-posts as near plum every way as possible, and the head-blocks on which the log is to lay, level. Put the saw right in the middle of the gate, measuring from the outsides, with the upper teeth about half an inch farther forward than the lower ones; set it by the gate and not by a plumline—this is to give the saw liberty to rise without cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the log room to push forward as it rises. Run the carriage forward, so that the saw strike the block—stick up a nail, &amp;c. there—run it back again its full length, and, standing behind the saw, set it to direct exactly to the mark. Stretch the saw in the frame rather most at the edge, that it may be stiffest there. Set it to go, and hold a tool close to one side, and observe whether it touch equally the whole length of the stroke—try if it be square with the top of the head-blocks, else it will not make the scantling square.</p>

                  <div type="directions">
                     <head>Of whetting the Saw.</head>
                     <p>The edge of the teeth ought to be kept straight, and not suffered to wear hollowing—the teeth set a little out, equal at each side, and the outer corners a little longest—they will clear their way the better. Some whet the under side of the teeth nearly level, and others a little drooping down; but then it will never saw steady—will be apt to wood too much;—they should slope a little up, but very little, to make it work steady. Try a cut through the log, and if it comes out at the mark made to set it by, shews it to be right hung.</p>

                     <p>Some long small logs will spring so much in sawing as to spoil the scantling, unless it can be held straight: to do which make a clamp to bear with one end against the side of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the other end under the log with a post up the side thereof—drive a wedge between the post and log, and spring it straight; this will bend the carriage side—but no matter—it is no injury.</p>

Set a post of hard wood in the middle of the main block close to the sliding one, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with a shoulder over the sliding one, for a wedge to be drove under this shoulder to keep the block tight. Make a mark on each block to measure from—when the log is mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the key is driven out. The other end next the saw is best held by a sliding dog, part on each side of the saw pointed like a gauge, with two single joint dogs, one on each side of the saw.</p>

               <p>THEN BY THE RULE—</p>
               <p>STEP I. What are the principles on which this art is founded?—The grain is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a head on the top of the straw, enclosed in a husk or chaff that requires a force to break <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> hull, and disengage it; which may be done either on the principle of beating or rubbing.</p>
               <p>II. What is the best plan in theory for effecting this?—As we find that it all requires wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> equal force, and is all contained in the head, which is much less in quantity than the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>—Theory directs the force to be regularly and uniformly applied to the head only, which will require but little power, seeing we can rub it out between our hands.</p>
               <p>III. How is this theory put in practice, and what are the imperfections and disadvantages of the common process?—The grain in the straw is laid on a plank floor, and beaten by men, which flails; or on the ground, and tread out by horses. The disadvantages are,</p>
               <p n="1">1st. The force is in both cases applied equally to the straw as well as the head.</p>
               <p n="2">2nd. Much force is lost being unnecessarily expended in beating the straw, yet many head; escape undone, because the force is so irregularly applied.</p>
               <p n="3">3rd. In treading by horses, the grain as well as the straw gets dirty.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Thrashing by men is both expensive and tedious.—Now cannot improvements be made to overcome all these disadvantages? Such speculations have produced several.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:028644_0445_0FDA2E63B2F885E0"/>
First, a machine on the principles of a coffee mill, which requires very little force to rule the grain out of the heads, which are first separated from the straw by means of a machine on the principle of a comb, cutting them off. A machine to reap the heads without the straw is wanted to complete this theory. For a description, see American Encyclopedia.</p>
               <p>Second, a machine, invented, and put in practice by Coln. Alexander Anderson of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia; the principles of which is to apply the strength of horses to strike the straw regularly with a uniform force, which finishes as it goes, and cleans the grain at the same time.</p>
               <p>A cylinder 4 feet long, and 3 feet 6 inches diameter, with eight bats fastened to its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference parallel to its axis, and of its whole length, is made to revolve with great rapidity; the bats strike the straw at every fourth of an inch, it being drawn into the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine by and between two rollers that move slowly. This machine makes great dispatch, but is expensive.</p>
               <p>Others, attending to the principle of treading, have made a thing in the form of the frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum of a cone or sugar-loaf, set full of cogs, to act as the horses feet. This is drawn by horses round a circular floor adapted to it, on which the grain is laid—the centre of the circle being the vertex of the cone. This having considerable weight and many cogs, a horse will beat out much more with it than with his feet, because it will strike a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more strokes with equal force. It has these advantages: it can be made by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary carpenter—is cheap—and the dirt is not mixed with the grain, straw, &amp;c.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>THE machine, to be worked by two men, was made on a scale of a 12 foot flail, having a spring which required a power of 20lb. to raise it three feet high at the point:—A spring of this power, and raised three feet high, being found to get out wheat with great effect.</p>
                  <p>The catches or teeth are strongly mortised into the wallower-shaft, and placed round in its circumference, so as to make an angle one with another, of 30 deg. These catches or teeth, take the lifters which raise the flails in an alternate manner, that is, three of the flails are operated upon with the whole power (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 20 lb.) and are on the point of striking; three of them are two thirds raised; three of them one third raised; and three of them at rest; consequently the whole weight to be overcome is 120lb.</p>
                  <p>The lifters should be placed so as that a perpendicular from their lifting end be at the middle of the flail; the rope should be fixed to the flail somewhat farther advanced to the end of the flail, that a proper tangent may be obtained: the ends of the lifters, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> teeth in the wallower, should be rounded off to form a tangent with each other.</p>
                  <p>The rope should be fixed to the flail with a hook and eye, to take off when not at work; for some of the flails being always in a lifting state, their elasticity would otherwise injure.</p>
                  <p>The greater the length of the flails, and the higher they are raised, the more powerful they become; they act upon the floor, with effect, about one third of their length; consequently, a flail 24 feet long will act on the floor, eight feet with force; and this in the size of flails. I would recommend in a horse machine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:028644_0446_0FDA2E6C63D2EDD0"/>
I have made the flails of white-oak and hickory poles; the elasticity wanted was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by paring away the upper part of the flail, from where the string is fastened to the end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed in the mortise: in this way the strength of the spring, and consequently the weight to be overcome, can easily be obtained according to the intended size of the machine. I had flails made with steel springs; the poles do better, and can easily be renewed whenever they are wanted.</p>
                  <p>The wicker-work having some elasticity, adds to the ease in thrashing. As most kinds of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>When necessary to turn the grain; or remove the straw; the end of the flails can readily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The fan or screen is intended for the horse-machine only.</p>
                  <p>The wallower or wheel should have 15 revolutions in a minute; there being four catches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> a length of four feet on the grain. A man thrashing in the usual manner, cannot make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> than 40 strokes in a minute; with a three foot flail; consequently this hand-machine, with twelve flails, by a combination of velocity and space, is equal to 24 men thrashing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>posing the stroke of the flails equally powerful. In a large machine, worked by a horse having 24 flails, of 24 feet in length, the execution will be much greater.</p>
                  <p>The application of a horse requires only an upright shaft; horizontal wheel, and trundle had fixed to the wallower; the horse going at the rate of 3600 yards in an hour; this is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ve the straw will also give him rest: the trundle-head can be easily proportioned to give he wallower-wheel 15 revolutions in a minute.</p>

               <p>II. What is the best plan in theory?—First, make a current of air for the grain to fall through, as deep as possible; then the lightest will be carried farthest, and the separation be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> complete at the end of the fall. Secondly, cause the grain with the chaff, &amp;c. to fall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <head>EXAMPLE III. Take the Art of Distillation.</head>
               <p>STEP I. The principles on which this art is founded are, evaporation and condensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The liquid being heated, the spirits it contains being most oily and lightest, evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates first into steam, which being condensed again into a liquid, by cold, is the spirits.</p>
               <p>II. The best plan in theory for effecting this, appears as follows: the fire should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the still so as to spend the greatest part of its heat possible, to heat the liquid. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the steam should be conveyed into a metal vessel of any form that may suit best; which is to be immersed in cold water, to condense the steam; and in order to keep the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denser cold, there should be a stream of water continually entering the bottom and flowing over the top of the condensing tub, the steam should have no free passage out of the conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, else the strongest part of the liquor may escape.</p>
               <p>III. Is this theory already put in practice, and what are the disadvantages of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon process?—1st. Greatest part of the heat escapes up the chimney. 2nd. It is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to keep the grounds from burning in the still. 3rdly. The fire cannot be regulated to keep the still from boiling over; therefore we are obliged to run slow: to remedy these disadvantages—First, to lessen the fuel, apply the fire as much to the surface of the still as possible. Enclose the fire by a wall of clay that will not convey the heat away so fast as stone or iron; let in as little air as possibly can be made to keep the fire burning; for the air carries away the heat of the fire. Secondly, to keep the grounds from burning; immerse the still with the liquor into a vessel of water, joining their tops together, then by applying the fire to heat the water in the outside vessel the grounds will not burn, and by regulating the heat of the outside vessel the still may be kept from boiling over.</p>
               <p>IV. A still of this structure was made by Col. Alexander Anderson, of Philadelphia, and the experiment tried; but the water in the outside vessel boiled, and being open, the heat escaped thereby, and the liquor in the still could not be made to boil—this appeared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the scheme. But considering that by enclosing the water in a tight vessel, so that the steam could not escape, and that by compressure the heat might be increased, and it passed to the liquor in the still, which now boiled as well as if the fire had been immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the still. Again, by fixing a valve to be loaded so as to let the steam escape, when arrived to such a degree of heat as to be near boiling over, then the still could not be made to boil over at all.</p>
               <p>Thus was an improvement produced by which he can dispatch business in the ratio of 2 to 1, expending fuel in the ratio of 2 to 2 1-2, to produce equal quantities of liquor.—We may bring forward another improvement by considering, that, as we know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that compressure above the weight of the atmosphere, keeps the steam from rising from the water, till heated to a certain degree above the boiling heat. We may hence conclude that a compressure less than the atmosphere, will suffer it to rise with a degree less than boiling heat, which suggests the expediency of taking off the pressure of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere from the liquor in the still, by which means we shall expend less fuel, and the heat need never be so great as to burn the grounds, which may be done by putting the end of the worm into a tight globular vessel of metal, and a cock between it and the condenser; then inject steam from a small boiler, and expel all the air out of this vessel; turn the cock and it will run into the condenser and be condensed. By repeating this a vacuum may be easily made, and kept up in the worm and top of the still, and the spirits will probably come off with half the heat and fuel usually expended.</p>
               <p>This is about to be put in practice to try the experiment.</p>

               <p>In support of this hypothesis, a neighbour of mine told me, he filled a rum hogshead in the fall full of apples at the bung, bunged it tight, and in the spring found them all sound; another, when a boy, buried a hollow gum bee-hive full of apples, trampled the earth tight about them, opened them when the wheat began to ripen, and found them all sound, but leaving them, returned in a day or two, and found them all rotten<note n="*" place="bottom">Much contained in this appendix is to be found in different authors; and several things, which I thought had originated with myself, have been treated of by Dr Franklin.</note>.</p>

               <p>BY the right use of natural Philosophy and Reason, aided by Experiments, many improvements might be made that would add much to the conveniences and comforts of life—But the great obstacle is the expense of experiments, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing theory to practice, which few will risque.—For when a man attempts to make any improvements, he is sure to be ridiculed until he succeeds, and then the invention is often depreciated—Doctor Franklin said—that "a man's use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

            <p>It is not necessary that he should see the seat but have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a slight draught of the situation of the stream, roads, height of the banks, &amp;c. with the exact fall of the water, and quantity, if scarce, as directed, art. 53. Those who choose to adopt any part of the said improvements after this date may by sending a line directed to him in Philadelphia

            <p>WHEREAS Robert Dawson hath established in Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton a manufactory of bolting cloths, and being desirous to have them recommended to the public, has submitted to our examination some of each kind, (they also having been tried by several millers at this place.) We who are subscribers are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to certify that those we have had experience of, or have seen tried, have answered well all the purposes of imported cloths; and as the silk, as well as manufacture, is of our own country, it is our opinion that they ought to obtain a decided preference to those fabricated in any foreign country.</p>
