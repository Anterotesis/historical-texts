            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT I propos'd laſt <hi>May's</hi> Seſſion for the advantage of the Province in relation to the Settlement of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> and Fortifying this Harbour, was ſo coldly entertain'd by the Aſſembly, That I am almoſt diſcourag'd from renewing my Advice on thoſe heads. Yet my zeal for the Publick Service will not ſuffer me to paſs over in ſilence thoſe two material points. The Settlement of the <hi>Colledge</hi> will beſt be obtain'd in my opinion by Addreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the KING for His Royal Charter of Priviledges. And as for Fortifying the Harbour, that is in your own power to do, and will I am perſwaded be pleaſing to the KING, who deſires, and delights in, the welfare and ſecurity of His people.</p>
            <p>I am told many of your Miniſters in the remote parts of the Province, have very narrow Stipends, not enough to maintain 'em Decently; 'tis reaſonable you ſhould make them eaſy: with them I recommend to your care the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter of this Town, who is deſtitute of a Maintenance, becauſe there are ſo very few <hi>French</hi> Families here: Let the preſent raging perſecution of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> ſtir up your Zeal and Compaſſion towards him. I wiſh for your ſakes the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants had been incourag'd among you, they are a good ſort of People, very Ingenious and Induſtrious, and would have been of great uſe for Peopling this Country, and enriching it by Trade.</p>
            <p>You know as well as I the Circumſtances we are in with the Eaſtern <hi>Indians,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> Miſſionaries have debauch'd 'em from their former Obedience to the KING, and that it was at their Inſtigation they Murder'd ſo many of your People this laſt War; and are now at the Devotion of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to act over again ſuch another Tragedy. It ſeems to me that the Suffering <hi>Jeſuits</hi> or other Popiſh Miſſionaries to live in this Province, and poyſon the <hi>Indians</hi> with their groſs Idolatry and Superſtition is <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000907_0002_0FACA05920CD6E30"/>I am ſorry to tell you, That I find the <hi>French</hi> Miſſionaries are no leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to debauch our five Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> in the Province of <hi>New York,</hi> taking Indefatigable pains to work on ſome by fear and menaces, on others by Enticement and Flattery; and the Meſſengers I lately ſent to Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, Inform me that ſeveral of our forward Fighting Indians that were beſt affected to us, have lately been diſpatch'd out of the world by poyſon. The parting with <hi>Canada</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> and the Eaſtern Country call'd <hi>Acadie</hi> or <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> with the noble Fiſhery on that Coaſt, were a moſt execrable Treachery to <hi>England,</hi> and intended without doubt to ſerve the ends of Popery. 'Tis too well known what Intereſt that King favour'd, that parted with <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> and of what Religion he died. I have now in my hands his Original Order to the Governour of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render that Country to the <hi>French,</hi> and 'tis obſervable the Secretary of State that Counter-ſign'd the Order, afterwards died a Papiſt. Such fatal Miſgovernment in the late Reigns, ought to give us the higheſt Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and value for his Preſent Majeſty, who is in all reſpects a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant KING, both in the watchful and Indulgent Care of His Proteſtant Subjects, and his great moderation to others.</p>
            <p>I am Commanded by the KING to Recommend to you the paſſing a Law to prevent the Eſcape of Pyrates and other Offenders out of Priſon, and to puniſh the Keepers of Priſons within this Province, and all other perſons that ſhall be conſenting to or aſſiſting in ſuch Eſcapes.</p>
            <p>You would do well to make a Law that ſhall effectually prevent the Clipping and Debaſing the Current Coin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo the Exportation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both which are become too univerſal a practice, and tend very much to the Impoveriſhment of the Province.</p>
            <p>The Management of the Eaſtern Indians in ſuch manner as to bring them again under the Obedience of His Majeſty is neceſſary above all other things, and worth your thoughts and care to try to effect.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Houſe of Repreſentatives,</p>
            <p>It will become you to take Care for the Support of the Government, and to provide ſuch Supplies as may beſt ſuit with the Eaſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the people, to you therefore I more particularly Recommend that Service.</p>
