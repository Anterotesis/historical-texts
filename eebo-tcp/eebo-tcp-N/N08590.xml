            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE following piece was written but a ſhort time before the repeal of the ſtamp-act; and as the ſubject of it was of the moſt general and important nature, the trifling altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of circumſtances which a few months have produced, cannot prevent it's being as applicable to the preſent ſtate of our affairs, as to thoſe diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable controverſies, in which we have been heretofore unhappily involved. The conciliating ſpirit which prevailed upon the firſt intelligence of the ſtamp-act's being repealed, prevented its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication then; though the author was ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly convinced, the colonies would not long have any reaſon to flatter themſelves, that the repeal of this act was a ſacrifice to liberty; or that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from any thing more than an apprehenſion of the ill conſequences which our brethren of <hi>Britain</hi> muſt have felt from the oeconomical reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which we had formed. Upon examining the debates, previous to the repeal, if any one could have doubted the ſenſe of the legiſlature, the act for ſecuring the dependence of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, would have reduced it to a ſufficient degree of certainty. Indeed, if this act had been more equivocal, the billeting act was explicit enough to have pointed out clearly to every common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, their <hi>generous meaning</hi>—A meaning evidenced by ſuch meaſures as could not but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the moſt alarming apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>In mixt forms of government, where the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the conſtitution requires the ſtricteſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010986_0004_0F852EF67AEDC120"/>
to the movements of each diſtinct part, jealous fears frequently intervene, upon the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt appearance of irregularity. The hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> alone, will furniſh us with facts ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport this aſſertion; ſince every man who poſſeſſes the ſmalleſt ſhare of hiſtorical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, muſt certainly have obſerved, that before any meaſure of importance could obtain the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary approbation of the three eſtates of the kingdom, it firſt paſſed a ſevere and critical exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; leſt a ſuperior addreſs in either of the parties intereſted, ſhould give themſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantage—leſt a deſigning miniſter ſhould extend the prerogative of the crown, or an artful commoner increaſe the liberty of the ſubject. A few thouſands added to the military liſt, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed the whole nation; and a body of troops, not equal to thoſe upon the <hi>American</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have with the moſt terrible apprehenſions, been conſidered as a formidable army,—ſo averſe have the people of <hi>England</hi> ever been, to truſt their liberties, even with the beſt of men, that they have choſen to depend upon the precarious aid of ſubſidiary troops, rather than put arms into the hands of their own countrymen: while there was the leaſt probability that thoſe arms might be employed to the ſubverſion of liberty. This conduct, I only mean to remark as conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the genius of liberty: and, though its policy, when critically examined, may not appear altogether unexceptionable, yet will the <hi>jealous caution</hi> which produced it, be ever conſidered as the grand bulwark of freedom. When I apply myſelf to conſider the ſituation of the coloniſts, I cannot but obſerve that they labour under diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties peculiar to themſelves. They have not only to guard their libertles againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010986_0005_0F852EF69983E7F8"/>
of the royal prerogative, but even to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their property againſt the invaſions of their more powerful brethren. The people of <hi>England</hi> have only one ſingle defence to make for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their freedom; and, if the ſyſtem of venality and corruption, which now ſo generally prevails, does not gradually lead them into a ſtate of ſlavery, no open violence can ever affect it. Far different is the ſituation of the divided <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans.</hi> Of them every diſtinct colony has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been conſidered as a particular plantation of the crown, and been governed by ſuch looſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary powers as were better calculated to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>deſpoſitiſm</hi> of a miniſter than the <hi>liberties</hi> of the ſettlers. They are now conſidered as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rivals, and their unprotected intereſts muſt fall a ſacrifice to thoſe of their jealous brethren. An artful, deſigning miniſter would naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to conciliate the affections of thoſe who more immediately ſurround the throne, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving any burthens from their ſhoulders, and ſixing them upon thoſe, by whoſe murmurs and complaints, he could not be ſo immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. To gratify the deſires of his ſelfiſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and flatter them with the appearance of an <hi>unnatural ſuperiority;</hi> he would willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to any acts for the limiting our trade, and reſtraining our manufactures: But perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the <hi>Americans</hi> will neither be ſo ſtupid as not to perceive the iniquity of theſe meaſures, nor ſo paſſive as patiently to ſubmit to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried into execution, he prudently prepares to ſupport them by means as infamous and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive as thoſe which are to be ſupported. Though our <hi>European</hi> neighbours are driven from the continent; and, though our ſavage enemies have long ſince laid down the hatchet, yet have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010986_0006_0F852EF78B422420"/>
our careful guardians left us with a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body of troops, and are daily ſending over freſh ſupplies—<hi>to protect us from any future dangers;</hi> when it cannot but be evident to every man of common knowledge, that in our preſent ſituation, we are both able and willing to defend our own frontiers, without putting the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the trouble of tranſporting troops for that purpoſe, at ſuch an immenſe expence. We have now ſixteen regiments diſtributed through the different colonies—moſt of them inſtead of being a defence to our frontiers, are a burthen to our maritime cities; where they are, by virtue of an act of the Britiſh parliament, to be plentifully ſupplied with neceſſaries at the expence of the place where they may be quartered; and as the quartering them depends altogether upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will of the commanding officer, he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely veſted with a power of oppreſſing any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle colony, which may have been ſo unfortunate as to have incurred the reſentment of thoſe who appointed him.</p>
            <p>When the miniſtry, reſolved to burthen us with ſo many troops, it was not thought proper to make the uſual requiſitions to the different aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for the neceſſary ſupplies. The power of parliament had met with an unexpected oppoſition, in their firſt attempts to enforce the ſtamp act. Urged by a prudent attention to their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, they had indeed determined to repeal this oppreſſive act; but leſt this extraordinary conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be conſidered as an acknowledgment of right, they determined to exert their authority once more in a manner ſo explicit, as ſhould leave us no room to doubt their meaning.</p>
            <p>One act is paſſed to declare the dependence of the colonies upon the <hi>imperial crown and parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010986_0007_0F852EF836BFD2C8"/>
of Great-Britain;</hi> and that dependence is immediately proved by a law for billeting ſoldiers in America, and for obliging thoſe places, in which the commanding officer may think proper to quarter them, to grant certain very ample ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of neceſſaries. Upon application to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of New-York, the general aſſembly of that province ſhewed their readineſs to comply with every thing that might be required for the accommodation of thoſe troops which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the valuable acquiſitions in <hi>America.</hi> They framed a law for the purpoſe, and granted a ſufficiency of ſuch articles as they conceived moſt uſeful and neceſſary for the ſoldiers: They did not indeed comply with every particular contained in the act of parliament—perhaps it might not be in their power. If any thing was to be given by the coloniſts for the accommodation of the ſoldiery, ſurely they were the beſt judges, of their own abilities, as well as of thoſe articles which they could moſt conveniently procure. If the parliament had thought proper to have ordered porter inſtead of ſmall beer, and gin inſtead of rum, they would ſcarcely have procured a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity, had they even ſought it with fixt bayonets. Although the inhabitants could not but be alarmed at a requiſition ſupported by the whole legiſlative authority, yet did they prudently decline taken notice of ſuch an <hi>extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,</hi> and very modeſtly reſolved to comply with the <hi>deſign</hi> of the act without any immediate reference to the <hi>act itſelf.</hi> Some triffling alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were indeed made in the ſtipulated allowances; but ſo inconſiderable were they that I believe the ſoldiery complained but little of the alteration; and I cannot think that the greateſt enemy to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica ever imagined that the freemen of New-York,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010986_0008_0F852EF8D135EDF8"/>
when they uſed a diſcretionary power in granting a ſhare of their own private property, for the uſe of the army, and were hardy enough to deviate, in ſome minute particulars, from the directions of the Britiſh parliament, would ever have excited ſo violent—ſo unjuſtifiable a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. A reſentment expreſſed by a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt unreaſonable and unconſtitutional—ſuch a proceeding as muſt prove, beyond all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of contradiction, that whatever conceſſions we may receive from a prudent attachment to their own intereſt, we can expect nothing from a generous attention to the ſpirit of their own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſtitution, or from an honeſt reluctance to invade the natural rights of their fellow-ſubjects.</p>

            <p>MR. PITT, has frequently declared that the freemen of Great-Britain have no right to take money out of our pockets, without firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our conſent; and yet their repreſentatives in parliament have reſolved, without deigning to conſult us, that we ſhall pay a certain ſum for furniſhing the ſoldiery with particular neceſſaries. Unwilling to revive a conteſt, which had juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ſettled ſo much to our ſatisfaction, we declined renewing the diſpute with regard to the legality of the act. We were contented to receive it as a <hi>reaſonable requiſition,</hi> though not as <hi>a bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law;</hi> and, conſulting our own abilities and conveniency, we granted ſuch articles as we thought would anſwer <hi>the deſign of the act.</hi> In this conduct. ſo remarkably temperate, we have incurred the higheſt diſpleaſure of the Britiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010986_0009_0F852EFE355AEF80"/>
and are expoſed, as a puniſhment due to our offences, to one of the moſt general, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt penalties which the hand of power could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. An act has paſſed to ſtrip us of our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, and render us unable to provide for ourſelves in a ſituation of the moſt imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; becauſe we have outrageouſly refuſed to ſubſcribe to our own ruin. We have modeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided controverting a point of the <hi>higheſt</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, leſt we ſhould draw upon ourſelves a charge of <hi>obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>malevolence.</hi> We have complied with the <hi>meaning,</hi> though not with the <hi>letter</hi> of the act. We have evidenced the moſt grateful and complying diſpoſition, and are nevertheleſs doomed to receive the puniſhment of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious oppoſition. If our every act is thus liable to be miſconſtrued, and we are patiently to receive ſuch ſevere chaſtiſement, we muſt at once renounce the name of free-men, and accommodate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a ſtate of <hi>abject vaſſallage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may not perhaps, juſt now feel any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ill conſequences from this reſtraint upon our legiſlation; but when we are to determine upon the purity or juſtice of any particular act, we are to conſider all the effects which it may probably, or even poſſibly produce. Suppoſe (for inſtance) that our ſavage neighbours ſhould once more wantonly invade our frontiers—to what a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſituation ſhould we be reduced! Our lives and fortunes expoſed to the attacks of a barbarous enemy, without our being able to raiſe either men or money for our protection. Can the greateſt enemy to America think of our being reduced to a ſituation ſo truly diſtreſsful, without accuſing of the moſt unnatural ſeverity, thoſe who arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to themſelves an abſolute power of directing and reſtraining our every action, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010986_0010_0F852EFEE7838E08"/>
as may beſt anſwer their own partial purpoſes? In this amazing exertion of parliamentary power, the ſingle colony of New-York is not alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. It may hereafter be the fate of every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther province, unleſs they now cordially unite in ſuch an application as may confirm their liberty, or eſtabliſh their ſubordination upon ſome regular principles.</p>
            <p>I am no favourer of violent meaſures. I would endeavour to ſupport our pretenſions by force of reaſoning, not by force of arms; but yet I would anxiouſly wiſh that nothing may intimidate us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an acquieſcence with the meaſures of oppreſſion. We may be compelled to ſubmit, but never to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh our claim to the privileges of the free-men.</p>
            <p>When we complain of the violent proceedings in the late adminiſtrations, let us conſider the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations which a century has produced in our conſtitution. We have now a ſtanding army of one hundred and twenty regiments. Scarce a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of rank but what has ſome military connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and even in the houſe of commons there are too many gentlemen of the ſword. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, that we are alarmed with ſuch <hi>ſpirited reſolves</hi>—that execution is to preceed judgment; and that the inhabitants of a colony are regarded as <hi>dependent vaſſals,</hi> by thoſe who have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to conſider a legion of <hi>free ſubject,</hi> as a band of <hi>abſolute ſlaves</hi>—points of honour now take place of points in law, and <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> itſelf muſt give way to that <hi>furor militaris</hi> which ſo univerſally prevails. The hand which beſtows a truncheon can never be guilty of oppreſſion, and the will of an artful miniſter, will become the law of a whole nation.</p>
            <p>I am no enemy to the preſent military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as I conceive it may influence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010986_0011_0F852F011E634C00"/>
our liberties; nor have I any reſentment againſt the inhabitants of that country, which gave birth to my anceſtors, but when I conſider them as exerting their ſuperior power to reduce their fellow ſubjects to a ſtate of ſubordination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their natural rights, and not to be reconciled to the ſpirit of their own conſtitution. I admire and revere the well regulated government of Great-Britain, and only wiſh to have our own ſyſtem eſtabliſhed by ſo excellent a ſtandard.</p>
            <p>As a coloniſt, my moſt ambitious views extend no further than the rights of a Britiſh ſubject. I cannot comprehend how my being born in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſhould diveſt me of theſe; nor can I conceive why the liberty and property of a free born Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhould not be protected from every invaſion with the ſame caution, which has ever been exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to guard the privileges of an Engliſhman. If we are entitled to the liberties of Britiſh ſubjects we ought to enjoy them <hi>unlimitted and unreſtrained.</hi> If our pretenſions to theſe are without any foundation, why are we left unacquainted with the cauſe and nature of our ſubordination? In acts of the greateſt ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and notoriety, we have been flattered with the title of Britiſh ſubjects—we have received with the blood of our anceſtors, the ſpirit of liberty, and our hearts naturally retain an utter abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſlavery. We have carefully examined thoſe glorious charters, granted to the virtuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of our brave fore-fathers; and the reſult of our examination cannot but inform us—that liberty is only to be ſupported by a ſteady op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the firſt advances of arbitrary power. The conduct of the coloniſts has been moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly miſrepreſented, and they have been ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as <hi>riotous</hi> and <hi>rebellious,</hi> when thoſe who are un-influenced by prejudice, cannot but diſcover
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010986_0012_0F852F01D14A3178"/>
that their warmeſt wiſhes riſe no higher than to a connection, founded upon <hi>natural right;</hi> and that their preſent reſentment could only be excited by the horrid apprehenſions of being reduced to a ſtate of <hi>ſlaviſh dependence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ſo great a ſtickler for the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the colonies, but I am ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of lodging in ſome part of the community a <hi>reſtraining</hi> power, for the regulating and limiting the trade and manufactures of each particular county or colony, in ſuch a manner as might moſt effectually promote the good of the whole; and I ſhould not obſtinately object to the veſting this power in the parliament of Great-Britain, if the violent meaſures which have lately been carried into execution, did not afford me too much reaſon to believe, that every conceſſion which might at this time be made from a <hi>principle of neceſſity,</hi> and a regard to the public utility, would be immediately conſidered as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſuch a <hi>ſubordination,</hi> as is totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the nature of our conſtitution. If a laudable motive of moderation, and a generous attention to the welfare and tranquility of the whole community, ſhould induce a ready ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to every regulation which the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may think neceſſary to frame, the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which may poſſibly attend ſuch a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conduct, may draw upon us, a charge of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable negligence.</hi> In a ſyſtem ſo complicated as ours, where one power is continually encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the other, and where the general ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance is ſo fluctuating and precarious; a ſpirit of compliance and moderation in the preſent age, may lay a foundation for the ſlavery and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of future generations; who will have the greateſt reaſon to charge us with having baſely
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010986_0013_0F852F029B94E5D8"/>
betrayed their liberties, by careleſly relaxing from the <hi>rigid ſcrutiny</hi> which ever ought to be made into matters of national concern.</p>

            <p>In the purſuit of all political meaſures, if we are not cautious in preſerving the <hi>appearance</hi> of liberty, we may inſenſibly loſe the <hi>reality</hi> itſelf. As men attentive to our own particular intereſts, we cannot but diſcover the many advantages which the coloniſts would neceſſarily have over their brethren of <hi>Britain,</hi> in the courſe of a <hi>free unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted commerce;</hi> but, as men of reaſon and integrity, we do not indulge a wiſh to enjoy theſe advantages at the expence of our fellow ſubjects. We ſhall ever readily ſubſcribe to ſuch commerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al regulations as may enable the inhabitants of Great-Britain, and Ireland, to meet us at all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign markets upon an equal footing; but where the authority by which theſe reſtrictions are to be framed, can with moſt ſafety and propriety be lodged, is now the ſubject of our inquiries.</p>
            <p>The boldeſt advocates for the power of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot, at this day, without bluſhing, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that it is ſovereign and ſupreme in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whatſoever. That great man, who is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contradiction, the beſt acquainted with the conſtitution of his own country, and the moſt ſincerely attached to her true intereſt, never wiſhed to extend the legiſlative power of Britain, any further than might be eſſential to her own preſervation; by eſtabliſhing ſuch regulations as were indiſpenſably neceſſary to prevent her falling a prey to her riſing colonies. As there was an immediate neceſſity of placing this power ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, the parliament of Great-Britain could
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010986_0014_0F852F0356812F48"/>
urge a claim founded in an appearance of reaſon, and ſupported by a ſuperiority of ſtrength; and yet reaſonable as this claim appeared to be, it could never be maintained, upon the principles of their own government. The commons of Britain might indeed with great propriety propoſe regulations for the trade, and reſtrictions for the manufactures of thoſe by whom they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; but how they can, with any face of equity, reſolve to extend theſe regulations and reſtrictions to thoſe from whom they have received no delegated power, is what I cannot easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. Would they but admit to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral council a certain number of deputies, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized from every colony, to ſupport the intereſts of their conſtituents, to explain the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their ſituation, and remonſtrate againſt any acts of oppreſſion, then indeed whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial regulations they might think proper to form, would be fixed upon a conſtitutional baſis, and their authority remain for ever undiſputed; as I can never be ſuppoſed to mean that it ſhould extend to any other than ſuch matters which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relate to commerce; while the internal policy of each colony ſhould ſtill be regulated by its proper repreſentatives, in conjunction with the deputy of the crown; and their liberty ſhould only be reſtrained and their property fairly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by thoſe who are legally veſted with that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. I am very ſenſible, that to fix a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in parliament for the purpoſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce only, would be attended with many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; but every man who has the cauſe of liberty, and the intereſt of his country at heart, would rather accept ſuch a partial, diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtabliſhment as might immediately be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than ſubmit to ſuch an unnatural ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010986_0015_0F852F04100545C8"/>
as muſt continually keep alive the ſpirit of contention, and finally involve us in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruin.</p>
            <p>The friends of parliamentary power loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in contemplating the idol they have raiſed; and to confirm the veneration which they have entertained, they annex to it the idea of omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and infallibility. It is a received maxim of the law—"that the king can do no wrong;" and yet our brave forefathers were not ſo deluded by this royal dogma as to ſuffer themſelves to be ſtripped of their invaluable rights and privileges by the arbitrary fiat of a wicked prince; and if they were juſtifiable in their reſolute oppoſition to the unwarrantable encroachments of a power which had been conſidered as ſacred. by a long hereditary ſucceſſion; how very reaſonably may we conceive that our conduct will be ſtrictly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible when we unanimouſly oppoſe the violent proceedings of a body which we may be ſaid, from day to day, to have faſhioned with our own hands. As the original design of delegating power, was, that it might be exerciſed for the good of the whole community, there cannot be a greater abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in polities, than to ſuppoſe, that thoſe whom we have veſted with a reaſonable and neceſſary authority, are not accountable to us if they ſhould by any conſideration, be led weakly and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to abuſe it. The doctrine of non-reſiſtance and paſſive obedience to the tyrannic will of a wicked prince has long ſince been exploded, and thoſe who have endeavoured to inculcate theſe ſlaviſh principles, have deſervedly been treated with the utmoſt rigour of the law.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010986_0016_0F852F04D1BEEC48"/>
misfortune which we moſt cautiouſly avoid, we have as much to apprehend from a corrupt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as from an ambitious King; and he who would patiently ſubmit to the uſurpations of the one, and reſolutely oppoſe the deſpotiſm of the other, only declares, by his conduct, that he would rather be ruled by five hundred tyrants than by one.</p>
            <p>The natural right which every man poſſeſſes, to reſtrain, by every poſſible method, the progreſs of arbitrary, lawleſs government, is not at this day to be controverted; and though it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated, that the too warmly and too frequently preſſing this doctrine, may excite a ſpirit of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; yet in anſwer to this, I muſt beg leave to remark, that the cauſe of liberty cannot be too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cultivated, &amp; that thoſe principles by which it is beſt ſupported, cannot be too often or too ſtrongly inculcated. Should the parliament of Britain, by an act of power, atempt to ſtrip their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents of ſome important, unalienable right; would they not meet with as certain and violent oppoſition, as if the crown, by an exertion of its prerogative, ſhould endeavour to diveſt them of ſome eſtabliſhed privilege? The King of Great-Britain is veſted with an extenſive, but not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted authority; and is himſelf bound by thoſe laws with the execution of which he is entruſted. The repreſentatives of the nation, in parliament aſſembled, with juſtice arrogate to themſelves many great and uſeful powers. They are truſtees lawfully appointed for the freemen of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—<hi>nequid detrimenti capiat reſpublica</hi> is the tenure of their appointment; and if they ſhould from any principle of venality or corruption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their important truſt, no man can doubt but that they are very reaſonably accountable to their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010986_0017_0F852F059BC081E8"/>
conſtituents for every part of their miſconduct. Should an act of the Britiſh legiſlature invade the rights of thoſe who clothed the law-makers with their legiſlative power, it could only be conſidered as a breach of truſt; but if the ſame authority ſhould be exerted to deprive us of our moſt ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable liberties, we muſt very properly regard it as an act of violence and oppreſſion. Such violence has lately been offered to the legiſlature of New-York in particular, and ſuch oppreſſion will with great reaſon be complained of by the colonies in general, when they more clearly diſcover the ill ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of thoſe ſtatutes, which have lately been framed under a pretence of regulating our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. I cannot think it neceſſary to enter into a minute examination of every particular ſtatute. The nature and importance of thoſe duties which have been impoſed upon ſuch articles as we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of importing from Great-Britain only, have been very clearly and accurately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by a late judicious writer.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

Laws which are the reſult of ſuch a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and well-digeſted compact, may bear hard upon ſome, but they cannot, with propriety, be

complained of by any; ſince every precaution which the wit of man could deviſe, was neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed for the benefit of the whole united body, after a due attention to the ſeparate intereſt of each.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Crown, agree to regulate their trade by well placed reſtrictions, and ſettle the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their manufactures in ſuch a manner as ſhall be moſt conducive to the public good.

            <p>But when the Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>formal compact</hi> with the Crown, attempt to bind thoſe, who can by no means be conſidered as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their agreement, they diſcard thoſe noble principles to which they owe the enjoyment of all that is valuable in life, and introduce power in the place of reaſon to ſupport a ſyſtem which has its foundation in partial, not in univerſal good.

If the abſurdity and injuſtice of ſuch a procedure is to be diſcovered by every eye, we ſhall not be long before we clearly perceive, through all the miſts
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010986_0020_0F852F07E2FFFDD0"/>
of ingenious ſophiſtry, that, upon the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible principles of their own conſtitution, the Lords and Commons of <hi>England</hi> can no more <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with the Crown for the limitting and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our natural liberty, than they can <hi>agree</hi> to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>grant</hi> the moſt valuable of our property to be diſpoſed of for their own private purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The more I conſider this maxim, which I have taken from my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> the more ſenſible am I of its weight and importance. To perceive its full force, it will be neceſſary to look back to the firſt dawn of freedom, when the good people of <hi>England,</hi> would no longer ſubmit to have their liberty and property arbitrarily diſpoſed of by the royal fiat. Conſcious of their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they, at firſt, only claimed a privilege of recommending by petition, ſuch meaſures as they might conceive neceſſary for the public good. In this humble form did the ſpirit of liberty firſt appear, while the power of the crown continued for ages almoſt unlimitted in its extent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled in its opperation. But, when an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the true intereſts of the nation, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their manufactures and extended their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, the common people readily ſhook off their ſervile dependence upon their Lords, and gladly embraced an opportunity of acquiring that afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of riches which was the firmeſt foundation of their future liberty. Thoſe, whoſe ſituation had lately been that of the moſt abject vaſſallage, now ſuddenly found themſelves raiſed, by their own induſtry, to the poſſeſſion of wealth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence. Proud of ſuch valuable and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant acquiſitions, they only waited for that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which was the child of time and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to direct their ſteps in the purſuit of meaſures which were to eſtabliſh the moſt ſolid ſecurity
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010986_0021_0F852F0897643860"/>
for that liberty and property which they had ſo lately acquired.</p>
            <p>Before ſcience extended her happy influence over this riſing nation, their progreſs in the paths of liberty was but ſlow and irregular—interrupted by events which they were too ſhort ſighted to foreſee, and obſtructed by revolutions which no human prudence could prevent. But, when their acquiſition of knowledge, from a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful examination of the paſt, enabled them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to regulate the preſent, but even to penetrate into the remote regions of future contingency, every revolving year furniſhed them with ſome opportunity to improve and enlarge their ſyſtem of liberty. With every aſſiſtance which human wiſdom could beſtow, ſupported by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ages, they have at laſt fixed the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their freedom upon ſuch principles as will forever ſtand the teſt of the moſt critical exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Careful to guard thoſe bleſſings for which they had ſo induſtriouſly laboured, they eſtabliſhed this as a fundamental maxim—that no new regulation could be framed, nor any old law abrogated but by the <hi>general conſent</hi> of the nation.

            <p>That right honourable and worthy gentleman who exerted his extenſive influence to ward off from the devoted colonies that blow which would have effected their immediate ruin, has been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make theſe declarations in our favour.—<hi>They are the ſubjects of this</hi> kingdom, <hi>equally entitled with ourſelves to all the</hi> natural rights <hi>of mankind, and the peculiar privileges of </hi> Engliſhmen, <hi>equally bound by the laws, and equally participating of its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>I have the higheſt veneration for the character and abilities of Mr. Pitt, and ſcarcely dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge myſelf in a train of reaſoning, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently points out to me the moſt ſtriking incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in the ſenſe of his ſpeech in January, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on American affairs. From the beſt evidence which I am capable of receiving, I cannot but be clearly convinced that our liberty muſt be only ideal, and our privileges chimerical, while the omnipotence of parliament can <q>bind our trade, confine our manufactures, and exerciſe every power whatever except that of taking money out of our pockets without our conſent.</q> If this ſovereign power, which they ſo warmly aſſert, ſhould be once tamely conceded, to what trifling purpoſe have we exerted ourſelves in our glorious oppoſition to the Stamp-act. At beſt we have but put the evil day a far off.—We have not combated the reality, but the mode of oppreſſion, we have only gained a temporary reprieve, 'till ſome future miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with as little virtue and more abilities than Mr. G—, ſhall think proper to employ this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded legiſlative power for the horrid purpoſe of reducing three millions of people to a ſtate of abject ſlavery.</p>
            <p>If our ſovereign lords, the commons of England, have been led, by their abſurd jealouſly and envious partiality, under the direction of a raſh and impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic miniſter, to ſtrike ſo bold a ſtroke at both our liberty and property, what danger may we not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from the ſame ſelfiſh principles, when they may be influenced by the deep laid ſchemes of ſome able ſtateſman? Under ſuch pernicious influence the chains of America may be forged and rivited on, while her incautious ſons are lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a ſtate of ſecurity. The power of taxation
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010986_0028_0F852F0DD0D7D808"/>
given up to their ſpirited oppoſition, the exceſs of their joy will not ſuffer them to indulge any gloomy reflections upon that <hi>dangerous reſerve</hi> of <hi>legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The preſent evil averted, the warmth of their ſanguine diſpoſitions will not allow them to think that oppreſſion may return at any other time, or in any other form. Their very gratitude and humility prevent their enquiring into a cauſe of the laſt importance. In the higheſt exultation of heart at a conceſſion ſcarcely expected, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as a matter of <hi>favour</hi> what they demanded as a matter of <hi>right,</hi> and, to avoid an appearance of arrogance in urging any new demands, they neglect the diſcharge of the moſt eſſential duties to themſelves and their poſterity. Perhaps they will ſcarcely thank the man who ſhall endeavour to convince them, that the ſimple power of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may as effectually ruin the colonies as that of taxation.</p>
            <p>Let us borrow and improve upon a thought of our greateſt enemy. Mr. G—tells us that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> and <hi>external taxes</hi> are the ſame in <hi>effect,</hi> and differ but in name. Mr. Pitt has indeed treated this opinion with ſo little attention, that he has only anſwered it by a general aſſertion, that <hi>there is a plain diſtinction between taxes levied for the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, and duties impoſed for the regulation of trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plain as this diſtinction is, my moſt induſtrious enquiries have not yet led me to it; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think with Mr. G—, that they are the ſame <hi>in effect.</hi>—The one is preciſely determined, while the other is more uncertain and eventual; but, in proportion to the ſum raiſed, the effect will be exactly the ſame. It is taken for granted that the collection of a ſtamp duty would drain
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010986_0029_0F852F11ADC8D728"/>
us of all the ſpecie which we receive as a balance in our Weſt-India trade. If any exorbitant duty laid upon ſugar and molaſſes produces the ſame effect, in what does the difference conſiſt? By either means the treaſury of England will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with the whole profit of our labour, and we ourſelves ſhall be reduced to that deplorable ſtate of poverty, of which we have, at this very moment, a moſt affecting inſtance. General as the calamity is now become, there are few ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed as not to know that the power of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has done all this miſchief, without any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from that of taxation. The ſevere reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions impoſed upon our trade, have made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable for us to anſwer every foreign demand, and, at the ſame time reſerve a ſufficient ſtock to keep up that circulation of property ſo neceſſary to the well being of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Involved in heavy debts, without any proſpect of diſcharging them—in want of the neceſſaries of life, without the means of acquiring them, the very politic Mr. G—has furniſhed us with the moſt intereſting facts to prove the truth of his doctrine. As great an enemy as he may be to the colonies, he has at leaſt kindly beſtowed upon them the moſt irrefragable proof that internal and external taxes are the ſame in effect; and that they may be as effectually ruined by the powers of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation as by thoſe of taxation.</p>
            <p>When the parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> arrogate to themſelves this ſovereign juriſdiction over the colonies, I ſhould be glad to know on what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they found their claim. Do they ground their pretenſions on the excellent principles of their own conſtitution, or is this ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a power <hi>virtually inherent</hi> in the name of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010986_0030_0F852F125E4724F8"/>
parliament? A name which ſhould remind them of their original ſtate of humility, when the diſtinguiſhing power which they boaſted was priviledge of <hi>ſpeaking their mind</hi> and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating their grievances. The Lords indeed may, with ſome appearance of reaſon, aſſert a ſupreme juriſdiction over the whole body of the nation, as the higheſt court of judicature: But when an aſpiring member of the Commons Houſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declares that he has a power to bind our trade, and reſtrain our manufactures, I ſhould be glad to know whether he derived this power from the honeſt freemen his conſtituents, or whether he acquired it by virtue of his office? From his conſtituents he could receive no more power than they <hi>naturally poſſeſſed;</hi> and, from his office he cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed veſted with any other authority, than that of deciding upon the formalities, and punctilios annexed to it.</p>
            <p>To graſp at a juriſdiction ſo infinitely extenſive, and ſo little capable of limitation, is expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that, from the antiquity of their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, they are become ſovereigns of the new-diſcovered world. Upon ſuch arbitrary principles muſt they ground their unreaſonable pretenſions; ſince no man in his ſenſes will aſſert that an inhabitant of <hi>Birmingham</hi> or <hi>Mancheſter</hi> has a <hi>natural right,</hi> after having obtained the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Crown, to reſtrain, and prevent an induſtrious ſettler of the colonies from engaging in thoſe particular manufactures which may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the buſineſs of his own profeſſion. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as this aſſertion is, either this muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or one full as pregnant with abſurdity; ſince one may with as much reaſon ſuppoſe this <hi>natural ſuperiority</hi> in the freemen of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:010986_0031_0F852F1364BB3E78"/>
as this <hi>acquired ſovereignty</hi> in the collective body of their repreſentatives. Whatever reaſons they may deviſe to ſupport this extraordinary claim, the motives to their uſurpation are clearly evinced in that part of Mr. Pitt's ſpeech, where he ſays—<q>if the legiſlative power of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> over <hi>America</hi> ceaſes to be ſovereign and ſupreme, I would adviſe every gentleman to ſell his lands and embark for that country.</q> A jealous fear, that, from the many natural advantages which we poſſeſs, we may, in ſome future age, rival our envious brethren in ſtrength and riches, has urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to exerciſe a piece of Ottoman policy, by ſtrangling us in our infancy. When we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the nature of thoſe fears which have already proved ſo fatal to our intereſt, the ſlighteſt examination ſhews them as contemptible and ill-grounded as were ever entertained by the moſt ſelfiſh of mankind.</p>
            <p>Had not this refined policy of our <hi>Britiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi> interfered, and rouſed us to attention, we ſhould, in all human probability, have continued for many centuries the faithful drudges of our indulgent mother; and <hi>Great-Britain</hi> would have increaſed in ſtrength and riches in proportion to the population of her colonies. While our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce continued unreſtrained we ſhould induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly have cultivated every branch of it, that we might be enabled to pay punctually to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that balance which would every year increaſe; ſince our attention to the ſettling an immeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extent of country, would effectually prevent our eſtabliſhing ſuch manufactories as would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with the neceſſaries of life.</p>
            <p>Had I ſufficient information to enter into a minute detail of facts, I believe it would be no
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010986_0032_0F852F1416D00AC8"/>
difficult matter to prove, that, in the courſe of our moſt ſucceſsful commerce, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> receives nine-tenths of the profit, whilſt we are humbly contented with being well fed and clothed as the wages of our labour.</p>
            <p>If this inferiority be the conſequence of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable connection, why would they wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to a ſtate of abject dependence? Or, if with the advantages which they already poſſeſs, a fair unlimited trade would bring into their hands all the ſpecie which we could draw from the Weſt-Indies, why would they wantonly uſe ſuch deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſures as they have lately purſued, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſame purpoſe?</p>
            <p>If the preſent ſevere ſyſtem of politics be the reſult of unreaſonable jealouſy; I will venture to aſſert that this very policy will counteract its own intention. Their diſtreſſes firſt led the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts into enquiries concerning the nature of their political ſituation, and the juſtice of the treatment which they had received. That ignorance which has kept them in a ſtate of peaceable ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, fled before their eager reſearches after that information which was ſo eſſentially neceſſary to the preſervation of their liberty. Enraged to find, that, while they had been amuſed with the ſpecious title of fellow ſubjects, and flattered with the rights of <hi>Britiſh</hi> freemen, they were in reality treated as infants in policy, whoſe every motion was to be directed by the arbitrary will of their jealous parent; when every ſuch direction evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently tended to reduce the one to an abject ſtate of dependence, and to raiſe the other to the moſt <hi>exalted ſuperiority.</hi> That both theſe purpoſes could eaſily have been obtained, by meaſures art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully managed, is not to be doubted, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010986_0033_0F852F14919B7240"/>
but the moſt violent oppreſſion could have rouſed us from our ſtate of ſtupefaction to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per degree of attention. But when our ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was excited by the moſt pointed injuſtice, rage inſtantly ſucceeded that tranquility which had been nouriſhed by our imaginary ſecurity. Warmed with a ſenſe of the injuries which we ſuffered, neither our gratitude nor our fear, could prevent our aſſerting thoſe rights the poſſeſſion of which can alone determine us freemen; and, though we could not but ſee that ſuperiority of power which could <hi>"cruſh us to atoms"</hi> yet could we have found even in the modern hiſtory of Europe ſo many examples for our encouragement, that we ſhould not have deſpaired of aſſiſtance ſufficient to preſerve us from the <hi>worſt of evils.</hi>

            <p>THE advocates for the ſovereignty of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> enumerate amongſt the other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations by which we are bound, the favours which ſhe has conſtantly conferred.

As for the ſupport which
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010986_0034_0F852F1A48017810"/>
they have given us in times of danger, if it did not immediately ariſe from the ſame motive which has produced their other favours, I am ſtill ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that it ſhould even be mentioned by thoſe who have laviſhed ſo much blood and treaſure, for the maintenance of an <hi>imaginary balance,</hi> or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending thoſe who never thanked them for their defence.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſuperficial examination muſt ſerve to convince us that the battles of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> could no where have been fought with ſo much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as in the woods of America; where her troops could be ſupplied with all the neceſſaries of life upon the eaſieſt terms, and, from whence all the money which they expended immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in immenſe payments for the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary importations of her manufacture which the exigencies of the war required.

In affecting this glorious purpoſe, I will venture to mention the aſſiſtance which they received from the provincial troops, as an aid of more importance than is generally allowed. I will even take the liberty to aſſert, that the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, in proportion to their <hi>real ability,</hi> did more for the general cauſe than could reaſonably have been expected, if not more than <hi>Great-Britain</hi> herſelf. This aſſertion I fancy will gain more eredit now than it would have gained ſome time ago; ſince the eyes of the world are at laſt open, and they muſt if they are not wilfully blind, plainly diſcover, that the eſtimates of our wealth which have been received from ignorant or prejudiced
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010986_0035_0F852F1AF2D127C0"/>
perſons, are, in every calculation, groſly errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Theſe miſrepreſentations, which have been ſo induſtriouſly propagated, are very poſſibly the offſpring of political invention, as they form the beſt apology for impoſing upon us burthens to which we are altogether unequal. The eaſy faith which every abſurd information obtained, and the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate meaſures, which were the conſequence of this unreaſonable credulity, muſt ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that while we are within the reach of parliamentary power, we ſhall not be ſuffered to riot in a ſuperfluity of wealth, or to acquire any dangerous degree of ſtrength. Whatever advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages may hereafter preſent themſelves, from an increaſed population or more extended trade, we ſhall never be able to cultivate them to any valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purpoſe; for, how much ſoever we may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ability of acquiring wealth and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the partial views of our ſelfiſh brethren, ſupported by the ſovereignty of parliament, will moſt effectually prevent our enjoying ſuch invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able acquiſitions.</p>
            <p>If any alternation in our ſyſtem of agriculture ſhould furniſh us with a ſufficiency of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary articles for the eſtabliſhment of the moſt valuable manufactories, and an increaſe of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhould enable us to carry them to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage; the manufacturers of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> jealous of ſuch a formidable encroachment, would eaſily obtain the interpoſition of our ſovereign directors; who would very naturally ordain, that we ſhould export our unwrought materials to be laboured by our more ſkilful brethren, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch our ſuperfluous inhabitants in ſearch of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother vacant world: And, if the extent of our commerce ſhould draw into our hands the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010986_0036_0F852F1DB5845CF8"/>
wealth of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the ſame unlimitted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would always carefully provide ways and means for conveying the whole into the treaſury of <hi>England.</hi> Perhaps ſome future <hi>G—lle,</hi> refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the ſyſtem of his predeceſſor, may make the powers of legiſlation anſwer the purpoſes of oppreſſion as effectually as the ſevereſt taxation.</p>
            <p>The meaſures which have already been purſued, almoſt give to conjecture the force of conviction; ſince no man can have been ſo inattentive to the moſt intereſting facts as not to know, that the power of parliament exerted in the ſingle inſtance or reſtraining our trade, has already reduced us to <hi>inconceiveable diſtreſs.</hi> Denied the means of acquiring ſpecie ſufficient for the purpoſes of a general circulation, and limitted in the emiſſion of our paper currency, men of conſiderable real eſtates become unable to anſwer the moſt trifling demands; and, when urged by creditors, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as much perplexed as themſelves, their lands are ſold by execution for leſs than half their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer value. This, as one of the moſt ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, attending the late unſeaſonable exertion of parliamentary power. I have ſelected for obſervation, from a very extenſive catalogue of grievances which it has already produced, and of which we are at this moment moſt ſeverely ſenſible. I am led to a choice of this particular fact, from a conſideration of the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence by which it may poſſibly be attended, ſhould the merchants of England immediately demand a rigid payment of the general balance due to them. It is not an eaſy matter to conceive how much our property may be affected by ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable a demand; ſince the calamity would by a regular connection, extend from the loweſt to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010986_0037_0F852F1E70523188"/>
the higheſt member of ſociety. But as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my intention to enter into a minute detail of facts, I ſhall content myſelf with offering ſuch looſe, deſultory obſervations as may ſerve to direct others in their reſearches after more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation upon this moſt intereſting ſubject. In the further purſuit of this deſign, I ſhall juſt take the liberty to obſerve upon the reſolves of the Commons, of <hi>February</hi> 1766, that the ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which they ſo liberally beſtow upon us, are evidently inconſiſtent with the principles upon which they are ſuppoſed to have voted the repeal of the ſtamp-act.</p>
            <p>From theſe reſolves we may very reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the repeal is more immediately found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>inexpediency</hi> of the act, than upon a conviction that they had exerted an <hi>unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal power.</hi> Had they been willing to allow this act as invaſive of an indiſputable right, they would not ſo ſeverely have cenſured us for our daring oppoſition, and laviſhed ſuch praiſes upon thoſe whoſe ſelfiſh views or ſlaviſh principles made them ſo readily ſubſcribe to the infallibility and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of parliament.—A peaceable ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the firſt attacks of encroaching power, is altogether incompatible with the genius of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! nor could it reaſonably be expected, that in ſuch a ſudden and dangerous invaſion of our moſt ineſtimable rights, the form of oppoſition could be perfectly model'd by the hand of prudence. Violent and precipitate as our meaſures were, they wanted nothing but ſucceſs to ſanctify them; ſince the moſt ſuperficial obſerver cannot but have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that in the political world, right and wrong are merely <hi>arbitrary modes,</hi> totally depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the riſe and fall of contending parties.</p>
            <p>The people of England very juſtly diſſatisfied
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010986_0038_0F852F1F1ECC3F30"/>
with the tyrannic conduct of a weak prince, made the boldeſt ſtruggles for the ſupport of their languiſhing liberty, in their firſt ill directed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts under the unfortunate <hi>Monmouth.</hi> The juſtice of their cauſe could not ſave them from the pains and penalties of <hi>open rebellion:</hi> But when a prince of military abilities gave them his powerful aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they ſuddenly effected the preſervation of their freedom, and diſtinguiſhed ſo important an event by the title of <hi>a glorious revolution;</hi> ſo much influence has ſucceſs, in rating the merit of our political conduct.</p>
            <p>When the committee of the houſe reſolve in the moſt general and expreſſive terms, that the authority of parliament over the colonies is <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and ſupreme in every reſpect whatever,</hi> there is no reaſoning againſt ſo formidable a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſupported by the power of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. We can only remark that the ſame houſe heretofore reſolved to take under their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction, the rights of the people, the privileges of the lords, and the ſovereignty of the crown; and, for a long time maintained this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural uſurpation.</p>
            <p>If they did not ſuffer the paſſions of the man to influence the judgment of the Senator, they would never treat that as a point of honour which ſhould only be conſidered as a matter of right.</p>
            <p>If, upon a cool, diſpaſſionate enquiry, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Commons of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have no <hi>natural or acquired ſuperiority</hi> over the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>America,</hi> they will certainly do us the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to acknowledge this very reaſonable indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and not wickedly endeavour to enſlave millions to promote the honour and dignity of a few ambitious individuals.</p>
            <p>In ſupporting this doctrine of independence, I
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010986_0039_0F852F1FD20933E8"/>
have eſtabliſhed as an incontrovertible truth, this very accurate definition of my Lord C. J. <hi>Hale</hi>—That every act of parliament is a <hi>tripartite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture of agreement between the three eſtates of the kingdom.</hi> If this maxim be not diſputable I very humbly conceive, that every conſequence which I have drawn from it, is fairly and logically deduced; for it cannot, but with the moſt glaring abſurdity, be ſuppoſed, that the parties to theſe political agreements may legally bind thoſe who are not in any wiſe privy to them.</p>
            <p>The very ſpirit of the Engliſh conſtitution requires, that general regulations framed for the government of ſociety, muſt have the ſanction of <hi>general approbation;</hi> and, that no man ſhall be deprived of life, liberty or property, but by the force of thoſe laws to which he has voluntarily ſubſcribed. Theſe principles once acknowledged as the foundation of Engliſh liberty, how can the coloniſts be ſaid to poſſeſs the <hi>natural rights of mankind,</hi> or the <hi>peculiar privileges of Engliſhmen,</hi> while they are every day liable to receive laws framed by perſons ignorant of their abilities—unacquainted with their neceſſities, and evidently influenced by partial motives? If my zeal for the good of my country has not greatly clouded my judgment, I ſtill dare ſo far depend upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which I have eſtabliſhed, as to aſſert, that, while the power of the Britiſh parliament is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>ſovereign and ſupreme in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whatſoever,</hi> the liberty of <hi>America</hi> is no more than a flattering dream, and her privileges delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſhadows.</p>
            <p>While I relate matters of fact, from the beſt evidence which I am capable of receiving, if I have miſrepreſented them, I lie open to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010986_0040_0F852F20C25532D0"/>
and, when I recapitulate the principles from which I have drawn my train of reaſoning, I am not ſo obſtinately attached to my own opinion as to be proof againſt conviction. If I am guilty of any errors in the courſe of this unconnected performance, they muſt be attributed to my not having received ſufficient information, or to my want of ability in uſing the materials which I had acquired. I have never wilfully miſrepreſented a fact, nor deſignedly drawn from it a falacious conſequence. I have not laboured to eſtabliſh any favourite ſyſtem, and, with the vanity of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector, ſupported it at the expence of my veracity.</p>
            <p>But however trifling this performance my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, both my head and my heart have co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in its production, and I really ſat down <q>to write what I thought, not to think what I ſhould write</q>
