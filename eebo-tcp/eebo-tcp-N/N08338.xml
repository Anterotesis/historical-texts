            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>BY way of preface I would offer a word or two to my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in general; but eſpecially to ſuch as were the hearers of the following diſcourſe. I would inform you, that you muſt not expect that it will appear word for word as it was when preached; it being then neither committed to writing or memory; yet the general lead, ſcope and ſubſtance of it is the ſame.—As it is not my method to read my ſermons, as many do, ſo neither do I commit to memory what I deliver, when I come to preach, as I underſtand that ſome do; for I think there is a medium between theſe two extremes, to be preferred before either of them; and that is for a preacher not to depend upon his notes, nor his memory neither, for what he is to deliver in public; and yet be as ſafe, and much more in the way of a bleſſing, than ſuch preachers are, who confine themſelves to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the for ementioned methods. Let a preacher that GOD has prepared for that work, have but the general plan, idea, or platform of his ſermon in his mind, when he is going to preach, with a heart that feels the weight of his ſubject, and the worth of ſouls, and he will not at all be likely to be blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his performances, altho' he has not his ſermon in his notes nor in his memory. However ſtudious and faithful the godly preacher is in private, in order to furniſh himſelf with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meſſage to deliver to the people in public: yet this is certain, that he has not got all the materials in private that contribute much toward the rendering his compoſitions complete and entire. For the godly preacher finds by experience that he has great help

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>in preaching by ſome preſent concurring circumſtances, while in the pulpit. The ſight of his audience, and their different apparent aſpect at preſent, whether ſtupid or affected, with that degree of divine Aſſiſtance that he has a right to expect from the LORD, to carry him through preſent duty, while the holy fervors of his own ſoul are en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>amed and excited by the means of his addreſs to the ſouls of others. Theſe things. I ſay, cannot fail of ſuggeſting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new ideas to the preacher, as he goes along in his work, and of furniſhing of him with abundance of proper matter to ſpeak that he had not tho't of before. So he ought to allow himſelf the liberty to improve the ſame as he paſſes along in his work, which he cannot do, if he confines himſelf to written notes in his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>livery, or to what he has committed to his memory.</p>
            <p>But ſome will be ready to ſay, that this method might do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the preacher was ſure always of having ſpecial aſſiſtance in preaching, but ſeeing he is liable to be left to ſtraitneſs of ſpirit, it is but a point of prudence for him to preach by notes, to prevent boggles and blunders.</p>
            <p>Anſ. I think that the remedy is worſe than the diſeaſe: for, on ſuppoſition that the preacher ſhould be ſometimes left to ſuch ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs of ſpirit that he could not proceed with that freedom as would always be deſirable in the preacher; yet the effect hereof might do him much good; teach humility, and his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ndance on GOD; and learn him the neceſſity of living in the power of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion always, which he finds he needs when he comes to preach. But the bad effect of the remedy plead for is that it is like to keep the preache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtraitned in ſpirit always: For if he can, by the help of his notes, get along one time without ſpecial aſſiſtance in preaching, ſo he can another, and another, and ſo always; which I would repreſent by a ſimilitude, thus: Suppoſe a man was about to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel a journey, but was ſo diſtruſtful of providence, in preſerving his legs through it, that he durſt not ſet out upon them in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as other folks do, but think it a point of prudence to get him a pair of wooden legs, for fear his own would fail; but when he has got them, he travels ſo much upon them, and neglects his own, that, in fine, it proves the very means which cauſes his own legs finally to periſh, ſo that ever afterwards, the man is obliged to uſe his wooden legs, or not go a ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p further. And it ſeems to me, that this is much the caſe with ſome preachers, who, by the gifts of nature and grace, have been conſiderably prepared to be real preachers, had they ventured out upon GOD, in the improvement of their preaching talents; but through timerouſneſs, and diſtruſt of GOD, or in compliance with the cuſtom of reading notes, have
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010648_0003_0F81BD61816BA9A8"/>habituated themſelves ſo to that practice, that their preaching gifts have dried up and periſhed; or, as in the words of the ſimilitude, they uſed wooden legs ſo much when they have better, that final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had nothing better than wooden legs to uſe. Hence it comes to paſs, that ſometimes, when an unexpected providence gives a fair opportunity for a ſermon, it muſt be omitted, to the grief of hundreds, for no other reaſon but this, viz. that the preacher did not happen to have his notes with him.</p>
            <p>But to return: From the hint above given of my method of preaching, the reader may underſtand, that I have took the ſame in writing the following diſcourſe, viz. that having the general plan and lead of it in my mind, fill'd it up, as I went along, with what did naturally occur. The occaſion was ſolemn; the ſubject is ſolemn; and may GOD make the reader ſolemn, think of death, and prepare for it; and then the end of theſe poor labours will be anſwered.</p>

O, now ariſe! ariſe! and reverence the Majeſty, the ſovereign Majeſty of heaven that has done it. Bow! bow, in humility, ſubmiſſion, &amp; reſignation to the holy will of God, that is guided by uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wiſdom, &amp; ſee that by no means you charge God fooliſhly.</p>
            <p>Man that is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and to the ſaints eſpecially, this world is a vale of tears. And what wonder is it that a world ſo full of ſin and rebellion as this world is, ſhould be ſo full of affliction and ſorrow as we ſee it is? yet we have no right to conclude that thoſe who are under the greateſt afflictions, are certainly the greateſt ſinners:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010648_0004_0F81BD618B1D0820"/>the contrary is evident many times: and the reaſon is obvious, viz. this, that this world is not to be the place of rewards and puniſhments, but a ſtate of tryal; and therefore God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations are calculated according thereunto: that is, they are trying, and ſometimes exceedingly ſo. And although God may ſend tryals and afflictions, either in judgment or mercy, upon the wicked, as in his holy ſovereignty he ſees fit; yet to his own children, he has bound himſelf by his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he will correct in meaſure and in mercy, if need be, and for their profit. But yet we find, by the ſcriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e account, that God ſometimes has a two-fold aim in correcting, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trying his own children; as ſometimes for correction, and ſometimes more eſpecially for tryal. For correction, when they fall into any particular ways of rebellion; according to Pſalm 89.30, 31, 32. "If his children forſake my law, and walk not in my judgments, if they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with a rod, and their iniquities with ſtripes." But ſometimes the Lord brings his children under afflictions, more eſpecially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or their tryal, when it is not to correct any ſpecial tranſgreſſion. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd this ſeems to be the caſe with Abraham, when God called him to go and offer up his ſon Iſaac; it was a heavy affliction, and it was ſent for his tryal; to try his faith and obedience. Hence, ſays God to him, in the cloſe of that tryal, "Now I know thou feareſt God ſeeing thou haſt not withh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me." Gen. 22.12. God knew that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham truly feared him before, but here was now an eminent proof and demonſtration of it. And God loves to put the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his children to the tryal; and here Abraham's ſaith was ſo tried and proved, that he is canonized in ſcripture for the eminency of his faith, Heb. 11.19. "Accounting that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead." And this ſeems to be the caſe with Job; he was afflicted grievouſly, but not ſo much for correction (he being conſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entiouſly upright) as for his tryal. As, ſays James, <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord,</hi> Jam. v. 11. The end of the Lord, in afflicting Job, we ſee was to prove the eminency of his patience, baffle and confound the devil in his own ſchemes and propoſals, and in the end to honor and exalt Job (or rather the ſtrength of his own grace in Job) as one of the moſt eminent ſaints left upon divine record. Hence he is ranked among the worthies, as we read of Noah, Daniel and Job, as ſome of the firſt men to ſtand in the gap to keep off God's judgments. And God intending thus to exalt him, ſaw meet firſt to prove him. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Job's afflictions was not ſent ſo much to correct him
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010648_0004_0F81BD618B1D0820"/>as to prove him, is plain from God's own words to ſatan, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Job had rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ived the firſt ſhock of his trials with ſuch compoſure and patience, that in all of it he ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly; ſo that God ſeems to boaſt of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency to ſatan, chap. 2, v. 3. "And the Lord ſaid unto ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil? and ſtill he holdeth faſt his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>egrity, altho' thou movedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe." And we all ſhould, my friends, if poſſible, learn the meaning and deſign of God, when he ſendeth afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether he ſends them for correction or for trial, that we may be in a better circumſtance to anſwer the deſign of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. If our afflictions are ſent for correction, then we ought to repent, reform, and do no more ſo wickedly; but if for tryal, then we ſhould ſee to it that thoſe graces hold out in their exerciſe, to the glory of God, as faith, love, patience, reſignation, ſubmiſſion, &amp;c. that we may, with Job, come forth, as gold brightened by the fire of <hi>affliction.</hi>

            <p>But to return to the words I firſt read: <hi>And it fell upon the</hi> young men, <hi>and</hi> they <hi>are dead.</hi> In theſe words we may note ſeveral things; as,
<list>
                  <item>1. And event is held forth, viz. death: 'tis ſaid, they are dead.</item>
                  <item>2. Who they were, that are ſaid to be dead; which we find they were not aged people, or men of grey hairs; but the young, the young men are dead, viz. Job's children.</item>
                  <item>3. We have here the means of their death held forth, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fall of the houſe. The wind came from the wilderneſs, and ſmote the four corners of the houſe, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead.</item>
                  <item>4. We may note the employment that death found them in, viz. feaſting. They were eating bread and drinking wine in their eldeſt brother's houſe, and perhaps not the leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of death till it come. O! what dying mortals are we! how liable to the ſtroke of death at any time, at any place, and in any employment! O! what need is there of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always ready! for we never know when we are ſafe from the ſtroke of death; but ſometimes, when moſt cautious, moſt expoſed;<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note> and that which we mean to be our protection, may prove the means of our deſtruction, as was the caſe here with Job's children: their houſe they made for their protection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And was not this the caſe with two of the young men now dead? who had been at work in a neighbouring field, and ſeeing the ſtorm ariſing, aim'd to come here to this houſe for ſhelter; but no ſooner were they ſeated in their chairs but death chain'd them down to rife no more.</item>

            <p>And, by the way, what think you, my hearers, concerning death? thoſe of you, in particular, who ſaw the young men (as many of you did) before they were removed from their ſeats, in which they ſat, when the fatal flaſh burnt in two the tow thread of life.

            <p>But what I aim to ſpeak further upon this ſubject, and to improve the preſent opportunity (God willing) to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage I can, is, not to give the character of the dead; but to improve the gloomy, melancholly theme, <hi>DEATH!</hi> which my text leads us to, and the late awful providence fixes our eyes upon, to the benefit of the living; and this is all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we may hope for, from the ſolemn ſcene now before us. The living cannot benefit the dead, but the dead may benefit the living: For that God who can bring light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and meet out of the eater, can alſo bring life out of death: And that this may be the event, in the preſent caſe, ſaints of God, let you cries aſcend to heaven.—I don't feel over critical about a curious method, at preſent; yet ſeeing that ſome one muſt be attempted, let it be the following, viz.</p>
            <list>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010648_0005_0F81BD624B0A81F0"/>
I ſhall not at this time, conſider death all the ways I find the word uſed and applied in ſcripture; but only in this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner. Briefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The loſs of God's moral image in which man was at firſt made; or that ſtate of alienation from God into which mankind are ſunk, by the original apoſtacy, and all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men are yet in, is called death, and men are naturally in a death-ſtate, and <hi>dead while they live,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith the ſcripture, 1 Tim. v. 6. that is ſpiritually dead, while naturally alive; <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Eph. 2.1.</p>
            <p>The true life and happineſs of the rational ſoul does not conſiſt merely in being endowed with ſuch powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as the great Author of human nature has given thereunto, as the <hi>underſtanding, will</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> which are eſſential to the very being and exiſtance of a reaſonable creature; not yet in the ſoul's union to the body. But the true life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the rational ſoul conſiſts in aſpiritual union to God; or a correſponding frame of mind and temper of heart to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repreſentations of the perfections and attributes of God. As a filial fear and reverence of the greatneſs, majeſty and power of God; a firm belief and truſt in the faithfulneſs and promiſes of God; an humble dependance on the all-ſufficient fullneſs of God; a cheerful and hearty compliance with the will of God, and an holy delight in the purity and moral beauty of the divine nature, &amp;c. In theſe things conſiſts the true life of the ſoul; and as it was ſaid of Adam in his firſt creation, he become a living ſoul, it was true in this ſenſe, his ſoul was alive, ſpiritually, having theſe correſponding diſpoſitions of ſoul towards God, co-natural with his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But alas! by the fall, how is the gold become dim! yea, become braſs; for the moſt fine gold is changed; the image and life of God removed, and the image of ſatan and death introduced. For who don't ſee, that ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any thing ſpiritually, that there are none of theſe right diſpoſitions of mind toward God, naturally to be found in mankind? Since <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he fall, men are naturally ſo far from the true reverential fear of God, in heart, that they are rather inclined to ſay in their hearts, that there is no God, Pſal. 14.1. And inſtead of being inclined to truſt in the faithfulneſs of God, mankind are more inclined to truſt in lies and falſhood, Jer. 13, 25. And inſtead of depending upon the all-ſufficient fullneſs of God, natural men had rather depend on ciſterns, yea, broken ciſterns that can hold no water. Jer. 2, 13. and inſtead of loving God for his purity and holineſs, that is, the very thing upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which they hate him ſo mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly as they do, that their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010648_0006_0F81BD630E808A28"/>minds are very enmity in the abſtract, Rom. 8.7. And inſtead of loving God's laws, and cheerfully complying with his will they ſay in plain terms, that they will not have this man to rule over them, Luke 19, 14. O! what a ſad and awful death-ſtate are natural men in! this ſpiritual death is a thouſand fold greater calamity and heavier judgment than merely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death. And all of you, my heaters, that are yet in your natural ſtate, are thus dead; and by reaſon of this ſpiritual death, you are more deformed, loathſome and naucious in the eyes of the holy God, than theſe corpſe are in your eyes, by means of natural death. And ſhall the ſight of three dead corpſes this day, fetch tears from many of your eyes, and ſhall not the conſideration of ſo many dead ſouls as we have amongſt us, fetch groans from none of your hearts? if not, it ſeems it muſt be becauſe the dead are burying the dead.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſtate and condition that the wicked ſhall be placed and fixed in after this life, and eſpecially after the judgment day, is called death. And death, in this ſenſe conſidered is of a very comprehenſive ſignification, including all evil in it, even compleat deſtruction. Hence it is called the ſecond death, yea, eternal death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The diſſolving the union between ſoul and body, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death; and here the word is to be underſtood in its moſt natural and obvious meaning, that every one knows what is meant by death, in this ſenſe of the word, tho' few conſider, as they ought, the conſequences of it. And death, in this latter ſenſe of it, with ſome of its important conſequences, is what now lies before us, which my text, and the preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence calls unto the conſideration of. When the meſſengers bro't us the late awful news, that the young men were dead, that three were killed with one clap of thunder, or awful flaſh of lightning, the melancholly ideas were ſoon catched by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; none aſk for information what is meant by death, for all expect, all know, that death turns the ſprightly, active youth into a gaſtly, breathleſs corpſe, which evidently ſhews that the heavy, leaden hand of death has cloſed the eyes for time, and chain'd in ſilence the nimble tongue as long, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d has ſo marr'd the beauty of the whole ſtructure, that the moſt tender relative can't endure the awful ſpectacle, but is ready to cry with Abraham, concerning his once beautiful Sarah, Let me bury my dead out of my ſight, Gen. 23, 4. A few of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſequences of death, I would here mention. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Immediately upon the diſſolving of the union between ſoul and body, there is an everlaſting parting with a worldly enjoyments. It is a ſad effect of the apoſtacy that mankind
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010648_0006_0F81BD630E808A28"/>purſue the world ſo greedily, and ſeize upon its enjoyments ſo eagerly, as if true happineſs conſiſted herein, or as if they would laſt forever, and were durable and permanent good. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worldly enjoyments are ſleeting in the nature and deſign of them, yea, they are always on the wing, ready for their flight; but if they halt a few moments by the command of heaven, bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd mortals think that they will always ſtay, and look for no higher nor better good; yea, neglect the higher, better, and only good, for the fake of theſe things. And the worldly heart of fallen man will be contriving how to make bed of reſt among the ſmiling charmes of creature delights; but, alas! to his ſurprize, before he has got compoſed upon his a bed of eaſe, he is all on a ſudden ſummon'd immediately to appear in the eternal world! But this will not ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the reſt of the worldly tribe to ſeek a better good, but cheated with ſome deluſion, worldly hearts will preſume upon laſting happineſs from worldly things; even againſt ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand informations &amp; warnings to the contrary. But I ſay, death will put an end to all theſe enjoyments. O! how ſhort liv'd are they! O! how ſoon is the bubble broke! what a panick might this ſtrike thro' the heart of all worldlings, who have their portion in this life, <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee, then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be?</hi> Luke 12, 20. At death there will not only be a parting, but an everlaſting parting with worldly enjoyments; for the ſaints in heaven will have a better, a full, and an eternal ſupply, without theſe things; and altho' the damn'd in hell will be in eternal want, yet worldly enjoyments would not releive them, ſuppoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey might have them; but have they muſt not, ſhall not, no, not ſo much as a drop of water to cool their tormented tongues. It ſeems that this conſideration ſhould moderate our purſuit of this world's goods, and excite us to ſecure a more laſting happineſs. O, labour not ſo much for the meat which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſheth, but more for that which endureth to everlaſting life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another important conſequence of death is, a final end to all means of grace: an end to all means, helps, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of preparing for our future and eternal ſtate, God has wonderfully diſtinguiſhed the fallen race of man, from the ſinning angels; them he reſerved in chains, under darkneſs, to the judgment of the great day. But the ſovereign mercy and grace of God hath interpoſed in the behalf of poor fallen man,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By providing a Mediator. For, without this, there would have been no more hope for fallen man, than for devils,</p>
            <p n="2">2. In granting a repreive to mankind, longer or ſhorter, according to the ſovereign pleaſure, and in this ſpace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010648_0007_0F81BD6491DFF168"/>to afford means of grace; as the written word, a preached goſpel, the Liberty of the throne of grace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And becauſe mankind are ſo averſe to the way of life and ſo entirely under the power of ſin, that meerly external means are inſufficient to prevail upon any of the fallen race truly to return to God, in the ways of the goſpel; therefore, over and above theſe external means, God is ſending down the influences of his holy ſpirit, to ſtrive with ſinners, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the outward means, and make them effectual to ſound converſion, and conſequently to eternal ſalvation. And O! what wonders of mercy are here, which the fallen angels ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had!</p>
            <p>And thus mankind come into the world, under the guilt of their original apoſtacy, and the curſe of the broken law; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved by the mercy of God only for a few uncertain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſovereign wiſdom ſees fit, with the means of grace in their hands, which, if not rightly improved, and truly complied with, will aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dly aggravate their eternal miſery. And O! what an awful and critical ſituation are mankind then in! and how reaſonable is it to expect that rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in our circumſtances, ſhould be engaged to the utmoſt degree, in improving the day and means of grace! Methinks this ſhould be the language of one and all, of one to another. "O! the infinite mercy of God, in providing a Mediator for us, and thro' him, has open'd a door of hope, and is now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording means of grace, and giving us an opportunity to make our peace with God! Come, come, O! come, let us enter while there is room, and before the Maſter of the houſe riſes up, and ſhuts too the door of mercy. Behold! now is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time, and day of ſalvation, and let us improve it. Let us ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. Let us ſeek firſt the kingdom of God, and mind the one thing needful; and agree with our Adverſary quickly, while we are in the way with him, and have means, and an opportunity ſo to do. O! let us cry mightily to the Lord, and who can tell but that he will turn away his wrath, that we periſh not."—I ſay, one might reaſonably expect that ſuch would be the language, and ſuch the conduct of rational creatures, in our circumſtances: but, alas! how reverſe of all this do we find the practice of men! inſtead of a thankful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Another important conſequence of death is, that it puts an end to all opportunity of performing, and diſcharging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative duties. It is of great importance that relative duties are faithfully diſcharged; ſuch as parents owe to children, and children to parents, rulers to ſubjects, and ſubjects to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, miniſters to their people, and people to their miniſters, &amp;c. The honor of God, the intereſt of religion, and the good and welfare of the riſing generation depend much hereupon. But, O! what ſad neglects here! and why? Why time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough yet, all are too apt to plead. The parent don't intend to die ſo, nor that his child <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hall neither, in ſuch awful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of religion, and ſoul concern; and the miniſter in ends by and by to be more thoro' with his people; and all hope to diſcharge relative duties, in a future period, in a better manner than at preſent they do. But alas! ſudden death comes and puts a ſtop to all—think of this, you that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="4">4. Another important conſequence of death is, that it unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably fixes the ſoul for eternity, either in weal or wo, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery to change no more. 'Tis true there may and will be ſome circumſtantial alteration, that the ſoul will meet with after death: as union to the body at the reſurrection, &amp; the ſaints happineſs will be progreſſive, and the miſery of the damned (perhaps) thro' eternity. But there will be no chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from happineſs to miſery, or from miſery to happineſs, but in this reſpect, as the tree falls ſo it lies, &amp; will eternally. But this world in which we now live is a changing world, and bleſſed be God that it is (wo to all the wicked if it were not) for among other changes, a ſaving change may poſſibly be met with in this world, but not in the next; he that is there found filthy, muſt remain ſo ſtill, and ſtill, and ſtill eternally; and he that is holy ſhall remain ſo as long. O, Beloveds! look before you leap, for the leap is for eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed to ſpeak a word briefly to the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral head propoſed, viz. <hi>That even young men in the bloom of youth, are liable to be cut down by the ſtroke of death.</hi> This is confirmed abundantly if we conſult either ſcripture or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation, and is ſo evident, that in words none will deny it, altho' in practice, it ſeems as if there were but few that did really believe it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſcriptures are full to this point; the text we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tells us, the young men are dead; and Luke tells us of a certain young man that was carried out dead, the only ſon of his mother, Luke 7. And ſays Job, one dieth in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet, his breaſts are full of milk, and his bones moiſtened with marrow, Job 21, 23, 24. But I ſhall not ſtand to multiply inſtances of this nature, given in ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is evident to, and by commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> obſervation abundantly. How many youth have we known in our day, that have been cut down by the ſtroke of death? ſome at home, ſome abroad, ſome by ſudden death, ſome by a lingering ſickneſs, ſome fall in battle, ſome are waſted by the wartery waves on a ſudden to the ſhore of eternity, and others, quick as the lightning's flaſh, fly from this world to the next, as on blazing wings of fire. Oh! there is but a ſtep acroſs from the road where the young walk, in the days of youth, to their eternal home, in the other world; and how many are there in youth that take this ſtep! how many youth are cut acroſs and ſoon get home, and never travel round by the way of grey hairs, and old age
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010648_0008_0F81BD65470053F0"/>for it? and it is too evident, that youth are liable to the ſtroke of death, to ſtand longer upon this point. But this is not all. Therefore I proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That youth are not only liable to be cut down by the ſtroke of death, <hi>but by a ſudden ſtroke, without one minute's warning, as to the time when.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſtrange thing is here, and yet how common too! for all to have warnings, a thouſand warnings of death's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and yet ſo many die without the leaſt warning; death not miſtruſted to be near, until he's done his work, ſtruck the fatal blow and fled. The old world had an hundred and twenty years warning of the flood, and yet were ſwept away ſuddenly by it at laſt. For, ſays Matthew, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage and knew not until the flood came and took them all away, Mat. 24.38, 39. And ſo it was with Sodom, and ſo it will be at the end of the world, and ſo it is with reſpect to particular deaths; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the warnings of its approach; how often do people cry peace and ſafety, until ſudden deſtruction in this ſenſe, comes upon them. But if you want a further proof of this awful point, viz. <hi>That youth are liable to be cut down by a ſudden ſtroke of death, without one minutes warning, as to the time when,</hi> the late awful providence that has called us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time, is a full demonſtration. For if by the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word ſhall be ſtabliſhed, then we have a competent number of witneſſes this day to bear teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to the preſent truth; and ſuch they are too, whoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity in their teſtimony, won't ſo much as admit of diſpute; for altho' they are dead, yet they ſpeak, and ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>dly too, and more effectually to the preſent point than the living can. And what ſay you my hearers? if you won't believe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the living, which God ſends you, dare you reject the teſtimony of the dead? Dives tho't in hell, if one might be ſent from the dead, his teſtimony would be believed. But, dear youth, God is ſending you, not only a ſinge, but a triple teſtimony from the dead, that greatly concerns you all, and will you not believe it? don't their witneſſes all agree? don't they ſpeak the ſame thing? don't they ſpeak truth? don't they ſpeak important truth? don't they ſpeak loud, loud as the voice of thunder? did you ever hear the voice of thunder loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? And yet, if you are deaf, and cannot hear, this day, God bids you look and ſee; that if you won't believe your ears, believe your eyes, and know that you are mortal.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Uſe firſt of information. Hence learn, how abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is, even for young people to be truly religious. There is a prevalent diſpoſition naturally in young people, to put off religion for the preſent, thinking there is time enough yet, and that it is not a buſineſs ſuitable to their age. Young people think it beſt for old folks, who have as it were one foot in the grave, of very age, to be religious, think of death, and prepare for it; but are very apt, in their tho'ts to exempt themſelves from any preſent neceſſity of ſetting about the work and buſineſs of religion in good earneſt. But O youth! youth! learn here how preſumptuous is your practice! true it is, that old people muſt die; but then it is as true that young people may die, and often do, when the old are ſpared: And a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtance of this nature, has been ſeen now, in this late ſurprizing providence. When death came amongſt us ſudden, and in this awful manner ſlung his darts, cut down three, at one inſtantaneous ſtroke, was it becauſe there was no aged people in the town, that the young were taken? or was it becauſe there was no aged people in the neighbourhood? nay further, was it becauſe there was no elderly people in the houſe then at the ſame time, when the young ſell victims to the rage of death? no, ſurely; for altho' ſeveral elderly people then were preſent, yet they were paſs'd by, yea, protected in the very jaws of death! one in ſpecial, aged almoſt to an hundred years, ſitting ſide by ſide as it were free among the dead, in about, the ſpace of three ſeet of the ſlain, yet eſcaped unhurt, untouch'd. So that here, dear youth, you may ſee your age is no defence againſt the ſtroke of death; nor have you any certainty that the aged muſt die firſt. O then, if you may die before the aged; if you may die in youth, and if you may die by a ſudden ſtroke, without a minute's warning as to the time when; how neceſſary it is for you always to be prepared? or, in other words, to be truly religious? and all of you, that are old enough to reflect upon theſe things, ought without farther delay, to lay the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to heart, free to Chriſt for refuge, and make your peace with God, get into, and live in, an actual readineſs for death; then let it come, it cannot hurt you; yea, let it come ever ſo ſuddenly, it can then do you no hurt, for to die will be gain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may hereby further learn, what is a ſufficient apology, for a young man or maiden to make, in their own defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſcoffing age, for becoming ſerious, godly, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010648_0009_0F81BD695AB382A0"/>die ſuddenly, as others have, without a minute's warning, of the time when; and therefore you count it prudent, wiſe and ſafe, to be always ready, always religious: and if earth won't approve this for an anſwer, heaven will: this will be approved of as wiſe in the hour of death, and at the day of judgment.

and delays, deceived them down to flames! and this will be your fate too,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010648_0010_0F81BD6A087FE740"/>my hearers, if you venture but a little longer to tread their ſteps. But that, by the bleſſing of God, I may excite you, one and all of you, immediately to ſet about, in good earneſt, the buſineſs that relates to the everlaſting welfare of your ſouls, I would, for your conſideration, lay a few things before you, by way of motive, to excite you hereunto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider that it is all owing to the meer mercy, free and ſovereign grace of God, that you have any ſpace, means and opportunity to make your peace with God, prepare for death, and the eternal world. Devils never had it, and were it not for ſovereign mercy, man had never had it neither.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, that the ſpace and opportunity that you have to prepare for death, at longeſt wont be long; and for aught you know, it may end with you before the ſetting ſun.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, if you ſhould, any of you, neglect the only ſeaſon which God will allow you to prepare for death in, as it is awfully to be feared you will, then, when it is too late, you'll curſe yourſelf, and your folly for't, eternally in hell. And the Devil, who tempts you now, all he can, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o delay your ſoul concerns, flattering you that there is time enough yet, will then inſult you for a fool, for hearkening to his lies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider how dear it coſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that ſalvation that is offered to you in the goſpel; yea, the day and means of grace he purchaſed at a dear rate for ſinners. Hence Chriſt is ſaid to be the Saviour of all men; that is, ſo far as they are ſaved, he is their Saviour. If ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have a temporary ſalvation, a ſhort ſpace of reprieve from the execution of the threatened ſentence againſt ſin; and if they have life, and the comforts of life a while; all this is owing to Chriſt, and it is meer mercy, which the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner don't deſerve: but eſpecially if we conſider ſinners as favoured with the means of grace, and offers of eternal life, it is owing to Chriſt, for he purchaſed that life, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is offered.</p>
            <p>And can you, my hearers, take the common bleſſings of life, purchaſed at ſo dear a rate, and conſume them upon your luſts? can you waſte away the day of grace, in purſuing this world, and the vain pleaſures of this life? And can you, dare you trample under foot the great ſalvation offered to you in the goſpel? Theſe favours were purchaſed with a price infinitely more worth than the whole world; not with ſuch corruptible things as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God. If all the meer men on earth, and all the angels in heaven, had laid down their lives, to have purchaſed theſe favours for ſinners, the price had been too
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010648_0011_0F81BD6B4AEC9D98"/>low, and rejected as inſufficient, Therefore hearken, O ſinner, and hear! I will ſpeak a dreadful word unto you, yet a truth, an awful truth, which you will find ſo one day; that if you continue to live as you liſt, and conſume thoſe dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought favours upon your luſts, and waſte away the golden ſeaſon of grace, and flight and reject the offers of Chriſt and ſalvation: that you will have a moſt dreadful, aggravated condemnation, in the end, when God ſhall come to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition for blood, and no common and ordinary blood nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but this precious blood of Chriſt, the guilt of which will be found under your ſkirts; for you will then be counted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the betrayers and murderers of Chriſt, who were not content with his once being crucified by the Jew? and Romans; but by your ſins you have been all your life long crucifying of him afreſh, and putting him to open ſhame. And where will your doom or portion be in the coming world? among the <hi>Sodomites?</hi> no, verily, but leagues below them, in the regions of darkneſs and woe, if not below devils themſelves, for ſurely they never were guilty of ſuch crimes.</p>
            <p>Conſider further, O ſinner! that once, when David's three worthies put their lives in their hands, and broke through the hoſts of the Philiſtines, to fetch him ſome water he long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; yet when they brought it, and David come to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how they expoſed their lives to get it for him, it wrought ſo upon his compaſſions, he could not bear to drink it, but poured it out before the Lord. But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt not only put his life in his hand, that is, expoſed his life; but he actually laid down his life O ſinner! to purchaſe all theſe favors you enjoy, and can you ſeize upon them greedily, not regarding the price? can you be laviſh of that which is the price of blood, and yet never think of him that bled? O! where is your ingenuity! O! vile ingratitude!</p>
            <p>Think again, how contrary is your conduct in meer world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs, and how much more wiſe and prudent? how choice and ſaving are you of that which is very dear and coſtly, of a worldly nature? if you have any thing that is uncommonly dear and coſtly, you are not wont to uſe and diſpoſe of it as you be of cheap, common and ordinary things. And if you were as wiſe in ſpirituals, O! how careful would you be to huſband your time well, and make the beſt uſe of the means of grace poſſible; and improve all earthly enjoyments with reſelence to death and the eternal world.</p>
            <p>Once more, under this head, conſider that you muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God for all theſe dear articles, if you abuſe them, or don't improve them as God requires. God don't give theſe
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010648_0011_0F81BD6B4AEC9D98"/>favours abſolutely out and out, to ſinners, and there's to be an end; no, no; but only conditionally. If a ſinner does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove well the favours he enjoys in this world, and as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him to do, he is welcome to them all, and eternal life to boot; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut if he don't, he muſt anſwer for them all. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinners muſt give an account of their ſtewardſhip by and by; and, O! what a dreadful an account it will be that they will have to give, when it will be made to appear, that they have waſted their Lord's goods, dear and coſtly goods, the invoice, the book of God, tells us the price was infinite. And, O dreadful! what do you think ſinner, of having ten thouſand talents, in fair articles bro't in againſt you at the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning day, and at the ſame time you have nothing to pay? and for want thereof, the body muſt be taken, and the ſoul too, and caſt into the priſon of hell, untill you pay the debt; <hi>Verily thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, untill thou haſt paid the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing,</hi> Mat. 5.26. Therefore, O ſinner, as free and as laviſh as you are, with the favours and bounties of heaven, as tho' they were cheap and common things: I tell you, that the time will come, that you will think their price is really dear, whate'er you think of it now. And as ſoft and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as theſe mercies are at preſent, while their ſilent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is, enjoy and welcome, if you'll love and ſerve the giver; yet if abuſed, by and by they'll harden into ſteel, and ſharpen into ſwords, and viſit you again in another form, and in a ſtern, unrelenting manner, demand ſatisfaction, for their abuſe, in all the ſeverity of ſtrict juſtice. There is not a mercy come from heaven, to the ſons of men, but what will return thither again, with a true account, how they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, how entertained, how improved, and by whom. Time, precious time will complain, Lord, I was abuſed and murdered by ſuch and ſuch perſons, and improved wholly to wrong purpoſes: ſabbaths complain, Lord, we were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned by ſuch and ſuch who were weary of us, and longed to have us gone, we being tedious and but thenſome company to them: the bible will complain of being neglected; ſermons of being ſlighted; invitations of being refuſed; conſcience of being ſtifled, and brow beat, and counteracted; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſpirit rejected, and the holy Spirit often grieved, &amp;c. Now theſe will be bitter complaints alledged againſt goſpel deſpiſing, and Chriſt rejecting ſinners; and they will awake the divine reſentment, to the higheſt pitch; and God will ſay, go viſit them again with full commiſſion to ſeek ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and revenge for ſuch groſs abuſe, &amp; heaven daring ingratitude. O ſinner, think of this! the time is coming, that the ſight of the many mercies that you have received and

            <p n="5">5. Conſider how many and great are the helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that God is affording you now, in order that you might get prepared for death. And among the reſt of the many precious means and helps that you have, this awful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, God has now come forth to us in, might be a very great help to you in this weighty affair, would you improve it as you ought. For now you are ſolemnized. Now the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and vanity of your minds is check'd. 'Tis very evident by your countenances, that you have no diſpoſition for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent frolick; and it may be ſome of you think you never ſhall have again. But O, your deceitful hearts! if you don't get them truly changed by renewing grace, will turn to their old courſe, and run as ſwift in the channel of former vanity as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Therefore now it ſeems, is your time, if you have any ſpiritual prudence at all, and intend ever to make your peace with God, now ſet about the work in earneſt, while the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this providence is not worn off. It ſeems that your hardneſs, blindneſs and ſtupidity has been ſo great, that you have obliged the Almighty, as I may ſay, to ſpeak in an unuſual manner to you. Had you been all obedient to the gentle voice of mercy, in the loving invitations of the goſpel, and the ſweet whiſpers of the Spirit; doubtleſs this awful voice of thunder might have been ſpared. For will the lion roar in vain, and when there is no cauſe? And upon whoſe account, my hearers, do you think it is, that God has come thus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly amongſt us? deck'd himſelf with thunder, &amp; cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in flames, and as with a puff of his fiery breath, has on a ſudden blew out the candle of life in three inſtances among us; while others ſcorch'd and ſtun'd, did, as it were
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010648_0012_0F81BD6C08B1E038"/>miraculouſly eſcape. I ſay, for whoſe ſake do you think that all this is done? do you think it was merely for the ſake of the dead? if you do, I think your thoughts are criminal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. No, no, my friends, for our ſakes, for the ſake of the living, doubtleſs are theſe awful deaths ſent. And as we had a high hand in bringing down this diſpenſation, God has an errand to us herein, we may conclude, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And what is it? Why the language is, turn, turn to God, turn to God or die. And what ſay you my hearers, will you hear? will you hear turn and live, or will you go on and die? Altho' there may ſeem great ſeverity in this diſpenſation, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to thoſe on whom ſeverity fell; yet it may be ſent in mercy, in great mercy to us who are ſpared, and ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warned; and it will be ſo in the event, if we improve it right.

O may the good Lord forbid! yet I am afraid it will, with reſpect to many of you. I am afraid you won't improve this providence ſo as to get any laſting good by it. But if you would be wiſe for yourſelves, wiſe for your ſouls, and wiſe for eternity: now is your time, dear youth, when God is calling you ſo loudly. If you wont hear a loud call, this loud call, what will you hear? Common and ordinary calls, it ſeems won't do the turn, won't prevail with you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, to turn to God; and if this extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common call wont prevail upon you neither, what will? And this may not only be the loudeſt, but it may alſo be the laſt call that ever God will give you. And it looks as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as not, that now is come the turning point for eternity with reſpect to ſome of you; and if you don't hear and turn now, it is to be feared that God will give you up, and ſay to you as of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>l your conduct, in order to the day of account and reckoning. Man's eye will be upon you; the good in hopes to ſee ſome good effect; and the bad in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to imitate your had example, with a bolder face, while they ſee that others do the like; and the devil will now have his eyes upon you, to ſee whether he is like to loſe his prey; he don't love to ſee you affected, ſerious and prayerful; he hates you ſhould be concern'd about your ſouls, and tho'tful of their eternal welfare; he had rather ſee you eagerly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earth, than to ſee you in earneſt for heaven; he had rather ſee you inclined to read romances and play books, than the bible; and had rather ſee you at a merry frolick, ſiddling and dancing, drinking and carouſing than to ſee you in your cloſet, upon your knees praying, or at a religious meeting, with the people of God, worſhipping. And therefore the devil will watch, and keep his eye upon you now, in order to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the firſt and fitteſt ſeaſon to tempt you to break through theſe reſtraints that God has now, by this providence, laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; and he will not only watch the fitteſt ſeaſons, but the fitteſt perſons too, to tempt forward, to lead the way. The devil knows that there is a check put to fiolicking in this town now, which young people are ſo prone to, and in this neighbourhood eſpecially; but he is in hopes that ſome of his faithful ſervants will venture for his cauſe ſoon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the old cuſtom again, and go on as merrily in his ſervice as ever. And now I would aſk the youth of this aſſembly, and the frolickers among the youth, which of you intend to ſhare theſe honors, of being the firſt that ſhall venture for the devil, in reviving that practice that is ſo agreeable to his will, and ſtrengthening to his kingdom? whoever you be that do it, you will have the applauſe of all hell, for being a bold ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier for the prince of darkneſs; and the devil will give you many high encomiums for your valor, as being one of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes of his kingdom.</p>

As God has come nearer to this neighbourhood, in this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to thoſe who live more remote; ſo he has come nearer to you ſtill; and if you don't anſwer the call of God herein, you will be inexcuſeable with a witneſs! but if you improve this providence aright, you will find mercy in all this ſeverity, and in the cloſe, be able to ſay that it is good for you that you have been thus afflicted, and that in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Lord hath done it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would ſpeak one word to ſuch whoſe lives were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ently expoſed, and yet, through the mercy of God, you are ſpared. If all others ſoon forget this diſpenſation, yet can it be poſſible that you ſhould? can you, when you have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard God's awful voice, but felt a touch of the hand of his dreadful power; and being ſcorch'd, and ſing'd by his light'ning's awful blaze, it ſeems you can't but know, that <hi>our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> And yet ſeeing your lives are ſpared, O how great are your obligations to hear the voice of Chriſt, ſpeaking to you in this providence! the language of which ſeems to be this, go for the preſent, and <hi>ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing befal you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, one word to you all, both old and young: If after all that has been ſaid and done to prevail with you to turn to the Lord, by ſound repentance, and unfeigned faith,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010648_0014_0F81BD6E49675170"/>yet if any of you ſhall venture to go on in ſin ſtill, and let the impreſſions of truth, and divine Providence wear off, without any good and laſting effect upon you; I wou'd juſt remind of another ſtorm that is a coming, inſinitely more dreadful than this late awful ſtorm has been; the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of which will not be conſined within the limits of a few miles in breadth, or hours in length, as was the caſe with this late ſtorm; but it will over-ſpread the while world of the wicked, and extend to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>moſt bounds of hell, as to the breadth of it; and as to the length of it will continue in its terror, without abatement, worlds without end. And the clouds of this ſtorm have already been long gathering, and ſo far riſen in the horizon of the written word, that is appears plain to faith's view now: and it will quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread our horizorn with a moſt melancholy gloom; for it will be a day of darkneſs, and gloomineſs, of clouds and thick darkneſs. And before the terrors of this day, which will be ſo great, the ſun and the moon will quit their ſtation, flee, &amp; hide as in ſome dark abiſs, and will never venture to ſhew their faces in the firmament any more. And the thunder and lightning of that day, will not be ſuch as has now been; meerly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And millions and millions, even all the wicked ſhall fall victims to the thunder of God's wrath in that day. As wicked men and devils were the Jonahs that cauſed this tempeſt to ariſe, ſo in that day when it comes none of them all will be able to ſtand before it, or flee or make their eſcape from it, but naked and defenceleſs they muſt lie open to it, in all the terrors of it, while G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
