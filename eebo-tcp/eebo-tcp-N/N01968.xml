            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yes, <hi>Sawny,</hi> I ſay ſo, and will prove it too. As to the firſt part, h.e. that Dr. MATHER <hi>ſent Circular Letters to ALL the Practitioners of the Town (the Owner
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002339_0009_0FDB2BEF17AA0B60"/>
of the Tranſactions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excepted.</hi>) Dr. MATHER did indeed ſend, A <hi>Letter to the Phyſicians in the City of Boſton,</hi> and directed it to One of them, a Worthy Schoolmaſter, (whom we did not reproach for going out of his Line for prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing Phyſick.) This he deſired to be communicated to them; and, <hi>Sawny,</hi> your honourable <hi>Name</hi> was particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and principally in the Direction. But he never ſent a particular or ſeperate Epiſtle to <hi>Ev'ry One,</hi> as you muſt mean, or otherwiſe exclude your ſelf from the Number of <hi>Practitioners.</hi> Indeed, he wrote a <hi>ſeparate Note</hi> to one or two, but no more; with another Copy of his Letter to you, for fear they ſhould be overlook'd among them. Beſides, <hi>Sawny,</hi> this <hi>General Letter</hi> it ſelf was not directed to ALL, there was <hi>ſome</hi> he had no thoughts of, as he told the Perſon by whom he deſir'd it might be Communicated.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Why,</hi> Mr. Demicus, <hi>you make of it, what we of the Learned call, a Complicated Lye: — You ſeem to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover two Lyes in One.</hi>—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>AC.</speaker>
               <p>But now for the other Sentence, (<hi>The Owner of the Tranſactions excepted</hi>;) Truth! it is ſomewhat hard, that the Dr. ſhould affront your honour ſo much, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Letter to any but your ſelf, when you know there is not a Phyſician in the Town, that ought to be named the ſame Day with you. But however, Maſter <hi>Sawny,</hi> he inſerted <hi>your Name in particular</hi>; and deſired <hi>expreſsly,</hi> that they would not forget YOU. And notwithſtanding you are ſo given over to <hi>Lying,</hi> and ſo <hi>brazen</hi> in it, as to ſay over again, that the DOCTORS <hi>Probity</hi> in his Abrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be concluded from his Addreſſing it to thoſe who had the <hi>Original</hi> in their Hands; For ſay you the Truth is, he ſent his <hi>Abſtract</hi> to <hi>all</hi> the Noted Phyſicians in the Town, but not to the <hi>Owner</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> and then cry out <hi>Proh Fides</hi>! Ah <hi>Sawny, Proh Fides,</hi> ſure enough! But now for t'other Paſſage; You ſay Dr. MATHER, <hi>invited them to come into the Practice of Inoculating the Small-Pox.</hi> And before this in the News-Letter, <hi>He applied to the Practitioners of the Place, to put this far fetcht, and not well voucht Method into Practice.</hi> But to ſee how far all this is true, I'le re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Concluſion of his <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the Physicians, wherein the World may ſee his unſpotted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

that inaſmuch at the practice of ſuffering the Small-Pox in the way of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> has never yet, as far as I have heard, been introduced into our Nation where there are ſo many that would give great Sums to have their Lives enſured for an Eſcape from the Dangers of this dreadful Diſtemper; nor has ever any one in <hi>America,</hi> ever yet made the tryal of it, (tho' we have ſeveral <hi>Africans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as I now find, who tryed it in their own Country,) <hi>I cannot but</hi> move, that it be WARILY pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in.

you rail at Dr. BOYLESTON, for propagating the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Small-Pox,</hi> and in a few lines after ſay, <hi>the Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation produces nothing analogous to the Small-Pox</hi>: here is ignorance and inconſiſtency too! And then you learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Compare it, to the receiving the Oil of <hi>Tobacco</hi> into the maſs of <hi>Blood,</hi> which you ſay may be received by the <hi>Stomach</hi> or <hi>Lungs</hi> without any prejudice. In your laſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, you talk like an Apothecary, and learnedly tell us that, <hi>all Constitution Diſtempers have ſome Idea, in ev'ry drop of our Juices, and ſo other Chronical diſtempers from the Perſon from whom the pocky matter is received are communicated unto the Perſon Inoculated.</hi> But <hi>Sawny,</hi> I ſuppoſe it will convey the <hi>Toothach</hi> too. And if the <hi>Pus</hi> was taken from you, <hi>Sawny,</hi> I fear the Perſon would be Inoculated which <hi>Lyes, Malice, Ignorance</hi>; for all thy juices are filled with the Idea's of them. And then, (for thou art a mighty Self-conſiſtent Spark <hi>Sawny</hi>) you afterwards learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly propoſe, that <hi>Inoculation</hi> (which you have all along repreſented, as <hi>Infecting the whole Body</hi> with all imaginable Venom) <hi>may be ordered by Act of Parliament as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate Succedaneum to the Genuine Small-Pox to purify the Blood from the remaining faeculency.</hi> Was there ever ſuch a Blockhead? But I'll ſuperſede the other Diſcoveries of your Skill, with the mention of but <hi>two</hi> more.</p>
               <p>You ſay that, <hi>Whatever ails the Inoculated in the after courſe of their Lives, may be ſubject to; the Blame will be laid on their former Inoculation.</hi> Here's ignorance and malice too. If they have ever taken any Phyſic of thee <hi>Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> they would have a much better Cauſe to lay it to. How very Prodigal of their lives muſt the People be, that will venture them in the hands of ſuch a woful Phyſician!</p>
               <p>And there is one Inſtance of thy Superlative skill, <hi>Sawny,</hi> that is very notorious. I have often enough heard thee ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicul'd for it. When the Patients are in the <hi>utmoſt danger</hi> thou ſeeſt nothing of it; nor ſayeſt any thing to prepare their Friends for it; yea, when they are actually dying and within two or three hours of Death, thou beareſt their Friends in hand, <hi>that there's no ſuch matter.</hi> There are many can tell enough of thy performances this way. —</p>

               <p>Yes, <hi>Sawny,</hi> you came recommended to <hi>them,</hi> and they were ſo Credulous (as you call them) to hope well, and ſpeak well of you. But you were ſo well known, they could procure you little practiſe, and accordingly you took a Voyage, but ſoon returned; where at laſt by their means you got a <hi>little Credit.</hi> However, but little notice was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of you, till your <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to <hi>Inoculation,</hi> made you famous. And yet, you were one of the moſt unſucceſsful PHYSICIANS in the Town. When there dyed above 700 People in this Town within three Months, how many were your unhappy <hi>Patients</hi>? Though at the ſame Time, GOD was pleaſed to Succeed Dr. BOYLESTON to a wonderful degree, in his Patients that laboured under the <hi>Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> beſides thoſe of <hi>Inoculation.</hi> And <hi>Sawny,</hi> are you not aſhamed now, to treat the Gentlemen that took ſuch pains to introduce you into all your <hi>practiſe,</hi> like a warmed <hi>Rattleſnake.</hi> I hope ſuch a Monſter of Ingratitude, will warn them from being too <hi>Credulous</hi> in encouraging Strangers.</p>
