            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may therefore ſeem a little grating, at ſuch a Time, to hear of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Medicines,</hi> implying <hi>Diſeaſes, Wounds</hi> and <hi>Bruiſes,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THE Anſwer is obvious: they appear in our ungrateful Returns to the Father of Mercy's for all his Benefits unto us. We are highly exalted, on account of Privileges:—fluſh'd with Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes paſt, and confident of more to come; whilſt <hi>we are laden with Iniquity</hi> and wrapped up in Security.</p>
            <p>OUR Caſe too nearly reſembles <hi>that</hi> of the Jews, in the Days of our Prophet. They were GOD's peculiar People: and he had long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged them as Children: <hi>fed them to the full,</hi> with every Kind of Bleſſing. But, in return, they filled Jeruſalem, the holy City, with their Abominations: ſuch as Adultery, Uncleanneſs, Idolatry, Oppreſſion, Murder and Blood: all which cry'd for Vengeance.</p>
            <p>KING <hi>Joſiah</hi> did every thing, that became a pious Prince to reform them. <hi>He turned to</hi>

Firſt, <hi>I am to ſhow, what Diſeaſes or evil Habits are imminently dangerous, threatning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to a People.</hi> They are ſuch as theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>A Selfiſh Spirit, or the prevalence of Self Love.</hi> This pernicious Principle, took place with our original Defection from God. When Man for ſook the Lord, he loſt ſight of the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Happineſs, retired into <hi>himſelf,</hi> and made <hi>himſelf</hi> the Object of his Love, and the Centre of all his Deſires and Actions. And if ſo, the Principle of Self Love, bears a univerſal ſway, exerciſing Dominion over all the humane Race, until renewed by the Grace of God, and directed by his holy Spirit. But leſt we miſtake the Principle, &amp; call Good, Evil; let us attend to our Saviour's Teaching; upon the head of Self Love, Mat. 22. 39. <hi>Thou ſhall love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> So then, we may and ought <hi>to love ourſelves.</hi> Our Lord allows of it, or takes it for granted. This is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple founded in humane Nature: not to be rooted out, but refined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Grace of God. And ſo is not, ſimply conſidered, any Fault or Diſeaſe. But then; remember thou haſt a Neighbour, that thou art related to Society; the Bond of which is Love. And therefore, thou ſhall love thy <hi>Neighbour,</hi> as well as <hi>thy ſelf.</hi> Which ſeems plainly to intimate, that our Lord does not here ſpeak of loving <hi>our ſelves</hi> merely as <hi>individual,</hi> made to dwell alone; but as we ſtand connected with our fellow-men, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008598_0010_102F949C06319628"/>
of a public Body, or Community, whoſe Happineſs he would have us promote, with the warmeſt Intention. And as Love is productive of every kind Office, therefore conſider, how thou loveſt <hi>thy ſelf.</hi> Sincerely,—fervently,—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably,—and then go and do likewiſe to thy Neighbour: not only to <hi>One</hi> but <hi>All.</hi> Love all the Members of that Body, of which thou alſo art a Member. This is due to the Public. And here is the Rule or Meaſure, by which thou art to render to thy Neighbour his Due. <hi>Love him as thy ſelf.</hi> So that <hi>Love</hi> is a ſocial Grace, planted in the humane Soul, not merely for our <hi>own</hi> Happineſs, but for the good of <hi>others</hi> alſo. But when a Man views himſelf, as an Individual Only, and not as a Member of Society; and thereupon conſults nothing but his Own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intereſt, not regarding the Intereſt of the Body: or if he lends his Aſſiſtance to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it is with this ultimate View, that <hi>himſelf</hi> alone may finally reap the Advantage. Such a Man is guilty of that criminal <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> which I here ſpeak of. And this is a moſt dangerous Diſeaſe, threatning Deſtruction to the People where it reigns. The Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſpeaks of it, as ſuch 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2. In the laſt days <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Times</hi> ſhall come; for Men ſhall <hi>be Lovers of their Own ſelves.</hi> Theſe are perilous Times indeed, when the generality of Men living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, ſhall be left to the Power of <hi>ſelf love;</hi> forgetting their Relation to the Body, ſhall every
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008598_0011_102F949D9F95BD38"/>
one ſeek his own private Intereſt and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: When, through Covetouſneſs, Malice and Envy, they ſhall never reſt, 'till they have murdered the public Intereſt and buried <hi>that</hi> out of ſight, which ſhould have been the great Object of their Attention and the Height of their Ambition to Secure. A moments Attention to the actings of this narrow, fordid Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will diſcover the Danger of it. For they that are actuated by ſuch a Spirit, have this only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in View, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>their own perſonal Intereſt;</hi> not as it is included in the public, or common good, but as ſeperate from it. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Schemes they Project and the Meaſures they Purſue, are from the ſome Principle, and for the ſame End, even <hi>ſelf Intereſt.</hi> Now, let us View all the Members of a Body, or Society, (and why not <hi>One</hi> as well as <hi>another,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> as well as <hi>One,</hi>) influenced by this ſelfiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and ſee what dreadful work they will make. For their Intereſt being oppoſite to each Other, (which muſt be the Caſe, on the preſent Hypotheſis,) it follows, that there will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual claſhing, among Individuals, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Meaſures and Means, to attain their private Ends, (for the Intereſt of One is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of another, where ſelf reigns,) and then, all their Meaſures will interfere with the public Intereſt: for <hi>this</hi> they have all agreed to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to <hi>ſelf.</hi> What then becomes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity? that Body of People which were united
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008598_0012_102F949F2E3FD800"/>
together for ſocial Purpoſes? why, it is demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. This Tabernacle i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſpoiled, and all its Cords are broken. And what becomes of the <hi>ſelfiſh Man</hi> at laſt? Why, however inſenſible he may be of the iſſue, he overſetts the Building, and like Sampſon, (in a better Cauſe,) is caſhed himſelf, by its Fall. For, by promoting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to the injury of the Public, he ſenſibly weakens the hands of that Body, yea diſarms it or all its Power, (as far as <hi>he</hi> is of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and ſo deprives himſelf of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and ſtrength, which the Community, had he not diſſolv'd its Bonds, would have exerted to his Defence, in a time of extremity, which <hi>he</hi> as an Individual, can no longer avoid nor endure. Mark the end then, of the ſelfiſh Man; to whom the Pſalmiſts words may be apply'd,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſalm 7 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He made a Pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His miſchief ſhall return upon his own Head, and his violent dealing ſhall come down upon his own Pate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>A party ſpirit is a dangerous Evil.</hi> This originates from ſelf, or is only the ſame ſpirit, acting in a different form and carrying a wider breadth. But then, every Sect or Party of Men, profeſſing the ſame Opinion, ought not to be look'd upon, as <hi>Party ſpirited,</hi> in any bad ſenſe, <hi>merely</hi> for their uniting in ſentiments, that differ from the reſt, or other part of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For, every Man has a natural, unalienable
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008598_0013_102F94A5F5510470"/>
Right to think and ſee for himſelf. And if he is conſcientious, he will be at Pains to find out Truth: which having found, to his ſatisfaction, muſt be dear to him. He therefore with his Brethren of the ſame Opinion, ought, as honeſt Men, to be zealous for thoſe Truths, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Importance of them. Sects or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in this Sence, as they are unavoidable, ſo they may not be hurtful to the Body. They don't threaten the public ſafety, provided all Parties duely conſider themſelves as equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Public; and do tenderly affect one another as Parts and Members of the ſame Body; holding up the public Health in conſtant View, as a Matter of the higheſt Importance, and the End of all their Purſuits. Such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit as this, which is no ways inconſiſtent with Parties, ſimply conſidered, will ſecure the public good, and, at the ſame time, the Peace and ſafety of all Parties and Individuals. But when a Party or Number of Men, unite to carry on a particular Deſign, either without any Regard to the public Health, or unhappy miſtaking <hi>themſelves</hi> for the <hi>Public,</hi> and thence concluding that nothing is of general Benefit but what favours <hi>their</hi> party-Intereſt: In conſequence of which their Strength and Zeal is put forth in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not the real good of the Public, but of their own Party, to the cruſhing of their diſſenting Brethren, as if they were not Members in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the ſame Body, This, I apprehend is to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008598_0014_102F94A9184397F8"/>
be <hi>Party Spirited</hi> in an evil Senſe, and is of moſt pernicious Conſequence. This affords continual Matter for the working of Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Bitterneſs, the Fruit of which is Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Strife and Diviſions which give the moſt fatal Wounds to the Common Wealth. This is for a Houſe or Kingdom to be divided againſt itſelf, which our Lord aſſures us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand.</p>
            <p>WHEN Parties are actuated by ſuch a narrow, contracted Spirit, each of them purſuing their reſpective Intereſts, ſeparate from the public Good, and regardleſs of its Fate, their Conduct is as unnatural and tends as directly to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a People, as if the Fingers of the Right Hand ſhould militate againſt thoſe of the Left; and <hi>both Hands,</hi> in their zealous ſtrife, neglect the Defence of the Body, when a drawn Sword is pointed at the Heart.</p>
            <p>SHOULD any plead, that the Conſtitution is weak, the Government bad, and the Rulers ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, all this wont legitimate a party Spirit, nor juſtify its ruling, ſo long as there is <hi>a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, common Good;</hi> upon the ſecuring of which, the <hi>ſafety</hi> of Individuals, under ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be obtained.</p>
            <p>THE holy Religion, that GOD has taught his People, is of ſuch a generous Temper, that it not only forbids their touching the public Peace, but requires them to ſeek and promote it (even under an <hi>idolatrous and tyrannical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</hi>

How unreaſonable then, as well as hurtful, is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of a party Spirit, in a well founded chriſtian Government?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A murmuring Spirit threatens Deſtruction to a People.</hi> "To murmur, is to ſpeak againſt a Perſon or thing, out of Diſlike, Impatience or Diſcontent." implying an injurious Reflection upon the great Governor of the World. This was one of the crying Sins among the Jews. But not peculiar to <hi>them.</hi> 'Tis found, too frequently, among the Profeſſing People of GOD, in all Ages of the World. Many complain of the difficult <hi>Times</hi> they live in;—not by way of humble <hi>mourning</hi> for the wickedneſs of them; but with a manifeſt Air of Impatience and Diſcontent under their Trials.</p>
            <p>BUT this Spirit commonly exerts itſelf againſt the Rulers of God's People, both of a civil and ſacred Order. <q>Either they take too much
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008598_0016_102F94AC30D079A8"/>
upon them; or they are ſeeking their own Honour, Eaſe and Profit, and care not what becomes of the People,</q> are Cenſures very liberally dealt out, againſt the Rulers; though like Nehemiah, they are really <hi>come to ſeek the Welfare of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT this is a threatning Diſeaſe—For Murmurers are commonly fond of Company. They'll endeavour to inſtill the ſame Notions into Others, which they themſelves indulge:—Willing to ſpread the Infection through the whole Body. From whence a general Diſ-affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes among People. The public Peace is Diſturbed. The Duty's of our reſpective Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are neglected. The Cords of Union are broke; and Society on the point of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded.—The Influence of Rulers is hereby Obſtructed,—their Authority weakned, &amp; their Hearts diſcouraged. Under which Tryals, if they are not meeker than Moſes, they will be provoked to Speak Unadviſedly with their Lips. All which tends to kindle the Anger of GOD againſt a People.</p>
            <p>THUS when they Murmured againſt Moſes and Aaron, the Lord reſented the Affront as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to himſelf: and accordingly took Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the Murmuring Iſraelites. Their Carcaſes fell in the Wilderneſs; or they died of the Peſtilence and Plague. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 29, 37.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>theſe things happened to them for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples, and they are written for our admonition,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008598_0017_102F94B07A374260"/>
ſays Paul.<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10, 11.</note> Therefore the Apoſtle ſolemnly warned Chriſtians againſt this daring preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Sin, ver. 10. <hi>neither murmur ye as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A Spirit of Evil ſurmiſing.</hi> This is for a Man to imagine, or uncharitably Suſpect ſome evil thing againſt his Neighbour, when he has no rational Evidence or ground to ſupport it. Directly contrary to the Law of GOD,<note n="†" place="bottom">Zech. 8. 17.</note>

was ſpoken, may be miſtaken; or an <hi>Action</hi> done, may be miſreprented: and then a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſpirit has Art and Ill Nature enough to dreſs it up in the blackeſt Colours, ready for the Uſe of a ſlandering Tongue. 'Tis reported as ſomething <hi>real</hi> and very <hi>criminal.</hi> It paſſes current from Hand to Hand, increaſing as it goes; until it becomes an <hi>horrible thing,</hi> no longer to be endured.—Upon this the clamour of Tongues is raiſed againſt the Man of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Station: and whether he be really innocent or guilty, it makes no odds,—they have no Leiſure nor Will to enquire after Truth: but lift up their Voices, with one accord, &amp; cry "away with ſuch a one from the Earth"—Away with him from his Seat of Honour and Truſt; for it is not fitting that he ſhould live in it any longer.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER they may be awed with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Superiors, and afraid of ſpeaking to their Faces; they are not aſhamed to ſurmiſe the hardeſt things againſt them, nor yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the black Falſehood; if they may do it with Impunity, or under the ſhadow of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. They ſtick not to <hi>revile the Gods, nor to curſe the Rulers of the People. So preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous are they and ſelf willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak Evil of Dignities.</hi> By this Means the Community is Wounded in her Head,—depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of her moſt able and uſeful Members and Weakned in all her Parts: beſides the Curſe

            <p>HAVING, in our nature, performed a ſinleſs Obedience to all the Commands of GOD, CHRIST JESUS, in our Behalf, ſubmitted to Death; <hi>Death</hi> including the whole of that Puniſhment, which, by Law, was due to the Tranſgreſſors of it.

               <hi>That he hath purchaſed the Church with his own blood.</hi> Purchaſed it; made full Payment, full Satisfaction, for all her Debts or Offences, occaſioned by Sin.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>THE deep Concern which all the Members of Community, and eſpecially ſuch as are in Places of Truſt, ſhould manifeſt in ſeeking the Public Health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[THAT Man is a dependant Creature, not only upon GOD his Creator, but alſo upon his Fellow Men: being form'd, not to live &amp; act alone; but in Fellowſhip with his Brethren: all united together, in a Body or Community, by certain Bonds: held and directed by certain Laws and Rules; under the Influence and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of proper Officers; in a juſt &amp; beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gradation, from the Head to the Foot: and this for the well Being of the whole Body, and the Safety, as well as Comfort of every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, is a Subject that hath been ſo often
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008598_0031_102F94DD73854138"/>
handled upon this Occaſion: and the Neceſſity of it, eſpecially in our lapſed ſtate, ſo well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that I need do no more than mention it. And from hence it appears, that every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this important Body, ſhould hold himſelf Obliged to put on a Public Spirit, and to exert himſelf, upon all Occaſions, to promote its Welfare. For the Safety and Welfare of the Public, is, not only his Own, out his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, his Friends, his Childrens. In that there is ſuch a cloſe Connection between the Body and its Members, that if the Body be well or ſick, the Members muſt be proportionably affected. Now, let the Regard which we have, or <hi>ſhould</hi> have for our Neighbours Welfare, be added to that which we have for our <hi>Own,</hi> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, for a public ſpirit, will be doubly ſtrong. And will yet gather ſtrength, when we View e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Individual, of the whole Body, happy or miſerable, according as it fares with the Public. So that a true Lover of Mankind, will prefer the public Good and Safety, above his <hi>Own,</hi> perſonally and ſeparately conſidered, as much as the whole Body is preferable to any one of its Members. And <hi>this</hi> not only juſtifies, but inſpirits a truly generous Soul, a real Friend of the Public, to ſacrifice, not only his own <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> but his <hi>Life</hi> to his Country's Service; when the ſafety, or welfare of the Community demands it of him. As it was with Noah, in the Time of the Flood,—the Safety &amp; Well Being
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008598_0032_102F94DF0BE0D138"/>
of <hi>Noah,</hi> his Family and of every living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that was with him, depended upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Ark.</hi> If <hi>that</hi> was kept above Water, entire and in a due Poſition; they were all ſafe: If it ſunk, or was daſh'd in pieces, by the Waves; they all periſhed: Therefore the Preſervation of the Ark was of greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and, very juſtly, a Matter of deeper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with every Member of the Family, than barely the Preſervation of <hi>himſelf,</hi> as ſeparate from the Ark.—So in the Caſe before us: Our whole Intereſt and Safety is embarked in the Public Welfare. And therefore that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic may be preſerved ſafe, in Health &amp; Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is a Matter of ſuch Vaſt Importance, as juſtly demands the firſt Concern of every incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated Member.—But then, the higher any Ones Station is in the Body; the larger is his Sphere of Action; the more numerous are the Branches of his Duty, and the more extenſive is his Influence. So that his Opportunities and Advantages to do good, are in Proportion to the Place he ſuſtains: And on the Other hand, his Failure of Duty, muſt be proportionably hurtful to the Public, as his Station is higher than his Brethrens. Which ſhows, that from the Head of a Nation or Province, down to the Maſter of a Family, our Concern for the Public Good ſhould riſe according to the Place which we Occupy. For Reaſon &amp; Experience teach, that Public Weal or Wo, depends, very much,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008598_0033_102F94E6ADE67918"/>
upon the good or ill Behaviour of thoſe, that are truſted with her Treaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that have the Care of conducting the whole Body, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, or as it excites and acts in it's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts.</p>
            <p>OF ſuch a Concern, for the Welfare of Zion and the Civil State, we have an Inſtance before us; in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> After his moſt vigorous Endeavours to ſave them from Ruin, had prov'd unſucceſsfull, he fell into Tears and lamented their pitiful Caſe: As in the Words immediately following our Text.

                  <hi>in our Diſtreſs. we called upon the Lord, &amp; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto our GOD. Lord ſave us for thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake. Give us Help from Trouble, for the Help of Man is vain. He heard our voice out of his Temple,</hi> above, <hi>and our Cry came before him even into his Ears.—Then did GOD ariſe and Scatter our Enemies: he made them that hated us to flee before us</hi> He either <hi>ſent Faintneſs into their Hearts, ſo that the Sound of a ſhaken Leaf did Chaſe them:</hi> Or if they met our Troops in the Field, they were ſmitten down before them. The Plains of <hi>Abraham</hi> can teſtify, that <hi>there the ſtout hearted were ſpoiled.

A glorious, but a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acquiſition! <hi>Glorious;</hi> as it was Obtained by unequal Numbers, with a Firmneſs and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſcarcely to be equalled. <hi>Coſtly,</hi> as the Blood and Life of the braveſt General was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. The Favour of GOD to this Land, in ſending over that accompliſh'd Officer, <hi>The Gallant WOLFE,</hi> to defend our Country, is ſo great and Diſtinguiſhing, that, methinks, all Heaven is liſtening to hear our Acclamations this Day, even Songs of Praiſe from an Obliged People.

               <p>O Daughters of Jeruſalem! Weep ye over WOLFE, the the young, the generous and the tender hearted Man! the bold, intrepid Warriour: who under GOD, has ſaved <hi>you</hi> from barbarous Hands, and your <hi>little Ones</hi> from being daſhed againſt the Stones.

               <p>And now: What can we expect in return for ſuch a fooliſh and even bruitiſh Requital of the bleſſed God? If Mercy and Kindneſs will not melt us, nor Judgment deter us from Sinning, we may expect that Wrath from the Lord will ſoon go forth to Devour us. Surely a People are never in greater Danger of ſpeedy Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than when they harden under Judgments and wax Wanton with Mercies. <hi>For as the Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, but beareth Thorns and Briars, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and is nigh unto Curſing.</hi>

Wherefore, as in repaiting the Walls of Jeruſalem, all Ranks of Men were engag'd in the work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Governour, down to Mechanicks, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Labourers, ſo ſhould we be all Hands at Work, in healing and reforming every Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that Sin has brought upon the Community whoſe dangerous Sickneſs calls aloud for ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Help.</p>
               <p>I would therefore humbly addreſs the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Heaven this day, to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: and more eſpecially to the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Body of this People: beſeeching their powerful Aſſiſtance in healing, i. e. reforming the dangerous Evils that have been deſcribed, and all others that prevail againſt us.

               <p>You are very ſenſible, my honoured Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that your Relation to the Body leads you, very naturally, to view your ſelves in a Twofold Light. As Rulers, ſet to govern and direct

IT therefore concerns you, Honoured Sirs, to take good heed to your ſelves, in the firſt Place; that, like Obadiah, <hi>you fear the LORD greatly:</hi>—Truſt in him firmly and walk Cloſely with him: that you yourſelves may be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Health, and better able to miniſter to your diſeaſed People: leſt they ſay, <hi>Phyſician, heal thy ſelf.</hi> To ſtrengthen your Hands and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your Hearts in this important work of Reforming what is amiſs among us, it may be of great Service, that you daily think of the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Titles</hi> &amp; awful <hi>Characters,</hi> with which you are honoured in the Scriptures. <hi>I have ſaid ye are gods,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, To remind you of the conſtant, tender Care you ſhould take of your Peoples Health: And to ſuggeſt, that, for Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Impartiality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Steady Conduct, your Adminiſtration, ſhould be a lively Image &amp; Tranſcript of GOD's unerring Government of the World.</p>
               <p>YOU <hi>are alſo Revengers to execute wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that doth evil.</hi> Which being executed with Solemnity, in the Fear of GOD, will make you a Terror to evil doers: and at the ſame time the Guardians of the Innocent: and upon the whole, <hi>the Miniſters of GOD for good to his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT that which adds the greateſt weight to Rulers Adminiſtrations is, <hi>Their Godly Example.</hi> They ſhould be <hi>holy as GOD is holy,</hi> &amp; <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as GOD is.</hi> This will convince their People,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008598_0043_102F95057B628F78"/>
that <hi>they themſelves</hi> believe that what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them, <hi>are ſacred Realities.</hi>—Matters of the higheſt Importance.</p>
               <p>IT alſo becomes our Civil Fathers to be <hi>Zealous</hi> in the work of Reformation. Your Peoples Sins ſhould deeply affect your Hearts, and make you reſolve, if poſſible, to heal them. But if unſucceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus did Moſes, David, Ezra, Nehemiah and other godly Rulers. And tho' your Sword may not reach the Heart of Sin, nor convert Sinners to GOD, yet your Prayers may reach Heaven and enter into the Ears of the Lord: Who has many a Time repented of the Evil which he tho't to do unto his People, for their Sins, and done it not; in anſwer to the godly Rulers Prayers. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 14.</p>
               <p>[YOU'LL pleaſe, my very Honoured Fathers, to conſider, how dependant we all are upon you. Tho' guilty of much undutiful Carriage towards you,—like peeviſh Children are too apt to murmur and complain,—to raiſe Parties againſt you: and boldly ruſh upon the Point of your Sword, by daring Impieties, yet our Eyes are upon you for Succour and Protection.

Good Laws for the ſuppreſſing of Vice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Diſorders, will fail of their End, if the Execution of them falls into Unſkillful or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Hands. And this is too often the Caſe, in ſome of your Towns: which makes the Wicked ſo bold and impudent; walking as if there was no Law nor Authority over them.</p>
               <p>IT therefore concerns You, Worthy Sirs, to propoſe and chooſe ſuch Men <hi>Only</hi> for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Peace, in your reſpective Counties and Towns, as are, not only equal to the Poſt, for <hi>Abilities,</hi> but Men that truely <hi>fear God,</hi> and are not afraid of the Face of Man. They ſhould be Men of great and approved <hi>Sobriety,</hi> walking Steadily in all GOD's Ordinances: that their Sentence againſt Tranſgreſſors may fall with Weight and Terror. And ſuch as have been criminally delinquent, in times paſt, ſhould be faithfully reproved by you, and reclaimed, or diſmiſſed from their Places: leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> encouraged by their Example, ſhould boldly contemn the Authority of their Office.</p>
               <p>ONCE more, Gentlemen; Conſider the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in which you appear at the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly—REPRESENTATIVES of the FREEMEN or Towns that ſend you: plainly ſuggeſting, that your Buſineſs here, is not merely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your <hi>perſonal Honour</hi> or <hi>Intereſt,—that</hi> is what you gave up to the Public, when you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Choice. You are therefore to look at the Health of your Conſtituents,—the Towns
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008598_0049_102F951ADE190848"/>
from which you come: and ſeek the Welfare of thoſe Societies. And yet a more important Object riſes here in your View, The Good of the whole Community or Colony, of which your Towns are but Parts or Members, as you your ſelves are of <hi>them.</hi> Yea, the Welfare of the whole Country and Kingdom, is to be thought of and promoted by you. And if the Freemen acted with Underſtanding and worthy of their Character, in their Appointment of you to this Truſt, they gave up the particular Intereſt of their Towns, and lodg'd it in your Hands, to be managed in ſuch a Manner, <hi>at</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the Aſſembly, as ſhould be judged moſt for the Health of the whole Body. Therefore, on the whole, I beſeech you to caſt off a narrow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Spirit,—ſpread your Thoughts abroad through the whole Community: and, with deep Concern, endeavour to recover the Health, (both in Church and State,) of a Diſeaſed and languiſhing People.</p>
               <p>III. To <hi>the Freemen of the Colony</hi>—I beſeech your earneſt Attention, that, if poſſible, our Health may be recovered.</p>

               <p>'TIS of vaſt Importance. Gentlemen, that you Seriouſly conſider the Relation you ſtand in to the whole Body—that you are Members of a moſt Valuable Community<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another; bound by ſolemn Bonds to promote the beſt Good of the Public.—And then, with great Attention, endeavour to inform and aſſure yourſelves, What is the Public Good, what is really for the Health of the Body, the People in general. And that which is So, muſt be the Object of your Purſuit. For <hi>this</hi> you muſt give up your perſonal Intereſt, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it interferes with the public: account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it your greateſt Happineſs and Safety, that the Body, of which you are Members, is in perfect Health.—This will prevent or cure you of a <hi>Party Spirit,</hi> which, if it riſes to a reigning Power among us, (as there is great Danger) will prove as certain Death to the Body, as a Mortification in the Bowels.</p>
               <p>BEWARE that you Indulge not an <hi>evil Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> againſt any one. Give not yourſelves up entirely to the Influence of Others: not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly act upon Vulgar Report, but be at Pains to acquaint yourſelves with Perſons &amp; Things, that you may not act in the Dark. And then, with ſound Judgment, and from a Principle of Conſcience, Chooſe you out and keep in Poſts
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008598_0051_102F952027532B50"/>
of Truſt, ſuch Men, to rule over you and to repreſent you, as you do ſoberly believe will ſerve the true Intereſt of the Public, with the greateſt Fidelity and to the beſt Advantage.</p>
               <p>IN a word: be always tender of the Public,—the Colony's Intereſt.—This is a beautiful and reſpectable Government: Second to none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in New-England, for Situation, Liberty, public Credit, Royal Favour, Religion and many Other Advantages. Let us therefore take Heed, that we don't marr the Beauty nor tarniſh the Glory of ſuch a comely Body, by abuſing our Liberties: I beſeech you beware leaſt you beſmear this lovely Face, with the infernal Spot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Diſcord, Strife and Diviſion, the curſed Offspring of Enmity and a narrow ſelfiſh Spirit, fermenting into a party Zeal.</p>
               <p>ONCE more, be careful and make Conſcience of appointing Such to the town Offices of Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury-Men, Tithing men, &amp;c. in your reſpective Towns, as ſhall be faithful in their Places,—Watching over and informing againſt notorious Offenders. For 'tis greatly Owing to the criminal Neglect of ſuch Officers, that Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſo openly abounds in many Parts of the Land.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>To Heads of Families.</hi>—It nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>you,</hi> to be zealous, in helping of us to reform the Evils of the Day. Families are little Nurſeries of Learning, Piety and good

Manners, or of Ignorance, Profanity and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Here</hi> we are formed to do much Good, or equal Hurt to the Community, of which we are Members. And therefore the greateſt Care is incumbent upon Heads of Families, to teach and rule their Houſes well. But alas for them! many are ſo Void of Knowledge and Skill, in the whole Affair of good Education, as it lies, not only in <hi>Teaching,</hi> but <hi>Governing</hi> and <hi>Diſciplining</hi> their Houſes; and ſo inſenſible of the vaſt Importance of it, that their Children, being neglected, come forth into the World, deſtitute of all good Furniture to Serve either God or their Country. Others that know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are, many of them, criminally Slothful and Negligent.—So that through the Weakneſs of ſome and the Careleſsneſs of other Parents, We have but an uncomfortable Proſpect, as to a great Part of the riſing Generation; more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in ſome Parts of the Land. For Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's Sake then, I beſeech all of you, that are Parents, and Maſters of Houſes, Awake and come in to the Help of the Lord. Put forth your moſt zealous Endeavours to reform the threatning Evils that are daily growing up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Eyes.—Think, how inconſiſtent it is, with the tender Love you feel for your Children, that you do ſo little for their beſt Good in this Life, or for their future, eternal Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Many Parents and Maſters of Families, would, I believe, do more and better, <hi>if they knew how;</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:008598_0053_102F952A3380EFC0"/>
and were ſenſible that a good Family-Education, in the true Meaning &amp; full Extent of it, is almoſt <hi>The All,</hi> as to their own and the public Health. But, as I apprehend, they want further Means to awake their Attention and Zeal, in this Affair, as alſo to guide them in the Work. I would therefore return to the General Aſſembly as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Land, and humbly propoſe,</p>
               <p>WHETHER it is not a Matter, weighty eno' to employ your ſerious Thoughts afreſh, that ſomething further be done for the Help of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that their Children may be trained up in the Way they ſhould go?—And to this End, take leave to propoſe, that a ſhort, plain and eaſy Treatiſe upon the Subject of Education and Family Government, might be ſpeedily prepar'd: And ſuch a Number of the Books diſtributed to each Town, that every Family may have One, and the <hi>Poor</hi> have them gratis.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>I may not paſs by our Worthy Colonels and Officers in the Army;</hi> Who have precious Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and many ſingular Advantages, to Reform the Vices of the Field, and thereby to do much at Healing the Land.</p>
               <p>HONOURED and much eſteemed Gentlemen: Your Loyalty to your earthly Sovereign is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indiſputable;—Your Zeal in your Country's Service is known to us all, and gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; your Courage and Bravery of Spirit has been tryed and proved: and finally
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008598_0054_102F952BE3F02260"/>
you are Profeſſors of our Holy Religion.—'Tis therefore juſtly expected of you, and we beſeech you, Gentlemen, with all your accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, to help us in reforming the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our dear Brethren and precious Sons, who are committed to your care. Improve the Advantages of your high Rank in ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vices of the Army.</p>
               <p>You worthily reſent the Affronts that are offer'd to your Perſons, and are ſenſibly mov'd when your own Honour is touched. You very juſtly puniſh Rebellion and Diſloyalty, with Stripes, Confinement or Death, as a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and neceſſary Diſcipline. But what are theſe Offences againſt your Perſons, Offices or earthly Sovereign, compar'd with the horrid Affronts that are daily offer'd to the GOD of Heaven, the King of Zion, by the filthy Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemys &amp; daring Impieties of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

It will be nobly done of you, if, riſing above the Fear of Man, you make your Zeal and Courage known among the Troops, in reproving and ſcourging out the Immoralities of the Army. For hereby you will conquer the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; formidable Enemies that we have to fear.

               </p>
               <p>MY Reverend and Dearly beloved Brethren. Since we by Office, <hi>are ſet to Watch for Mens Souls,</hi> As accountable to GOD for them, We above all Men in the World, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for their Health; And eſpecially at ſuch a Day as <hi>this,</hi> when Multitudes are even Wounded to Death, but inſenſible of their Danger; Yea, when <hi>grey Hairs are here and upon the</hi> People <hi>and they know it not.</hi>—What can we do for the Health of the Daughter of Zion? Surely Our beſt Offices are both <hi>her</hi> Due and <hi>our</hi> Duty. To this I would ſay, that as ever we mean to heal and ſave a Diſeaſed People, we muſt in the firſt place,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Preach GOD's Word faithfully.</hi>—GOD's Word of Truth, as revealed in the Scriptures, is the great Inſtrument or Means, in the Hand of his Miniſters, by which they perform all their Cures. Hereby Sinners are converted,<note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 18.</note> and Saints Sanctify'd,<note n="‖" place="bottom">John 14. 19.</note> But then, divine Truths
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008598_0056_102F9530CAED16B0"/>
are healing, only as they bring Sinners to CHRIST, the great Phyſician, as before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And in Order to perſwade Souls to CHRIST for <hi>healing,</hi> they muſt be made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they are <hi>Sick.</hi> For the <hi>Whole need not the Phyſician,</hi> (ſuch wont come to CHRIST) <hi>but they that are Sick</hi>—Our firſt Concern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be, to convince People of their Sickneſs,—to open their Wounds, ſhew them their Diſeaſe, and make them ſenſible of their abſolute need of CHRIST to heal them. This is done by ſhewing them, from the Word of GOD, <hi>their loſt Eſtate by Nature.</hi> That they are not only Guilty of breaking the Whole Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Practice,</hi> but that they are by <hi>Nature</hi> an <hi>Unclean Thing.</hi> [That they are not as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam when he came firſt out of the Hand of GOD, bearing his Image <hi>in Holineſs:</hi> but as <hi>Adam</hi> in his fallen State; bearing an Image op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>that</hi> in which Man was created: as is fairly intimated Gen. 5. 1, 3. And ſo that their Nature, in this fallen State, is] wholly corrupt, interwoven with Luſts,—averſe to GOD and Holineſs, having no good thing dwelling in them. We muſt labour to convince them, as the Scriptures declare, that they are without Righteouſneſs and Strength,—utterly unable to help themſelves, and as unworthy of any Help or Favour from GOD: And ſo, that they lie <hi>at Mercy,</hi>—Sovereign Mercy.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, Sinners muſt be ſhown, that
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:008598_0057_102F9536A25FDDA0"/>
this Corrupt Nature, called, <hi>The Old Man, muſt be crucified with CHRIST,</hi> and <hi>this Body of Sin deſtroyed,</hi> or elle they can never be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>from the ſervice of Sin,</hi> as St. Paul Inſiſted, Rom. 6, 6. And finally, that all this is done by the Mighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Power of GOD; as the ſame Apoſtle teaches, Eph. 2. 10. <hi>We are his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, created in CHRIST JESUS to good Works.</hi> Thus deep muſt we make the Inciſion,—open the Wound to the Bottom,—ſhew them the Plague of the Heart and Nature, that they may <hi>feel</hi> themſelves undone.—Sick unto Death. Then will CHRIST JESUS be precious to their Souls, when we preach his Unſearchable Riches and diſplay the Fulneſs of his Grace. [This is the goſpel Method of healing diſeaſed Souls.—Theſe the foundation Principles, upon which alone we may hope to effect a thorough, laſting Reformation. For the <hi>Tree</hi> muſt be <hi>made good,</hi> or it <hi>cannot bring forth good Fruit,</hi> as our Saviour teaches. If a <hi>clean Heart</hi> be not <hi>Created</hi> in Men, their Unmortified Luſts will have Vent; break out &amp; corrupt all their Doing.] In Vain do we attempt to perſwade Men to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Life, and preſs them to Obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of GOD, without leading of them to the Rock that is higher than they; to CHRIST JESUS for Strength.—To little Purpoſe do we arm our ſelves with ſtrong Reaſons or ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all the Force of Rhetorick, in declaiming againſt the Vices of the times, without plunging
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:008598_0058_102F953A2D9F7D38"/>
the Sword of Truth into the Sinners Heart, and Opening to him the Fountain of Corruption that lies within. <hi>This</hi> ought we to do, and not to leave the <hi>other</hi> undone.—One might as well expect to ſubdue the Shrubs only under Plain, only by nipping off the Buds in the Spring, as to heal a vicious People of their mortal Diſeaſes, by working perpetually upon their immoral Practices <hi>alone,</hi> without opening the Nature, &amp; preſſing the Neceſſity of the New Birth, or an inward Work of the Spirit of Grace.—Or if we grant that Sinners may be perſwaded into an external Reformation, merely by the Force of Argument &amp; Intreaty, without an inward Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of the <hi>Old Man;</hi> as poſſibly they might, for a while: yet this would be but <hi>to heal the Hurt of the Daughter of God's People ſlightly,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. 6. 14.</note> there would be no room to cry <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> for <hi>that.</hi> To cleanſe the outſide, while the Heart within remains diſeaſed, full of Putrifying Sores, is to beſtow much Labour &amp; Coſt to little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: even like the Applying of coſtly Plaiſters to Pimples in the Skin, when the whole Maſs of Blood is corrupted. Let <hi>that</hi> be purged, and theſe Eruptions will die away.—How happy would it be, my Brethren, if all that preach the Goſpel of CHRIST every where, (or that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to do it,) <hi>did Speak the ſome thing and were perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind and in the ſame Judgment,</hi> reſpecting thoſe Things?—
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:008598_0059_102F953BC69F2120"/>
Sinners, of Every Claſs, could then find no Place for Shelter nor Eaſe:—go where they would, they'd meet the pointed Arrows of GOD's Word, pricking of them in the Heart, &amp; could find no Reſt for their Souls, until they found it in CHRIST: Which is the great Deſign of the Goſpel Miniſtry.—Once more,</p>
               <p>[2<hi>ly</hi> As ever we would Heal our diſeaſed People, we muſt <hi>Practice</hi> as well as Preach the Goſpel of CHRIST. <hi>Take Heed to ourſelves that we breath nothing but the Spirit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in the whole of our Converſation.</hi>—We ſhould always remember that we are the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Meek and lowly JESUS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon whom the Holy Spirit deſcended like a Dove: in Conſequence of which, <hi>when he was reviled He reviled not again.</hi> He bore the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities with the utmoſt Patience, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all his Diſputes, againſt the worſt of Men, without any heat of Temper, or indecent Reflections. <hi>His Gentleneſs made him great.</hi>—Now, if we are his true Miniſters, we have drunk a Meaſure of the ſame Spirit,—are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the ſame Temper and have learned to talk in his Language. And, with this Armour on, we need not fear. Such a mild and gentle Spirit is the beſt Defence againſt the rough and boiſterous Sons of Violence. They cannot pierce this Coat of Mail,—this Clothing of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, if we keep it cloſe about us; no, not with their moſt in venom'd Arrows. Therefore
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:008598_0060_102F9541FA535DB0"/>
did CHRIST JESUS expreſsly charge his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he ſent them forth, <hi>to be wiſe as Serpents and harmleſs as Doves.</hi> Take with you the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Serpent, but leave his <hi>Poiſon</hi> and his <hi>Sting.</hi> Inſtead of <hi>that,</hi> take the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of the <hi>Dove,</hi> which has no Gall,—no Bitterneſs to Vent againſt her Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors. This truly great and noble Spirit, tho' deſpicable in the Eyes of the World, will make us as bold as Lions in our Maſters Cauſe: And, at the ſame time, enable us, the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, to heal the Wounds, with which the Daughter of Zion is now bleeding to Death.—How entirely out of Character, then, do we the Miniſters of CHRIST behave, when Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, Preaching, or Writings, are animated with an untender Spirit, and indecorated with hard Expreſſions or unkind Reflections. Surely, <hi>we do then walk naked, and they ſee our ſhame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Too much of this has appeared, in ſome of our late Pamphlets: which, had it not been for the Author's Names, could hardly have been charg'd upon ſuch worthy Miniſters of our Meek and gentle Lord.—I meddle not with the <hi>Diſputes</hi> themſelves,—'tis enough for me to lament them!—But the <hi>Spirit</hi> with which ſome of them have been managed, is evidently ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to CHRIST's Spirit;—ſo deſtitute of Love &amp; Gentleneſs: Yea, ſo full of Harſhneſs and Severity, that I am perſwaded Religion has been more wounded thereby, than it could
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:008598_0061_102F7463B2487F60"/>
have been by the <hi>Faults</hi> or <hi>unhappy things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> that occaſion'd thoſe Diſputes. And this, I hope will juſtify me in attempting to heal my Brethren of this Infirmity; that the Cauſe of CHRIST may ſuffer no more, for want of his kind and generous Spirit in defending of it.—As Moſes ſaid to Aaron, his Brother, in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the Calf; <hi>What did this People unto Thee, that thou haſt brought ſo great a Sin upon them?</hi> So let me be indulg'd the Queſtion, Dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, What have any done to provoke you, thus to Strip yourſelves of your Prieſtly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; cloth yourſelves in ſo rough a Dreſs,—a Founder's Habit.—Have any invaded the Rights of Conſcience, or the Liberty of Churches and Societies? What then? Muſt we take up carnal Weapons to defend the ſacred Cauſe? Is not the Sword of the Spirit our beſt Defence? Solid Arguments and Scriptures, well adapted, are like a Munition of Rocks.</p>
               <p>IF any have laid aſide the Gentleman and the Chriſtian; and Abuſed the Public with Raillery inſtead of Reaſon; Let us remember and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Angel when he was diſputing with Satan: <hi>He dare not bring a railing Accuſation.</hi>—Had this been lawful; yet he forbore. He knew with whom he had to do.—If any have utter'd Falſehoods.—Let us ſhew them their Error, in a friendly manner; with Politeneſs of Speech: and make them aſhamed. In a word; if any have done wrong; yea grievouſly ſtepp'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,—

It certainly becomes us to put on Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where there is any Room for it, &amp; ſuppoſe it was an Error of Judgment, in our Brethren, to which we are all liable: and then, how eaſy, yea how pleaſant a thing is it, for us, with all Kindneſs and Gentleneſs of Spirit, to ſhew them their Miſtake,—to ſet them in the right way, as one would a Weary Traveller, that has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily miſs'd his Road?</p>
