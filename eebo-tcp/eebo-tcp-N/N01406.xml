            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We have had a <hi>dark</hi> and ſorrowful <hi>long Winter</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntimely Deaths</hi> (as we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay) of many of our <hi>dear Children,</hi> and hopeful <hi>Young People.</hi> And now this <hi>last Week</hi> a very <hi>ſudden awful Death</hi> has taken away <hi>One of the fairest Flowers in this Garden of GOD;</hi> One of the moſt <hi>Blooming and Lovely</hi> Children in the <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Land,</hi> whether we ſpeak of <hi>Body or Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wou'd take <hi>this Occaſion</hi> therefore, for the profit both of <hi>Elder</hi> and <hi>Younger</hi> Perſons, to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the <hi>Contemplations</hi> which I have ſometimes had on the <hi>Meaning of Divine Providence,</hi> in ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſtreſſing Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Context</hi> is one of the moſt <hi>mournful Chapters</hi> that you can find in all the <hi>Holy Scripture. Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> the <hi>Weeping Prophet,</hi> does in the moſt <hi>pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> words that <hi>Art</hi> can chuſe and lay together, excite Himſelf and others unto <hi>Holy Sorrow</hi> on the foreſight of the Calamities coming upon <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by the conquering and cruel <hi>Arms</hi> of the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> He wiſhes that <hi>his own Head were Waters, and his Eyes a fountain of Tears, that he might weep day and night, for the ſlain of the Daughter of his People.</hi> He <hi>weeps</hi> for their <hi>Sins,</hi> which he therefore Enumerates; and then He weeps <hi>afreſh</hi> over the proſpect of GOD's <hi>Judgments,</hi> the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Fruit, and dreadful Puniſhment of their Sins: in which he muſt be a <hi>Stock</hi> rather than a
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001671_0010_0FB4E27E3B39DD80"/>
               <hi>Man,</hi> who is not affected with the <hi>Hand and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of</hi> Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>bitter Mourning</hi> in the <hi>Context:</hi> v. 15. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the LORD of Hosts, the GOD of Iſrael; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with Wormwood, and give them water of Gall to drink.</hi> v. 17. <hi>Conſider ye, and call for the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women, that they may come,—and let them make haste, and take up a Wailing for us; that our Eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids guſh out with waters: for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion! How are we ſpoiled! —Hear—O ye Women,— and teach your Daughters wailing, and every one her Neighbour Lamentation: for Death is come up into our Windows, and is entred into our Palaces; to cut off the Children from without, and the Young men from the Streets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can be more <hi>ſoft, paſſionate and moving,</hi> than the <hi>strain</hi> of the Context? and what <hi>wound up</hi> the ſtrings of ſorrow unto this <hi>High Note,</hi> but Death come into their Windows, to cut off the Children and Young people from the Streets! Well does the <hi>Prophet</hi> call for the <hi>tenderest hearts,</hi> and the <hi>ſhrillest voices,</hi> even of <hi>Women,</hi> to raiſe the Lamentation on this account.</p>
            <p>All Divine <hi>Judgments</hi> call for our <hi>Sorrowing</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods Hand and Rod. While God <hi>distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſorrows in his Anger,</hi> our Eyes ſhould <hi>pour out tears</hi> unto God. We ought to <hi>weep</hi> with him that is in <hi>Trouble,</hi> and our <hi>Eyes ſhould mourn</hi> by reaſon
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001671_0011_0FB4E281DE413D40"/>of affliction. But in no <hi>Instance</hi> does <hi>Nature</hi> teach &amp; even force ſorrow, more than in <hi>Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and the Death of Children: This was the voice in <hi>Rama, Rachel weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted,</hi> &amp;c. It was ſaid of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe goeth to the Grave to weep there;</hi> a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly place indeed to draw forth the Tears of Relations.</p>
            <p>But I'm aware that many may be <hi>too apt</hi> of themſelves to <hi>indulge Grief.</hi> I will forbear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Enlarge any further on the <hi>Context.</hi> Death is come up into our <hi>Windows: ſcil.</hi> of the Chambers where the Sick lay. There's no lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Doors againſt this <hi>Officer,</hi> when he comes to Arreſt, or ſerve his Execution. Or rather, as a <hi>Thief</hi> in the Night <hi>Steals in</hi> at the Window, ſo does Death often ſteal as <hi>ſuddenly</hi> into our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ere we are aware. Nor does it enter into the <hi>Cottages of the Poor</hi> only, but into the Houſes of the Rich, the Dwellings of Rulers, and the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Princes.</hi> But that which I ſhall only attend to is, that it ſpares not the <hi>tender pleaſant Children,</hi> nor the hail and <hi>promiſing Youths;</hi> Theſe, a moſt ſad part of its Execution, it <hi>cuts off from the Streets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The <hi>Streets,</hi> where the Young people were wont to <hi>Walk,</hi> and where the Children us'd to <hi>Play.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Obſervation</hi> that I ſhall raiſe from the Words, is this:</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That abundance of the Children of Men, and of our moſt hopeful, pious and promiſing Children do Die Young.</head>
               <p>A very <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>poor, little Obſervation</hi> you'll be ready to ſay; what any <hi>Child</hi> may make, and I would pray <hi>them</hi> to do ſo. I'm ſure, you don't think that I intend to labour in the <hi>proof</hi> of this obvious <hi>Truth,</hi> and Univerſal Experience of Mankind. There is great <hi>Inequality</hi> as to the length of peoples lives here in the Body, tho' at the <hi>longest</hi> the life of man is very <hi>ſhort;</hi> as a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that endureth but a ſhort time. There are the <hi>untimely Births which never ſee the Light:</hi> and many that are <hi>Born alive,</hi> yet only number a <hi>few breaths, hours and days,</hi> and <hi>expire</hi> again, without fulfilling their <hi>Week</hi> or <hi>Month.</hi> What <hi>brittle</hi> and tender things are our <hi>Babes,</hi> and what multitudes die in <hi>Infancy! Delights, lent</hi> us for a year it may be, and then <hi>taken</hi> (we hope) to the Delights of God for ever. In <hi>Childhood</hi> the blooming flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er falls too, and <hi>Autumn</hi> comes almoſt before the <hi>Spring</hi>'s begun. If thro' a million Dangers, mortal to others, we get up to <hi>Youth,</hi> yet how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and often does Death cut down the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>budding plant!</hi> And when from Youth we are got to <hi>Manhood,</hi> even then in the prime of our ſtrength we are often ſnatch away from Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001671_0013_0FB4E28516A98380"/>from Service, and from all Worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Job 21.23. <hi>The number of his months are cut off in the midſt; he dies in his full strength, his Breaſts are full of Milk, and his Bones are moistned with Marrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus is it with the Children of Men; and this <hi>happens alike to all,</hi> both to the <hi>Evil and the Good.</hi> Now my <hi>Deſign</hi> is with Modeſty and Holy Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Enquire into the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of Providence in this particular, which tho' it may ſometimes appear very dark, and be very grievous to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, <hi>yet certainly</hi> is in it ſelf very <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and Holy and Gracious.</p>
               <p>I am to <hi>Obſerve</hi> then, that abundance of our <hi>hopeful and lovely</hi> and promiſing Children, and thoſe top that are <hi>really Pious and Godly</hi> in their Childhood, do Die Young. It always <hi>has been,</hi> and ſtill <hi>is</hi> ſo. Righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> the <hi>first fruits</hi> of fallen Man to God, the firſt <hi>Martyr</hi> for Religion, and the <hi>firſt-born</hi> of the Grave, died young. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> was no <hi>Old Saint</hi> in his Day, tho' ripe for Heaven, when God took him. He died not, it's true, but was the <hi>Earnest</hi> to the Old World of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> The <hi>ten Children of Job,</hi> who we hope Inherited their pious Fathers <hi>Sanctity, and Prayers,</hi> died together in their Youth. Heavy the Tydings to their amazed <hi>Parents—The Houſe fell upon the Young men, and they are dead, and I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am eſcaped alone to tell thee.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Holieſt,</hi> and whom God loves beſt, he takes <hi>ſooneſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001671_0014_0FB4E2875DA90480"/>So it was we know in the peaceful Death of the young Prince <hi>Abijah.</hi> 1 King. 14.13. <hi>He only of Jeroboam ſhall come to the Grave, becauſe in him there was found ſome good thing.</hi> To name no more, Our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf has <hi>ſanctify'd an Early Death</hi> by dying in the <hi>prime</hi> of the Life of Man.</p>
               <p>And now give me leave to do ſome Honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> (as it ſhall enable me) in ordering theſe Early Deaths. It is a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>grievous</hi> to us, lamentable to ſee, and heavy to bear, and ſo it ſhould be; yet we may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the <hi>Divine Government,</hi> no not in <hi>this;</hi> however grievous it be to <hi>Grace and Senſe</hi> together. Let the <hi>Sovereign GOD</hi> call ſoon for them that fear him, and are but beginning to ſerve him, and ſo are likely to honour him, and be Bleſſings in the World; whoſe <hi>Hope and Crown</hi> they are; yet is he eaſily juſtified in his doing, and clear in his judging thus. Now that I may begin right on this <hi>Argument,</hi> which is one of the <hi>deep</hi> things of God; Let me ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Soveraignty of God</hi> is enough, and inſtead of a thouſand Reaſons, to his Creatures in any of the Diſpenſations of his Providence, which may be dark to them. I'm afraid that the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God is not at all conceived of, nor adored by multitudes of Chriſtians, as it ought to be. The <hi>Scripture</hi> every where ſpeaks in the moſt <hi>exalted ſtrains</hi> that can be about it. And when the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations</hi> of God are ſuch as furprize and confound
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001671_0015_0FB4E28A8CE6B430"/>our weak Reaſon and Underſtanding, then very often inſtead of going about to ſatisfy our ſcruples, and level them to our Capacity, it bids us <hi>worſhip,</hi> inſtead of <hi>arguing</hi> about the Unſearchable Councils of Heaven; and contemplating the Greatneſs of God to be <hi>dumb.</hi> So in Gods dealings with his Servant <hi>Job,</hi> when he and his Friends had been contemplating the poſſibility of ſuch Inflictions on an Upright perſon; at laſt <hi>Elihu</hi> takes up the Argument, and reproves them all for preſuming to talk ſo freely of the Great GOD; asking them if God were to give them Account of what He did or could do? or if they muſt be diſſatisfy'd with the Almighty's Actions when ever they could not account for them? He vouchſafes them no other ſatisfaction but the Greatneſs &amp; <hi>Dominion</hi> of God; and when God himſelf ſpake afterward out of the <hi>Whirlwind,</hi> it was in the ſame lofty Style and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; proper to, and worthy of a God. <hi>Job</hi> 33.12, 13, 17.36.22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very juſtly may the Great GOD <hi>diſdain</hi> to let us reaſon with him againſt any Circumſtances which He orders for us, either in reſpect of Life or Death. Shall not the <hi>Clay</hi> ly ſtill under the <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> skilful Hand? <hi>Balaam</hi> was provok'd to ſtand corrected by his <hi>Aſs;</hi> and yet the Aſs taught the Prophet with Juſtice and Mildneſs: Yet <hi>Vain Man,</hi> that is born like the Wild Aſſes Colt, would be wiſe before God, even to reprove his Maker!</p>

                  <item>1. <hi>Life and Death are among thoſe things that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely belong to the Divine Sovereignty.</hi> Who but the God of the Spirits of all fleſh ſhall ſay, when our Souls ſhall come into theſe dwellings of fleſh, and when leave them? The Key of <hi>Hades</hi> is in his Hand, and it is one of the <hi>Inſignia</hi> of his Supream Dominion. The Life he gave is his own, and ſhall he not do what he will with it?</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>God is to be reſigned to even with reſpect to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of preſent Serviceableneſs, or Future Glory.</hi> We ſhould deſire indeed a <hi>Distinction</hi> in both <hi>Worlds,</hi> owning our ſelves unworthy mean while of a Name in either of them.

To do <hi>much</hi> we ſhould always deſire, that we have done <hi>no more,</hi> ſhould be our Humiliation; that we have done <hi>any thing</hi> is matter of Thanksgiving, and if it muſt be no more, we muſt (like our Famous and Eminent Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> when a dying) bleſs God for the leaſt, which we never deſerv'd, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign our elſe deſired Life. If we have any place in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of Glory, we muſt leave it to God to ordain our <hi>magnitude</hi> and <hi>brightneſs</hi> there; and as one <hi>Star differs from another Star in Glory; ſo is the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> Now he that telleth the Number of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and calleth them all by Name, has done the ſame in Numbring the <hi>Elect,</hi> and making them <hi>Veſſels of Honour.</hi>

I proceed now to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Our lovely, gracious Elect Children cannot be too ſoon in Heaven.</hi> Happineſs and Bliſs in the fulneſs and perfection thereof can never come too ſoon. If God takes the Elect <hi>Infant</hi> from the <hi>Mothers Breast,</hi> or the <hi>Fathers Knees,</hi> to Himſelf an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better Father; pray, what loſs is it? How bleſſed is it for the <hi>Babe</hi> that no more days or months were ordained for it in this ſcorching and freezing world of ours! in this world of Sin and Affliction! Will the Babe pine after the Mothers Breaſts, when Angels have taken it in their brighter Arms to carry it to, and lay it in the Boſome of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> the Good Shepherd of Souls, who layes the <hi>Lambs</hi> in his Boſome? Surely 'tis beſt of all to go to an immediate Everlaſting Reſt, ſince God ordains it; never to have felt at all the Evils of guilt or trouble which the Godly are here ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten groaning under! Well then, we are never too young to be happy: Happineſs can never come too ſoon; that <hi>Surprize</hi> muſt at laſt be exceeding <hi>pleaſant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sometimes it has been the deſire and choice of Holy Children, with ſubmiſſion to the Sovereign Pleaſure and Wiſdom of God, not to have a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance here in this World.</hi> This is a rare thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet we lately had an <hi>Inſtance</hi> of it in our Neighbourhood, in that Excellent <hi>Youth,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of Major <hi>Fitch,</hi> whoſe gracious Example, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Death will not be ſoon forgotten. It was
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001671_0018_0FB4E29048BF2E78"/>a pretty frequent <hi>paſſage</hi> with him, that he ſaw little in this World to make one deſire to live long here. 'Twas a ſign that his heart was ſoon and ſtrangely ſet on Heavenly Things. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome very comfortable degrees of hope and <hi>good aſſurance</hi> of our Intereſt in a better Life. There are but few even of the Children of God in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced years, who upon ſettled and weighed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Devotion, arrive unto an <hi>habitual willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to Die. Yet ſome ſtrange <hi>Instances</hi> of it have been found under the Early Impreſſions of Divine Grace: The <hi>fear of Sin,</hi> the longing for <hi>freedom</hi> from it, and the deſire to be <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excuſe even the deſire to be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Reſignation</hi> to God: but the <hi>Glorifying</hi> God on Earth, the Serving our Generation according to the Will of God, and the Believing in the <hi>Alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of the Grace of God to <hi>keep</hi> us thro' the World, muſt make Life when prolonged, not only <hi>eaſie,</hi> but <hi>delightful</hi> to us, and an <hi>Esteemed Mercy</hi> of God to us. Certainly to <hi>abide</hi> in the fleſh is very <hi>needful</hi> and <hi>deſirable,</hi> while <hi>to live is Chriſt:</hi> but when we change this <hi>thought,</hi> and can ſay to our ſelves—<hi>to me to die is Gain,</hi> it may be difficult not to <hi>verge</hi> too much with the Holy <hi>Apostle</hi> in his deſires rather of a diſſolution; &amp; to <hi>groan being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in this Tabernacle; knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> Phil. 21.23. 2 Cor. 5. begin. Some Good People have <hi>wiſh'd</hi> for a <hi>Sudden Death;</hi> but moſt of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001671_0019_0FB4E291C10EFF00"/>of God with great Reaſon joyn rather in that part of our <hi>Littany,</hi> to be <hi>preſerved from it.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it very much takes away the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of the Diſpenſation, when it comes to be the matter of a devout perſons deſire and choice. But theſe are Extraordinary <hi>Caſes,</hi> not to be bro't into <hi>Example,</hi> nor to be commended to our Imitation; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be inſiſted on.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Poſſibly God may have conſulted the Spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a deſirable and gracious Child in its Early Death.</hi> I mean both in reſpect of <hi>Grace</hi> here, and <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter. Had the Child lived, you know how certainly it had been <hi>expoſed</hi> in this place of ſin, temptation and danger: what from the <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> latent Indwelling Sin, and that <hi>Adder in the Path,</hi> the Devi and Satan; what from an Inſnaring World, and the luſting fleſh reſiſting the <hi>Spirit</hi> in all its heavenly deſires. It is a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of great happineſs to be once ſafely paſt all theſe <hi>hazards,</hi> &amp; out of the reach of theſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies and <hi>fiery darts;</hi> never to be tempted, nor to ſin more; but to be confirm'd in a State of Grace, and aſcertain'd, poſſeſs'd of Everlaſting Happineſs. Now God only knows how little a longer time might have been improved; how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle might have been got by it, how much might have indeed been ſuffered by it. It is a ſad truth, but a certain one, <hi>that many Good people have found little or no advantage to their Spirtual Life by length of time.</hi> They were Converted young, it may be,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001671_0020_0FB4E2933ACE69B0"/>and if they had died young, they had been in the ſame place in Heaven, if not in a better, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving liv'd to more years. How often have people gone backward, quench'd the Spirit of Grace, and hurt their own Souls. Take the Inſtance of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> how gloriouſly did he begin, and outſhone in Grace, as he did in Wiſdom and Dignity: He was the <hi>Wonder</hi> of the Church, as his <hi>Temple</hi> was of the World: He went before the very <hi>Ministers</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Lords Prophets in zeal and in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and now had he died young, his Grace had been without a <hi>stain</hi> upon it: but he liv'd to ſhow the <hi>frailty</hi> of the Greateſt <hi>Saint</hi> in a State of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Affluence,</hi> and the hazard there is from <hi>Senſual Objects</hi> in our greateſt Attainments here below. I dare not preſume to think whether his fall has put him a great way <hi>back</hi> in the Liſt of the Glorify'd, his Repentance and Recovery being glorious in our Eyes; but certainly if his <hi>Graces</hi> had not been brighter above, had he died in his unſpotted youth, and before his fall, yet had his <hi>Name</hi> among Saints on Earth been ſo.</p>
               <p>We are <hi>Sailing</hi> in a very tempeſtuous and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sea,</hi> like <hi>Mariners</hi> that ſometimes ſet out with a fair and ſtrong <hi>Gale,</hi> and make half their Paſſage in a few days; but then they meet with ſome rough contrary Winds that force 'em <hi>to Ly by</hi> at leaſt, if they are not <hi>driven back,</hi> and have many a League to meaſure over again, if ever they <hi>make</hi> their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at all. If the <hi>Ship</hi> ſpring a <hi>leak,</hi> tho' it do
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001671_0021_0FB4E2998A840C10"/>not founder, but after many hardſhips the <hi>Port</hi> is gained, yet the Loſs and Damage ſuſtained is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very much. So are there many that Set out well in their Youth, and at laſt get to Heaven, but it is ſorely <hi>ſhatter'd</hi> and <hi>broken,</hi> through their falls before one temptation and another in their way. The Floods do not <hi>drown</hi> them in perdition, but yet thro' their ill Conduct and fooliſh Management much of their rich Freight and Lading is <hi>damnify'd</hi> and thrown Overboard. They can ſhow the <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> they once had put aboard them, but alas, <hi>canker'd</hi> and marr'd now: they are not when they die, even what they were in their early years, but their <hi>Beauty</hi> marr'd by the advance of <hi>Age;</hi> which tho' it be natural to the <hi>Body,</hi> yet it is unnatural to the <hi>Immortal Soul.</hi> They die <hi>Penitents</hi> it's true, but not <hi>Proficients;</hi> and tho' they get to Heaven at laſt, yet no higher there than if they had died in their younger days.</p>
               <p>Upon all, ſay, if it is not very poſſible that God may graciouſly have conſulted the Spiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of many an Elect Veſſel of Mercy, in their Early Death. We have no <hi>foreſight</hi> of things to come, but God has the moſt perfect that can be; and tho' there's no foreſight of Grace in the Saints before it is given, but only in the purpoſe of God to give it, for in our corrupt nature it never could be at all but of his free Gift; yet in the beſt of Saints there's an eaſie foreſight to us all of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ready to break out upon all Occaſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Some God <hi>permits</hi> for wiſe Ends, and the Good of others, to live and ſhew the prevalency of Corruption in them, againſt ſuitable ſtrivings and meaſures of his Grace; and others God <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi> from being like Inſtances and <hi>Sufferers,</hi> by a happy Early Death. And tho' he does not ſay, as to particular perſons (and leſs may we) that this is his End; yet poſſibly it may be ſo in the very <hi>Inſtances</hi> we are mourning over. Indeed for ought we know, had they liv'd they wou'd have <hi>grown</hi> in Grace more and more; and it is meet for us to ſuppoſe and hope it wou'd have been ſo: but 'tis as true, that for ought we know it wou'd have been otherwiſe: and it is not at all <hi>amiſs</hi> for us to ſatisfy our ſelves after this <hi>manner;</hi> when the matter is neceſſarily left ſo <hi>doubtful</hi> to us, and <hi>hazardous.</hi> But ſo much for this particular.</p>

                  <hi>Long Life</hi> here in this World is unavoidably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>many Sorrows,</hi> eſpecially if a perſon be pious and devout.

               <p n="6">6. Many things reſpecting the <hi>Nature of Saving Grace</hi> are to be <hi>learn'd</hi> from, and are <hi>ſeen</hi> in the <hi>Early Deaths</hi> of pious and hopeful Young people. As,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>It ſhows us that Grace intends not to ſecure us a long Life here in the Body.</hi> No, it is the <hi>aſſimilation</hi> of the Soul unto another Life, and its <hi>preparation</hi> for it: it is to <hi>wean</hi> the Soul from the ſenſitive life, and to <hi>raiſe</hi> it above the ſame: it <hi>points</hi> the Soul unto the life of ſpirits in holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is <hi>to come;</hi> and on no pretence therefore can it fix the heart down in any deſires or proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of living long here. Indeed, <hi>Grace never ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any ones life here,</hi> but has prolong'd rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a <hi>mans; length of days are in her right hand</hi> and <hi>long life ſhall ſhe add unto thee:</hi> Prov. 3.16. There is nothing in a principle of Grace and Holy living, but what tends to the preſervation and lengthening
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001671_0025_0FB4E2A0C0ED6D40"/>out of mans life. It bears antipathy to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of all thoſe <hi>Intemperances</hi> and vicious <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,</hi> which ſhorten mens days. It does by <hi>trust and prayer</hi> commit us to the care &amp; bleſſing of the God of our lives. It deſires to live to his Glory; and it ſecures to us that ſo far as God ſees it beſt for us, we ſhall live in his world. But no further can a principle of Grace look to a continuance of the preſent life. No, the firſt and chief <hi>Relation</hi> of Divine Grace, and <hi>Benefit</hi> from it is unto a life to come. Col. 3.3. <hi>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in GOD.</hi> The <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> only is worthy to be called <hi>our Life;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> is hid with <hi>Christ;</hi> as the life of the <hi>Branches</hi> is hid in the <hi>Root:</hi> So are our Hopes for Eternity depoſited and laid up with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven.</item>
                     <item>2. Again, The Death of pious Children teaches us this alſo of a <hi>Principle of Grace, that where it once is, the Soul is ſafe.</hi> Let Death come as <hi>ſoon</hi> as it will after a perſons <hi>Coverſion,</hi> when once a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Change has paſſed on him, be he never ſo young, the Soul is ſafe. It is indeed <hi>very deſirable</hi> to us on many accounts, that there be ſome good <hi>ſpace</hi> granted to us for the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Grace, and the <hi>Actings</hi> of the Regenerate Life: that ſo <hi>the Great GOD</hi> may have ſome Honour and Service from us, the fruits of that Grace which He hath Implanted in us; and <hi>we</hi> ſome good Evidence and hope of His Grace in us, and of our Title to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; that ſo we may at laſt die in peace and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001671_0026_0FB4E2AB8664BFD0"/>
                        <hi>Comfort</hi> as well as <hi>Safety.</hi> But this is not <hi>abſolutely neceſſary:</hi> and a perſon really dies in peace, in a State of Salvation, and goes to Heaven, if a Change be truly wro't in the Soul, tho' God do not ſpare him any length of time to bring forth the fruits of his Grace. And the Early Deaths of pious <hi>Ones</hi> may ſatisfie us, <hi>That Salvation depends not on length of time for the continued Exerciſe of Grace;</hi> tho' it be in its ſelf a Favour of GOD greatly to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if it may be His Will.</item>
                     <item>3. Hence alſo does it evidently appear, <hi>that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not of Works, but of Free Grace altogether.</hi> If it were of Works of Righteouſneſs wro't by us, it were much to be apprehended that they who die young could never be ſaved. If <hi>Infants</hi> are ſaved, it muſt be of free Grace, fortheſe can have no <hi>Works</hi> of their own: no, not ſo much as one <hi>Act of Faith</hi> are they capable of: and yet <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Multitudes of <hi>them</hi> are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd and juſtify'd, and taken to Heaven. In ſome proportion it is thus with him that dies young: ſuppoſe within the <hi>Month</hi> or the <hi>Year</hi> wherein the Grace of God has taken hold of his Heart; when he is but juſt beginning to live to GOD, is but turning to Him in his own apprehenſion, and by his own confeſſion has done nothing for Him; but was beiginning he hop'd in earneſt to think of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, &amp; <hi>Now</hi> muſt be gone: However, he dies in Chriſt and goes to Him: but then how rich and free is that Grace which ſaves him? <hi>Where
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001671_0027_0FB4E2AEC9ECDCF0"/>is Boasting?</hi> Where is any life of working ſo much as to be imagined?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore to finiſh this <hi>Head, How amiable and adorable doth this render ſaving Grace to us!</hi> that however young we die, 'tis poſſible to be ſaved by it; that how ſoon ſoever it takes poſſeſſion of us, it puts us into a ſecure and happy Sate. O how lovely and deſirable a thing then is it! how very valuable and precious!</p>
               <p>See you <hi>One</hi> that has but juſt begun to ſeek and ſerve GOD, and GOD has ſo ſuddenly, inſtantly, preſently rewarded and glorified him! when CHRIST his <hi>Judge</hi> ſhall name this <hi>Child</hi> with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the <hi>Last Day,</hi> what can it anſwer?— LORD, when did I ever ſerve Thee? What did I ever do for Thee? From the day that thy Grace found me, I had not a year, not a month, not a week (it may be) allowed me to live to honour Thee! No, Gracious LORD! in the day almoſt wherein thou didſt pleaſe to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> me thou didſt alſo <hi>Glorifie</hi> me. E'er I cou'd find thy <hi>Grace</hi> in my <hi>Soul,</hi> I found my ſelf <hi>taken</hi> to thy <hi>Glory;</hi> and as I was but beginning to <hi>ſeek</hi> thy Mercy, I found my ſelf Embraced in the <hi>Arms</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>O what ſhould render GOD &amp; His Grace more amiable to us, than his glorifying it after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the young Penitent, the <hi>Infant Saint!</hi> No ſooner born from <hi>Above,</hi> than taken <hi>Thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> The Death of thoſe that are pious and gracious in their Youth <hi>is of excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and

               <p>Let me then <hi>Obſerve,</hi> and ſo make the proper <hi>Application</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> in this <hi>Illustration</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That to be ſure in the Early Death of pious Children, there are many Uſeful <hi>Admonitions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thoſe that are Young.</hi> Younger <hi>Friends and Relatives</hi> ſhould take the <hi>Warnings</hi> of GOD, which are <hi>firstly and directly</hi> meant to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You</hi> muſt be admoniſh'd, <hi>O Young Perſon,</hi> that you your ſelf <hi>may die ſoon and ſuddenly</hi> likewiſe. You ſhould never ſee one of your <hi>Own Age</hi> buried, or one younger than your ſelf die, but you ſhould ſeriouſly think—'It might have been <hi>my turn</hi> as well, or mine may be the <hi>next,</hi> and within a <hi>few</hi> days (if not to <hi>day</hi> or to <hi>morrow</hi>) I may follow. What am I better than my <hi>Companion?</hi> or it may be my life is not of half the worth that <hi>his</hi> or <hi>hers</hi> was! nor has been half ſo well improved or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed! or if it has, yet this makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; ſince the <hi>best</hi> die young.</p>
               <p>See one proof of that <hi>Truth,</hi> Pſal. 39.5. <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye very man at his beſt Eſtate is altogether Vanity.</hi>

Yet in this <hi>Vigour</hi> of Nature and Grace both, may we ſuddenly expire and vaniſh away.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Early Religion is the highest Wiſdom, and Interest of all the Children of men;</hi> the moſt <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi> and neceſſary thing that can be. You can never begin too ſoon to think of your Souls, ſince you may every day look to die. This alone ought to awaken you to <hi>remember your Creator</hi> in the days of your Youth, and as you enter upon this life, to chuſe that <hi>Good part</hi> which can never be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you; and to <hi>Seek first</hi> the Kingdom of GOD, and his Righteouſneſs. The <hi>Funeral</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every <hi>Infant</hi> or <hi>Child,</hi> calls all the Children in the <hi>Streets</hi> to be thinking of, and preparing for their own Death: for if you are not too young to <hi>Die,</hi> neither are you to be <hi>Religious,</hi> and to make your Souls your care.</p>
               <p>It <hi>warns</hi> you now in your Youth, that you <hi>need better Friends &amp; Dependance</hi> than any in this World, and a better <hi>Portion</hi> than this World can ſlatter you withal.

                  <hi>Children!</hi> Let me put it to you, whether you have ever yet began to think of your <hi>Souls,</hi> your <hi>Sins,</hi> your <hi>Saviour,</hi> your <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> your <hi>Dying Hour,</hi> and of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Do you <hi>pray,</hi> do you fear to ſin, do you take any care to be Saved?
