            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Scribes and Pharisees bare inveterate malice against Christ, for his searching Doctrines, by which he detected them of gross Hypocrisy: and the more confirmation he gave thereunto by his Miracles, the deeper rooting did their prejudice take in their hearts; and because his spotless Conversation secured him from any impeachment, reserring to the Law of God: they sought occasion against him with respect to the Customs of men: accordingly in the begining of this chapter, they are brought

But also, as it was, in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it, a thing unlawful for them to do; as the whole of his reply carrieth it: This Custom among the Jews was not a thing meerly civil, but was made Religious, and had a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Holiness affixed to it, and by prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was now grown a Ceremony in Worship; and men were esteemed Ceremonially defiled, who did not attend it; and by this means it became unlawful.</p>
            <p>Christ in his reply, useth Arguments <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> and <hi>ad rem.</hi> 1. <hi>Ad hominem;</hi> verse 3. to 7 they of all men, had no reason to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for they were notorious Offenders, in that they <hi>had made void the command of God by their
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000585_0004_0FA958151A4C9AE0"/>
Traditions:</hi> which he exemplifies in the fifth <hi>Command,</hi> they had their <hi>beams in their own eyes,</hi> and therefore very unfit to <hi>pluck out Motes in others,</hi> if there were any. 2. <hi>Ad rem,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He discovers the Hypocrisy of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Worship, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He instructs the Auditory in the vanity of this particular Tradition, <hi>vers</hi> 10, to 21.</p>
            <p>In his Taxing them with Hypocrisy, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to the Prophet, who had laid the same charge to their Fore-fathers, for the very same reason: and it refers to, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 13. Here are two things in which this their Hypocrisy is detected.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their putting of God off with Lip Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whilst their hearts were absent, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their introducing of Humane Institutions into the Worship of God.</p>
            <p>In the words then there are two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The sin which is here reproved; <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Doctrines the Commandments of men,</hi> i. e. introducing Humane Institutions into, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them parts of Divine Worship:</p>
            <p>Here observe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The subject matter about which this Sin was conversant; <hi>The Commandments of men;</hi> i. e. mens Inventions, by which he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand civil Laws respecting civil Government; for they were not wont to be men's Texts to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000585_0005_0FA95817D94FBC80"/>
Preach upon, and as for the Authority of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to Enact such Laws; Christ never called it into question: Nor yet can he intend the <hi>civil Sanctions</hi> which are put upon <hi>Divine Institutions</hi> by Humane Authority, for this also is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted warrantable, as well from Scripture-precept, as the Example of Godly Rulers in all the Ages of the Church of God; but that which he intends, is <hi>things devised by men, and imposed as parts of Worship, which are no where commanded by God:</hi> such a thing was this under debate, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the washing of the hands before meat.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The sin which he chargeth them with on this account, <hi>Teaching Doctrines.</hi> The word translated, <hi>Teaching,</hi> is used in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>Preaching the Gospel;</hi> and the word translated, <hi>Doctrines,</hi> is used for the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> it therefore intends, a Preaching of these up, as matters of Conscience, and binding them upon men as Duties incumbent on them, on whatsoever pretext They were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> whom our Saviour had now to do withal; who pretended to be Teachers of others; it was therefore a special sin they were under the guilt of, that they bound these burdens on mens Consciences, by pleading mens authority to make Traditions, and impose them upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but he also insinuates, that, as it was their sin to teach such things to the people; so
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000585_0006_0FA95B320A2EE730"/>
it was, no less a sin in others to receive, and practice according to such Teachings: for this whole Discourse is brought in to justify his Disciples for Non-compliance with them; and himself for prohibiting them so to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reproof it self is contained in the sharp censure which he passeth upon this sin; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that it is <hi>vain worship.</hi> The word signifies that which is <hi>to no purpose, frivolous, lost labour,</hi> that will do the person no good at all, which is idle and impertinent; and it may have respect either:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the worship it self, that it is foolish, and therefore not to be admitted; or,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the Worshippers, that they do spoil their whole Worship by such Additaments, it makes all the rest to be to little or no purpose; it is a dead fly in the Oyntment.</p>
            <p>From the words we may rationally infer this:</p>
            <div type="doctrine_and_exegesis">
               <head>DOCTRINE</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mens Institutions cannot be admitted and practiced in the Worship of God, without incurring the guilt of a very great sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not only a sin committed by them that invent, and appoint them, nor only by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000585_0007_0FA95B32C686D660"/>
them that preach, them up, and tye them upon mens Consciences; of which, it is not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business to treat; but it is also no small sin in those that comply with, and yield confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to them.</p>
               <p>In the clearing up of this Doctrine; we may enquire,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What we are here to understand by the Institutions of men?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherein the sin under consideration doth consist?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How it appears to be so very great a Sin?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What we are here to understand by the Institutions of men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whatsoever is made a part of Religious Worship, wholly by Humane Authority. Here we must observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The head which it properly refers to, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>Religious worship.</hi> There are the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men, which we are in the Scripture Commanded to yield Obedience unto, and that for <hi>Conscience sake:</hi> Civil Government is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of Gods, appointment; and as Rulers ought to make the moral Law the Rule of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, so there are divers Prudentials about which they have authority from God, to enact such Laws as are most conducible to the benefit of their Subjects: but this is of another nature, Now in worship we consider, either the <hi>object of it,</hi> and that is God only, or the matter and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000585_0008_0FA95B366DAFA9D8"/>
                  <hi>Media,</hi> and they are either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Institut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> the latter of these is here specially respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> those external ways and means by which this Worship is to be paid unto God: these are in Scripture called <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Commands,</hi> by a special appropriation: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so, they must depend upon some Authority that doth command them, and this must both appoint and give a Sanction to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reference which it bears to this head; it is made a part of it, we are warily to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between that which is <hi>Essential,</hi> and that is meerly <hi>accidental,</hi> or a common adjunct: Man is to be considered, not only as he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, but also as he is a man: and in this last respect, there are many things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from his actions, and for that reason, are common to all both <hi>natural, civil,</hi> and <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:</hi> such as <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and what else of like nature: and therefore their consideration in Religion is not Essential, but Accidental to it, and that have a meer civil respect in it: and are directed to by the Law of nature, and common prudence is to direct men in their <hi>usage</hi> of them; though these also, when they have a religious respect put on them, are made es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, and come under the things our Saviour here refers to: But a thing may then be said to be made a part of Worship, when it hath such an <hi>Holiness</hi> put upon it, as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000585_0009_0FA95B36A952FEA8"/>
a <hi>medium</hi> of our <hi>Communion with God:</hi> and this is not to be judged of, by what men say of it, but by the necessary consequence of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> usage of it: of this nature were all the Observances of the Ceremonial Law of Old, &amp; they continued to be such, till such time as Christ abolished them; and such was this usage which he here condemns in our Content: it was not the washing of their hands at meals, as it was a point of civility and outward clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, that our Saviour was offended at, or would ever have found fault withall; but it was for their placing of a <hi>Ceremonial Holiness</hi> in this <hi>Tradition,</hi> thinking that God was a great deal more Honoured by them that did it, than by such as omitted it: which Opinion of theirs removed it from among <hi>Civils,</hi> and placed it among <hi>religious</hi> things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When its being so made depends wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Humane Authority. <hi>Natural Worship</hi> is such as the nature of the object to whom, &amp; of the subject by whom it is to be performed, doth require, and is therefore taught by the light of nature: such is Prayer to God, fearing and reverencing him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Instituted Worship,</hi> is something that is <hi>positive,</hi> and must needs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depend upon some Authority: it is for that reason a duty, because it is enjoyned, and must suppose a power in him who doth enjoyn it, so to do: Now a thing may be said to be made by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000585_0010_0FA95B381D7C9D50"/>
the Institutions of men, when not only the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> but also the <hi>devising</hi> of it proceeds from them. In this respect <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is said to <hi>offer Sacrifice in a month which he devised in his own heart, I Kings</hi> 12. ult. not only the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the thing imposed derives from men; they first invent, and then they command it: and it may be said thus to be commanded, not only when lawful authority do pass it into an Ordinance, and give it a Sanction, by affixing penalties to the neglect of it; but also, when by Custom or Tradition, it is so brought into practice of a people, that it becometh a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to any that shall omit it, and they are looked upon to be irreligious for not carefully complying with it; and such was the present case in our Context;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein the sin under our consideration doth consist?</p>
               <p>A. 1. <hi>We may consider it negatively,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth not necessarily suppose a change of the object; though it may be so interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, for <hi>God is not pleased to acknowledge that to be done to him, which is not done by his order,</hi> but still, it may be professedly devoted to the honour of the true God, so was that feast, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 5. Men may pretend a <hi>true object,</hi> and yet use a <hi>false medium:</hi> it is left as a mark of infamy upon the Jews, that they <hi>offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000585_0011_0FA95B38D1623200"/>
in the high places,</hi> (places which they had consecrated of their own heads, and put holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon;) although it <hi>it was only to the true God,</hi> 2 Chron. 33. 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor are they only guilty, that wholly lay aside the institutions of God, and surrogate the Inventions of men in their room. The Jews, under their greatest Apostasy, kept up Temple-worship, observed the days that were of Gods own appointment, attended on the stated feasts, offered those sacrifices which had been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by <hi>Moses,</hi> though possibly they (were not so carefull and constant in them,) but they tacked their own Traditions to them, and so made a mixture of one and the other, men may go to the House of God, and attend upon his Worship in those Ordinances which he hath Instituted, and they may annex unto them a worship which he never gave any Order about: the men that offered in the high places, came to the Temple too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Positively, in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When men have any manner of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with such a worship as this is. Any thing wherein we partake with others, in that which is sinful, is a sin, and renders us guilty of that very sin; hence we have that Dehortation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

the unfruitful works of Darkness,</hi> and men do contract such a fellowship, more ways then one; it is done, not only by performing the same things, our selves, and placing Religion upon them, but by our being present at such Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and thereby Joyning in it with them that so do, and so far, countenancing of them in it: Our presence being a signal Approbation, whilst we no ways reprove it; or by our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for such things as lawful in themselves, and therefore not absolutely to be condemned in those that practise them, or by our allowing of those that are under our watch and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to give their attendance on such a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as that is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we pin our faith for any part of Worship that we do perform, on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of men. Suppose the thing it self be really a part of the worship which is of Divine Institutions, yet if we do not <hi>search the Scriptures to see whether it be indeed so</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-wise, as those <hi>Noble Bereans</hi> did, for which they are commended, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17. 11. but contentedly take it upon trust, and all the pretence we can plead for our doing of it, is that such and such, Holy, wise, able, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men so practised, we incur this censure justly; I know there is a good respect to be had for such men, and great use to be made of them; but still, if their authority, and so say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000585_0013_0FA95B3A4A95E660"/>
be the Basis on which we lay the stress of our practice, and the highest reason we can give for it, this is to worship God, not for his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but on Humane Authority; so that though it should be Gods Worship in it self, yet it becomes man's institution as it is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How it app<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> to be so very great a Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it is really a sin thus to do, will be evident by making it out to be a great sin; and that will be cleared by considering of those Rules by which the greatness of a sin is to be judged of, which I shall here instance only in three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may judge of the greatness of it by the dishonour that is done to God by it: All sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its true denomination in <hi>that it is against God,</hi> and the malignity of it doth properly consist; in that it is a coming <hi>short of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> and for this cause, the more he is dishon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured by it, the more agravated it must needs be.</p>
               <p>Now there are these considerations that may be had of of this sin in this respect.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000585_0014_0FA95B3B13AFCB80"/>
1. That it is a sin against the <hi>Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of the first Table.</p>
               <p>Now All sins that are against the first Table, are more directly against God; he being the next and immediate object of it, whereas the next object of Second Table Duties is our Neighbour, all the Duties of this Table are to be done by us, not only for him as our Lord, and Law-giver for so are the other also, but to him, as he on whom they are to Terminate; if then we pray, we must pray to God, if we fast we are to do it to him; that therefore is the fault foun<hi>d</hi> in them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>that they did it not to him.</hi> Now the second command hath a proper aim at instructing us about insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worship: In the first we are told whom we are to Worship, and what is that Natural Worship which is due to him; in the second, What manner of Worship he will have paid him by us; it therefore enjoyns us to take his Directions in it, and to receive the Command from his mouth, not daring <hi>to add to, or to take away any thing from it,</hi> hence there are so many serious and solemn cautions given about it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. 12, 32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30 6. &amp; elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hence it is a Sin that is directly against the <hi>Divine Prerogative:</hi> when God gave his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commandment, to his people of old, he was pleased to set his name to them, as a King doth to his Royal edicts; <hi>I Am the LORD:</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000585_0015_0FA95B3BCB7FC190"/>
herein manifestly intimating that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all such Institutions depends, entirely upon his Prerogative, that the Obligation of them lies in his being Lord and Law-giver to his People, so that for any to undertake in this matter to make any ordinances of their own heads in worship, and bind them upon mens Consciences, is an Invasion upon his Soveraignty, of which he is very tender; and who shall Dare to fetch the warrant for the practising of any thing of this nature from any authority inferiour unto his? must not this of necessity be to put men upon Gods, Throne; and what can that be lesse then an act of Treachery or Rebellion against the Crown of Heaven? and what deeper died a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish can sin have Charged upon it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It casts a great Reproach upon <hi>the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> He hath made no small displays of his wisdom, in contriving the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will be worshipped by his Creatures, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and sufficiently to answer his end, by Gaining to himself Glory, and procuring the Salvation of his Chosen: and for this reason <hi>Israel</hi> of old were said to be a <hi>wise people;</hi> on account of their enjoying <hi>his Ordinances, Deut.</hi> 5 6. but herein we make men wiser than God, whilst our thus practising declares us to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that they can Meliorate his worship, by their adding of those things to it, as if men
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000585_0016_0FA95B3C8EA0A100"/>
knew better than he, what is most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to his Glory and our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It casts a great reflection upon the <hi>Eaithfulness of Christ in his Church.</hi> Moses was a Type of Christ, and herein doth the Apostle make the parallel between the Type and the Antitype, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>that he was Faithful to him that appointed him, as Moses was in all his House.</hi> And this hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar respect unto Instituted Worship, Now we find that <hi>Moses</hi> prescribed, by Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, the whole of that in the times of the Law, even to the very <hi>Pins</hi> and <hi>Taches,</hi> and <hi>fillets;</hi> of the Tabernacle, and all this Exactly <hi>according to the Pattern given him in the Mount, so as that nothing</hi> was wanting, or might be added: and thus must Christ have done in the Gospel Church, or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Parallel will not hold, but the Type must outshine the Antitype, which it never did; that therefore was a Prophefy of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel times though delivered in Old-Testament. Language, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43 11. <hi>shew them the form of the house, and the fashion therof, and the going out therof, and the comings in therof, and all the forms therof, and all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances therof, and all the forms therof, and all the Laws therof, and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form therof, and all the Ordinances therof, and do them:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000585_0017_0FA95B3D485AE2B0"/>
thus to do, is to signifie that we acknowledg and believe that Christ hath omitted somthing that is Essential to his Worship.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is to <hi>impose upon God, and</hi> that is a great sin. We do nothing less herein, than to give Laws to the great King, from whose mouth we ought to receive all. Acts of worship are designed for Communion between God and his people; and he hath promised to them that do rightly worship him, that <hi>he will be among them and bless them;</hi> which is their great encouragement to give attendance to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, because there is a blessing in them; but God hath obliged himself no farther than to his own Appointments; whereas in those things we say, that God shall come and hold Communion with us in Mens Prescriptions, that these shalld oblige his presence with us; for without this supposal, Ordinances must lose their proper end; and this must needs be the highest arrogancy that can be.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence it is a <hi>vain Worship,</hi> so it is called, <hi>Text,</hi> and this must needs denominate it sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. To do any thing in vain, is folly, but to Worship God in vain, is gross iniquity; and what less than <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>in must that of necessity be, in which we can promise to our selves no fellowship with God, or participation in his grace, except he will for our pleasure, lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his Prerogative, and submit himself to the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000585_0018_0FA95B3FABD2EAF8"/>
prescriptions of men? if men only were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon, it were not so much; but to think to impose upon God, is in it self-presumption, and will prove ruine in the event.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may judge of the greatness of this sin, by the Displeasure of God which appears against it; it can be no little provocation, that God manifests his sore indignation at, &amp; this discovers it self.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Jealousy</hi> which he entertains on this account. Where is it that he declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a <hi>Jealous God,</hi> but in the matters of Instituted Worship? Exod. 20 5. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>Jealousy is the rage of a man;</hi> when therefore God assumes it to himself, it must needs intimate his great indignation; a person is not wont to be jealous, but in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he placeth a very high account up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consequently looks upon himself to be basely abused, if he be touched in that; and thus doth God in point of this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to have the acknowledgment from his people, that he alone hath the ordering of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of his Worship.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the awful <hi>Threatnings</hi> which he hath Denounced against this sin, we find that he hath menaced <hi>Generations to come,</hi> that they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000585_0019_0FA95B4122C57958"/>
hall feel the smart of their <hi>Fathers</hi> prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this account, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. We see therefore how he threatnens the ten Tribes for <hi>waking</hi> of <hi>many Altars,</hi> and <hi>building of Temples,</hi> Hos 8 11, 14. the summe is, this sin should icrease their guilt, till it had root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out; yea, when <hi>Israel</hi> had made the Golden Calf, which was a new mode of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and the Feast held to it, is called a <hi>Feast to Jehovah,</hi> Exod. 32. 5. God both plagued them at present for it, and also threatens them to keep it in remembrance against them for afterwards, verse 4 The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore have an observation, <hi>That no Judgment ever after fell upon that people, but it had an Ounce of the Golden Calf in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the severe <hi>Judgements</hi> which he hath executed upon men for this sin it is well to be Remarked, that the first quarrel that ever God had with mankind, was about Instituted worship; and a transgression of a positive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept referring to the Worship of God, in a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> hath filled the world with all the miseries which to this day it groans under. <hi> Nadah and Abihu</hi> will offer up Incense unto God with strange fire, and it brought them to a strange and sudden end, <hi>Gideon'</hi>s <hi>Epnod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

his <hi>golden Calves</hi> to the Worship of God, and it rooted out every branch of his family, and at length carried the whole Land into Captivity. And these things are written for our Learning; the <hi>Jealousie</hi> of God hath many times <hi>burnt like a fire,</hi> and consumed root and branch of such as have thus tempted him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may also be seen in the <hi>harm</hi> that men do to themselves by it; and this is consequent upon the former. Men <hi>sin against their own <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> by thus doing; and that is a great sin; and this harm will especially appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They certainly lose all the labour and cost that they lay out upon such Worship; this also is implied in casting of it <hi>Vain Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> and this loss bring unknown damage along with it. It matters of Worship, men are more peculiarly concerned for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own Salvation; it is therefore a Spiritual Loss that men sustain by this: if they worshipped God aright, how much might they forward their everlasting good by it? for it would afford them the opportunity of the nearest Communion with God, that is to be enjoyed before such time as the <hi>Glass</hi> shall be removed, and he be <hi>seen face to face;</hi> but now they do nothing at all towards this: they do but trifle in matters of Eternity: and by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000585_0021_0FA95B42962A8B98"/>
reason of this they come to sustain an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Loss.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hazards our losing the good of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of God. The words of our Text seems to intimate, as if the whole Worship were rendred <hi>vain</hi> by this mixture, and truly it cannot be denied to be a Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to withdraw that blessing from his own Institutions, which hath its absolute dependance upon his Influence, with respect to those that are fond of interweawing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions with them; nay, usually, when they lay themselves out so much upon these, they too often neglect the right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the other; and are not seldom punished by God, in being left to fall into all sorts of <hi>Immoralities:</hi> this sin very seldome goes alone, but is wont to have a Train of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grievous sins attending upon it; and this is according to God's fore-warning, Psal. 81. 11, 12. <hi>Israel would none of me, so I gave them up to their own hearts lusts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Men by thus doing, expose themselves to the danger of being deprived of Gods Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, when men cannot rest satisfied with Gods appointments, but they must have more, and such as come out of a mint which hath no warrant for the Coining them; he often

Righteously takes these away from them; partly by leaving them gradually to lay them aside, first one, and then another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may be, both cannot be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently attended; Mens Commandments, Thrust out Gods Institutions; The <hi>Altar of Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> justles away the <hi>Brazen Altar,</hi> and it must now be put in a corner, &amp; serve only for some private Devotions; partly by bringing of Desolating Judgments which lay all wast: thus the Kingdom of Judah, in time lost their Temple, and Altar, and Sacrifices, and were carried into a fearful Captivity, and this sin was a leading one to the procuring of these Dismal Calamities.</p>

than <hi>washing one's hand</hi> in order to eating our food; the thing hath no harm in it at all; yea, it may sometimes occasionally be a point of cleanliness and good manners to do it, when the not doing it would be offensive to our own and others Stomachs: but if this once come to have <hi>Religion</hi> put upon it, and it must be accounted a Note of greater Sanctity in them that do it, and a Token of unholiness in such as neglect it, exposing them to scandal, now Christ will by no means admit that his Disciples should practise it: Had it been only a civil custome of the Nation, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have found fault with it, such as was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them water to wash their feet, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reflects on him: <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 44 but he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and condemns this, and good reason, for it is <hi>vain,</hi> a man can get no good by it, nor do God any honour with it; it therefore doth not serve to any end or purpose at all, but wholly falls short of the very design of Worship: a plea therefore from, indifferency in the thing is vain, for the excusing, much more for the warranting of any Tradition, which by the commandment of men <hi>loseth its indifferency, and is tied as a burden on mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000585_0024_0FA95B44C72D72B8"/>
Instituted Worship must be able to prove its Legitimacy by Institution, for, because it a not natural but positive, it depends upon Authority: its obligation therefore can be of no greater strength than the Authority of its Author, can put upon it; &amp; that must be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his right to command it; all instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons derive their Authority, either from God, or the Creature: if it be from <hi>G</hi>od, then he hath signified his mind about it in scripture, and that in particular; for he hath no where by any general indulgence given away this Liberty of his to any other Authority in the world, to have the dominion of the Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, or to give rules of worship; but hath on the one hand strongly prohibited it and severely threatned any that shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to do it; if then any such derive from men let them shew their Authority, if they expect them to be entertained; The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing of any part of worship belongs to the <hi>second,</hi> and not to the <hi>fifth Command;</hi> and must for that reason have a Divine War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Hence it follows that there is nothing to be received by us on this account, but what hath God's Seals affixt to it: it is thersore enough to set us down, resolved against any such thing, if we can say there is a silence about it in the scripture; that God hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Commanded it, in his word, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
