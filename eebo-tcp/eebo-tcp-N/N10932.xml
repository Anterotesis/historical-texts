            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fortune had moſt unjuſtly beſtowed upon others in too large a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>It was a matter of diſpute for ſome time whether they were of the <hi>Mohawk</hi> kind or not; and this ſuſpicion, I imagine, firſt aroſe from the obſervation of a learned phyſionomiſt, who perceiving their <hi>Os frontis</hi> to be uncommonly flat, burſt out into the following exclamation:</p>
            <l>"Your ſapſculls are neither ſquare, oval, nor round,</l>
            <l>"A proof that their judgments can never be ſound:</l>
            <l>"I really believe they are put <hi>wrong way on,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>"As they ſeem to reſemble a cobler's lap-ſtone."</l>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the above aſſertion might border upon truth, yet ſeveral of theſe chiefs denied it, by openly declaring themſelves to be neither more nor leſs than plain <hi>Narraganſets</hi>; who ſcorn'd to ſcalp any perſon who would ſubmit to have his private property deſtroyed, without complaining.</p>
            <p>With regard to their <hi>political</hi> ſchemes, I challenge all <hi>Hell</hi> to match them. Law they have none, nor any do they want; and could they ſend to Salem or Endor to procure a <hi>witch</hi> to bring MOLLINEAUX from the dead, even HE would condemn them.</p>
            <p>The Firſt of theſe chiefs is A—MS, a <hi>ſachem</hi> of vaſt elocution; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> being extremely poor, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> mouth of A—MS is ſufficient to fill the
<pb facs="unknown:013840_0007_0F92035EF7D53680"/>
mouths of millions in America. But it is propheſied that the time is near at hand, when the <hi>frothy food</hi> will fail them.</p>
            <p>But generous JOHN ſcorns to let him ſtarve,—far from it; 'tis well known his purſe-ſtrings have been at SAM's diſpoſal ever ſince he aſſiſted in making the Oration delivered by JOHN on the 5th March 1774, to a crowded audience of Narraganſet <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second of theſe chiefs is H—CK, who having been poſſeſs'd of too much money for a private gentleman, reſolved to make a public attempt to become a Monarch, and having courted <hi>popularity and power</hi> almoſt as long as he did Miſs ...... Miſs ...... or Mr Barnard's cook-maid, Betty Price, is at laſt likely to be jilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his turn, and in the end to be wedded to beggary, contempt, and a g—s.</p>
            <p>The Third of theſe incomparable <hi>Indians</hi> is ROWE; a chief (according to George Alexander Stevens) poſſeſs'd of a great fund of kn—owledge; but having a ſkull of an uncommon thickneſs, and the futures of the <hi>cranium</hi> being cloſely compacted, he never has never been able to diſplay any rational faculties, except when he invented the new method of <hi>making Tea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, oh! for words to grace the character of the moſt traiterous of men!—a modern Bravo. Did not the name of <hi>rebel</hi> ſtain the <hi>ſoldier,</hi> I could have afforded him a more brilliant title, and have call'd him a General. His name is L—. Oh! beware my friends of his follies!
