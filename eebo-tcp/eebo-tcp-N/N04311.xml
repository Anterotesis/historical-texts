            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>In the Year that King</hi> Uzziah <hi>died, I ſaw the</hi> LORD <hi>ſitting upon a Throne, high and lifted up.</hi>—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">'T</seg>IS the juſt obſervation of the contemplative <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> that the heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament ſheweth his handy-work; and that the earth is the LORD'S, and the fulneſs thereof, he hath founded it upon the ſeas and eſtabliſhed it upon the floods. Now if GOD had wiſdom to contrive, and power to effect theſe beautiful globes, he has an indiſputable right to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005326_0005_1016FF6BC9A30698"/>
the government of them, and is certainly qualified for it: Nor may it be thought, that it does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with his majeſty, or is an obſtruction to his quiet and happineſs to concern himſelf in the government of the world. The notion of <hi>Lucretius</hi> is contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to that idea of the divine being, the oracles of truth furniſh us with. To ſuppoſe, that, when he had made the world, he took no further thought or care, but left it to ſhift for itſelf, implies one or other of theſe abſurdities, that he either made it for no wiſe deſign, or through ſome miſtake in its formation it did not anſwer his original purpoſe; like an unſkilful artificer, not having framed his work according to the model of it in his own mind, throws it by, and does not care what becomes of it: But as it is a moſt wiſe production, that has no blotches or blunders in it, but in all its parts exquiſitely done, and every way correſpondent to the deſign in the eternal mind, there can be no reaſon upon this account why he ſhould not govern it. And then, as he is a moſt wiſe agent, and all his works the effects of counſel, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had ſome wiſe deſign in making it, 'tis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for him to govern it, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that deſign; and how can he act more like himſelf, and diſplay the glory of his perfections better, than by preſerving the ſeveral ranks of beings, in that harmonious and admirable order they were placed in at firſt? or why ſhould it be thought below his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to regard the works of his own hands? or can it be any difficulty to an omniſcient and omnipotent being to attend ſuch a number of things as the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world includes? To imagine this is to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005326_0006_1016FF6D5A741458"/>
limit the moſt high, debaſe his excellencies, and bring him down upon a level with his creatures, and to think that becauſe we find our minds and powers ſo narrow and limited, that a ſmall number of objects bound our thoughts and cares, therefore the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo many muſt be a burden to GOD himſelf. It becomes us better to confeſs and adore with the <hi>pſalmiſt,</hi> than to object againſt providence, <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>reigneth, he is clothed with majeſty.—he is the king of all the earth.</hi> But then, as to the <hi>form</hi> of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he exerciſes, it is a ſubject ſo ſublime and myſterious that we can ſay but little of it; and therefore having aſſerted that <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>reigns,</hi> he preſently adds, that <hi>clouds and darkneſs are round about him. His way is in the ſea, his path in the mighty waters, and his footſteps are not known.</hi> But tho', the <hi>arcana imperii</hi> are an height we can't reach, a depth we can't fathom, yet we muſt think there is a great deal of reaſon and righteouſneſs in them; and that a moſt beautiful ſcene would open to us, if we were let into all the ſecret ſprings of the divine government, and could trace the various ſteps and gradation by which every deſign in accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Good men, in all ages, have been ſo well ſatisfied with the wiſdom, goodneſs and equity of providence, that they have acquieſced in it, <hi>rejoiced in tribulation,</hi> triumphed when ſurrounded with greateſt dangers, and thick and black clouds have impended over the church or ſtate, and threatned its ſubverſion.</p>
            <p>It is from our profeſſed belief of his all-diſpoſing providence, and juſt ſenſe of our abſolute dependance upon it, and of our duty to <hi>acknowledge GOD in all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005326_0007_1016FF70303E3840"/>
our ways,</hi> and implore his direction in an affair of the higheſt importance, and wherein the intereſt of the province, both civil and religious, is ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that we are now aſſembled in this houſe of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Thanks be to the LORD upon the <hi>throne,</hi> that our <hi>civil liberties</hi> granted by the ROYAL CHARTER are continued, under the auſpicious reign of king GEORGE the IId; and that this day is again revolved upon us, wherein the <hi>heads of our tribes,</hi> are met together to ſelect and conſtitute, by the conſent of the <hi>governour,</hi> one main branch of our <hi>legiſlature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas your <hi>Excellency</hi> and the <hi>honourable Board</hi> have called me, however unworthy, to declare the counſels of heaven to you, upon this occaſion; <hi>ſtirring up your pure minds, by way of remembrance,</hi> I deſire to ſpeak with humility and fear, as becomes the oracles of GOD, and with fidelity to my great LORD and MASTER, knowing that I muſt give an account.</p>
            <p>When the angel of the LORD appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in a flame of fire, out of the midſt of a Buſh, he ſaid, <hi>I will now turn aſide, and ſee this great ſight;</hi> ſo let us all now turn aſide, for a while, and lift up our eyes above the hills, above the firmament, and behold with the wondring <hi>prophet</hi> the LORD <hi>ſitting upon a throne high and lifted up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was of noble birth, of the royal family, and <hi>nephew</hi> to king <hi>Uzziah</hi> he here ſpeaks of, as the <hi>Jews</hi> relate. And he was of a <hi>noble ſpirit,</hi> and not exceeeded by any that propheſied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or after him in clearneſs and abundance of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005326_0008_1016FF731276F1A8"/>
viſions, and revelations, eſpecially concerning the MESSIAH; and in a curious and polite, lofty and majeſtick ſtile.</p>
            <p>The firſt words of my text ſpread a melancholy gloom upon the face of rulers. <hi>In the year that king</hi> Uzziah <hi>died.</hi> Tho' a <hi>great</hi> man in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a <hi>good</hi> man, yet <hi>he died.</hi> Neither grace nor grandure can exempt from death. Princes, who are in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified ſenſe the <hi>breath of a people's noſtrils,</hi> derive their breath from GOD; and when it pleaſes him, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign arbiter of life, <hi>their breath goes forth, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the earth, and in that very day their thoughts periſh.</hi> Whatever diſtinction GOD, in his providence, has made betwixt one man and another, in civil reſpects, they are all in death's account equal. King <hi>Uzziah'</hi>s reign was long and proſperous, and <hi>Judah</hi> was happy under it; but he muſt not live always: It is the prerogative of him, whom the <hi>prophet ſaw upon the throne,</hi> to be the KING ETERNAL.</p>
            <p>It was in the year of this king's death, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had his viſion. GOD, <hi>at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers by the prophets;</hi> ſometimes by dreams, ſometimes by a audible voice, and ſometimes by viſions, as here to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by the river <hi>Chebar.</hi> It is not to be ſuppoſed, that the eyes of the <hi>prophet</hi> were ſo ſtrengthned by a ſupernatural power, as that he ſaw into the third heaven, at ſo vaſt a diſtance; but he had a repreſentation of the light &amp; glory of it, conveyed to his mind by ſome ſenſible images, and of the LORD <hi>ſitting upon a throne</hi> there, not like king <hi>Solomon'</hi>s, a <hi>throne of ivory, and overlaid with the

            <p>It could not be any <hi>meer</hi> man, or an <hi>angel,</hi> aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a human form. It is the place of the angelical orders to ſtand about the throne, and miniſter unto it; and this is honour enough for them. It was a <hi>divine perſon,</hi> the SON OF GOD, the <hi>root</hi> and the <hi>offſpring of David,</hi> the <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>morning ſtar.</hi> Some think it was the <hi>firſt</hi> of the divine perſons who was exhibited to the prophet, and that we read of a like appearance of his, Dan. vii. 9. <hi>I beheld till the thrones were caſt down, and the ancient of days did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, and the hair of his head like the pure woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

this to be underſtood of CHRIST, who is called the <hi>ancient of days,</hi> becauſe of his immutable and eternal <hi>divinity,</hi> and that it is a miſtake to aſſert that the FATHER, or the HOLY GHOST ever appeared in ſuch a low and diminutive form; but the SON often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally did ſo, for he was to be incarnate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thus he appeared to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and in the ſame ſhape, upon the burning mount, at the giving of the law; and, in the like manner to <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> for ſo the viſion is explained, John 12. 41. <hi>Theſe things ſaid</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>when he ſaw his glory and ſpake of him:</hi> All which appearances were undoubtedly deſigned to prefigure his aſſumption of the nature of man, and its ſubſequent advancement to the throne of GOD, the authority of a prince and a judge there.</p>
            <p>Whether he aſſumed the form of that individual body he appeared in afterwards, is an inquiry more <hi>ſpeculative</hi> than <hi>practical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſet upon the throne of his FATHER was the glory he had with him before all worlds, and which he had a <hi>natural</hi> right to: And it is alſo the glory the FATHER promiſed him as the reward of our Redemption, Iſaiah liii. 12. <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death.</hi>—Pſalm xvi. II. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life, in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> In the proſpect of this recompence he engaged, ſuffered the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, and is now thus <hi>highly exalted above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet.</hi>—</p>

The apoſtle <hi>John</hi> long ſince beheld him in the ſame place and poſture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 1. with all the ſhining myriads about him, and praiſing of him.</p>
            <p>It is then an <hi>exalted</hi> JESUS the prophet ſaw, and I am now ſpeaking of. <hi>He that was made lower than the angels, is now crowned with glory and honour.</hi> And ſuch an high prieſt the chriſtian has, <hi>who is ſet down on the right hand of the throne of the majeſty in the heavens.</hi> I hope you will all hear the report with pleaſure. I am ſure, if thro' grace we arrive at the viſion that comes after, it will never tire us. CHRIST upon the throne is the attractive object of every eye, and engages every heart, angels behold and wonder, and ſaints adore the riſen GOD: His throne is guarded with legions of bleſſed ſpirits, who with united voices proclaim his excellencies and ſhout his praiſes. They did not diſdain to ſing his birth to humble ſhepherds, and now with joy celebrate the glories of his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the redeemed and perfected ſpirits unite in the conſort, Rev. 19. beg. <hi>I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, ſaying, Alleluja,—for the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth.</hi> Thus the ſaints are joyful in glory, the children of Zion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He ſets upon a throne of grace, to which we may may come boldly. The conſideration of his majeſty might make us afraid to draw near and ſpeak to him: This effect it had upon the <hi>prophet,</hi> when he beheld the glory of the LORD, <hi>Then, ſaid I, wo is me, I am undone:</hi> But he is exalted upon a <hi>mercy-ſeat,</hi> with a rainbow (an emblem of mercy) about his head: This <hi>invites</hi> the ſinner to him, <hi>even to his ſeat,</hi> to lay open his wants, complain of his grievances, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his compaſſion and help. He ſets upon a throne of GRACE to give out <hi>pardons</hi> to humble ſupplicants, and communicate <hi>bleſſings</hi> to the poor and needy; and he is as ready to give as we can be to aſk them.</p>
            <p>He ſets upon a throne of <hi>government,</hi> giving out his laws, and demanding our obedience, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what regards we pay to them, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or puniſh us accordingly: For the throne of <hi>judgment</hi> is alſo his; and at his word we either ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken of the <hi>perſon,</hi> the prophet ſaw upon the throne of glory, high and lifted up:</p>
            <p>I proceed to conſider,</p>

            <p>CHRIST <hi>upon the throne</hi> in our nature, what can be more delightful to hear and contemplate? And how great and boundleſs the expectations it raiſes in us? He is now ready to all acts of care about his people,

they are ever under his eye, and within reach of his arm; he is a <hi>ſun</hi> to <hi>enlighten,</hi> a <hi>ſhield</hi> to <hi>defend,</hi> and a <hi>fountain</hi> to <hi>ſupply</hi> them: What more is needful to encourage the active chriſtian, to revive the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaint, or to aſtoniſh the daring ſinner? CHRIST'S advancement is the believer's aſſurance, that he ſhall live and reign with him in that bleſſed world, where <hi>they ſhall hunger no more, neither ſhall the ſun light on them, nor any heat; for the lamb which is in the midſt of the throne ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and GOD ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be particular here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This exaltation of CHRIST ſpeaks the <hi>tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant dignity</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of his <hi>perſon,</hi> that he is worthy of the throne he ſets on, and qualified for all the great deſigns of his advancement. It would be a diſhonour to the wiſdom of GOD to place him there, if he was a mean perſon, or an inſufficient ruler: It ſpeaks his <hi>joint-intereſt</hi> in the FATHER, the <hi>eternal head</hi> of government, and <hi>oneneſs</hi> with him in <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>glory:</hi> For GOD never did, or will receive any other into the throne, to ſhare the dignities and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of it: To <hi>which of the angels ſaid he at any time, ſet thou at my right hand?</hi> Nothing like it was ever ſpoken to any of <hi>them.</hi> They are the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>pureſt</hi> productions of divine light, above man in his original ſtate of integrity and perfection; but infinite <hi>deſcents</hi> below the SON of GOD, and pay their <hi>joint homage</hi> to him in the loweſt poſtures of humility and reverence.

the <hi>ſtupidity</hi> of ſome men, in debaſing <hi>him</hi> almoſt to a <hi>level</hi> with <hi>themſelves:</hi> The excellency of CHRIST infinitely tranſcends all <hi>angelical</hi> perfection; ſome faint rays of this glory were viſible to his diſciples, <hi>Thro' his veil of fleſh: We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the</hi> FATHER,—John i. 14. But how little of it appeared to them, in reſpect of what the <hi>prophet</hi> ſaw, when HE was <hi>ſitting upon his throne,</hi> with all the coeleſtial inhabitants about him, and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all the bright rays of the FATHER'S <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>his own.</hi> The prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had a like viſion of him, cloathed with robes of dazzling light. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, we may not ſuppoſe that the <hi>fulneſs of glory</hi> was viſible to either of them: It was not the ſplendor of <hi>unveiled</hi> majeſty, but the <hi>likeneſs of his glory;</hi> the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it, is <hi>light inacceſſible</hi> and cannot be viewed by mortal eyes. Glorified ſpirits have much brighter viſions of him. The ſoul in its exalted ſtate ſhall <hi>ſee the king in his beauty,</hi> all the perfections of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely great and glorious nature in their brightneſs and purity, the effect whereof will be the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, ardent love, and an eternal ſpring of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal praiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſpeaks the <hi>utmoſt grandeur.</hi> To aſcend a throne is the <hi>very top of preferment;</hi> fleſh and blood can riſe no higher: The moſt aſpiring tempers do but aim at this, and have no notion of a ſuperiour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement; and it is but here and there one, that can graſp the <hi>royal dignity.</hi> This honour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon CHRIST at his <hi>aſcention,</hi> according to the prediction, Pſal. 47. 5. <hi>GOD is gone up with a ſhout; the</hi> LORD <hi>with the ſound of a trumpet; ſing praiſes to GOD; ſing praiſes to our king, for he is the king of

Man thought the meaneſt honour too much for him, but in GOD's eſteem all the glory of heaven was not too great: When he was arraigned at the bar, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that he ſhould by and by aſcend a throne, and head an empire comprehending both heaven and earth, and they <hi>ſhould hereafter ſee him coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory, attended with all the holy angels,</hi> to take vengeance upon his enemies: They entertain'd the report, (as we may imagine) with a <hi>diſdainful</hi> ſmile; thinking it no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the wilds of <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> for ſo mean a perſon to challenge ſo exalted honours: He was born in a ſtable, begun his life with brutes, and ended it with malefactors; but now is the LORD of hoſts, principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers: oh ſurpriſing change, and beyond all imagination to them by <hi>whoſe wicked hands he was crucified and ſlain! here</hi> he was deſpiſed of men; <hi>there</hi> he is adored by angels: <hi>here</hi> in contempt and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery he was crowned with thorns; but <hi>now</hi> he wears the crown of glory: <hi>here</hi> he was nailed to a croſs; but <hi>there</hi> he ſets upon a throne high and lifted up: <hi>here</hi> he groaned under the weight of ſin and the curſe; <hi>there</hi> he triumphs: <hi>here</hi> he had no form or comelineſs; but <hi>now</hi> he ſhines in all the beauties and glories of the god-head, and has the moſt profound reſpect and veneration paid him by the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers about him.</p>

3. It aſſures us of the <hi>accompliſhment of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> The FATHER that choſe him to this work, knew him equal to it, He did not lay the help of his periſhing creature upon a broken reed, but <hi>upon one that was mighty.</hi> The burden was too heavy for an angel's ſhoulders, but the SON was able to bear it, he could both fulfil the <hi>precept</hi> and ſuffer the <hi>penalty</hi> of the violated law; and ſo diſcharge the debt we owed to inflexible juſtice. The FATHER, by an audible voice from the excellent glory, teſtified his acceptance of what he had done: And the SON appeals to him, when leaving the world, that he had glorified him on the earth, and finiſhed the work he had given him to do; and, according to the eternal compact between them, ſupplicates for that glory he enjoyed before the world was, which was as readily given him, as it was aſked for, as the <hi>pſalmiſt</hi> by ſpirit of prophecy declares, <hi>I have ſet my king up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my holy hill of Zion,</hi> Pſal. ii. 6. He raiſed him from the diſhonours of the grave, and placed him at his own right hand; and the grandeur he now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes, is an inconteſtible evidence, as of the <hi>dignity</hi> of his <hi>perſon,</hi> ſo of the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of his <hi>ſacrifice;</hi> for if he had not accompliſhed the work he engaged in, but it had come imperfect from his hand, he had not been thus advanced, but left eternally under the power of death. His reſurrection aſſures us, that the <hi>whole debt</hi> was paid, the thundering law ſilenced, and the juſtice of GOD has no further demands to make upon us.

            <p>The ancient <hi>heathen</hi> confined the dominion of GOD to the <hi>ſupreme</hi> heavens, over the <hi>angelical</hi> orders, and would not allow that he had any concern in the affairs of this <hi>lower world,</hi> the government of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſtates and empires; but the oracles of truth inſtruct us better.

The <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> conſiſts very much in the <hi>variety of its parts:</hi> And the <hi>qualifications</hi> of men, for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>ſtations</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> they are to act, in the rank of rational beings, is from CHRIST the <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>wiſdom.</hi> Thus CHRIST <hi>upon the throne</hi> is the LORD <hi>of all,</hi> and has <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>power</hi> ſufficient to <hi>govern all</hi> by himſelf, and without the inſtrumentality of <hi>men</hi> or <hi>angels;</hi> but he is pleaſed to make uſe of <hi>them</hi> in the

conduct of his affairs both <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>eccleſiaſtical.</hi> As to his government by <hi>angels</hi> we know but little of it: They are inviſible agents in the ſervices they do us; but his rule by <hi>men</hi> is evident and indiſputable; for he has ſaid, <hi>Judges and officers ſhalt thou make in all thy gates which the</hi> LORD <hi>thy GOD giveth thee throughout thy tribes; and they ſhall judge the people:</hi> and the civil ruler is called <hi>the miniſter of GOD.</hi> The diſtinction of <hi>king</hi> and <hi>ſubject, rulers</hi> and <hi>ruled,</hi> is not the <hi>contrivance</hi> of deſigning men, but of <hi>divine ordination:</hi> 'Tis CHRIST upon the throne that has appointed <hi>magiſtracy,</hi> that advances <hi>men</hi> to ſuperiour or ſubordinate offices, and accompliſhes them for <hi>government;</hi> and has declared to us for what <hi>end</hi> he doth it, and accordingly what the <hi>people</hi> over whom they preſide may expect from <hi>them,</hi> and they from <hi>him</hi> as they behave and manage in their reſpective <hi>ſpheres;</hi> and alſo what regard he will have <hi>us</hi> pay to <hi>them.</hi>

               </hi> then. <hi>Magiſtracy is an inſtitution of</hi> CHRIST <hi>upon the throne.</hi> This is an aſſertion that ſtands in the ſtrongeſt light in the ſacred oracles. The <hi>wiſdom</hi> of GOD thought it highly neceſſary for man in his apoſtate condition, whatever it might have been if he had kept his primitive ſtate, and retained his original purity and glory; and therefore impoſed it not as a <hi>burden,</hi> but a <hi>bleſſing</hi> upon mankind; for what is or can be more beneficial to the world? 'Tis the very life and ſoul of <hi>humane ſociety;</hi> without it, what but perpetual <hi>diſcords</hi> and <hi>contentions</hi> might be expected? <hi>Oppreſſion, injuſtice,</hi> and the moſt flagitious <hi>enormities</hi> would ſoon lift up their heads and grow

               <hi>rampant,</hi> and the whole earth become a <hi>theatre</hi> of the moſt <hi>bloody tragedies.</hi> An <hi>ungovern'd ſociety of men</hi> would be no better than a <hi>herd of ſavage beaſts,</hi> worrying and devouring one another: To prevent this <hi>confuſion,</hi> GOD has inſtituted <hi>civil government</hi> to be a guard upon our perſons and lives, and defend us from the violence and injuries we might be expoſed to from men more <hi>crafty</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> than ourſelves.</p>
            <p>It was an unhappy <hi>juncture</hi> when there was <hi>no king in Iſrael</hi> to reſtrain the boiſterous luſts and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong paſſions of the people; but <hi>every man did that which was right in his own eyes; libertiniſm</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, idolatry</hi> and a <hi>practical contempt of GOD,</hi> his <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> broke in like a flood upon the <hi>nation,</hi> and expoſed them to the angry <hi>reſentments</hi> of heaven. Where all authoritative &amp; coercive power is taken off, men will ſoon think that <hi>where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> and make it evident that it was not ſo much the dread of <hi>hell,</hi> as of a <hi>halter,</hi> that reſtrained them from the greateſt villanies.</p>
            <p>A <hi>common-wealth</hi> without <hi>government</hi> is like a <hi>body</hi> without <hi>eyes,</hi> which ſtands expoſed to a thouſand miſchiefs, but can defend itſelf from none of them: To take away <hi>government,</hi> would be to deprive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind of all that is <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>ſacred,</hi> and to reduce a beautiful world to a meer chaotical ſtate of darkneſs and confuſion; but a well-ordered <hi>common-wealth</hi> how beautiful and glorious to behold! And how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the BRITISH <hi>conſtitution!</hi> and how juſtly may it be the admiration and the envy of the nations about it, with a KING upon the throne, ſwaying the <hi>ſceptre</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> with his <hi>nobles</hi> about him, and <hi>officers</hi> under him, in their ſeveral degrees of ſubordination! herein bearing ſome little and faint reſemblance of the

               <hi>prophet's</hi> viſion of the LORD <hi>ſitting upon his throne, ſurrounded with his miniſters, the holy angels,</hi> who are celebrating his <hi>glory</hi> and ſerving his <hi>government:</hi> Thus the <hi>ſun,</hi> the fountain of light is placed in the <hi>centre,</hi> with the <hi>ſtars</hi> and <hi>planets</hi> in their reſpective orbs, and different degrees of magnitude, revolving about him, and all contributing to the benefit of <hi>our</hi> ſyſtem. But ſuppoſing, that <hi>government</hi> had not been of <hi>divine inſtitution,</hi> but mankind had been left intirely to their own liberty, there is no doubt but they would ſoon have been ſo fully convinced of the abſolute neceſſity of it, that they would not have continued long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. <hi>Anarchy</hi> is ſuch a ſtate as no reaſonable man would chooſe, there being no manner of ſafety in it, either of life or property. It was an ancient cuſtom among the <hi>Perſians</hi> to abrogate the laws of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhut up their courts of judicature, and ſilence the oracles of juſtice upon the death of their <hi>ſovereign,</hi> and every man was left to his own empire for five days together; in which time ſuch horrid things were done, and outrages committed as to convince them, by ſad experience of the want of a king, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of laws. It was the juſt obſervation of the <hi>roman</hi> oraror, <hi>Nihil tam aptum eſt ad jus conditionem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que naturae, quam imperium, ſine quo,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing is ſo adapted to the ſtate and priviledge of <hi>humane nature</hi> as <hi>government,</hi> without which it is impoſſible that <hi>families, cities</hi> or <hi>nations</hi> ſhould ſubſiſt, yea without it the race of mankind would be ſoon extinct.</p>
            <p>There is doubtleſs a certain <hi>oeconomy</hi> in the world above, amongſt the bright intelligences that encompaſs the throne of GOD, and the LAMB: This ſeems to be plainly intimated by the diſtinguiſhing <hi>titles</hi> given them of <hi>thrones, dominions, angels, arch-angels, cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005326_0024_1016FF9CE8F03598"/>
and <hi>ſeraphims:</hi> There is a ſort of <hi>regimen</hi> in the <hi>ſtarry</hi> regions, in their higher and lower ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and degrees, without which compoſition, they could not properly be called an <hi>army:</hi> And there is ſomething of this to be found amongſt the <hi>irrational</hi> tribes; the <hi>bees,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> and others have obſerved, have their <hi>king,</hi> and the <hi>cranes</hi> their <hi>leader;</hi> and they obſerve their nocturnal watches in diſpoſed orders. Thus <hi>magiſtracy</hi> is <hi>an ordinance of</hi> CHRIST, the alwiſe GOD and ſupreme LORD of the world: And ſeeing he has conſtituted it among men, he certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our practical acknowledgment of it; and who would be loth and backward to make this conceſſion, ſince we are all beholden to <hi>government,</hi> for <hi>order, peace</hi> and <hi>religion?</hi> We are certainly worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confuſion, if we are ungrateful to GOD, for regular <hi>government:</hi> Now we may <hi>dwell quietly in our houſes,</hi> or <hi>ſit under our own vines and fig-trees, and none to make us afraid:</hi> Now the <hi>wealth</hi> we obtain by <hi>honeſt</hi> induſtry, may be inſured to poſterity: Now we may be build <hi>temples</hi> for the worſhip of GOD, without danger of having them pulled down, by <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious hands;</hi> and adore the GOD that made us, without being moleſted with <hi>mutinies</hi> and <hi>uproars:</hi> Now we may enjoy our <hi>ſabbaths,</hi> and have conſtant opportunities for our ſouls, in the free uſe of all thoſe means, whereby immortal ſpirits are trained up for the heavenly world: For theſe things, <hi>bleſs</hi> we GOD, and <hi>honour</hi> the KING.</p>
            <p>But in aſſerting <hi>civil government</hi> to be an <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of CHRIST, I don't intend that any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>form</hi> of it is ſo; for this, the <hi>apoſtle</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly ſays, is an <hi>human ordinance.</hi> It was never the deſign of GOD, that any <hi>one</hi> model ſhould <hi>univerſally</hi> obtain amongſt mankind; for if it had, he would
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005326_0025_1016FFA19A04FED8"/>
undoubtedly have expreſſly revealed it, and not left the world thus long in the dark; for <hi>divines</hi> of the greateſt <hi>note</hi> and <hi>eminence,</hi> have never been able to find out any ſuch <hi>intimation</hi> of his pleaſure in <hi>holy writ:</hi> And if he had preferred any particular <hi>form,</hi> it is no ways probable that he would have permitted that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> his favourite people, to have been ſo often changed, as we find it was no leſs than five times: It looks as if theſe ſeveral alterations of their <hi>conſtitution</hi> were permitted, on purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world that every <hi>form</hi> was alike indifferent to him; and that he left it to the prudence of <hi>every</hi> nation to make choice of <hi>that,</hi> which beſt ſuted their own <hi>tempers</hi> and <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and that if any people ſound <hi>their'</hi>s defective, the <hi>fault</hi> was their own if it was not reformed. And <hi>this</hi> being the true <hi>origin</hi> of <hi>civil government,</hi> it is a very natural inference that <hi>rulers</hi> derive their authority under GOD, from that <hi>conſtitution</hi> to which they belong; for it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that <hi>kings</hi> and <hi>governours</hi> are ſent down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from <hi>heaven,</hi> with their <hi>commiſſions</hi> in their hands: And ſince the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>civil ruler</hi> flows from the <hi>conſtitution</hi> he is under, the natural extent of it is limited by the maxims of doing that, which is <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to all under that <hi>conſtitution.</hi>

            <p>There have been ſome <hi>fanaticks,</hi> that, in the ſtrongeſt terms, have denied the <hi>divine right</hi> of <hi>civil rulers;</hi> and aſſerted that no man's <hi>conſcience</hi> was bound to a <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to them, and to <hi>oppoſe</hi> their <hi>authority,</hi> was no immoral act: of this ſtamp were the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> the <hi>German Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other <hi>enthuſiaſtick ſectaries</hi> ſince, who, under a pretence of ſetting up the <hi>throne of</hi> CHRIST, have been for ſubverting the <hi>thrones</hi> of <hi>kings,</hi> as if they were diametrically oppoſite as GOD and <hi>Belial,</hi> as <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>hell;</hi> but this is to confront the <hi>ſovereignty</hi> of the <hi>moſt high,</hi> who in the plaineſt terms aſſures us, that the <hi>higher powers</hi> are from <hi>him,</hi> and have the impreſs of <hi>divinity</hi> upon them.

They ſhould appear like the HOST of GOD <hi>formidable</hi> and <hi>terrible,</hi> the <hi>cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi> that guarded the tree of life with the flaming ſword of juſtice in their hands, to execute wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bold and daring criminals, and to ſuppreſs vice and immorality, in all its forms and complexions, and to drive it if poſſible out of the land: <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> naturally tends to deprive a people of the divine ſmiles and protection, and to bring down diſtreſſing calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

upon them. The proſperity of a <hi>province</hi> infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly depends upon the favour and bleſſings of heaven, but if GOD be gone from us, what can be expected but a ſeries of woes and judgments? Such a people cannot ſubſiſt long, but muſt inevitably ſink into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and ruine, which to prevent ſhould be the care and endeavour of the <hi>civil ruler.</hi> The apoſtle adds—<hi>a praiſe to them that do well;</hi> that do their <hi>own proper buſineſs,</hi> that confine their zeal and activity within their own limits, and <hi>wherein they are called of GOD, there abide,</hi> and are faithful; theſe ſhall have the countenance and protection of thoſe under whom they ſerve.</p>
            <p>But its time that I proceed to the next particular to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The qualifications of the</hi> civil magiſtrate, <hi>or what he muſt be according to the direction of </hi> CHRIST, <hi>to anſwer the deſign of his conſtitution, and that he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge with fidelity, and to divine acceptance, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt repoſed in him.</hi> It is not <hi>every man</hi> that is fit to govern, how much ſoever he may think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf qualified for it: The weight of government is too heavy to be laid upon every one's ſhoulder, they muſt be <hi>able men</hi> to ſurmount its difficulties, and wade thro' its emergencies. There may be many <hi>excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> in a man, and yet he may not have a turn for government: The great &amp; glorious characters by which rulers are known &amp; diſtinguiſhed in the ſacred oracles, convey to us ſuch ſublime ideas, as cannot be in any meaſure anſwered, except by here and there <hi>one</hi> of an exraordinary genius: Sometimes they are dignified with the title of GOD's, Exod. 22. 28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the</hi> GODS. GOD himſelf ſtiles them ſo; and how much does it <hi>magnify</hi> their <hi>office,</hi> and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005326_0032_1016FFB5C844FD38"/>
and honour does it call for from us? They are ſtiled the <hi>lights of a people.</hi> Thus the royal <hi>David </hi> was the <hi>light of Iſrael:</hi> They are lights for ſplendor, counſel and comfort; and what greater title can be given of a mortal man? or, what more is ſpoken of GOD himſelf? <hi>GOD is light;</hi> wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, power, purity and all perfection is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. Sometimes they have the character and ſtyle of <hi>ſhields of the earth,</hi> Pſal. xlvii. 9. <hi>The ſhields of the earth belong to the</hi> LORD; i. e. <hi>magiſtrates,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors and guardians of a nation, are <hi>dependant</hi> upon GOD: And it is a great bleſſing to a people to have <hi>ſuch ſhields,</hi> eſpecially when it may be ſaid of <hi>them,</hi> that they <hi>belong</hi> to the LORD; that is, not only <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by</hi> him, but <hi>devoted to</hi> him, employed for his honour, and his people's intereſt: Then he is greatly exalted, when princes and governours and inferiour officers exert their power to promote the kingdom &amp; intereſt of CHRIST, &amp; to defend their people from inſult &amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oppreſſion. I ſay, when we reflect upon <hi>ſuch titles</hi> of the <hi>civil magiſtrate,</hi> as they ſuggeſt to us ſomething very ſuperiour, and are almoſt apt to raiſe our thoughts of <hi>him</hi> as another <hi>ſort</hi> of being, that approaches nearer to <hi>divinity</hi> than mankind generally does, ſo to expect from him ſomething proportionably great and good. It was <hi>Jethro'</hi>s advice to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>provide out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear GOD, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs,</hi> and place <hi>ſuch</hi> over them to be rulers.</p>
            <p>To be particular here,</p>
            <p n="1">. <hi>A principle of</hi> true grace <hi>living and reigning in the heart, is the</hi> firſt <hi>and</hi> beſt <hi>qualification in a magiſtrate.</hi> It is the juſt obſervation of one, that <hi>no</hi> Principles, but thoſe of <hi>religion,</hi> are ſufficient to form
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005326_0033_1016FFB8A38F35E0"/>
a <hi>great</hi> man; all other accompliſhments ſeparate from this, will looſe their luſtre and glory: It is <hi>piety</hi> that <hi>makes the face of a</hi> ruler <hi>to ſhine.</hi> This is his brighteſt ornament, as <hi>holineſs</hi> is the moſt orient pearl in the crown of heaven: All the bright ornaments of <hi>Greece,</hi> or all the <hi>Roman</hi> dictators and conſuls were not ſo great &amp; honourable as the <hi>chriſtian</hi> magiſtrate cloathed with the <hi>robe of holineſs,</hi> &amp; reſplendent in the <hi>image of GOD:</hi> All the eloquence and oratory of <hi>Cicero;</hi> or all the great atchievements and conqueſts of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for which they have been ſo much celebrated, don't ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them worthy of that eſteem, love and honour which is juſtly paid to a <hi>chriſtian</hi> Governour; who, by the charmes of his good example, the noble conqueſt of his own luſts and paſſions, his holy zeal for GOD, and faithful endeavours to advance the beſt intereſts of his people, is render'd worthy of the higheſt honour. GOD himſelf eſteems and honours ſuch a ruler, and will honour him in the regions of the bleſſed: He now <hi>ſhines as the ſun when he goes forth in his ſtrength;</hi> and ſhall hereafter <hi>ſhine as the brightneſs of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the world of light and glory.</p>
            <p>The GODS of a people ſhould adorn their exalted ſtations with <hi>ſobriety, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>ſanctity.</hi> They are, as one expreſſes, <hi>lights</hi> upon a hill viſible to all, and they cannot tranſgreſs, but like the <hi>eclipſe</hi> of the <hi>ſun,</hi> every one obſerves it, and the ſmalleſt defect in them obſcures the whole orb of their virtues. The <hi>Roman Optimates</hi> were ſo to behave in all things as to make their conduct approved by every good man, and worthy the imitation of all: Their <hi>Cenſors</hi> and <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> were to inſpect the morals, and correct the vices and extravagancies of the people. It was given in charge by the GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the electors of the empire to chuſe the perſon that he ſhould nominate

to be their king; and to the king ſo elected, to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of religious laws in his adminiſtration, Deut. 17. 18. <hi>It ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he ſhall write him a copy of this law, and it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the</hi> LORD <hi>his GOD, that his heart be not lifted up, and that he turn not aſide from the commandment to the right hand or to the left:</hi> And to excite him to this, and to induce to practice what he read, he is told the advantage that his religion would be unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>it would prolong his government, and entail a bleſſing upon his poſterity.</hi> Secular dignity lays no foundation for a bleſſed hope, tranſlates no man to the coeleſtial paradiſe: 'Tis only <hi>holineſs</hi> that qualifies for <hi>happineſs,</hi> the viſion of CHRIST <hi>upon the throne,</hi> and <hi>the rivers of pleaſures that flow from it.</hi> The <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> work of the <hi>divine ſpirit</hi> upon the ſoul, and his teſtimony to it, in concurrence with our own ſpirit, is that alone which can give us that ſweet <hi>peace which paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> a divine calm in a dying hour, and afford us a comfortable proſpect of future glory. It is not the <hi>coat</hi> and <hi>character</hi> of a miniſter of ſtate, that will be any advantage to him in the great audit-day, that will ſecure him from the animadverſions of the ſupreme JUDGE, or render his doom any thing leſs ſevere: It won't make in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to plead, that he has been a <hi>ruler</hi> over men, and ſuſtain'd ſuch a <hi>poſt.</hi> 'Tis nothing but our <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>good works,</hi> the genuine product of them, that will recommend us to the divine acceptance: If our ſtation and buſineſs be high, if we have not the hearts of ſincere humble <hi>chriſtians,</hi> we ſhall have but the greater ignominy, and fall at laſt. Our earthly GODS muſt

ſtand at the <hi>ſame barr,</hi> and be judged by the <hi>ſame rule</hi> with their people; and without an impreſſion of the <hi>divine character</hi> upon them, they ſhall have the doom of the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ſlothful ſervant,</hi> and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the bliſsful preſence and kingdom of GOD for ever. We ſee then the <hi>obligation</hi> upon magiſtrates to be <hi>good men:</hi> 'Tis abſolutely neceſſary to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own <hi>comfort</hi> in the <hi>preſent,</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> in the <hi>coming</hi> world; and it is neceſſary to thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> people, to form them to religion and virtue, by the ſhining examples of it in their own perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Great</hi> knowledge <hi>and</hi> wiſdom, <hi>are eſſential qualifications in</hi> civil rulers. <hi>Piety</hi> alone won't do; for then every <hi>good man</hi> would be qualified to rule, which it is certain he is not; but they muſt be <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> men, and like the accompliſhed ruler of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who conducted his people, as in the <hi>integrity of his heart,</hi> ſo <hi>with the ſkillfulneſs of his hands:</hi> How can the grand intentions of government be ſerved, or how can government itſelf be ſecured from contempt, when it falls into weak and unſkillful hands? If <hi>the blind lead the blind,</hi> there's no need of an oracle from heaven to foretel the conſequents. <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum cum ſceptro,</hi> was the <hi>Egyptian</hi> emblem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q>It is the ſame frantick madneſs, ſays Dr. <hi>Henry More,</hi> to exile <hi>prudence</hi> out of the <hi>affairs of ſtate,</hi> as to exclude <hi>reaſon</hi> out of the <hi>mathematicks</hi> and <hi>philoſophy.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It bodes well to a people when it may be ſaid of them as Ezek. 27. 8. <hi>Thy wiſe men, oh</hi> Tyrus <hi>that were in thee, were thy pilots.</hi> Men ſkilled in the art of <hi>navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> and could direct their brave fleets in times and places of danger, their ſafety and proſperity conſiſted
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005326_0036_1016FFC2ABFD5A40"/>
very much in having ſuch wiſe men in ſo uſeful and important a ſervice. Magiſtrates are the <hi>pilots</hi> of a people, and therefore muſt be men of great wiſdom and prudence; an ignorant pilot is a <hi>ſoleciſm,</hi> and to what purpoſe is the office of a magiſtrate without abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to execute it? A weak and giddy head will ſoon cauſe a ſtaggering body, and a ruined ſtate: The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical houſe muſt inevitably fall that has the ſlender reed, inſtead of ſtrong pillars, to ſupport it. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> are the two eyes of the magiſtrate; with one he views the people in their conſtitution, tempers and outward circumſtances, what are their dangers, and from what cauſes they ariſe, and what may be done to prevent them; with the other he forms ſuch ſchemes, and applies ſuch remedies as are proper to the caſe. Who then is ſufficient for theſe things? where is the man that anſwers the character of an accompliſhed ruler? he is like <hi>Elihu's</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>one among a thouſand.</hi> Indeed almoſt every man thinks himſelf qualified to ſet at helm, guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern publick affairs; but this is becauſe he is both a ſtranger to himſelf, and to the difficulties of government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Courage <hi>is a neceſſary and excellent quality in a magiſtrate.</hi> Knowledge of the ſtate of the <hi>province,</hi> and wiſdom to conduct its affairs to advantage, will be to but little purpoſe without <hi>courage:</hi> Theſe in conjunction won't fail to diſtinguiſh a man amongſt thoſe of his own rank and order; but if he poſſeſſes the former, the latter being wanting, it may be of ill conſequence, as it may deter him from ſpeaking or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely, in any matter that lies before him. If the head is crowded with ſublime and noble ideas, and theſe ranged in moſt beautiful order; 'tis <hi>courage</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005326_0037_1016FFC5E99F9038"/>
muſt draw them out into act and exerciſe, and render them ſerviceable to the publick. A <hi>cowardly</hi> magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate is like the timerous <hi>hare</hi> in a <hi>lion</hi>'s den; the frown or check of a great perſonage will frighten him out of his conſcience, and obſtruct the execution of juſtice. The <hi>Athenian</hi> judges held their courts in <hi>Mars-ſtreet,</hi> to ſhew that they had <hi>martial</hi> fire, tho' cloathed with <hi>Apollo's</hi> robes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They muſt be</hi> juſt <hi>men.</hi> The GOD and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world is <hi>juſt,</hi> and in this a pattern to rulers, who ſhould endeavour to be <hi>righteous</hi> as he is <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> This is what he expreſſly requires of them; <hi>the GOD of Iſrael ſaid it, and the rock of Iſrael ſpake it. He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt.</hi> Juſtice obliges the magiſtrate to deal fairly and righteouſly between man and man, to protect the innocent, and right the injured. There is <hi>an iniquity to be puniſhed by the judges;</hi> and <hi>there is a reward for the righteous,</hi> which the <hi>miniſter of juſtice</hi> muſt ſee diſtributed, as he would not <hi>bear the ſword in vain.</hi> The <hi>juſt</hi> ruler will take care that righteous laws, and none but ſuch, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the ſubject; and when made, that they are enforced with proper ſanctions, and duly executed according to the regards that are paid to them. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> were uſed to picture their <hi>judges</hi> without <hi>hands,</hi> as ſome other nations have done without <hi>eyes,</hi> that they might not be guilty of <hi>bribery,</hi> which <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eyes of the wiſe,</hi> and <hi>perverts the words of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> The oppoſite to this, viz. <hi>injuſtice,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the laws of GOD, and the precepts of chriſtianity; and the unjuſt man <hi>is abhorred of the</hi> LORD: The apoſtle's words are ſhocking, and one would think ſufficient for ever to deter men from the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005326_0038_1016FFC8C77C07E8"/>
practice of this ſin, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 12. So that <hi>injuſtice</hi> is a ſin that is inconſiſtent with the fear of GOD, or a principle of grace in the ſoul: 'Tis impoſſible that there can be ſincere and undiſſembled <hi>piety towards GOD,</hi> where there is not <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> towards men. 'Tis one of the <hi>main</hi> ſtrokes in the character of a citizen of <hi>Zion,</hi> that <hi>he walketh uprightly,</hi> and <hi>worketh righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. And finally. <hi>They muſt be men of a</hi> publick ſpirit; ſeeking the good of all their people, and not to enrich themſelves: The <hi>avaritious</hi> magiſtrate is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the prophet to a <hi>wolf</hi> ravening the prey, and aiming at nothing but to get diſhoneſt gain, Ezek. 22. 27. When it may be ſaid of a magiſtrate, <hi>thine eyes and thine heart are not but for covetouſneſs,</hi> What but miſchiefs to the publick, oppreſſion and every ſort of villany may be expected from him?</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſidered the <hi>qualifications</hi> of <hi>civil rulers;</hi> or what they are to be and do, according to that power they have received from CHRIST, and that relation wherein they ſtand. And when rulers are thus qualified, it is from CHRIST: He is the fountain of all good, and diſtributes his bleſſings as pleaſeth him; and they are his gifts and graces that adorn the magiſtrate, and in which he ſhines.</p>
            <p>I am now to conſider,</p>
            <p>In the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt place. <hi>The</hi> regards <hi>which</hi> CHRIST <hi>upon the throne, who has conſtituted civil rulers, will have us pay to them.</hi> Now we are to honour them as temporal fathers; to ſupport the dignity of government by paying them their <hi>juſt tributes;</hi> to pray for the divine bleſſing upon their perſons and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005326_0039_1016FFCB9DD96B20"/>
adminiſtrations; and to yeild a voluntary and chearful ſubjection to them in all their lawful demands. The debt of <hi>honour</hi> to them is a moral precept, doubtleſs couched under the law of the <hi>fifth</hi> commandment. <hi>Honour the king,</hi> which may include <hi>inferiour officers,</hi> is alſo an apoſtolick charge: This honour is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by outward geſtures, and by defending and preſerving their character againſt ſuch <hi>male-contents</hi> as make too free and bold with it, <hi>ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> and reproach their adminiſtration; and by <hi>rendering</hi> them that <hi>tribute</hi> or <hi>cuſtom</hi> which is proper in their exalted ſtations. And then, as we ſhould <hi>pray</hi> that they may be under the <hi>divine influence</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> from the KING upon the throne to the <hi>loweſt officer</hi> under him, ſo we ſhould <hi>ſubmit to every ordinance of man for the</hi> LORD's <hi>ſake;</hi> the apoſtle's words are awful Rom. 13. 2. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of GOD; and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation:</hi> It intends <hi>lawful</hi> authority; for it is no fault at all, but a duty to diſobey, if theſe <hi>injunctions</hi> are oppoſite to the laws of GOD: It is an eternal maxim of truth, that GOD muſt be obeyed rather than man.</p>
            <p>But I may not enlarge upon theſe things, but paſs to the uſe of what has been ſpoken in ſome <hi>inferences,</hi> omitting others.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Again conſider,</p>
            <p>That your <hi>time of ſervice</hi> for CHRIST and this people is <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>ſhort,</hi> This is a melancholy motive, but ſhould be a quickning one, to our rulers, and to us all, to be active and diligent in the ſervice before us; as our LORD himſelf was quickned in his work from this conſideration. 'Tis a dying world we are in; <hi>our days on earth are as a ſhadow, there is none abiding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where are all the ſons of ſame we read of in paſt ages? And, where are thoſe that once were the lights of <hi>our Iſrael,</hi> our ſheilds and our glory?

            <p>The <hi>account</hi> you muſt quickly give up to the great and impartial JUDGE of the world. And how will magiſtrates, negligent of their duty, dare to hold up their guilty heads, before the flaming tribunal above; when they ſhall be charged not only with their own <hi>perſonal</hi> ſins, but with all <hi>other's</hi> ſins, perpetrated by their contrivance? Such loads of guilt will expoſe them to a moſt intolerable doom and puniſhment in the other world.</p>

acceptance among us; which affords us ground to hope that it will be your deſire and endeavour to make us happy, by a vigorous proſecution of every thing within your ſphere, that is requiſite to promote the religious and civil intereſts of this people.</p>
            <p>Your EXCELLENCY has the honour of being placed at the <hi>head</hi> of a <hi>province,</hi> that has been as remarkable for piety towards GOD, and loyalty to the <hi>crown,</hi> as any one in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions: A <hi>province</hi> that has been the delight and the care of heaven, and in a very ſignal manner ſmil'd on the proſpered; that it may be ſaid,—<hi>Who is like unto thee, Oh people, ſaved by the</hi> LORD, <hi>the ſhield of thy help, and the ſword of thy excellency.</hi> And therefore, SIR, your tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards for us, and endeavour to make us ſtill a more flouriſhing and happy people, will be an offering high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceptable to the LORD. A great opportunity is put into your hands to do us good; and we would hope it is becauſe GOD <hi>loveth his people</hi> that he has ſet your EXCELLENCY over us in ſuch a day and time as this: And that you will be the means of delivering us from the perplexing difficulties we are involved in, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by an <hi>unhappy Medium,</hi> uncertain as the wind, and fluctuating like the waves of the ſea, and which lies at the mercy of every one to riſe or ſink at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; thro' the <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> whereof the land mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and the cries of many are going up into the ears of the LORD of <hi>Sabaoth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would alſo humbly aſk your EXCELLENCY'S ſmiles upon the COLLEGE, the chief ſeat of learning among us, the glory of NEW-ENGLAND; and eſpecially at ſuch a time as this, when learning is deſpiſed and vilified as a thing prejudicial to the church and ſtate; whereas it is the honour and ſafety of both.</p>

With this conſideration, <hi>Thetis</hi> comforts her brave ſon in <hi>Homer,</hi> that though he ſhould be ſhort lived, yet he ſhould continue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the admiration of poſterity; by this means, tho' you ſeek not glory to yourſelf, yet you ſhall <hi>obtain a good report,</hi> and your <hi>memory ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> when the <hi>memory of the wicked ſhall periſh.</hi> But alas, what and how little is this compared with that honour, which CHRIST <hi>upon the throne</hi> will confer upon you, as a recompence to your fidelity in his ſervice, and which infinitely tranſcends all the honours of this paſſing world, and ſhall laſt for ever.</p>
            <p>I conclude with my earneſt wiſhes, that the beſt of bleſſings may deſcend &amp; reſt upon your EXCELLENCY'S <hi>perſon</hi> &amp; <hi>family</hi> to the period of a holy and happy life; and that you may be late tranſmitted to the bleſſed regions of immortality and glory above, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thro' the good hand of our GOD upon us, you are met together to day to chooſe <hi>one branch</hi> of our legiſlature. Now there are <hi>two</hi> things that ought to govern you in your <hi>election;</hi> One is, the <hi>ability</hi> or
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005326_0048_1016FFE681D423C0"/>
               <hi>fitneſs</hi> of the perſon you vote for, that he is a man of good knowledge and wiſdom, and a man of integrity; if he is defective in theſe, he is certainly deſtitute of the eſſential qualifications for government. The other is this, In your choice have a <hi>principal regard</hi> for the <hi>glory of</hi> CHRIST upon the throne, and the <hi>good of your Country;</hi> not to pleaſe men, but GOD; not to ſerve a party-ſpirit; not to gratify any one's ambition or humour; not from a contracted ſelfiſh principle: I hope, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> you will deteſt ſuch low and ſiniſter deſigns. Be pleaſed to think with yourſelves, before you caſt your <hi>vote,</hi> Will it be an act <hi>pleaſing to the Lord</hi> CHRIST, that I hold up my hand, or give my vote for ſuch a man? What is the <hi>principle</hi> that governs me in it? Is it becauſe I think him the moſt capable, and beſt diſpoſed to ſerve the publick? Or have I ſomething elſe in view? Let not <hi>prejudice</hi> or <hi>affection</hi> turn the ſcale; and ſuch a man be neglected or left out, becauſe he is not in ſuch a <hi>ſcheme</hi> or <hi>party,</hi> tho' otherwiſe well qualified; and another take place that is leſs worthy, becauſe he has ſuch a turn of thought, or is likely to ſerve ſuch a deſign. It was once the complaint of a wiſe and political head, <hi>I am not able to bear this people myſelf alone;</hi> and it was good policy (and ſoon became ſound divinity) which <hi>Jethro</hi> gave him, <hi>to take wiſe men, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and known among the tribes,</hi> and place ſuch to be rulers. Never did the circumſtances of this people call for more of the ſpirit of <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, compaſſion</hi> &amp; <hi>integrity,</hi> than at this day: When the tide ſerves, the wind blows favourably, and all things make for the voyage, a leſs degree of ſkill may poſſibly ſuffice; but it requires an <hi>artiſt to ſteer in a ſtorm.</hi>

And, <hi>honour'd Sirs,</hi> after the affair of this day is over, and the ſeveral <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>legiſlature</hi> come to act in concert, it is to be deſired, that you may all approve yourſelves what by <hi>profeſſion</hi> and <hi>character</hi> you are, the <hi>ſervants of the Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST; a title which no man has any cauſe to be aſhamed of, and which no <hi>angel</hi> or <hi>arch-angel,</hi> but is fond of; and that you manifeſt your <hi>love</hi> and <hi>loyalty</hi> to him, in a <hi>reſolute</hi> and <hi>vigorous oppoſition</hi> to every thing that tends to <hi>obſtruct</hi> his intereſt, and the flouriſhing of religion in the truth and purity of it among us;—And in a ſolemn and reverend regard to the DAY, the <hi>houſe</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> of GOD, and that a proper care be taken to prevent the great and ſcandalous diſorders that ſome are chargeable with in theſe reſpects. I am ſenſible there are good and wholeſome laws provided, to oblige all perſons to <hi>attend</hi> the publick worſhip, and to prevent <hi>unneceſſary travels</hi> upon the SABBATH; but how little regard is paid to them? They are every day trampled on, and in the open face of ſome in authority, and yet there is little or no notice taken of it: This is <hi>an iniquity to be puniſhed by the judges;</hi> but if the civil officer <hi>neglects his duty,</hi> the whole land becomes guilty and muſt ſuffer for it, for there needs nothing more to make a ſin <hi>publick,</hi> than that it is connived at by thoſe, in whoſe <hi>power alone</hi> it is to ſuppreſs it.</p>
            <p>To draw to a cloſe, Let us all <hi>practically acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the regency of</hi> CHRIST, and <hi>ſubmit</hi> to all his <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>demands</hi> upon us. Our duty herein is too evident to be diſputed, and the conſequent advantage of it is a dignity and felicity beyond all expreſſion, thought or parallel. HEAVEN, with all its charms

But <hi>where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?</hi> CHRIST <hi>upon the throne</hi> has power enough to condemn &amp; puniſh them; and will exert his power, as for the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of his willing people, ſo for the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of all his enemies.

harm from one ſo degraded: They ſlight his threats, &amp; ſeem to queſtion his ability to execute them, but they will feel the diſmal effects of them, to their everlaſting confuſion.—<hi>Who hath ever harden'd himſelf againſt GOD, and proſpered?</hi> He can cruſh the daring rebel with greater eaſe than we can the feeble worm: To allude to Job 41. 20. <hi>Out of his mouth goeth a flame; when he raiſeth up himſelf, the mighty are afraid.—He is a king over all the children of pride.</hi> There is not any creature <hi>that has an arm as GOD;</hi> or,<hi>that can thunder with a voice like him?</hi> What is the chaff be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtrong wind, or briars and thorns to the raging fire? No more is the ſinner in his hand: He that triumphed over all the powers of hell, when ſet in battel array againſt him, can eaſily conquer the ſinner when he preſumes to enter the liſts with him. He decks himſelf with majeſty and excellency, and arays himſelf with glory and beauty; he caſts abroad the rage of his wrath; beholds every one that is proud, and abaſes him; looks upon him, and brings him low, and treads the wicked under his feet; he girdeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſtrength unto battel, purſues his enemies and overtakes them, as he did the <hi>Egyptian</hi> hoſt, in their purſuit of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> neither doth he turn again 'till they are conſumed. Sinners are but plotting miſchief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, and paving the way to their own deſtruction, when they are regardleſs of his laws, and trample his authority under their feet: They may think they act wiſely for themſelves; but they ſhall find it otherwiſe, repent their choice and upbraid their folly when it is too late, and they ſhall come to <hi>drink of the wine of the wrath of GOD, which is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;</hi> and ſhall be <hi>tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the

preſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the lamb.</hi> This, Oh ſinner, will be thy fate unleſs thou art wiſe betimes to make thy peace with the SON of GOD. 'Tis to be earneſtly wiſhed, that every poor and periſhing ſoul would be perſuaded to ſubmit to CHRIST, accept him as his LORD, open his heart, and invite him to come in, and be willing to let <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſelf,</hi> and all, go to make room for <hi>him.</hi> And let us all expreſs our loyalty to CHRIST by our <hi>ſubmiſſion to our civil rulers,</hi> who bear the title of GODS, and are inveſted with ſometing of <hi>his</hi> authority.

            <p>And now, May the GOD of peace and grace be with us, and do for us, and for this whole people, exceeding abundantly above all that we are able to aſk or think; and may our hearts be perfect with the LORD our GOD, all our days, and may it be well with us for ever; for the ſake of JESUS CHRIST, to whom with the FATHER, and the bleſſed SPIRIT, be aſcribed, as is moſt due, all honour and praiſe, might, majeſty and dominion, both now, henceforth, and in eternal ages.</p>
