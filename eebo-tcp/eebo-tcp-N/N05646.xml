            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Matt. 19, 18.</bibl>
               <q>—<hi>Jeſus ſaid, Thou ſhalt do no Murder.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> are quoted from the <hi>ſixth</hi> of the <hi>ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which God publiſhed from <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the hearing of the main Body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, and wrote on <hi>two Tables of Stone,</hi> that they might be a <hi>ſtanding perpetual Rule</hi> for the Direction of their Conduct towards Him and one another. And as <hi>all</hi> theſe Commandments (the Fourth only excepted, and this only in part) are grounded on <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and not <hi>meer poſitive Inſtitution,</hi> they are <hi>univerſally</hi> obligatory, ſo far as Mankind are under Advantages to become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. This is particularly true of the <hi>Commandment</hi> I have juſt read to you; becauſe it took riſe from that <hi>Fitneſs</hi> and <hi>Propriety</hi> of Action, which is everlaſtingly due from Men towards each other, as they are <hi>all of one Blood,</hi> and endowed with the ſame <hi>common Right</hi> to the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of Life here on Earth. And this <hi>Commandment</hi> is <hi>eminently</hi> bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as it has been adopted by our great Maſter and Lord into <hi>his Religion,</hi> and makes one of the important <hi>Laws of his Kingdom. Jeſus ſaid,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007168_0004_102ADE09EE07A548"/>
Thou ſhalt do no Murder.</hi> In diſcourſing to which Words, I ſhall endeavour two Things.</p>
            <p>I. Firſt, <hi>Explain</hi> the <hi>Senſe</hi> in which we are here commanded to <hi>do no Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Secondly, <hi>Enforce</hi> the Command, by repreſenting the <hi>horrid Nature,</hi> and <hi>enormous Guilt</hi> of the Sin of <hi>Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall then conclude the Diſcourſe with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. Firſt, I am to <hi>explain</hi> the Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is plain, if one Man ſhould ſlay another by <hi>meer Chance,</hi> as we vulgarly ſpeak; that is, when he had no <hi>Intention</hi> to do it, nor any Thought of being the occaſion of Hurt to him, in the leaſt, it is a <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap</hi> only, and not the <hi>Crime</hi> here cautioned againſt. Accordingly we find, that God himſelf, in this Caſe, frees a Man from <hi>Guilt,</hi> ordaining that he ſhall live. Deut. 19. 4, 5. <hi>Whoſo killeth his Brother ignorantly, whom he hated not in Time paſt, as when a Man goeth into the Wood with his Neighbour to hew Wood, and his Hand fetcheth a ſtroke with the Ax to cut down the Tree, and the Head ſlippeth from the Helve, and lighteth upon his Neighbour that he die, he ſhall—live.</hi> Only, it ought to be remembred here, <hi>Careleſſneſs</hi> is a <hi>Fault;</hi> and ſhould we, in this Way, be the <hi>occaſion,</hi> tho' <hi>accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> of another, we might have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for uneaſy Reflections on ourſelves; much more, if we were engaged in <hi>that</hi> which was in it ſelf <hi>unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable</hi> and <hi>ſinful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If one Man ſhould take away another's Life, in <hi>neceſſary Self-Defence;</hi> as when, by being <hi>ſuddenly</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> aſſaulted, he is obliged to repel Force with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007168_0005_102ADE33C5A8D270"/>
Force, or run the Riſque of loſing his own Life, he is not chargeable with the Sin of <hi>Murder.</hi> In Caſes of this Sort, the Fault lies not with him that <hi>ſlays,</hi> but with him who is <hi>ſlain.</hi> The Man who was thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſmite his Brother is innocent. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Guilt of Blood; but it is wholly chargeable upon him who gave the <hi>occaſion</hi> for exerting the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable Right,</hi> which Men have to <hi>preſerve</hi> themſelves. The <hi>Scripture</hi> therefore ſays, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>If a Thief be found breaking up, and be ſmitten that he die, there ſhall be no Blood ſhed for him.</hi> He is himſelf the <hi>proper ſole</hi> Cauſe of this Evil; and ought therefore to be the <hi>only</hi> Sufferer for it. Tho' great Care ſhould be taken, that Men do not needleſly expoſe themſelves to the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of exerting their <hi>Right of Self-Defence:</hi> nor ſhould they ever exert this Right, in this <hi>extreme</hi> Caſe, unleſs when the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>apparently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, <hi>Enemies</hi> may be <hi>ſlain</hi> in <hi>War,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Breach of this <hi>Command:</hi> Always provided, the <hi>War</hi> is engaged in upon <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> Reaſons; as, to redreſs Injuries, guard againſt Wrongs and Violence, and ſecure the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of valuable Rights and Privileges; all other Methods having prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ineffectual. In this Caſe, it is rather a <hi>Virtue</hi> than a <hi>Crime,</hi> to be inſtrumental in curbing the Inſolence of Enemies, and weakning their Strength to injure and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; tho' in the doing of it, Numbers of them ſhould be <hi>ſlain.</hi> They are indeed the <hi>faulty Cauſes</hi> of their own Death. The oppoſing them with <hi>Force</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be conſidered as an Act of <hi>publick Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Self-Defence;</hi> and thoſe who are <hi>active</hi> herein, inſtead of being <hi>faulted,</hi> ought to be <hi>applauded:</hi> And the more ſucceſsful they are in reducing <hi>ſuch Enemies</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> the more worthy they are of <hi>Honour.</hi> But if <hi>Wars</hi> are come into <hi>meerly</hi> to ſerve the Ends of <hi>Pride, Ambition, Avarice,</hi> or any other <hi>Luſt,</hi> either of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Mind,</hi> the <hi>Lives</hi> which are taken
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007168_0006_102ADE0C3552AA50"/>
away in <hi>ſuch Wars</hi> are really ſo many <hi>horrid Murders.</hi> How far the <hi>immediate Inſtruments</hi> may be chargeable with <hi>Blame</hi> in God's Sight, may be difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but it is, at once, evident, that their <hi>Employers,</hi> the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the Earth, are, in this Caſe, <hi>inhuman, cruel, barbarous Butchers</hi> of their Fellow-Men, and will be treated <hi>as ſuch</hi> by the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> who <hi>reſpecteth not the Perſons of Men;</hi> but will <hi>render to all,</hi> whether high or low, without favour or Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>according to their Deeds,</hi> in the Day of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Son Jeſus Chriſt to judge the World in Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>In fine, If Men are <hi>put to Death</hi> for <hi>Capital Crimes</hi> by Authority from the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> who is <hi>God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> and <hi>holds the Sword</hi> for this very Purpoſe, it is not a Treſpaſs upon my Text; but an act of <hi>publick Service,</hi> neceſſary for the <hi>well-being of Society;</hi> which could not ſubſiſt, if wicked and violent Men ſhould be ſuffered, with Impunity, to invade the Rights of others, as their ungoverned Luſts might prompt them thereto.</p>
            <p>Theſe Caſes being excepted, the Sin forbidden in this <hi>Commandment,</hi> is the <hi>voluntary taking away another's Life without Cauſe, or without a juſt and neceſſary one:</hi> Upon what <hi>Motive</hi> ſoever it is done, whether from Hatred, or Malice, or Envy, or Revenge, or preſumed Safety, or pretended Reparation of Honour: Or, by what <hi>Means</hi> ſoever it be effected; whether by direct Violence, or fraudulent Contrivance; in an open, or clandeſtine Manner; immediately by ourſelves, or by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of others. Or if Life ſhould not be <hi>actually</hi> taken away, yet is this Commandment violated, at leaſt, in the all ſeeing View of God, if it was <hi>endeavoured,</hi> and ſuch Endeavour would have taken Effect, had it not been counter-acted by ſome unforeſeen Turn or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Conduct of Providence; as in the Caſe of thoſe, who entered into a Conſpiracy to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007168_0007_102ADE362FB93960"/>
laid wait for him, in proſecution of this bloody Deſign, but were hindred, beyond their own Intention, from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing it; <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12, 14.</p>
            <p>This now is the Crime which is here forbidden; and it is a <hi>more</hi> or a <hi>leſs</hi> aggravated one, in proportion to the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that attend it. If the <hi>Deſign</hi> upon another's Life was not <hi>ſuddenly</hi> excited; but took riſe from <hi>cool, deliberate, ſettled, Hatred and Malice,</hi> it is <hi>Murder</hi> in the <hi>groſſeſt</hi> Senſe. Nor will the <hi>Manner</hi> in which it was committed make any conſiderable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the <hi>Degree of Guilt.</hi> It is <hi>Murder of the deepeſt Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>Murder</hi> alſo, tho' in a <hi>leſs</hi> criminal Senſe, when Life is taken away, not from a <hi>ſettled Principle</hi> of <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>deliberate</hi> Malice, but in conſequence of <hi>ſudden An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> heightened into <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury.</hi> What Allowances <hi>human Laws,</hi> under ſome Governments, may make for ſudden Tranſports of Paſſion, and how far, in ſome Caſes, they may be ſatisfied without the <hi>Blood</hi> of the guilty Perſon, I pretend not to determine; but, in true <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it is evidently <hi>unfit,</hi> that <hi>Life</hi> ſhould be continually expoſed to hazard, from the turbulent and ungoverned Wrath of Men. This would be to ſubject quiet and peaceable Members of Society to the greateſt <hi>Hardſhips,</hi> by <hi>conſtructively</hi> giving Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>angry Men</hi> to vent their Fury on them. It is plain, the poſſeſſion of Life is not ſo ſtrongly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſecured as it might be, and ought to be, in well regulated Society, if <hi>paſſionate</hi> Men may be indulged the Liberty of ſlaying their Neighbours; provided they are able to plead, they were in a <hi>Fit of Rage,</hi> not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the government of themſelves, and not knowing what they did.

into Rage, which hurries a Man on wickedly and injuriouſly to invade his Neighbour, and deprive him of Life, is <hi>murderous</hi> in the Eye of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and in the Eye of God, and it is Pity if it is not, in all Places, ſo eſteemed, by the <hi>Law of Man.</hi> I now proceed,</p>
            <p>II. In the ſecond Place, to <hi>enforce</hi> the Command in my Text, by repreſenting the <hi>horrid Nature</hi> of this Sin of <hi>Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed one of the <hi>blackeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>monſtrous</hi> Sins, and ſo eſteemed both by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is mentioned by Name, in the ſacred Writings, as a Sin which is eminently <hi>hateful</hi> to <hi>God. Pſalm 5. 6. The Lord will abhor the bloody Man. Prov. 6. 16, 17. Hands that ſhed innocent Blood are an Abomination to the Lord.</hi> And he has accordingly teſtified his great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt this Sin, even from the Beginning of the World. That was his Language to <hi>Cain,</hi> the Son of the firſt Man that ever lived, upon having <hi>murdered</hi> his Brother <hi>Abel. Gen. 4. 10, 11. 12. What haſt thou done? The Voice of thy Brother's Blood crieth to me from the Ground. And now thou art curſed from the Earth, which hath opened her Mouth to receive thy Brother's Blood from thy Hand.—A fugitive and a Vagabond ſhalt thou be in the Earth.</hi> An awful Puniſhment this! And well might <hi>Cain</hi> break forth, and ſay, as in the Words that next follow, <hi>My Puniſhment is greater than I can bear!</hi> It may be worthy Obſervation, The moſt awfully ſevere and extenſive Judgment God, was ever pleaſed to viſit this World of ours with, was <hi>its Deſtruction by a Deluge of Water,</hi> one Family only excepted; and the Reaſon is given, <hi>Gen. 6. 11. Becauſe the Earth was filled with Violence.</hi> And it was to prevent <hi>ſuch Violence</hi> in the <hi>new Generations</hi> that might proceed out of the Loins of <hi>Noah,</hi> that God made it a <hi>ſtanding perpetual Law. Gen.</hi> 9. 5, 6. <hi>At the Hand of every Man's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007168_0009_102ADE38D32EEB50"/>
will I require the Life of Man. Whoſo ſheddeth Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed.</hi> And when he took upon himſelf the more <hi>ſpecial Government</hi> of the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he peremptorily annexed the Sentence of <hi>Death,</hi> to the Law againſt <hi>Murder.</hi> And that it might be known what Murder was, he ſays, concerning every Man that ſhould kill his Neighbour, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 16. <hi>And if he ſmite him with an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iron, ſo that he die, he is a Murderer: The Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> It follows, in the next Verſe, <hi>And if he ſmite him with throwing a Stone, and he die: he is a Murderer: The Murderer ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> It is yet added in the following Verſe, which may be worthy of Notice, upon this Occaſion, <hi>or if he ſmite him with a hand-weapon of Wood (wherewith he may die) and he die; he is a Murderer: The Murderer ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> And it is farther obſervable, the Sovereign Lord of Life was pleaſed moſt ſolemnly, and in expreſs Words, to prohibit <hi>the taking any Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Life of a Murderer,</hi> as in the 30th and 31ſt Verſes of this Chapter, <hi>Whoſo killeth any Perſon, the Murderer ſhall be put to Death—ye ſhall take no Satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer; but he ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> And that this Law might not be evaded, by the Flight of <hi>Murderers</hi> to any of the <hi>Cities of Refuge</hi> (a Number of which were appointed for the Protection of thoſe, who tho' they had <hi>killed others,</hi> yet were not chargeable with <hi>Murder</hi>) he particularly ordained, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>That they ſhould be fetched thence, and delivered into the Hands of the Avenger of Blood, that they might die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more than all this, the holy God, to ſignify his great Indignation againſt this Sin of <hi>Murder,</hi> has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly rank't it, in the Revelation of his Will by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, among thoſe <hi>Crimes</hi> which, if not repented of, will certainly be a Bar in the Way of Men's obtaining <hi>Life in Heaven,</hi> according to 1 <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:007168_0010_102ADE53B7AB4820"/>
3. 15. <hi>No Murderer hath eternal Life;</hi> yea, he has mentioned it, by Name, as a <hi>Sin</hi> that will, without ſincere Repentance, expoſe Men to the <hi>ſecond Death,</hi> or, which means the ſame Thing, <hi>the Fire of Hell,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. <hi>Murderers ſhall have their Part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone: which is the ſecond Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this Sin of <hi>Murder</hi> is thus ſingularly <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>black</hi> in the Eſteem of <hi>God,</hi> ſo it is likewiſe in the Account of <hi>Man.</hi> It is indeed a Crime that is <hi>ſhocking</hi> to the human Mind, unleſs when abandoned to all Senſe of what is right and fit: Nor are there many, however debauched in their Principles, and diſſolute in their Manners, but would find within themſelves <hi>uneaſy Emotions</hi> of Soul at the Thought of committing a <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Murder;</hi> adopting the Language of <hi>Hazael,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog that he ſhould do this Thing?</hi> All civilized Nations have, as one, united in ranking <hi>Murder</hi> among the moſt <hi>enormous Crimes,</hi> and guarding againſt it by enacting <hi>Laws</hi> with the Sanction of <hi>Death.</hi> We know indeed of no People, however rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated, in other Reſpects, but have entertained a kind of <hi>Horror</hi> at the Sin of <hi>Murder;</hi> judging it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſome remarkable Puniſhment. Hence the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> at <hi>Melita,</hi> reaſoned among themſelves, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 4. <hi>No doubt this Man is a Murderer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom, tho' he hath eſcaped the Sea, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Vengeance ſuffereth not to live.</hi> And even <hi>Murderers</hi> themſelves, when they come coolly to reflect upon what they have done, are commonly filled with great <hi>inward Remorſe;</hi> turning upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the keeneſt reſentments of their Folly. And ſhould they eſcape the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of Man, they ſcarce ever after enjoy themſelves, or take Comfort in Life. Their Hearts miſgive them; their Thoughts trouble them; their guilty Fears perpetually haunt them: And ſometimes, for the ſake of <hi>Peace within,</hi> they have been, as it were, forced to reveal their own Wickedneſs;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007168_0011_102ADE3AD8BD5020"/>
chuſing rather to die by the <hi>Hands of Juſtice,</hi> than to drag on Life under the uneaſy Senſations of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Self-condemning Conſcience.</p>
            <p>And it is upon <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> Grounds, that <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is thus reckoned by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> as one of the <hi>blackeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>monſtrous</hi> Crimes, and felt to be ſo by <hi>Murderers</hi> themſelves: For it carries in it, in an high Degree, <hi>Uncharitableneſs, Injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>Impiety;</hi> each of which are in themſelves great Breaches upon the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> to our Neighbour is the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary <hi>Commandment;</hi> and like the firſt, which requires <hi>Love to God,</hi> it is great and important. <hi>On theſe two Commandments hang the Law and the Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> We are deſtitute of all Virtue and Religion, if we do not <hi>love God;</hi> and it is a vain Thing to pretend that we love God, if we love not our Neighbour alſo. For as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 20. <hi>If a Man ſays that he loves God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar; for he that loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he hath ſeen, cannot love God whom he hath not ſeen.</hi> And what ſtronger Evidence can a Man give, that he don't love his Brother, than embruing his Hands in his Blood? This is the ſtrongeſt Proof of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely void of that Chriſtian Temper which is kind, and gentle, and peaceable, and apt to put one upon walking with all Lowlinſs, and Meekneſs, and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering; forbearing and forgiving one another in Love. To be ſure, when one Man is urged on to ſlay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Malice, deliberate</hi> and <hi>premeditated,</hi> he diſcovers <hi>Uncharitableneſs,</hi> in the higheſt Degree; yea, <hi>Inhumanity</hi> and <hi>Barbarity</hi> reign in him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Good-Will</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Piety.</hi> To hate a Brother to the Death is the utmoſt Pitch of Hatred. And if, in imitation of our Maſter and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and out of reſpect to him, we ought to be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007168_0012_102ADE55B4F01BD8"/>
willing to lay down our Lives for the Brethren, it muſt be a moſt enormous Breach of <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> for a Man wilfully, and without Cauſe, to take away his Brother's Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judgment</hi> is as <hi>weighty</hi> a matter of God's Law as Mercy; for the Lord our God hath particularly required it of us <hi>to do Juſtice.</hi> But the <hi>Murderer</hi> outragiouſly tranſgreſſeth the Rule of Right; invading his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Property, in the moſt indiſputable Caſe: For the Poſſeſſion of Life is what he claims by <hi>immediate Grant</hi> from the great Sovereign of the Univerſe. And by invading this Right he does him the greateſt poſſible Injury; for he deprives him of the moſt <hi>valuable Good.</hi> Nothing indeed, in all the World, is ſo precious as Life; for it is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all other Enjoyments, and juſtly preferable to them all. The Father of Lies therefore ſpake Truth, when he ſaid, as in <hi>Job</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Skin for Skin, all that a Man hath will he give for his Life.</hi> Nor can the Loſs of it be repaired or compenſated. He that loſeth his Life, loſeth therewith all future Capacity of Enjoyment in this World, without any Poſſibility of recovering it again. It is therefore the higheſt and moſt aggravated Injury that can be done to a Man to take away his Life unjuſtly. It, in a manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſſes every other Evil, whether in Name, Eſtate, or bodily Welfare in any Kind; for theſe <q>have their Meaſure, and may be capable of ſome Reparation: But this is altogether extreme and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides it ought to be remembred here, when a Man wickedly ſlays his Brother, he not only, at once, turns him out of all Capacity of enjoying any farther Good in this World, but deprives him of the Time he might otherwiſe have had to make Preparation for <hi>another World,</hi> and may be the <hi>Means</hi> of his being <hi>tormented,</hi> inſtead of <hi>comforted</hi> there. The <hi>Murderer</hi> of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007168_0013_102ADE3CD7872D98"/>
not only robs him of his <hi>temporal Life,</hi> and all <hi>Temporal Good</hi> therewith; but of his <hi>Space for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and Opportunity to make his Peace with God, and to get into good Terms with Heaven: And if he ſhould <hi>ſuddenly</hi> diſpatch him into the other World, and in his Sins too, as, it may be feared, is too often the Caſe, he is, in a Senſe, the Murderer of his <hi>Soul,</hi> as well as Body, and may properly be charged with bringing upon him the <hi>ſecond,</hi> as well as the <hi>firſt Death.</hi> A very ſerious and awful Truth this! And if it were duly attended to, might, under the Bleſſing of God, be happily influential to reſtrain from the horrid Sin of <hi>Murder.</hi> It is not confined, in its Conſequences, to the preſent World; but may prove <hi>injurious</hi> to our poor innocent Brother, innocent as to us, beyond the Grave, in the <hi>Reſurrection World.</hi> Many a poor Sinner, it may be feared, by the Murder of his Body, has been <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>conſtructively</hi> murdered in his <hi>Soul</hi> alſo. And ſhall we dare venture upon the Commiſſion of a Crime <hi>which</hi> may be the <hi>immediate Occaſion</hi> of the <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of our Brother? Shall we not rather keep at the utmoſt Diſtance from that Act of <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> towards our Brother, which, together with deſtroying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Body,</hi> may be the <hi>Means</hi> of deſtroying his <hi>Soul in Hell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may ſtill add here, the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> involved in the Sin of <hi>Murder,</hi> affects others beſides the Man himſelf that is turned out of Life. His <hi>Relations,</hi> eſpecially <hi>near</hi> ones are greatly <hi>injured;</hi> as hereby thoſe <hi>natural Paſſions</hi> are awakened, which occaſion the keeneſt Senſe of Pain, and, many Times, abiding Sorrow of Heart, ſuch as they are never freed from on this Side the Grave. Beſides which, they are deprived of the <hi>Advantage</hi> they might have received from him, upon whom, under God, they chiefly depended for their comfortable Subſiſtence in Being. The Wife of a Man's Boſom is ſometimes, by this injurious Sin, at once ſubjected, not meerly to the Solitude of a widowed Life, but to unknown Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007168_0014_102ADE57C7653BF8"/>
Anxieties, and Hardſhips conſequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; while, at the ſame Time, his Children are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the State of poor helpleſs Orphans, without a Guide to their Youth, or, it may be, any Means to provide for their Education, and future Welfare in the Word.—But God only knows all the <hi>Injuries</hi> which are <hi>connected</hi> with this unjuſt Act of taking away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Life.—Whole Families have been ruined by it; yea, in its unhappy Conſequences, it may have been the <hi>Means</hi> of their Ruin in <hi>another World,</hi> as well as <hi>this.</hi>—Moreover, the <hi>Public</hi> is highly injured by the Sin of <hi>Murder,</hi> as well as the <hi>murdered Perſon</hi> himſelf, and his <hi>Relatives.</hi> It loſes one of its Members, and, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herewith, all the Service it might have reaped from one in his Place, in the Improvement of his Time and Talents, for promoting the general Good. And, as the Caſe may be, and ſometimes really has been, the Injury, in this Reſpect, riſes high, and proves an irreparable Damage.—Such <hi>Injuſtice</hi> is involved in the Sin of <hi>Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It argues alſo <hi>Impiety</hi> againſt God, and to a great Degree; for it is a downright Encroachment upon, and Uſurpation of, that <hi>Right over Life,</hi> which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord of the Univerſe has reſerved to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by <hi>himſelf only,</hi> or by his <hi>Vice-gerents</hi> in certain Caſes, wherein the Good of Society may make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.—And it is, in another Reſpect, an high Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered to God; for it diſpoſſeſſes him of his <hi>juſt Property,</hi> by virtually robbing him of a <hi>Creature</hi> whom his Hands have formed; yea, of a <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> from whom he might have received a Revenue of Honour and Service. Beſides all which, it is a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of that Image of God</hi> which every Man natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bears. And it was indeed for this Reaſon, in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, that the <hi>Statute</hi> againſt <hi>Murder,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> was guarded by God himſelf with the Sanction of <hi>Death.</hi> So we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth Man's
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007168_0015_102ADE3EC9468300"/>
Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed; for in the Image of God made he Man.</hi> The Man who <hi>murderouſly</hi> ſheds another's Blood, is not thought fit, by the Wiſdom of the Supreme Legiſlator, to live any longer on the Earth; becauſe he hereby heinouſly affronts God, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contempt on the nobleſt Work of his Hands, <hi>that</hi> which he made <hi>after his own Likeneſs, in his own Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, upon the whole, this Sin of <hi>Murder</hi> appears to be one of the <hi>fouleſt</hi> and <hi>blackeſt</hi> Crimes, of very <hi>heinous</hi> and <hi>complicated</hi> Guilt. It is at once a Sin againſt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> It virtually <hi>uſurps God's ſovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> his Throne of Juſtice, his Sword of Vengeance; and it does the <hi>higheſt Injuſtice</hi> to Man, both in his <hi>private Capacity,</hi> and as related in Society.</p>

He has had a fair Trial conformably to the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land; and as, upon a full hearing of his Caſe, it very evidently appeared, that he had <hi>murderouſly ſhed Man's Blood,</hi> it is right and fit, that <hi>by Man his Blood ſhould be ſhed.</hi> Our Hearts may poſſibly relent towards him; we may be diſpoſed, from the working of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pity, to wiſh he might be permitted to live, and not obliged to die: But the great Governour of the World, who is <hi>infinitely</hi> merciful, but, at the ſame Time, <hi>wiſely</hi> ſo, has ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 13. <hi>Thine Eye ſhall not Pity him;</hi> that is, ſo as to ſave him from Death: <hi>Thou ſhalt put away innocent Blood from Iſrael;</hi> that is, by ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Blood of the Murderer.

May that God, who pities thoſe who hope in his Mercy, as a Father pities his Children, pity her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed Caſe, comfort her Heart, ſanctify this Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to her, and make it turn out to her Spiritual and everlaſting Good!</p>
               <p>May the poor <hi>innocent Children,</hi> alſo, innocent of this great Crime for which their Father ignominiouſly ſuffers Death, find Favour with him who has ſaid, <hi>All Souls are mine; as the Soul of the Father, ſo alſo

the Soul of the Son is mine. The Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die:—The Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father.</hi> And may they find favour with <hi>Man</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Let none caſt it cruelly in their Teeth, that their Father died a <hi>Murderer.</hi> Let none think, or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And may they underſtand, and hearken to, the Voice of God in this awful Providence, which loudly calls upon them, not to forſake him, leaſt he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and leave them to reap the Conſequences of their own Folly, even in this World, as far as Death, with public Ignominy.</p>
               <p>We cordially mourn with the <hi>aged Parents</hi> of this unhappy Man. The Occaſion of their Grief is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bitter. What Conſolations in Chriſt do they ſtand in need of? Can we who are <hi>Parents,</hi> put our Souls in their Souls ſtead, and not mingle our Tears with theirs? If we have any Bowels, they cannot but be moved within us. Let it be our ardent Prayer to the God who dwelleth on high, that he would ſend the <hi>Comforter</hi> to dwell in their Hearts, that this Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, added to that of <hi>Age,</hi> may not bear too hard upon them. He only can relieve their Souls. And if he ſhall pleaſe to undertake for their Help, this Stroke of his Hand, ſevere as it is, ſhall only ſerve for the Trial of their Faith, and Hope, and Patience, and Subjection to the Father of Spirits; which Graces, being proved to be <hi>more precious than Gold that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> tho' it ſhould be tried <hi>with Fire, ſhall be found unto Praiſe, and Honour, and Glory, at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for this is that which he hath ſaid, and on which he hath cauſed us to hope, <hi>Bleſſed are they which endure Affliction; for when they are tried,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007168_0019_102ADE43B2A3E1E8"/>
they ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Relatives</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> are not the only Perſons who ſhould mourn upon this Occaſion. If they <hi>mourn,</hi> as being themſelves <hi>ſufferers;</hi> we ſhould mourn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God's Law hath been tranſgreſſed, his Name diſhonoured, his Image deſtroyed, and ſuch Guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted as cries for Vengeance, and will <hi>defile the whole Land,</hi> if it be not removed by <hi>ſhedding of Blood;</hi> ſo <hi>inhuman,</hi> ſo <hi>foul,</hi> ſo <hi>black,</hi> ſo <hi>enormous,</hi> is the Sin of <hi>Murder!</hi> It ſhould ſenſibly touch our Hearts with Grief, when any are left of God to be thus <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>unjuſt;</hi> and the tremendous Conſequence of ſuch Guilt, even in this World, ſhould fix in our Minds a <hi>deteſtation</hi> and <hi>dread</hi> of it, that no Temptation ſhall be ever able, by divine Help, to overcome.</p>
               <p>And this is the great Thing aimed at, both by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> in <hi>publickly</hi> taking away the Life of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</hi> For as this Puniſhment puts a Period to their Exiſtence in the preſent World, it is final; and can't be intended for their <hi>future better Conduct,</hi> but for the <hi>Reſtraint of others,</hi> by awakening their Attention, by ſtriking their Minds with Awe, and guarding them, thro' the Influence of the Paſſion of Fear, againſt the Force of the Temptations they may meet with to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in this Kind. To this Purpoſe is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>And all Iſrael ſhall hear, and fear, and ſhall do no more any ſuch Wickedneſs.</hi> It was Wickedneſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Death that is here ſpoken of. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, in the immediately foregoing Verſes, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Man, whoever he was, that ſhould be guilty of this Wickedneſs, <hi>Thine Hand ſhall be upon him to put him to Death.—Thou ſhalt Stone him with Stones 'till he dies.</hi> And why was he to be thus awfully puniſhed? Evidently, for the <hi>public Good,</hi> for the Benefit of <hi>all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007168_0020_102ADE5E1FED1C68"/>
Iſrael,</hi> to alarm their Fear, and put them upon their Guard, <hi>to do no more ſuch Wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the Deſign of this Day's <hi>Execution.</hi> It is intended for the <hi>common Good,</hi> by exhibiting an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>public Vengeance:</hi> Such an one as is fitted to curb the Luſts of Men, and prevent their breaking forth in <hi>murderous</hi> Attempts upon the Life of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. We ſhould view it in this Light, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from <hi>that Crime</hi> which will expoſe us to be cut off by the Hand of <hi>civil Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are doubtleſs many here preſent, who deſign to be among the numerous Spectators of the tragical End of this unhappy Criminal.—Be adviſed not to make this melancholy Sight a Matter of <hi>vain Curioſity;</hi> much leſs of <hi>Sport and Merriment.</hi> It is capable of a wiſe and good Uſe; and you may receive laſting Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage herefrom. Be ſerious, conſiderate.—Recollect the Hazard you may have been in of committing this Sin; and, in pious Ejaculations, acknowledge the Kindneſs of God in the Reſtraints of Providence which may have preſerved you.—Be in the Exerciſe of the laſt Office of Love and Pity towards this condemned Man, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vent to the Breathings of your Souls in ſilent Applications to the Throne of Mercy, on his Behalf, in this Time of his greateſt Need. And, in a Word, let it be your ſincere Endeavour to get your Hearts impreſſed with a deep Senſe of Sin, of the Sin of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in particular. Deteſt it from the Bottom of your Souls, and reſolve within yourſelves, in the Strength of Divine Grace, that you will, thro' your whole future Life, take Care that you be not drawn aſide to commit ſo heinous a Tranſgreſſion. And that your Reſolution may be <hi>effectual</hi> for your Reſtraint,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:007168_0021_102ADE45E7BC3DC0"/>
Be upon your Guard againſt all the <hi>Tendencies</hi> towards this Sin, ſuch as <hi>Anger, Wrath, Hatred, Malice, Envy, Revenge;</hi> together with their immediate Effects, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious</hi> and <hi>deſpiteful Language, Quarrellings</hi> and <hi>Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> If we do not keep our ſelves from the governing Influence of theſe <hi>Occaſions</hi> of the Sin of <hi>Murder,</hi> we ſhall live in continual Hazard of being betrayed unto it, to our <hi>own,</hi> as well as the Diſhonour of God.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially would I put you upon your Guard againſt <hi>outragious Anger;</hi> as it was owing to raſh, impetuous, wild Paſſion, that this poor Man was hurried into the Sin for which he is condemned to die. If we are of a haſty Spirit, and given to Anger, we ſhould fear what may be the Conſequence, and lay the Reſtraints of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Religion upon this unruly Paſſion. We ſhould watch againſt the firſt Riſings of Anger, and check it in its Beginnings, leſt, as it gains Strength, it ſhould get beyond Government, put us out of Poſſeſſion of our ſelves, and be the Occaſion of our doing that, which may bring us to public Shame in this World, and hazard our Salvation in the next.</p>
               <p>But above all, let me adviſe you not to ſuffer your ſelves to be eaſy, 'till you are the <hi>Subjects</hi> of that Faith which <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> Love to God, Love to Chriſt, and Love to one another. This, more than any Thing, more than every Thing, will put us out of Danger of injuriouſly treating our Neighbour, at leaſt, in any high Degree. If we love God and Jeſus Chriſt, and, from Love to them, love our Brother alſo, we ſhall then be ſo far from being under the undue Influence of Hatred, Anger, Wrath, Malice, Envy, and the other Luſts of the Fleſh or Mind, that we ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the Offices of Kindneſs and Goodneſs to all Men. We ſhall be full of Mercy and good Fruits. We ſhall walk in all Lowlineſs, and Meekneſs, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007168_0022_102ADE60608F8E58"/>
Forbearance; being ready to forgive one another, as God for Chriſt's ſake forgiveth us. If any ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> curſe, we ſhall be ready to bleſs; if any ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, we, inſtead of reviling again, ſhall leave our Caſe with God, who judgeth righteouſly; and inſtead of being overcome with Evil, we ſhould overcome Evil with Good. And being thus fitted in the Temper of our Minds for the Society of Angels and glorified Saints, we ſhall, in God's Time, be admitted to dwell with them in that World, where there is no Variance nor Strife, but everlaſting Peace and Concord, and thoſe mutual Offices of Love and Friendſhip, which will make us the Delight of one another, and the Delight of God, from whoſe Preſence will flow to us Rivers of Pleaſure for evermore. God grant it may be the Portion of us all, for his Mercy's Sake, in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Amen.</hi>
