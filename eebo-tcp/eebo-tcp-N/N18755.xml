            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>DEARLY and well beloved Brethren of the African Lodge, as through the goodneſs and mercy of God, we are once more met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to celebrate the Feſtival of St. John the Baptiſt; it is requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> that we ſhould on theſe public days, and when we appear in form, give ſome reaſon as a foundation for our ſo doing, but as this has been already done, in a diſcourſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in ſubſtance by our late Reverend Brother <hi>John Marrant,</hi> and now in print,</p>
            <p>I ſhall at this time endeavour to raiſe part of the ſuperſtructure, for howſoever good the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may be, yet without this it will only prove a Babel. I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew the duty of a Maſon; and the firſt thing is, that he believes in one ſupreme Being, that he is the great Architect of this viſible world, and that he governs all things here below by his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, and his watchful eye is over all our works. Again we muſt be good ſubjects to the laws of the land in which we dwell, giving ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to our lawful Governors and Magiſtrates, giving honour to whom honour is due; and that we have no hand in any plots or conſpiracies or rebellion, or ſide or aſſiſt in them: for when we conſider the bloodſhed, the devaſtation of towns and cities that hath been done by them, what heart can be ſo hard as not to pity thoſe our
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024374_0003_0FC62415C842A790"/>
diſtreſt brethren, and keep at the greateſt diſtance from them. However juſt it may be on the ſide of the oppreſt, yet it doth not in the leaſt, or rather ought not, abate that love and fellow-feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we ought to have for our brother fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men.</p>
            <p>The next thing is love and benevolence to all the whole family of mankind, as God's make and creation, therefore we ought to love them all, for love or hatred is of the whole kind, for if I love a man for the ſake of the image of God which is on him, I muſt love all, for he made all, and upholds all, and we are dependant upon him for all we do enjoy and expect to enjoy in this world and that which is to come.—Therefore he will help and aſſiſt all his fellow-men in diſtreſs, let them be of what colour or nation they may, yea even our very enemies, much more a brother Maſon. I ſhall therefore give you a few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this from Holy Writ, and firſt, how did Abraham prevent the ſtorm, or rebellion that was riſing between Lot's ſervants and his? Saith Abraham to Lot, let there be no ſtrife I pray thee between me and thee, for the land is before us, if you will go to the left, then I will go to the right, and if you will go to the right, then I will go to the left. They divided and peace was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. I will mention the compaſſion of a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to a Prophet of the Lord, Ebedmelech, when he heard that Jeremiah was caſt into the dungeon, he made interceſſion for him to the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024374_0004_0FC6241835C7C2E0"/>
King and got liberty to take him out from the jaws of death. See Jer. xxxviii 7-13.</p>
            <p>Alſo the prophet Eliſha after he had led the army of the Framites blindfold into Samaria, when the King in a deriding manner ſaid, my <hi>Father</hi> (not conſidering that he was as much their Father as his) ſhall I ſmite, or rather kill them out of the way, as not worthy to live on the ſame earth, or draw the ſame air with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo eager was he to ſhed his brethren's blood, that he repeats his blood-thirſty demand, but the Prophet after reproaching him therefor, anſwers him no, but ſet bread and water before them; or in other words, give them a feaſt and let them go home in peace. See 2 Kings, vi.22.23.</p>
            <p>I ſhall juſt mention the good deeds of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, though at that time they were looked upon as unworthy to eat, drink or trade with their fellow-men, at leaſt by the Jews; ſee the pity and compaſſion he had on a poor diſtreſt and half dead ſtranger, ſee Luke x. from 30 to 37. See that you endeavour to do ſo likewiſe.—But when we conſider the amazing condeſcending love and pity our bleſſed Lord had on ſuch poor worms as we are, as not only to call us his friends, but his brothers, we are loſt and can go no further in holy writ for examples to excite us to the love of our fellow-men.—But I am aware of an objection that may ariſe (for ſome men will catch at any thing) that is that they were not all Maſons, we allow it, and I ſay that they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024374_0005_0FC624196C463A80"/>
were not all Chriſtians, and their benevolence to ſtrangers ought to ſhame us both, that there is ſo little, ſo very little of it to be ſeen in theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened days.</p>
            <p>Another thing which is the duty of a Maſon is, that he pays a ſtrict regard to the ſtated meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lodge, for maſonry is of a progreſſive nature, and muſt be attended to if ever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a good Maſon; for the man that thinks that becauſe he hath been made a Maſon, and is called ſo, and at the ſame time will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect to attend his Lodge, he may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured he will never make a good Maſon, nor ought he to be looked upon as a good member of the craft. For if his example was followed, where would be the Lodge; and beſides what a diſgrace is it, when we are at our ſet meetings, to hear that one of our members is at a drinking houſe, or at a card table, or in ſome worſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, this brings diſgrace on the Craft: Again there are ſome that attend the Lodge in ſuch a manner that ſometimes their abſence would be better than their Company (I would not here be underſtood a brother in diſguiſe, for ſuch an one hath no buſineſs on a level floor) for if he hath been diſpleaſed abroad or at home, the leaſt thing that is ſpoken that he thinks not right, or in the leaſt offends him, he will raiſe his temper to ſuch a height as to deſtroy the harmony of the whole Lodge; but we have a remedy and every officer ought to ſee it put in execution.—
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024374_0006_0FC624206D6A7AE8"/>
Another thing a Maſon ought to obſerve, is that he ſhould lend his helping hand to a brother in diſtreſs, and relieve him, this we may do various ways; for we may ſometimes help him to a cup of cold water, and it may be better to him than a cup of wine. Good advice may be ſometimes better than feeding his body, helping him to ſome lawful employment, better than giving him money; ſo defending his caſe and ſtanding by him when wrongfully accuſed, may be better than cloathing him; better to ſave a brother's houſe when on fire, than to give him one. Thus much may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now cite ſome of our fore-fathers, for our imitation: and the firſt ſhall be Tertullian, who defended the Chriſtians againſt their heathen falſe accuſations, whom they charged with treaſon againſt the empire and the Emperor, becauſe of their ſilent meetings: he proved that to be falſe for this reaſon, for in their meetings, they were wont to pray for the proſperity of the Empire, of Rome, and him alſo; and they were accuſed of being enemies to mankind, how can that be, ſaid he, when their office is to love and pray for all mankind. When they were charged with worſhipping the Sun, becauſe they looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt when they prayed; he defended them againſt this ſlander alſo, and proved that they were ſlandered, ſlighted and ill-treated, not for any deſert of theirs, but only out of hatred of them and their profeſſion.—This friend of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024374_0007_0FC62422F21F0630"/>
diſtreſt was born in Carthage in Africa, and died Anno Chriſti, 202.</p>
            <p>Take another of the ſame city, Cyprian, for his fidelity to his profeſſion was ſuch, that he would rather ſuffer death than betray his truſt and the truth of the goſpel, or approve of the impious worſhip of the Gentiles: He was not only Biſhop of Carthage, but of Spain and the caſt, weſt and northern churches, who died anno Chriſti, 259.</p>
            <p>But I have not time to cite but one more (out of hundreds that I could count of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were not only examples to us, but to many of their nobles and learned,) that is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, who had engraven on his table theſe words</p>
            <p>He that doth love an abſent Friend to jeer,</p>
            <p>May hence depart no room is for him here.</p>
            <p>His ſaying was that ſincere and upright Prayer pierceth heaven, and returns not empty. That it was a ſhelter to the ſoul. A ſacrifice to God and a ſcourge to the Devil. There is nothing, ſaid he, more abateth pride and ſin than the frequent meditation on death he cannot die ill, that lives well; and ſeldom doth he die well, that lives ill: Again, if men want wealth, it is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly gotten, if they have it they ought by good works to lay it up in heaven: And again, he that hath taſted the ſweetneſs of divine love, will not care for temporal ſweetneſs. The reaſonable ſoul made in the likeneſs of God, may here find much diſtraction, but no full ſatisfaction; not to be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024374_0008_0FC62423F1B4ABA0"/>
without afflictions, but to overcome them is bleſſedneſs. Love is as ſtrong as death; as death kills the body, ſo love of eternal life kills world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſires and affections. He called Ingratitude the Devil's ſpunge, wherewith he wipes out all the favours of the Almighty. His prayer was, Lord give firſt what thou requireſt, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me what thou wilt.—This good man died anno Chrſti, 430.—</p>
            <p>The next is Fulgentius, his ſpeech was, why travel I in the world which can yield me no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor durable reward, anſwerable to my pains. Thought it better to weep well, than to rejoice ill, yet if joy be our deſire, how much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, who have a good conſcience before God, who dread nothing but ſin, ſtudy to do nothing but to accompliſh the precepts of Chriſt. Now therefore let me change my courſe, and as before I endeavoured amongſt my noble friends, to prove more noble, ſo now let my care and employment be among the humble and poor ſervants of Chriſt and become more humble that I may help and inſtruct my poor and diſtreſt brethren.</p>
            <p>Thus my brethren I have quoted a few of your reverend fathers, for your imitation, which I hope you endeavour to follow, ſo far as your abili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>I ſhall now ſhew you what progreſs maſonry hath made ſince the the ſiege, and taking of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in the year 70, by Titus Veſpaſian, after a long, and bloody ſiege, a million of ſouls having been ſlain, or had periſhed and the eity, it was taken by ſtorm and the city ſet on fire. There was an order of men called the order of St. John, who besides their other engagements, ſubſcribe to another, by which they bound themeſlves to keep up the war againſt the Turks, theſe men defended the temple when on fire, in order to ſave it, ſo long, that Titus was amazed and went to ſee the reaſon of it; but when he came ſo

near as to behold the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> he was amazed, and ſhed tears, and ſaid, no wonder theſe men ſhould ſo long to ſave it. He honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with many honors, and large contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made to that order from many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and were alſo knighted. They continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 88 years in Jeruſalem, till that city was again retaken by the Turks, after which they reſided 104 years in the Cyrean city of Ptolemy, till the remains of the Holy Conqueſt were loſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſettled on the Iſland of Cyprus, where they continued 18 years, till they found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to take the Iſland Rhodes, being maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that they maintained it for 213 years, and from thence they were called knights of Rhodes, till in the year 1530, they took their reſidence in the Isſland of Malta, where they have continued to this day, and are diſtinguiſhed by the name of the knights of Malta. Their firſt Maſter was Villaret in the year 1099. Fulco Villaret in the year 1322, took the Iſland of Rhodes, and was after that diſtinguiſhed by the title of Grand-Maſter, which hath devolved to his Succeſſors to this day.</p>
            <p>Query, Whether at that day, when there was an African church, and perhaps the largeſt Chriſtian church on earth, whether there was no African of that order; or whether, if they were all whites, they would refuſe to accept them as their fellow Chriſtians and brother Maſons; or whether there were any ſo weak, or

rather ſo fooliſh, as to ſay, becauſe they were Blacks, that would make their lodge or army too common or too cheap? Sure this was not our conduct in the late war; for then they marched ſhoulder to ſhoulder, brother ſoldier and brother ſoldier, to the field of battle; let who will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; he that deſpiſes a black man for the ſake of his colour, reproacheth his Maker, and he hath reſented it, in the caſe of Aaron and Miriam. See for this Numbers xii.—</p>
            <p>But to return: In the year 1787 (the year in which we received our charter) there were 489 lodges under charge of his late Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Duke of Cumberland; whoſe memory will always be eſteemed by every good Maſon.</p>
            <p>And now, my African brethren, you ſee what a noble order you are members of. My charge to you is, that you make it your ſtudy to live up to the precepts of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you know that they are all good; and let it be known this day to the ſpectat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs, that you have not been to a feaſt of Bacchus, but to a refreſhment with Maſons; and ſee to it that you behave as ſuch, as well at home as abroad; always to keep in your minds the obligations you are under, both to God and your fellow men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And more ſo, you my dear brethren of Providence, who are at a diſtance from, and cannot attend the Lodge here but ſeldom; yet I hope you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to communicate to us by letters of your welfare; and remember your obligations to each

other, and live in peace and love as brethren— We thank you for your attendance with us this day, and with you a ſafe return.</p>
            <p>If thus, we by the grace of God, live up to this our Proſeſſion; we may cheerfully go the rounds of the compaſs of this life. Having lived according to the plumb line of uprightneſs, the ſquare of juſtice, the level truth and ſincerity. And when we are come to the end of time, we may then bid farewell to that delightful Sun and Moon, and the other planets, that move ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully round her in their orbits, and all things here below, and aſeend to that new Jeruſalem, where we ſhall not want theſe tapers, for God is the Light thereof; where the Wicked ccaſe from troubling, and where the weary are at reſt</p>
            <l>Then ſhall we hear and ſee and know,</l>
            <l>All we desired and wiſh'd below,</l>
            <l>And every power find ſweet employ,</l>
            <l>In the eternal world of joy.</l>
            <l>Our ſleth ſhall ſlumber in the ground,</l>
            <l>Till the laſt trumpet's joyful found,</l>
            <l>Then barſt the chains with ſweet ſurprize,</l>
            <l>And in our Saviour's image riſe.</l>
