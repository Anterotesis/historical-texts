            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE external name of Free Maſon does not entitle man to uſurp any authority, or claim any reſpect from his fellow, without he ſtrictly conforms to the ſalutary laws and reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on which our myſtery is founded.

Would you wiſh to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed by the good and worthy, be prudent in your words and actions, let it ever be your ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate view, to add reſpect to the venerable and noble order, of which you have the honour of being a Member; which will not only diſarm malevolence of its ſting, but gain you that love and reſpect which is due to merit.</p>

               <head>PRUDENTIALS.</head>
               <p n="1">1. In all your actions whether public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, be prudent as becometh a Maſon; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in your public character, that the eye of the world is upon you, and the partial tongue of the envious is liable to cenſure the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous endeavours; much more ſo, ſhould you, as a Maſon, forget your duty, and give any plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable reaſon, by being guilty of the leaſt irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtep in your conduct.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. In your more private connections, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> your thoughts are expoſed to the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing eye of the great Architect of the Univerſe; therefore, prudently conſider, that great and comprehenſive Maſonic command, laid down in our ſpiritual Treſſel-Board,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>"As ye would that men ſhould do unto you,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>"Do ye even ſo to them."</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3d. It is indiſpenſably your duty to check every appearance of vice; for where its baneful influence takes impreſſion on human nature, its effects are terrible. It draws a gloom over every ſhining virtue, prevents its growth, and ſteals into the deepeſt receſſes of the heart, and infects every thing within its reach; and produces pride, malice, revenge, diſcord, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemic diſorders are diametically oppoſite to our noble inſtitution, and muſt be guarded againſt in particular; they muſt have no place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—no, not even a name in the breaſt, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when made the repoſitory of our grand Myſtery.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Prudence obſerves, that a man given to intemperance is no way fitting for a member of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023996_0006_0FC2F034F7A9E0C0"/>any laudable ſociety; for he values neither health, wealth, friends, family, reputation or character: But temperance is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ornaments of our venerable inſtitution.— Therefore, as you prize your character as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be temperate in all things.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. Prudence informs us, that Charity, or univerſal love, is a peculiar virtue, and grows on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the breaſt of the benevolent, and is the grand corner ſtone of our order. It unites us in one univerſal band of affection—conciliates true friendſhip, and effectuates the great and noble purpoſe of making each other happy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in each others felicity.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. Would you wiſh to gain eſteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be temperate, be frugal, generous, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, humane, ſincere and kind to all men; this is indiſpenſably your duty, would you wiſh to ſupport the character of a Free Maſon. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſays, the prevalency of good example is great; and no language ſo expreſſive as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent life and converſation; theſe once forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a maſonic character, will diminiſh the man in the eye of the worthy, and give a full ſcope to the envious part of mankind to cenſure our noble and honorable inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="7">7th. True brotherly love is eſſentially neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to attain to any degree of perfection in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonic Art (as it is the life and eſſence of all other virtues) your cultivating it, and ſhowing its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in your life and actions, will teſtify to the world, the goodneſs of your reſpectable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the tongue of the envious and malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent will be ſtruck dumb, and ſlander diſarmed of its venemous ſting. Cultivating brotherly love
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023996_0007_0FC2F0367B8AEB80"/>with laudable emulation, endeavouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel each other in whatever in good and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, is what is required of all Free Maſons. Be not contented, therefore, with the bare name of a Maſon, but walk worthy of that glorious Profeſſion, in conſtant conformity to its dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates; for he who ſtiles himſelf a Maſon, and acts contrary to the mild and ſalutary precepts of our venerable order, is not worthy of being a Member of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="8">8th. Prudence ſays, Evil-ſpeaking is a mirror, which ſhews a bad man's principle in fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. As a Maſon in particular, ſhun this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious practice of back-biting and ſpeaking evil of any man. How eaſy is it to ſpeak well of any man, if you know it to be ſo; if you do not, ſay no ill of him. Be prudent, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the royal Pſalmiſt (he ſays) <hi>"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep thou the door of my lips;"</hi> this deteſtable vice is the offspring of a diabolical, depraved diſpoſition. A ſlanderous tongue bites like a ſerpent, and cuts like a ſword. Conſider ſeriouſly, brethren, ſhould any of us be guilty of cenſure, or ſlander (which I hope not) how inconſiſtent ſuch baſe proceedings are with the myſtical precepts of our inſtitution. Dare any of us as Maſons, preſume, by one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious blaſt of our tongue, at once to ruin our brother or friend's character and reputation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to all poſterity. Lay your hand on your heart, appeal to that, conſider how incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the precepts that were delivered to you as a Maſon, to be guilty of ſuch an injury, then ſhudder at the thought of ſuch baſeneſs, that is ſo deſpiſable in the eye of man, and ſo
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023996_0008_0FC2F03847EC9C38"/>contrary to the commands of the great Architect of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9th. Prudence adviſes you, as a man in all your actions and dealing with the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a public or a private nature, to <hi>"act on the ſquare"</hi> with all mankind, rendering every man his due. As a Maſon, this duty is doubly encreaſed; prudently conſider, how great the violation, ſhould you ſtoop ſo low as to forget every ſacred tie of Maſonry, and wrong your friend and brother, what would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? You would expoſe yourſelf to the tongue of the ſlanderer, and be deſpiſed by all men, and what is worſe, forever forfeit the love and reſpect of every worthy Maſon and friend;—therefore let me conjure you, by that ſincere maſonic love, that I bear to your perſon and character as a friend and brother, that you forget not the ſacred band of union, that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and binds us in love and amity together—that you keep in view that grand period of your life, when by the authority of our Order, you became the fellow, friend and brother of the greateſt and beſt of men, throughout the globe. And as long as you act conſiſtent with the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary rules of Maſonry, you will be eſteemed and beloved, reverenced and reſpected,, by every virtuous and worthy man.</p>
               <p>Permit me here to add a charge, which, or ſomething ſimilar, you no doubt remember to have been given to you on a ſolemn occaſion—and let me recommend a ſerious attention to the uſeful Monitions contained in it.</p>

               <p>YOU are now admitted, by the unanimous conſent of our Lodge, a fellow of our moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and honorable ſociety; antient, as having ſubſiſted from time immemorial, and honorable, as tending in every particular to make the man ſo, that will be but conformable to its glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. The greateſt monarchs in all ages, as well of Aſia and Africa as of Europe, have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers of the royal Art, and many of them have preſided as Grand Maſters over the Maſons in their reſpective dominions; not thinking it any diminution of their imperial dignities to <hi>level</hi> themſelves with their Brethren in Maſonry, and to act as they did. The world's Great Architect is our Supreme Maſter, and the unerring rule he has given us is that by which we work. Religious diſputes are never ſuffered in the Lodge, for, <hi>as Free-Maſons,</hi> we only purſue the univerſal religion of nature. This is the cement which joins men of the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent principles in one ſacred band, and brings together thoſe who were the moſt diſtant from one another.</p>
               <p>THERE are three general heads of duty, which Maſons ought always to inculcate, viz. to God, our neighbours, and ourſelves. To God, in never mentioning his name but with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential awe which becomes a creature to bear to his Creator; and to look upon him always as the <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> which we came into the world to enjoy: And according to that view to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023996_0010_0FC2F045BB8D6450"/>regulate our purſuits. To our neighbours, in <hi>"acting upon the ſquare,"</hi> or doing as we would be done by. To ourſelves, in avoiding all intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and exceſſes, whereby we may be led into a behaviour unbecoming our laudable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>IN the ſtate, a Maſon is to act as a peaceable and dutiful ſubject, conforming cheerfully to the government under which he lives; he is to pay a due deference to his ſuperiors, and from his inferiors he is rather to receive honour with ſome reluctance than to extort it; he is to be a man of benevolence and charity, not ſitting down contented while his fellow-creatures (but much more his Brethren) are in want, and it is in his power, without prejudicing himſelf or family, to relieve them. In the Lodge he is to behave with due decorum, leſt the beauty and harmony thereof ſhould be diſturbed and broke. He is to be obedient to the Maſter and preſiding officers, and to apply himſelf cloſely to the buſineſs of Maſonry, that he may ſooner become a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient therein, both for his own credit, and for that of the Lodge. He is not to neglect his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary avocations for the ſake of Maſonry, nor to involve himſelf in quarrels with thoſe who, through ignorance, may ſpeak evil of, or ridicule it. He is to be a lover of the arts and ſciences, and to take all opportunities of improving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf therein. If he recommends a friend to be made a Maſon, he muſt vouch him to be ſuch as he really believes will conform to the aforeſaid duties; leſt by his miſconduct at any time the Lodge ſhould paſs under ſome evil imputations. Nothing can prove more ſhocking to all faithful
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023996_0011_0FC2F046F7313238"/>Maſons, than to ſee any of their Brethren pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, or break through the ſacred rules of their Order, and ſuch as can do it, they wiſh had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been admitted.</p>
               <p>WHEN aſſembled within the peaceful walls of our Lodge, where univerſal love and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony inſpires each boſom. When our buſineſs is over, then prudence introduces gaiety and good humour, to cheer the mind, and diffuſe its pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joys over the underſtanding; then ſweet hilarity ſmiles ſerene on every countenance, and calls for the cheerful Song.</p>
               <p>IN the following Pages the worthy Brother will find a ſmall Collection; which I have ſelected from different Authors, and which I hope will be well received, and tend to promote harmony and unanimity.</p>
