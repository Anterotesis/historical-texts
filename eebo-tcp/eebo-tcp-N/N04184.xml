            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Honoured</hi> SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT your Deſire the following <hi>Sermon</hi> is ſent to the Preſs; to YOU therefore I in Form preſent it. You have alſo gratified the Deſires of others, who wiſh'd to <hi>read</hi> it after they had heard it. I pray GOD it may be of ſpiritual Profit to you and them.</p>
            <p>GOD <hi>has made his wonderful Works to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: His Work is honourable and glorious, ſought out by all them that have Pleaſure therein;</hi> which <hi>all</hi> ought to have. At Times therefore we ought to <hi>preach</hi> on this Subject, but always in an <hi>evangelical, ſcriptural</hi> and ſpiritual Manner. A <hi>Chriſtian Audience</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:005155_0004_1016C9540B7F9698"/>ſhould ever be ſo treated, edified and gratified. I pleaſe my ſelf with thinking, it was <hi>this</hi> that gave the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> it's Force and Acceptance with ſo many. If now in <hi>reading</hi> it, they or others may find a like Pleaſure and <hi>Benefit,</hi> they will thank you, <hi>Sir,</hi> under GOD, as the Hand that conveys it to them.</p>
            <p>GOD has ſet You near the Head of our <hi>Province</hi> for worldly Eſtate and <hi>Riches;</hi> but the <hi>true Honour</hi> which we wiſh You, and to all our Brethren of like <hi>ſuperior</hi> worldly Circumſtances, <hi>cometh from above the Firmament;</hi> even the Riches of <hi>Grace,</hi> the <hi>endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subſtance,</hi> a Treaſure in <hi>Heaven</hi> which faileth not. We are therefore commanded by our LORD and SAVIOUR, to <hi>charge them that are rich in this World, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain Riches, but in the</hi> LIVING GOD, <hi>who gives us richly all Things to enjoy: That they do Good, be rich in good Works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate; laying up in Store for themſelves a good Foundation againſt the Time to come, that they may lay hold of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>weekly</hi> SABBATH is the ſpecial, reverend and perpetual <hi>Memorial</hi> to us of the Wiſdom, <hi>Power</hi> and Goodneſs of GOD in his Work of CREATION; and a more gracious and ſolemn <hi>Memorial</hi> thereof could not be given us, for the <hi>Honour</hi> of GOD from us, or for ſpiritual <hi>Good</hi> to us from GOD.</p>
            <p>How neceſſary is it for us in our fallen State, to be call'd <hi>off</hi> every <hi>Week</hi> from our worldly Works, to a <hi>calm</hi> deliberate and rais'd <hi>Contemplation</hi> of GOD our MARKER, PRESERVER, REDEEMER and SANCTIFIER; in his whole Work of Nature, Providence &amp; Grace! That every <hi>ſeventh Thought</hi> (as it were) thro' all our Time might be on GOD, and ſacred to his <hi>Praiſe.</hi>

Before there could be a <hi>Sabbath</hi> to <hi>Man</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> while the LORD was but laying the <hi>Foundation</hi> of it <hi>upon nothing,</hi> the <hi>Angels of</hi> GOD gave <hi>Praiſe and</hi> Glory; <q>
                  <hi>The Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of</hi> GOD <hi>ſhouted for Joy.</hi>
               </q> And this is <hi>our</hi> happy <hi>joyous</hi> Exerciſe, if GOD give a Heart for it, as our <hi>Sabbaths</hi> Return; as the PSALM for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day would inſpire us; Pſal. xcii. <q>
                  <hi>For thou</hi> LORD <hi>haſt made me glad thro' thy Work,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>and I will triumph in the Work of thy Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we are ever <hi>in the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>on our</hi> LORD's-DAYS, and favoured with any <hi>Viſions of the</hi> SON OF MAN <hi>in the midſt of his Golden Candleſticks,</hi> our thankful <hi>Praiſes</hi> will aſcend to HIM at the FATHER's right Hand, as enter'd into <hi>his Reſt</hi> upon his <hi>finiſhing</hi> the Work of our REDEMPTION, as GOD <hi>ceas'd from his</hi> when the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed. But we muſt wait for the <hi>perfect Sabbath,</hi> and the perfect <hi>Praiſe,</hi> among the <hi>crowned Elders</hi> and adoring <hi>Angels</hi> before the THRONE, Rev. iv. Where they <q>

            </p>
            <p>Sir, My Heart's Deſire and Prayer to GOD is, that the SABBATH OF THE LORD may be ever thus holy to HIM in <hi>your Dwelling,</hi> and in all the Families of the <hi>Flock!</hi> That the <hi>Rich</hi> among us in particular may ever give a bright <hi>Example</hi> in this Reſpect; teſtifying hereby their <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD who gives 'em all Things <hi>richly to enjoy,</hi> pertaining both to <hi>Life and Godlineſs!</hi> That when the LORD comes to Judgment, and fills our <hi>Firmament</hi> with his dazzling tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous <hi>Glory;</hi> and the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor</hi> ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>You ſee here, that the <hi>Firmament</hi> is the <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>School</hi> of JESUS CHRIST, and he ſends us to it to learn reſpecting <hi>himſelf;</hi> and to <hi>Him,</hi> who is <hi>aſcended above all Heavens,</hi> we muſt be looking thro' it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> While GOD continues us in theſe animal dying <hi>Bodies,</hi> we muſt devoutly conſider GOD's <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> as the great MEDIUM and Inſtrument of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to <hi>our World</hi> (and to what <hi>other</hi> Worlds we know not, but have Reaſon to think the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting many others) his immenſe Benefits and <hi>Bounties</hi> of a <hi>temporal</hi> and earthly Kind, for the Preſervation of our <hi>Lives,</hi> and for our daily and yearly <hi>Supplies</hi> with all the Neceſſaries and Comforts of them. For in vain had <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> been made without a <hi>Firmament;</hi> for there could have been neither <hi>ploughing</hi> or <hi>ſailing</hi> without it; nor Buſineſs, Food, Health, Strength and Pleaſure; no <hi>Seed-time</hi> or <hi>Harveſt,</hi> Day or Night, Summer or Winter; no Graſs for the <hi>Cattle</hi> nor Herb for <hi>Man;</hi> no Smell or Taſte or Appetite for Corn, Wine and Oil: in as much as the whole <hi>Suſtenance</hi> of every <hi>ſenſitive</hi> Creature depends upon this <hi>potent</hi> and beneficent <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> by which GOD <hi>holds</hi> our Soul in Life; by which alſo he <hi>judges the People:</hi> For (as has been ſaid before) neither could there be ſultry <hi>Heat</hi> or chilling <hi>Cold,</hi> ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating <hi>Calms</hi> or furious <hi>Storms,</hi> Peſtilence and Famine,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005155_0024_1016C98786EA7648"/>Whirlwinds or Earthquakes; no preſent <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> come to us, without a <hi>Firmament</hi> ſurrounding us. Let <hi>Elihu</hi> firſt, and then <hi>David</hi> teach us how to <hi>adore</hi> and give Glory to GOD for this perpetual <hi>Profuſion</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence to ſo many Worlds beſides ours. Job xxxvi. 24,—33. "<hi>Remember that thou magnify his Work which Men behold! Every Man may ſee it, Men may behold it afar off! Behold</hi> GOD <hi>is great and we know him not; neither can the Number of his Years be ſearched out! For he maketh ſmall the Drops of Water, they pour down Rain according to the Vapour thereof; which the Clouds do drop and diſtill upon Man abundantly! Alſo who can underſtand the Spreadings of the Clouds, or the Noiſe of his Tabernacle?

Pſal. lxviii. ulz. "<hi>Sing unto GOD, ye Kingdoms of the Earth, O ſing Praiſes to the LORD, Selah! To</hi> HIM <hi>that rideth upon the Heavens of Heavens which were of old!

O</hi> GOD, <hi>thou art terrible out of thy holy Places; the</hi> GOD <hi>of Iſrael is he who giveth Strength and Power to his People! bleſſed be GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let what has been ſaid of the <hi>viſible Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> lead us into the Contemplation of GOD's <hi>ſpiritual Kingdom,</hi> both of <hi>Grace and Judgment, viſible</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, preſent</hi> and <hi>future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Word</hi> and SPIRIT of GOD will juſtify us in this <hi>Tranſition;</hi> For 1. The <hi>viſible ſpiritual</hi> Kingdom of Grace, in the <hi>Church of</hi> GOD on Earth, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us by a glorious <hi>Firmament of Power and Mercy.</hi> And 2. As to the <hi>inviſible World,</hi> if <hi>Hell</hi> be <hi>without</hi> a Firmament, a Firmament of <hi>Glory</hi> will be found in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, the viſible Kingdom of <hi>Grace,</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD on Earth, is repreſented to us by a glorious <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Power</hi> and Mercy. This has been in part ſhown before, but I have yet to add.</p>

CHRIST in his <hi>Perſon, Offices</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> is in the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> declared to be <hi>the Light of the World, the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ariſing over <hi>Souls</hi> with <hi>Healing</hi> under the <hi>Rays.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then if we go on to contemplate the <hi>Church of the Sanctified,</hi> ſhe is repreſented by a <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun,</hi> with the <hi>Moon and Stars under her Feet,</hi> and on her <hi>Head a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi> Revel. xii. 1.</p>

            <p>Or if we go on to ſpeak of the WORD they preach, it is as <hi>a Light that ſhineth in a dark Place:</hi> or if we ſpeak of the <hi>Gifts and Graces of the</hi> SPIRIT in 'em, or exercis'd in their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> theſe render 'em ſo many <hi>burning and ſhining Lights</hi> to and in the <hi>Churches</hi> to whom they miniſter: And finally, the <hi>Work of Grace</hi> begun and increaſing in the Soul of every <hi>private Chriſtian,</hi> and exhibited in their <hi>holy Life</hi> and Converſation, makes <hi>them</hi> LIGHT IN THE LORD; holding forth the Power and Efficacy of the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> and making them ſhine <hi>as Lights in the World;</hi> in <hi>Family</hi>-Order, in <hi>Church</hi>-Order, in <hi>Sabbath</hi>-Sanctification which belongs to both; and this "<hi>Path of the Juſt ſhines on unto the perfect Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On theſe Accounts it is that the SPIRIT ſays unto the <hi>Churches, "Ariſe, ſhine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</hi> LORD <hi>is riſen upon thee! and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall come to thy Light, and Kings to the Brightneſs of thy Riſing.</hi> — And this is the <hi>Firmament of Glory</hi> in the <hi>viſible Church on Earth;</hi> "wherein with <hi>open Face</hi> beholding as in a <hi>Glaſs</hi> the Glory of the LORD, <hi>Souls</hi>
