            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>"OUR civil government (ſays an excellent Engliſh Writer) is happily placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two extremes of <hi>deſpotic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>popular licentiouſneſs:</hi> it is wiſely compoſed of ſuch a due mixture of the ſeveral ſimple forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, thoſe of one, of a few, and of many, as to retain as far as poſſible the advantages, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the inconveniencies, peculiar to each; and the parts are ſo nicely combined and adjuſted, that the ſeveral powers co-operate and move on together in concert and agreement, mutually tempering, limiting, and reſtraining, yet at the ſame time aiding, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtrengthening each other."</p>
            <p>This frame of government, for the admirable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of its ſtructure, has always been the wonder of the world; and under its protection and mild influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſubjects of Great Britain are the happieſt people on earth. But of all the ſubjects of Great Britain, thoſe who reſide in the American Colonies have been, and, were they ſenſible of their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, might ſtill be, by far the happieſt: ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the bleſſings of peace, health, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing plenty—enjoying the benefits of an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and free conſtitution—ſecured by the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and patronage of the greateſt maritime power in the world—and contributing, in but a ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the ſupport of the neceſſary public expences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4"

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Under theſe advantages, the colonies have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to flouriſhed beyond example. They have become populous, both by natural increaſe, and the yearly influx of foreigners, the ſure indications of a happy country; and they have become rich, by practicing, at their eaſe, the peaceful arts of agriculture and commerce. And were they to purſue the ſame path which has brought them thus far, there is no doubt but they would go on to flouriſh and proſper in the ſame proportion, till, in proceſs of time, they would exite either the admiration or envy of the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. The advice therefore of MOSES to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple highly favoured of Heaven, is juſtly applicable to them; and nothing could be wanting to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but hearts to follow it,
<q>Only <hi>take heed to thyſelf,</hi> ſays he, and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from thine heart, all the days of thy life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But a far different proſpect, at this time, preſents it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to view. The darkneſs of a riſing tempeſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to overſpread our land. The thunder roars at a diſtance, and appears to be ſwiftly approaching. It is high time therefore to awaken the thoughtleſs to a ſenſe of their danger, and to think of providing for our common ſafety.</p>
            <p>There is, there can be, but one way to prevent the ruin that threatens us. Our own miſconduct has brought it forward; and our immediate reformation muſt ſtop it progreſs. He muſt be blind, that is not convinced of this; and he muſt be infatuated, that will purſue the road, which evidently terminates in darkneſs and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:013224_0004_0F8FB55B2BDD2428"/>Whether the Britiſh Parliament has been right or wrong in its late proceedings, towards the Colonies; our behaviour has been ſuch as every government muſt and will think intolerable. If the ſupreme power of any kingdom or ſtate, through want of due information or attention, ſhould adopt meaſures that are wrong or oppreſſive, the ſubjects may complain and remonſtrate againſt them in a reſpectful manner; but they are bound, by the laws of Heaven and Earth, not to behave undutifully, much more not to behave inſolently and rebelliouſly. The bands of ſociety would be diſſolved, the harmony of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and the order of nature ſubverted, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, reſpect, and obedience, might be refuſed to thoſe whom the conſtitution has veſted with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt authority. The ill conſequences of open diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to government are ſo great, that no miſconduct of the adminiſtration can juſtify or excuſe it. The guilt of it is ſo aggravated, that Chriſtians are requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under the heavieſt penalty to avoid it, and to be <hi>ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> of whatever character, <hi>for conſcience's ſake.</hi> No tyrant was ever more deſpotic and cruel, than <hi>Nero,</hi> and no Court ever more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted than his; and yet to the government of this cruel and deſpotic tyrant, and his corrupt miniſtry, peaceable ſubmiſſion was enjoined by an Apoſtle, who had a due regard for the rights and liberties of mankind. To diſturb or threaten an eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by popular inſurrections and tumults, has always been conſidered and treated, in every age and nation of the world, as an unpardonable crime: and were we the ſubjects of the <hi>Grand Turk,</hi> it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that we ought not to encourage ſuch practices, as that St. Paul and St. Peter, who condemned them, were inſpired men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013224_0005_0F90450F560252B8"/>But my deſign is not to conſider, how far the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Colonies is, or is not, conformable to the rules and precepts of the Chriſtian religion; but, how far it is to be condemned or juſtified by the maxims of ſound policy and prudence. Our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral intereſt and ſafety are conſiderations which all will regard, how much ſoever they may ſlight or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the obligations of religion.</p>
            <p>The voice of complaint, to call it no worſe, is now heard through every corner of our land; and we are daily exhorted to prepare for the defence of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and all that is ſacred, with united efforts.— But before we proceed, it concerns us to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, both as to our real danger, and the ſteps proper to be taken</p>
            <p>Were the Americans actually in a ſtate of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it would ſhew their wiſdom and prudence, to ſubmit with patience to their preſent condition, rather than to provoke the power that oppreſſes them, without ſome fair proſpect of obtaining relief. One degree of diſtreſs, in conſequence of the weight of illegal power, is a grievance; ten degrees of diſtreſs are proportionably a greater evil; but bad as it is, he muſt be an idiot or a madman, who would not prefer them to twenty. But it appears to me that, of all people under heaven, the King's ſubjects in America, have hitherto had the leaſt ground for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; and that the preſent confuſion of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies has been occaſioned by miſinformations and falſe alarms. If none of our <hi>legal</hi> rights have been invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no injury has been done us; if we have not been injured, we have no room for complaint; and we can never be juſtified in reſenting that, which it would be unreaſonable to complain of.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>My <hi>Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Subjects!</hi> ſuffer, for a few minutes, an American, one who has often gloried in the title, who loves his country as much, and has as great a regard for its honour, as any of you, to reaſon and expoſtulate with you, in plain language, on a ſubject now of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, both to you and him.</p>
            <p>You are taught to exclaim loudly againſt
<q>the arbitrary proceedings of the Britiſh Parliament.</q>
But conſider; wherein have they been arbitrary, and in what do you ſuffer? Why, it ſeems,
<q>a duty of three pence a pound, has been laid, by Parliament, upon their teas exported to America; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not purchaſe the tea, without paying the duty.</q>
But if this may be called a burden, ſo may the weight of an atom on the ſhoulders of a giant: beſides, this burden may be eaſily avoided; for we have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to purchaſe the tea, and unleſs we purchaſe it, we are under no obligations to pay the duty.</p>
            <p>You will ſay:
<q>the Parliament had <hi>no right</hi> to lay the duty.</q>
But I ſuppoſe we are, moſt of us, but indifferent judges of the rights of Parliament; or however, the Parliament muſt act according to their own judgment, and not according to ours, if it be different from theirs. They aſſert, and believe, that they have the right in queſtion; and we have never proved that they have not. Nay, we ourſelves have always believed and allowed that they have it, till the preſent occaſion. I might add, that we have always allowed that they had a right to regulate not only the trade, but all concerns of the Colonies; ſuch a power they have always exerciſed, and we have ſubmitted to their acts. Thus, for inſtance, we have paid a duty on wine and molaſſes, in obedience to Parliament, and without proteſtations or remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and, for the ſame reaſons, we are as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013224_0007_0F8FB55FD5BA7830"/>
to pay the duty on tea. If we would act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently, we ſhould either refuſe to pay the duty on wine and molaſſes, or conſent to pay it on tea; for it is, in both caſes, impoſed from the ſame principle, and has the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be replied,
<q>Theſe and all other duties ought to be rejected, becauſe they are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents,</hi> and intended to prepare the way for high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er demands; and if Parliament has a right to take from us one penny, without our conſent, it has a right to ſtrip us of our whole property, and to make us abſolute ſlaves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, I believe, is the firſt time that a ſovereign power has been in want of <hi>precedents,</hi> to juſtify its making laws to govern any part of its dominions. It is a contradiction in the nature of things, and as abſurd as that a part ſhould be greater than the whole, to ſuppoſe that the ſupreme legiſlative power of any Kingdom does not extend to the utmoſt bounds of that kingdom. If theſe Colonies, which originally belonged to <hi>England,</hi> are not now to be regulated and governed by the authority of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> then the conſequences are plain; they are not dependant upon <hi>Great Britain</hi>—they are not included within its territories—they are no part of its dominions— the inhabitants are not Engliſh, they can have no claim to the privileges of Engliſhmen; they are, with regard to <hi>England,</hi> foreigners and aliens; nay, worſe, as they have never been legally diſcharged from the duty they owed it, they are rebels and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. On the above ſuppoſition, they are, at beſt; as much the dominions of <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> as of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; for there can be no difference in this caſe, unleſs one has an authority over them, which the others have not. But if <hi>Great Britain</hi> poſſeſſes
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013224_0008_0F8FB56045C3CCB0"/>
a ſovereignty over the Colonies, ſhe certainly has a right, at leaſt, to regulate our commerce; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to regulate the importation of ſuch articles of mere luxury, as we can chooſe whether we will be concerned with, or not, with but little inconvenience to ourſelves. Now the preſent duty on tea is exactly ſuch a regulation.</p>
            <p>You allow that this duty is a thing that is but trifl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in itſelf; but then you conceit that you ought to oppoſe it, becauſe it is a <hi>precedent,</hi> which hereafter may be uſed to your diſadvantage. I am ſorry to ſee that men can be ſo eaſily deluded by ſuch ſophiſtry. Can you imagine that Parliament will not do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they think right to be done by them, without waiting for <hi>Precedents?</hi> Yet precedents of their own for regulating the trade of the Colonies, are not wanting. Every reign, ſince the ſettlement of the Colonies has produced them; in conſequence of which you are daily paying duties that, in every view, are as liable to exception, as the duty on tea. From hence it is evident, that you yourſelves have no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be governed by precedent, whatever regard the Parliament may be ſuppoſed to have for them.</p>
            <p>As to the argument that,
<q>If Parliament has a right to take from us one penny, without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it has a right to ſtrip us of our whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;</q>
altho' ſo great a man as Mr. LOCKE was the father of it, it appears to me to be weak and ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. A right to do what is reaſonable, implies not a right to do what is unreaſonable. A father may have a right over his ſon, ſo far as to ſend him on an errand, or upon any reaſonable ſervice, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an abſolute authority as can oblige him to throw himſelf down a precipice, or to hang himſelf. In like manner, caſes may happen, in which it would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013224_0009_0F8FB560F67A26D8"/>
be reaſonable for Parliament to take from us ſome ſmall matter, though we were unwilling to part with it; but the caſe can hardly be ſuppoſed, in which it would be reaſonable to take from us every thing, unleſs we ſhould have forfeited it. Every ſociety has a right to make a moderate uſe of its power over its own members, but not to abuſe it. There can be no right to do what is unqueſtionably <hi>wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, it is <hi>wrong</hi> to tax us at all, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our conſent.</hi> But the duty on tea, which has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned all our confuſions, is not ſuch a tax; for unleſs you conſent to the tax, you are not to pay the duty. You may refuſe it, if you pleaſe, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring any penalty, or conſiderable inconvenience. As to ſuch taxes as ariſe from the general regulation of American commerce, they muſt be impoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our formal conſent, if they are impoſed at all. For if all the Colonies muſt be conſulted, and all muſt agree, before ſuch a regulation can take place; it is eaſy to foreſee, that nothing of this kind can be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as nothing can be propoſed, in which all the Colonies, having each its peculiar views and intereſts, would be likely to agree. Therefore <hi>Great Britain</hi> muſt either impoſe ſuch duties upon our imports and exports, as may be thought proper for the good of the whole community, without our conſent, or ſhe muſt not attempt to regulate our trade; and if ſhe is not to ſuperintend and regulate our trade, ſhe had better relinguiſh at once her claim of authority over her colonies; after which they cannot expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her protection.</p>
            <p>But you further object, that
<q>if we are to be bound by laws to which we have never conſented, we have not the rights of Engliſhmen.</q>
In anſwer
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013224_0010_0F8FB561B074B578"/>
to this, let me remind you, firſt of all, that it never was, nor can it be, the right of Engliſhmen to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the authority of an Engliſh or Britiſh Parliament. It is not a <hi>proper</hi> conſent to the laws enacted by the Britiſh Parliament, but the being <hi>bound</hi> by thoſe laws, that diſtinguiſhes a Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from a foreigner. So long as a man reſides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any dominions, he is a ſubject of it, and is oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubmit to its laws, as far as they concern him, whether he approves of them or not. There are many people in England, who are natives of the country, that do not conſent to acts of Parliament that are paſſed, unleſs by a bare <hi>fiction of the law</hi>; which can make a <hi>nominal</hi> conſent, but <hi>not a real</hi> one. This is always the caſe of the Minority, where there is a diviſion, whoſe votes are over-ruled by the major part; for the law neceſſarily paſſes, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but contrary to, their conſent.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there are millions of people reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> who have no votes in elections, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſulted about the expediency of laws. I hope theſe are all Engliſhmen, although they give no other conſent to acts of Parliament, to which they are bound to ſubmit, than what is implied in their freely reſiding within the juriſdiction and protection of Parliament. In this ſenſe, the Americans, by fixing themſelves, and continuing to reſide, within the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh dominions, conſent to be governed by the Britiſh laws. When the Coloniſts firſt ſettled on Engliſh American ground, they well knew that the authority of Parliament was not to be ſuſpended or withdrawn, in their favour; and they knew too, that they had no power of ſending repreſentatives to Parliament of their own chooſing. <hi>On theſe terms</hi> they willingly ſettled here; and they have always enjoyed every
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013224_0011_0F8FB5628D5AC320"/>
advantage which they originally expected to receive, and which was contracted for in their ſtipulation with the Crown, and they can have no juſt reaſon to complain on this account. Yet notwithſtanding all this, they have been lately told by their agents, who had it from the beſt authority, that if they choſe to ſend over perſons to repreſent them in Parliament, they ſhould be admitted to ſeats in the Houſe. In my opinion, they have done wiſely in not accepting of the offer; but after refuſing it, they have ſurely no reaſon to complain, that they have no repreſentatives in the Parliament that muſt govern them.</p>
            <p>It has been frequently aſſerted, in juſtification of your claim, that,
<q>as the charters granted by the Crown, have allowed a legiſlative authority to the ſeveral Colonies, the inhabitants are to be bound by no laws, but what are made by their reſpective provincial legiſlatures, to which they conſent by repreſentation.</q>
With regard to this doctrine, I beg leave only to aſk a few queſtions. Can you be made to believe, that it was ever the intention of the Crown, to eſtabliſh by charter a power of legiſlation, in any of the Colonies, that is ſovereign, independent, and incontrolable by the ſupreme authority of the nation? Can you imagine, that in any inſtance, more than a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> right of juriſdiction was meant, for the internal regulation of the diſtrict mentioned in the charter; or conceive that ſuch a grant can place you beyond the reach of parliamentary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Would not the arguments that perhaps have deceived you, prove as ſtrongly, that the charter of the city of <hi>Albany,</hi> granting a power to make laws for its internal regulation, <hi>provided they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the laws of the Province,</hi> places the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that city beyond the reach of laws made by the aſſembly of <hi>New-York?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:013224_0012_0F8FB563E0388518"/>You, one and all, talk of your rights by charter: but are not ſome of the Colonies without charters? And do all the charters convey exactly the ſame privileges and rights? Do any of them ſay, that you ſhall not be bound by laws made in Great Britain? Nay, does not the charter of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, that <hi>taxes</hi> may be laid upon the inhabitants <hi>by act of Parliament?</hi> None therefore have a right to plead their charters, in the preſent controverſy, with the mother country, who reſide in the colonies that are without charters, or in Pennſylvania; and it is high time for thoſe who reſide in the other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to furniſh ſome kind of evidence, that their charters give <hi>them</hi> the right for which they contend. They have not yet done this; they have not attempted to do it; I ſuſpect they never will attempt it; and I challenge them to do it if they can. You may have heard ſome of them <hi>declaim</hi> on this topic, and you may hear them again; but, if you expect the <hi>proof</hi> called for, you will be diſappointed.</p>
            <p>What has been offered is in order to ſhew, that, in reality, no proper <hi>right</hi> of the colonies is infringed by the late act of Parliament, that impoſes a ſmall duty on the teas exported to America. And here it is worthy of notice, and we ought to attend to it all along as we proceed, that the colonies of <hi>Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Maryland, Virginia,</hi> the <hi>Carolinas</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> are not affected by any other of the late acts of Parliament; and have no diſpute of their own with the mother country, but what ariſes from the tea-act.</p>
            <p>But let us now <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> that we have been really injured by this act; and that our paying the duty would be dangerous to our conſtitutional liberties.
<pb n="14"

On this ſuppoſition, which the Americans in general ſeem to have adopted as the true ſtate of the caſe, the great queſtion is,—<hi>What method the colonies ought in wiſdom to purſue, in order to get rid of the duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Different meaſures have been already taken, in the different colonies, to avoid the operation of the act. In <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> the obnoxious tea was landed; but the inhabitants formed a reſolution, to which they have the virtue punctually to adhere, not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it. Happy would it have been for the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, if this meaſure had been univerſally taken! In that caſe, we ſhould ſtill have enjoyed tranquility, uninterrupted by ſeditious alarms; and the black cloud, charged with ſtorm and thunder, that now darkens our land, would not have collected.</p>
            <p>In moſt of the other colonies, the tea was not ſuffered to enter their ports; but it was ſent back unhurt. This indeed, in all its circumſtances, muſt be conſidered as a kind of inſult upon government; but yet it was ſuch a ſpecies of miſbehaviour, as, in all probability, the nation would have overlooked, and many of the friends of America would have thought worthy of commendation. But, as the evil genius of the colonies would have it, the tea that was ſent to <hi>Boſton,</hi> was neither ſtored, nor ſent back, but outrageouſly deſtroyed by the hands of violence.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be thought of conſigning, or ſending back the tea, there are but few people ſo abandoned to all ſentiments of fitneſs, propriety, and juſtice, as to think the deſtruction of it excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and the government at home, as all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would in the like caſe, thought it unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—It was ſoon determined, to inflict an exemplary puniſhment upon the town that was guilty of ſuch
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013224_0014_0F8FB564AB27F558"/>
ſhameful and flagrant injuſtice; and an act was paſſed, for ſhutting up the port of <hi>Boſton,</hi> till pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſatisfaction ſhould be made for ſo provoking an outrage.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that all the Americans are out of the reach of this act; that it was not intended to affect them; and therefore that they have nothing immediately to do with it, excepting the inhabitants of <hi>Boſton</hi> themſelves. Accordingly I ſhould have paſſed it by, as foreign from <hi>our</hi> part of the diſpute, had it not been voted by all our county and provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial COMMITTEES, to be <hi>dangerous to the liberties of the Britiſh colonies.</hi> For this reaſon I ſhall offer ſome obſervations on what appears to have been the policy of the act; which I ſhall addreſs to thoſe only, who are ſo reaſonable and modeſt as to allow, that the tea ought not to have been deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>If the conduct of the Boſtonians, in deſtroying the tea, was criminal, it deſerved puniſhment; and puniſhments ſhould always be regulated by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and degree of the crimes for which they are inflicted, and the circumſtances that attended the commiſſion of them. Now the crime of the Boſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians was a compound of the groſſeſt injury and inſult. It was an act of the higheſt inſolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards government; ſuch as mildneſs itſelf cannot overlook or forgive. The injuſtice of the deed was alſo moſt atrocious: as it was the deſtruction of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to a vaſt amount, when it was known that the nation was obliged in honour to protect it. At the ſame time it was very notorious, that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perpetrators was, by this example, to lead and excite others, when the expected opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould preſent, to the ſame wanton exceſs of riot and licentiouſneſs. Under theſe circumſtances,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013224_0015_0F8FB5671624DE78"/>
ſound policy was thought to require, that both a ſevere and a ſpeedy puniſhment ſhould be inflicted— ſevere, that it might bear ſome proportion to the guilt; and ſpeedy, that it might prevent the like miſchief in other inſtances.</p>
            <p>Many, I know, who admit that Boſton ought to have been puniſhed, yet exclaim loudly againſt the puniſhment decreed by Parliament, as being too ſevere in its manner: And if any other puniſhment had been inflicted, many of them, I dare ſay, would have exclaimed ſtill. For when people are once diſaffected towards an adminiſtration, whether with or without juſt reaſon, they will always find ſome pretence for blaming any meaſure that can be taken by it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of the puniſhment in queſtion, it was no more than ſhutting up a port, till ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhould be made for a flagrant injury and inſult, of which it had been guilty. While this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint was laid, a free uſe of all the neighbouring ports was allowed; ſo that no people but the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the town of <hi>Boſton</hi> were intended to be puniſhed by this act; and a ſufficient time was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged <hi>them</hi> to remove all their veſſels out of their harbour, that they might be uſefully employed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſtraint of their port. And as ſoon as compenſation ſhould be made for the injury done, and a proper acknowledgment of the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, every appearance ſhews that government intended to be ſatisfied, and to remove the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For proviſion was made, that, on ſuch an event, the King might immediately ſuſpend the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the act, without waiting for the meeting, or the formal proceedings of the Parliament, which might require time. Surely none, who have as high
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013224_0016_0F8FB567DCCDA840"/>
a ſenſe of public guilt, as of private, can think this puniſhment too ſevere for the crime, conſidered under all its aggravations. For, no people are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the uſe of any advantage, which they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly abuſe to the injury of others.</p>
            <p>An outcry is alſo made, that
<q>the puniſhment of the <hi>Boſtonians</hi> was haſty and precipitant, offering no alternative, and not ſuffering the party to be heard.</q>
It is freely confeſſed that, in common caſes, none ought to be puniſhed without a regular trial and conviction. But here the caſe was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and extraordinary. The moſt eſſential rights of government were audaciouſly invaded—the crime was notorious and unqueſtionable—a regular trial muſt have been the work of time—and while this would be depending, it was imagined the evil would ſpread. Both the letter and ſpirit of the law had been openly inſulted and defied, by the people in Boſton; and, in ſuch a caſe, the <hi>forms</hi> of the law, in bringing them back to a ſenſe of their duty, when it was apprehended that the delay of puniſhment would be dangerous to the community, were thought to be diſpenſible. Such conſiderations indeed will not authoriſe a judge, or any court of juſtice, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this compendious manner; but when a caſe comes before the whole legiſlative body, they have always the power to diſpenſe with the ordinary forms, and to do what is conceived to be moſt conducive to the public ſafety. For, to uſe the words of the juſtly celebrated Dr. BLACKSTONE,
<q>The bare idea of a ſtate, without a power, ſomewhere veſted, to alter every part of its laws, is the height of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical abſurdity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is moreover objected, that
<q>ſuch a mode of puniſhment involves the innocent in the ſame cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="18"
                      facs="unknown:013224_0017_0F904510412F2960"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the guilty.</q>
In anſwer to which, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that this inconvenience muſt always attend all puniſhments inflicted on a people, whether by God or man, and neceſſarily ariſes from the condition of the world. There is no body of people ſo bad, but many innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are intermixed with them. At the very worſt, there is always a number of innocent children, who are connected with, and dependent upon, the proper delinquents. The conſequence of which is, that no people, and commonly no individual, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be puniſhed, without hurting ſome innocent perſons. The objection therefore, if it has any weight, will hold good againſt all public, and moſt private puniſhments, of what kind ſoever. In the town of <hi>Boſton</hi> there are many innocent, worthy and reſpectable perſons (many more than is commonly imagined) who are as free from the public guilt, and hold it in as much abomination, as any men within his Majeſty's dominions. For their ſake, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, thoſe who have the greateſt regard for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of government, wiſh that the puniſhment could have been avoided. But as this was politically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, they muſt bear their own ſhare, with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and patience, as well as they can,—enjoying a conſciouſneſs of their own innocence,—maintaining their integrity,
<q>in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation</q>
—and looking forward to that time, which I hope is not diſtant, when they may expect to be diſtinguiſhed with ſuch favours as the public can give.</p>
            <p>The <hi>reſolves</hi> of the above-mentioned <hi>committees</hi> alſo expreſs, their brethren in <hi>Boſton,</hi> meaning the offenders againſt government, are to be conſidered
<q>as ſuffering in the common cauſe of American
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013224_0018_0F8FB56872319818"/>
liberty.</q>
But I hope the <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi> of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, is not avowed to be any part of the ſyſtem of <hi>American liberty</hi>; and I ſhould be extremely ſorry to find, that the <hi>common cauſe of the colonies</hi> requires ſuch defences as theirs. If a raving enthuſiaſt, in order to promote the cauſe of American liberty, ſhould take it in his head to aſſaſſinate his Prince, and afterwards ſhould be puniſhed for his treaſon; he might with equal propriety, be conſidered as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in the cauſe of American liberty. But, in that caſe, I believe no ſober Americans would think themſelves bound to abet the aſſaſſination; and for the ſame reaſons, we are under no obligations to abet the deſtructive violence of the people in <hi>Boſton,</hi> or to endeavour to ſkreen it from public juſtice. So far as they meant well, they ought to be commended; but ſo far as they did wrong, they ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And we both expoſe ourſelves, and injure our cauſe, by appearing to countenance their lawleſs and unwarrantable proceedings.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>reſolves</hi> alſo condemn, <hi>as oppreſſive and dangerous,</hi> the other <hi>act</hi> for altering the adminiſtration of juſtice in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi>; and it has been uſed as an inſtrument, in the hands of our popular incendiaries, for farther enflaming the minds of the Americans againſt the King and his Miniſters. But it deſerves notice, that the alteration made by the act, is rather an imaginary than a real evil. For it introduces into that province a regulation, which is far from being inconſiſtent with the happineſs of the people; as it only reduces them to a form of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, under which the inhabitants of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> have been as happy as any people in <hi>America.</hi> Indeed it abridges them of ſome privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that had been granted by charter. But no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013224_0019_0F8FB5693B1A3020"/>
are curtailed by the act, but ſuch as had been abuſed and forfeited over and over, and ſuch as probably would continue to be abuſed, to the great injury and diſturbance of that province, as well as to the diſhonour and reproach of the nation· It is the opinion of the beſt friends to the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that charters <hi>may</hi> be forfeited; and, it is a proof of the mildneſs, not of the rigour, of the adminiſtration, that the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> charter, after ſo many abuſes and provocations, has not been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally vacated, rather than abridged.</p>
            <p>Beſides the two laſt-mentioned acts, there is a third, for ſettling <hi>the government of Quebec,</hi> which has been as ſucceſsfully applied to the ſame noble purpoſe of enraging the Americans againſt the meaſures of government; and more lies and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations concerning this act have been circulated, than one would think malice and falſehood could invent. It is poſitively aſſerted, and generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, on the evidence of poſitive aſſertions, that by this act the Popiſh religion is <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vaſt extent of country now ſubject to the government of <hi>Quebec</hi>; and that the Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is there obliged to ſkulk in corners, not daring to lift up its head. Whereas, if we have recourſe to the words of the act, we ſhall ſee, that the Popiſh religion is no more than <hi>tolerated</hi> within that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; which was one of the conditions on which the country ſurrendered itſelf to the crown of Great Britain; and that a proper foundation is laid for the eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant religion, which is meant to take place. Tithes, which are the property of the tolerated Romiſh church in all the pariſhes, are indeed ordered to be paid, as formerly, to the miniſter of the pariſh; but the very moment a man
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013224_0020_0F8FB56A1226F900"/>
declares himſelf a Proteſtant, he is freed, by the act, from the obligation to pay tithes to the Popiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent. In that caſe, it is provided, that
<q>his Majeſty, his heirs or ſucceſſors, may make ſuch proviſion out of the—accuſtomed dues and rights, for the encouragement of the <hi>Proteſtant religion,</hi> and for the maintenance of a <hi>Proteſtant clergy</hi> within the ſaid province, <hi>as he or they ſhall, from time to time, think neceſſary and expedient.</hi>
               </q>
It is true, the Papiſts in <hi>Canada</hi> might have had a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration leſs generous than is granted them, without the Parliament's allowing to the clergy their tithes, or to the pariſhes their churches. But ſuch a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although it might have fulfilled the letter of the articles of the treaty, would not have anſwered their expectations, nor have left upon their minds favourable impreſſions of the Britiſh juſtice and honour. If we had taken from them their churches, or ſtripped the clergy of their tithes, which might have been done with equal propriety, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have encreaſed the number of his Majeſty's diſaffected American ſubjects; which appears to be too great without them. And as to <hi>trials by juries,</hi> they are affirmed to be excluded by the act; but the aſſertion is groundleſs and falſe. Juries are no more excluded from <hi>Canada,</hi> than they are excluded from the other American colonies. They have never been eſtabliſhed by act of Parliament in any of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, excepting the late act for the regulation of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi> They owe their being in <hi>America</hi> to acts of our provincial Aſſemblies, confirmed at home; and the provincial legiſlature of <hi>Canada</hi> may introduce them as ſoon as they pleaſe, and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they will, as ſoon as the inhabitants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

Two of them were meant as puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for crimes againſt the ſtate, and to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe who were conſidered as the greateſt offenders, and from whoſe republican ſpirit a general miſchief was apprehended. The deſign of the other act was to ſecure to a new colony the religious tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it had a <hi>right</hi> to demand, and otherwiſe to eaſe the minds of a numerous body of people, whoſe behaviour towards government had been decent and unexceptionable ſince they owed it allegiance, and who were likely to prove his Majeſty's <hi>moſt loyal and faithful ſubjects</hi> in his American dominions.</p>

of theirs are worthy of regard. For, in all their motions, they diſcover themſelves to be under the undue influence of prejudice and paſſion. Thro' this dark and miſty medium every object appears to them under a violent diſtortion; and as thus diſtorted, they muſt aſcribe it to others. No wonder then, that they put the very worſt conſtructions upon, and aſſign the very worſt motives for, all the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Britiſh Parliament.</p>
            <p>However, let us now ſuppoſe the truth and reality of the facts as ſtated by them; yet the inferences they intend, will by no means follow. Suppoſing Popery were actually <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> on the requeſt of the inhabitants; would it follow, that it was deſigned alſo to eſtabliſh it in the other colonies, where the inhabitants are averſe to it? Can any man, in his ſenſes, believe this to be the deſign of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Again: ſuppoſing the puniſhment inflicted on the Boſtonians to be arbitrary and ſevere; yet thoſe who are free from their guilt, and mean not to contract it, have no reaſon to fear the like puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<q>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: for he is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain; for he is the miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</q>
So far as we are innocent, we are ſafe; but if we undertake to juſtify or abet the crimes of others, we ſhare in their guilt; and particularly, if we are fomenters of the ſedition that rages in <hi>Boſton,</hi> we muſt take the conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:013224_0023_0F8FB56C2FA9C458"/>But the Boſtonians, you ſay, are <hi>over-puniſhed.</hi> If that be the caſe, they are entitled to our pity, and to our influence in obtaining a mitigation of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But this can be no reaſon, for our put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves in the ſame predicament with them, for making ourſelves partners in their guilt, or for bringing upon ourſelves a ſimilar puniſhment. We muſt be fools to think of doing this; and if they deſire us to do it, their modeſty is like that of <hi>the fox in the fable,</hi> who, becauſe he happened to have loſt his own tail, requeſted of his brother foxes, that they would all ſuffer their tails to be cut off too. But the foxes had more wiſdom than to comply; and ſo ſhould we have. As the puniſhment of the Boſtonians was deſigned to be local, and peculiar to them; we have no buſineſs to cauſe it to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Their caſe is not yet ours; and, God grant that it never may be!</p>
            <p>The proper diſpute ſubſiſting between Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and any of her colonies, excepting that of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> is only <hi>de Lana Caprina,</hi> about an act impoſing a duty of <hi>three pence a pound</hi> upon tea. This is the only ground <hi>we</hi> have for complaining of the adminiſtration; and yet this has occaſioned, throughout our colonies, ſuch an indecent and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oppoſition to government as is truly aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Can ſuch behaviour on ſo ſlight a provocation, proceed from <hi>dutiful and loyal ſubjects?</hi> No; it is impoſſible. Whatever we may think, or ſay, of ourſelves; if we had any true principles of <hi>loyalty,</hi> or any tolerable ſenſe of the <hi>duty</hi> that is due to the ſupreme legiſlative power, under which the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and our conſent, have placed us, no trifling conſiderations could prevail with us to behave towards it in ſo petulent and diſreſpectful a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013224_0024_0F8FB56CEC6A0E60"/>
manner. But there is too much reaſon to believe, that our minds are unprincipled, and our hearts diſpoſed for rebellion. Ever ſince the reduction of <hi>Canada,</hi> we have been bloated with a vain opinion of our own power and importance. Our caſe has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced pride and wantonneſs. We have been intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with ſuch draughts of liberty, as our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions would not bear; and under this intoxication, we have conceited that all the privileges indulged us were the effects of fear. From thinking, we have proceeded to ſpeaking, diſreſpectfully of our mother country; and our language now is—
<q>It is contrary to reaſon and nature, that the petty iſland of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> ſhould govern, and give laws to, the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and mighty regions of <hi>America.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet whatever <hi>time</hi> may produce, at preſent the petty iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> is able to govern ten ſuch <hi>Americas</hi> as this, if ſhe will exert her power. But ſhe wiſhes by lenity and forbearance and indulgence (I will venture to uſe theſe words, notwithſtanding her demand of a duty of three pence a pound upon her tea, if we ſee ſit to make uſe of it) I ſay, ſhe wiſhes by lenity, forbearance and indulgence to ſecure our affections, and to render us ſenſible, that our greateſt political happineſs muſt ariſe from her ſmiles and foſtering protection. We ſhould be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this, were it not for our ignorance, and want of conſideration; and willing to confeſs it, were it not for our pride. But if we determine to deny her authority, or to queſtion her <hi>right</hi> to command us; ſhe will prove to the world, and bring us to confeſs, that though ſhe is ancient, ſhe is not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated or exhauſted; and that ſhe ſtill poſſeſſes the ſpirit and vigour that have animated her beſt years.</p>
            <p>Were ſhe only to do nothing, but barely to leave
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013224_0025_0F8FB56F458B0D58"/>
the Colonies to themſelves with their jarring prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and intereſts, and projects; we ſhould ſoon ſee province waging war againſt province, and our country would be involved in ſuch miſery and diſtreſs as are beyond all our preſent conceptions. Should it be known abroad that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> had withdrawn her protection, and would no longer intereſt herſelf in our preſervation and ſafety; within the compaſs of one year our ſea-ports would be ravaged, and our veſſels plundered or ſeized as ſoon as they left our harbours. We ſhould therefore ſoon feel the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of purchaſing the protection of ſome maritime power, and on terms not of our propoſing, but of theirs; and which could never be able to ſecure us againſt any hoſtile attempts of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſhould ſhe ſee fit to make any; while ſhe maintains that Empire of the ſea which ſhe now holds, and of which all the Maritime powers of the world are unable to diſpoſſeſs her.</p>
            <p>But replies the ignorant and deluded American:
<q>Notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid of the naval ſtrength of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> it is aſſerted by our patriotic leaders, and we have reaſon to think, that theſe colonies, of themſelves, are able to withſtand all her force.</q>
The judgment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven viſibly appears in this dreadful infatuation. It was but a few years ago, that we believed, and found by experience, that the colonies were unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the militia of <hi>Canada,</hi> ſupported by a few regiments of regular troops from <hi>France.</hi> That this was the general opinion, moſt of us may remember; and it is evident from the meſſages that paſſed between Governor SHIRLEY and the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Boſton,</hi> from the addreſs of the aſſembly of <hi>Virginia</hi> to the King at the beginning of the late war,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013224_0026_0F8FB5700E7FEDE8"/>
and from many other authentic documents of that period. The Colonies then humbly and ardently implored that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> would ſpeedily ſtep in to their reſcue, and preſerve them from a deſtruction that threatened to overwhelm them. Their prayers were ſoon heard; and what was the conſequence we all know. The ſtrong bulwarks and fortreſſes of <hi>Canada</hi> were ſtormed, and the country conquered by the diſcipline and invincible bravery of but a ſmall part of the Britiſh troops.</p>
            <p>There is no room to doubt but ſuch an army as was employed in the reduction of <hi>Canada</hi> would be more than ſufficient for the conqueſt of all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected American Colonies, ſhould ſuch a reſolution become neceſſary in order to reduce them to obedience. For they are open and acceſſible on every quarter, and have not a ſingle fortreſs to cover them, nor one regiment of regular troops to defend them; and they are without military ſtores, without magazines, and without the ſkill that is neceſſary for ſupporting an army. Under ſuch circumſtances what would the boaſted numbers of our inhabitants avail us againſt an attack from <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> If an army was ſent in upon us, which a body of forty thouſand of our militia was unable to withſtand (for it is impoſſible that a greater number of undiſciplined men could act to advantage) it would be able to carry deſolation through the whole country; and all the men in the Colonies were they firmly united, would not be able to oppoſe it. But yet if the army here ſuppoſed, ſhould be found unequal to the deſign of reducing the Colonies, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> could ſend of her own troops a ſecond, of equal ſtrength to the aſſiſtance of the firſt; to theſe ſhe could add a third of <hi>Heſſians,</hi> a fourth of <hi>Hanoverians,</hi> and ſo on till the work were
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013224_0027_0F8FB570B50D2958"/>
compleated. She could eaſily take poſſeſſion of all our ſea-coaſts where our wealth is principally ſeated, and force us to fly into the back parts of the country for immediate ſafety. There an army of <hi>Canadians</hi> might be ordered to meet us, and unnumbered tribes of <hi>ſavages</hi> might be let looſe upon us at the ſame time, while our lands would he uncultivated, our ſtores exhauſted, our families unſheltered, and thoſe that happened to eſcape the ſword, glittering and flaming both in the front and rear of our ſettlements, would ſoon periſh by ſickneſs or famine.</p>
            <p>All that is here mentioned <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is able to do; and all this I believe ſhe <hi>would</hi> do, ſhould ſhe be obliged to enter into a war with the Colonies— provided the Americans had reſolution and <hi>firmneſs</hi> enough (for ſo ſome would call it) to hold out to ſuch extremity. But I am too well acquainted with their character to expect that they would prove thus <hi>obſtinate</hi> in the day of trial. When they come to find that on their ſide there can be no proſpect of victory, but that every day muſt deepen their diſtreſs and render their condition worſe and worſe; their natural underſtandings will return to them, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly plead the neceſſity of a ſubmiſſion as ſoon as poſſible. In that caſe happy would it be for them, if they could be conſidered only as conquered enemies; but alas! they muſt be viewed in the light of <hi>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed rebels,</hi> and treated accordingly. Their leaders muſt be given up into the executioner's hands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations of their eſtates forfeited by rebellion, muſt follow, and all muſt be left at the mercy of their vanquiſhers. When one people is conquered by another in war, private property is reſtored to its former poſſeſſors; but when rebellions are cruſhed, the moſt to be expected is, that the lives of thoſe that belong to the lower claſſes will be ſpared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:013224_0028_0F8FB5720ED6A908"/>To this wretched and accurſed ſtate of rebellion, the principles that have been propagated, and ſeveral ſteps that have been taken in the American Colonies directly tend. Nay, a rebellion is <hi>evidently commenced</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> in the county of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> without room for retreating. The inhabitants of that large and populous county have openly bid defiance to the united authority of the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons aſſembled in Parliament; they have moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly rejected the regulations of their courts of juſtice &amp;c. eſtabliſhed by Parliament; and not only ſo, but they have ſet up in <hi>direct oppoſition.</hi> to their authority, a government of their own. In the ſpirit of outrageous licentiouſneſs, they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by brutal violence, thoſe reſpectable gentlemen that held Commiſſions under the Crown, to reſign them in forms of their own inditing, and to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh their ſtations; and they have appointed others of the ſame factious and turbulent diſpoſition with themſelves to fill their places, till their long-projected <hi>republic</hi>

                  <p>I am perſuaded that there are not many men in the other Colonies of any denomination, who have not a general prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle of affection, eſteem and veneration for our civil Conſtitution, however it may be darkened by the groſs exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions occaſioned by the heat of the preſent diſputes. But in <hi>New-England</hi> I conceive, the real ſentiments of the people are of a <hi>peculiar</hi> complexion. Many of the firſt ſettlers imported with them an averſion to the <hi>regal</hi> part of our Conſtitution, and were thorough-paced <hi>Republicans.</hi> To every ſpecies of monarchy they were as inveterate enemies as any of their brethren, whom they left behind them in <hi>England</hi>; ſome of whom could not bear to read the word <hi>King</hi> in their <hi>Bibles,</hi> but wherever it occurred they ſubſtituted <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> in its place. It is well known that even good old father BAXTER was a remarkable inſtance of this nature. In the time of CROMWELL'S uſurpation, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his book of <hi>Saints everlaſting Reſt,</hi> in which he thought fit to uſe the phraſe of <hi>The</hi> PARLIAMENT OF HEAVEN, inſtead of ſaying <hi>The</hi> KINGDOM OF HEAVEN <note n="†" place="bottom">GREY's <hi>anſwer to</hi> NEAL.</note>. Now thoſe original ſettlers of <hi>New-England</hi> ſtifily maintained, and zealouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to propagate their own antimonarchical principles; and thoſe principles have been handed down by an uninterrupted ſucceſſion, from father to ſon, and from generation to generation, to the preſent day.</p>
                  <p>Although many of their deſcendants have acquired liberal ſentiments, and have renounced the bigotry and prejudices of their well-meaning fore-fathers, whether relating to matters of religion or government; yet this is by no means the caſe with regard to the body of the people. They ſtill retain an hereditary averſion to the frame of the Engliſh Conſtitution, and to the controll of monarchy; and this averſion has been from time to time, occaſionally animated and inflamed by a ſet of <hi>Pulpit-Incendiaries,</hi> for which that part of the country has been ever famous. By theſe and other inſtruments they have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared whenever the word is given, to declare and exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at all hazards for an <hi>independent</hi> government of their own modelling.</p>
                  <p>The confuſions of the preſent time have been thought to afford a favorable opportunity, for putting their deſign in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The Colonies are diſcontented, and it has been imagined that they might all be perſuaded to encourage the attempt. On this preſumption, the decree has gone forth to <hi>erect the Republic</hi>; the <hi>Rubicon</hi> has been paſſed, and there can be no thoughts of retreating. They have drawn the ſword, with an aim to plunge it into the bowels of our ancient and venerable Conſtitution; and henceforward the ſcabbard muſt become uſeleſs. The cry now is: <hi>We have no part in</hi> DAVID, <hi>neither have we inheritance in the ſon of</hi> JESSE: <hi>Every man to his tent,</hi> O ISRAEL.</p>
               </note> ſhall be ſettled, which is the glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They have already if we may believe <hi>credible

            <p>Now theſe rebellious Republicans, theſe hair-brained fanaticks, as mad and diſtracted as the ANABAPTISTS <hi>of</hi> MUNSTER, are the people whom the American Colonies wiſh to ſupport!

this grand COMMITTEE OF COMMITTEES, to find out ſome way conſiſtent with our claims for obtaining the reſtoration of our common tranquillity, and a happy reconciliation of Great-Britain to her Colonies. The <hi>known</hi> character of <hi>ſome</hi> Gentlemen appointed as Delegates, and the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> character of <hi>moſt</hi> of the others, led us to expect from them all that we wanted; and to believe that the united wiſdom of the Americans would ſhine in full ſplendor at the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> and that the prudence and policy of the Counſels there taken would be ſuch, as would have done honour to an Aſſembly of the greateſt ſages of antiquity. But—the poor Americans are doomed to diſappointment. The firſt diſcovery of the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Congreſs</hi> was ſhocking. Every thing was kept ſecret for ſome weeks, and we flattered ourſelves with hoping for the beſt. But when the news arrived at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that the people of SUFFOLK had OPENLY REVOLTED FROM THEIR AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEGIANCE to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>government</hi>; in a ſudden tranſport of joy, the veil of the <hi>Congreſs</hi> was drawn back, and a myſtery revealed that filled the minds of many with ſurprize and aſtoniſhment; the myſtery was, that the Gentlemen of the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> in whom we conſided as the faithful guardians of the <hi>ſafety,</hi> as well as <hi>rights</hi> of America, were <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to enter into a league offenſive and defenſive, with its <hi>worſt enemies</hi> the New-England and other Preſbyterian Republicans. This fact is notorious to the world; it can neither be denied nor palliated; for they haſtily and eagerly publiſhed, (and it was the firſt thing that they <hi>did</hi> publiſh) their cordial approbation of the <hi>Suffolk Reſolves</hi> for erecting an <hi>Independent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>; and recommended to the Americans the ſupport of thoſe meaſures <hi>with united

            <p>If thoſe who have been moſt active among us, in raiſing ſeditious tumults, and in filling the country with diſtraction, will not be perſuaded, by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going conſiderations, to recede, it is hoped that others will; and it would be no ſmall point gained, in favor of the Colonies, if thoſe who are friends to order and government, and enemies to the riots and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013224_0035_0F8FB579ACF7E2F8"/>
diſturbances of abuſive <hi>mobs,</hi> would aſſume the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age openly to declare their ſentiments. All thoſe who are ſtill loyal to their ſovereign, ſhould do the ſame. His Majeſty's good ſubjects of the town of <hi>Rye</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. RIVINGTON's <hi>Gazetteer</hi> of October 13.</note>, to their laſting honour, have ſet the example. Not only their names, but their numbers, are very reſpectable; and, were the example to be followed, through all the towns and diſtricts of our ſeveral Colonies, I doubt not but it would appear, to the confuſion of ſome among us, that, in every province, there are more than <hi>ſeven thouſand men who have not bowed the knee,</hi> and who will not bow it, to the <hi>Baal</hi> of independency. And I now congratulate all ſuch on the pleaſure of finding, from the information of Gentlemen of unqueſtionable veracity, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves</hi> from <hi>Georgia</hi> were far from expreſſing <hi>the ſenſe of the inhabitants</hi> of that grateful and loyal Province; but that they were framed only by a company of hot-headed fellows, met together in a tavern <note n="†" place="bottom">RIVINGTON's <hi>Gazetteer,</hi> ut ſup:</note>.</p>
            <p>I will only obſerve farther on this ſubject, that all who have the courage now to declare themſelves friends to Government, will undoubtedly think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in honour, intereſt and conſcience, to reſort to the King's <hi>Standard,</hi> when it comes to be erected in our different Colonies, ſhould that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly event happen; and theſe, of themſelves, will compoſe a body, which, in a good cauſe, will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to its oppoſers. But many thouſands of others, and indeed the greater part of thoſe who ſhall not have rendered their caſes deſperate, when they ſee the danger thus nearly approaching, and the ſtorm ready to burſt, will be glad to fly for ſhelter
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013224_0036_0F8FB57A748CAAD0"/>
too to the Royal ſtandard, if human nature continues the ſame that it ever has been; and they will be zealous to <hi>ſignalize</hi> themſelves in the King's ſervice, in order to render unqueſtionable that loyalty which was formerly ſuſpicious. It is morally certain that, in the day of trial, a large majority of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans will heartily unite with the King's troops, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>America</hi> to order. Our violent republicans will then find themſelves deſerted by thouſands and thouſands in whom they now confide; and inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly dreadful muſt be their diſappointment.
<q>O! that they were <hi>wiſe,</hi> that they <hi>underſtood</hi> this, that they would <hi>conſider</hi> their LATTER END!</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more on the ſuppoſed caſe of our waging WAR AGAINST THE KING, and entering into a STATE OF REBELLION; the thoughts of which, all ſober men, and all conſcientious men, and all who prefer the good of their country to the gratification of their own obſtinate humors, muſt reject with horror.</p>
            <p>But another ſcheme is propoſed, at firſt view leſs ſhocking, which alſo appears to be recommended by the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> and which many at preſent are inclined to adopt; I mean, <hi>a general non-importation agreement</hi> throughout the Colonies. Againſt a propoſal of this nature I have two objections to offer: Namely, that it will greatly diſtreſs a country which I love; and that it will not anſwer the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In order (N. B.) to get rid of a duty of <hi>three pence a pound on tea,</hi> it is propoſed to ſtop all importation from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and even from the <hi>Weſt-India Iſlands,</hi> till the act impoſing it ſhall be repealed. But a remedy of this kind is ten thouſand times worſe than the diſeaſe. It is, for the wiſdom of it, like cutting off an arm, in order to get rid of a ſmall ſore in one of the fingers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013224_0037_0F8FB57B2C78A4C0"/>On a late trial of non-importation from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> only, as ſoon as the ſtores of Engliſh goods began to be exhauſted, every family among us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſuch inconveniences and difficulties, as produced a general murmur and complaint. For although the articles imported from <hi>England</hi> are not abſolutely neceſſary to ſupport <hi>animal</hi> life; yet it was found that the <hi>civilized</hi> life we had been uſed to, and which is neceſſary to the happineſs of all but ſavages, depended, in no ſmall degree, upon our importations from <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> And had the non-importation continued much longer, it would have excited inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in moſt parts of the country.</p>
            <p>But a non-importation from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> would ſtill more tenderly affect us. For to ſay nothing of <hi>Rum,</hi> or of <hi>Molaſſes</hi> for the uſe of our diſtilleries, without which more than a hundred thouſand Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican dram-drinkers would ſoon be clamorous; the want of the ſingle article <hi>Sugar</hi> would diſtreſs every family upon this Continent. For this, in the quantity that is neceſſary, we could find no ſufficient ſubſtitute: the hardened juice of our <hi>Maple,</hi> where it could be had, would be but a forty one; and as to <hi>Honey,</hi> we all know its uſe; and were our ſtock of it ever ſo large, it would prove but a bad ſweetner of the bitter draught of a non-importation.</p>
            <p>Here then it is propoſed, that, to the non-importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we have experienced and could hardly bear, another ſhould be added, that would affect us ſtill worſe; and that a double weight ſhould be faſtened upon thoſe ſhoulders, which were ready to give way under a ſingle one. But this is not the worſt of the caſe. It is generally believed, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from <hi>England</hi> have confirmed the opinion, that if the Colonies ſhould reſolve to import nothing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013224_0038_0F8FB57BFAFD2688"/>
from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> they will not be ſuffered to import from any other quarter—not, even the ſalt that is neceſſary to cure their winter's proviſions, or to ſeaſon their porridge: And beſides this, that an abſolute <hi>non-exportation</hi> will be ordered, and not a ſingle veſſel ſuffered to go out of our harb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. Such an order, we know, can effectually be executed, with the greateſt eaſe. It is but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral Cuſtom-Houſes to grant no clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; and then every veſſel that offered to ſail, would be a lawful ſeizure. A few of the King's frigates would be ſufficient to do the buſineſs, for all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies on the Continent. Two or three of them ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the <hi>Capes of Virginia,</hi> would command every veſſel belonging to the Ports, and to the fine navig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rivers, of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi> As many ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the <hi>Capes of Delaware,</hi> would ſecure <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Jerſey</hi>—and ſo of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Now a total ſtagnation of all foreign commerce, would at once place us in a glorious and bleſſed ſtate. In the firſt place, all that live by this commerce would be thrown out of employ. Our <hi>ſailors</hi> would be turned aſhore; our ſhips would rot in our harbours; and our eſtates, which conſiſt of wharfs or ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, would become as worthleſs, as thoſe of the ſame nature are at preſent in the town of <hi>Boſton.</hi> Our <hi>ſhip-builders,</hi> and their attendants, their <hi>ſmiths, car men &amp;c.</hi> with all that are employed in the buſineſs of cordage and rigging, muſt be immediately diſcharged. The numerous body of <hi>pilots</hi> and <hi>boatmen</hi> muſt be turned adrift. Nor would it fare much better with our <hi>ſhop-keepers</hi> and <hi>merchants,</hi> whoſe families are ſupported by the profits ariſing from their reſpective occupations. The expenſive buſineſs of all our <hi>iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works</hi> muſt ſtop; and the many thouſands which they
<pb n="40"
                   facs="unknown:013224_0039_0F904510BAE76C08"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
provide for, muſt, unprincipled as thoſe wretches commonly are, be let looſe upon the country, to get their living as they can.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe claſſes of people, and many others which I have not enumerated, muſt have a ſupport, and but few of them will be able to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and if their poverty is not relieved to their ſatisfaction, they will ſoon learn to carve for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There are but few pariſhes and counties among us, which have not complained of the burthen of their own poor. But what will they ſay, when the burthen comes to be encreaſed an hundred-fold, as it neceſſarily muſt, when a general non-importation and non-exportation take place; and all their wanted reſources fail them at the ſame time. The want of the money, of which we have been lately drained, in order to pamper the Boſton fanaticks, will then be ſeverely felt: Nor can we expect any return of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in our diſtreſs from that Province, as their ſufferings will be much greater than ours.</p>
            <p>In the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> there is a large number of populous ſea-port towns, which have no other ſupport than their fiſhery. The town of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> has three hundred ſchooners employed in that ſervice, with a proportionable number of hands. In the town of <hi>Marblehead</hi> there are ſuppoſed to be near four thouſand men, and many of them with families, that know of no other means of ſubſiſtence than the cod-fiſhery. I might mention <hi>Plymouth, Salem, Beverly</hi> and a number of other towns, that are nearly in the ſame ſituation. Now, when all theſe fiſhermen are turned aſhore, and their veſſels become uſeleſs; they muſt, with their unprovided families, diſperſe themſelves amongſt the inhabitants, and while the country affords any thing to eat, they will not ſtarve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:013224_0040_0F904511792015A0"/>But to return to theſe Colonies. I have mentioned the diſtreſs that muſt immediately overwhelm many orders of people, on a general ſtagnation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; but have ſaid nothing of our Farmers, or thoſe that live by the cultivation of their lands.— Theſe may think themſelves a kind of <hi>privileged</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and imagine that ſuch a revolution of affairs will affect them but little; yet a very ſhort experience will open their eyes, and convince them of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. It is their farms, as all other reſources will fail, that muſt ſupport all the abovementioned thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of diſtreſſed people. Who muſt furniſh them with food? None can do it, but, THE FARMERS. Who muſt ſupply them with cloathing? THE FAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERS. Who muſt ſhelter many of them in their houſes? THE FARMERS. And can they expect pay for all this? Alas! thoſe poor creatures will have nothing to make payment with. And if they are employed as labourers, they are all unacquainted with the buſineſs; and their labour will turn to but little account. Indeed, were the markets abroad open, the farmer might ſomewhat increaſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his beef, his wheat and other produce, by their means, ſo that his bargain would be leſs into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. But the foreign conſumption, on which he is now growing rich, will entirely ceaſe; and there will be no demand for his beef, and his wheat and other produce. All that he raiſes muſt periſh on his hands, except what he expends in his own family, and on the poor that will be preſſing upon him.</p>
            <p>When all people are thus diſtreſſed; when every mind is uneaſy and diſcontented; it will be natural for them to fall to reproaching one another, with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authors of this general calamity. This will be productive of eternal quarrels, and riots, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013224_0041_0F90451254E240A0"/>
and acts of violence, amongſt ourſelves; and then our miſery will be compleat.</p>
            <p>Yet after all, were it likely that theſe political ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and convulſions would produce a repeal of the act in diſpute, it would be <hi>ſome</hi> alleviation of our misfortunes to conſider, that we ſhould gain by them <hi>Three pence a pound,</hi> on all the tea we ſhould have occaſion to purchaſe. But my <hi>ſecond</hi> objection againſt a general non-importation agreement is, that it will not anſwer the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After what has been ſaid and done by the Colonies, a general non-importation agreement will be conſidered by <hi>Great Britain</hi> as an act of hoſtility, intended to <hi>compel</hi> her to relinquiſh her claim; and ſhe will not ſubmit to be conquered by <hi>ſuch</hi> weapons, any more than by force of arms. It is not pretended that ſhe is altogether invulnerable in this part. The blow would reach her, and be felt by her; but the wound would not be mortal. The ſtrength and vigour of her conſtitution would bear much more, than we are able to inflict. But—the ſhaft, ungraciouſly aimed at the vitals of our Mother, on the rebound may prove fatal to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>A total ſtagnation of commerce would affect <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in much the ſame manner, that it would affect her colonies, or any other commercial people; that is, it would rob her of her ſubſiſtance. But a partial ſtagnation could not affect her in the ſame manner that we ſhould be affected by a total ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Now, the non-importation in queſtion, while it would cauſe a total ſtagnation of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, would produce no more than a partial ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of hers; and conſequently would not place her in a ſituation ſo diſtreſſing, as it would place us. Her trade is not confined to her American Colonies.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013224_0042_0F904513017B45C0"/>
She has ſhips and factories in every quarter of the globe; and the treaſures of the Eaſt and Weſt are perpetually flowing in upon her. She receives no neceſſary or uſeful articles from theſe Colonies, but what ſhe formerly received, and may at any time be ſupplied with, from foreign nations. Her manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are conſumed in the Colonies, ſhe can ſhortly find ways to diſpoſe of at other markets.</p>
            <p>There is one branch of this hopeful project, that will contribute immediately and directly to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> almoſt in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it will diſtreſs ourſelves. The Reader ſcarcely needs to be told, that what is here meant, is the ſtopping all intercourſe and communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Colonies and the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> As ſoon as this takes place, the markets of Great Britain will be ſupplied, not only with the quantity of goods from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> which they have formerly received, but with the addition of all that is now conſumed in the American Colonies. The Britiſh merchants will likewiſe have the advantage of ſupplying the Iſlands with many articles, which at preſent are not ſcored in any of their invoices.</p>
            <p>The Weſt-Indians themſelves indeed may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what injured and diſconcerted at firſt, by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this part of the plan; but far leſs, than ſeems to be generally expected and intended by us. The Iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> can ſupply her Planters with all kinds of proviſions, but butter and flour; and with all the lumber that may be required, for a hundred years to come, excepting ſtaves and heading for their <hi>Rum Puncheons.</hi> Theſe ſhe has often received from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> from whence ſhe might receive them again. But there will be no occaſion for ſending ſo far. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> can ſupply her, and all the other iſlands, with
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013224_0043_0F904515A2630638"/>
theſe articles, as well as with flour, in any quantity that may be ordered; to ſay nothing of Georgia and the two Floridas, which abound in common lumber, at the ſervice of the <hi>Windward, Leeward,</hi> and <hi>Caribbee</hi> Iſlands. So that after the firſt year, new channels may be opened, plans formed, and correſpondences ſettled, in ſuch a manner, that the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> may be nearly as well ſupplied without our aſſiſtance, as they now are with it; and with ſome articles, perhaps better.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the contrary; yet what ſhould we gain by this curious bargain? Why, the ill-will and reſentment of all the Weſt-Indians. For ſome years paſt, they have cultivated a peculiar friendſhip with the North-American Colonies, and propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much happineſs from a cloſer alliance.</p>
            <p>They have ſent hither their children, in large numbers, for their education: and many of them have brought over their families, and liberally ſpent the incomes of their eſtates among us. But when they find that, we can ſo ingeniouſly contrive ſchemes to diſtreſs them without benefiting ourſelves; as they are generally not wanting in ſpirit, they will be apt to reſent ſuch ill uſage, by withdrawing their ſons and their families from among us, and perhaps by breaking off all further connexion with us in the way of commerce.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, it will naturally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that by a general non-importation agreement we ſhall carry on a very unequal warfare with Great Britain; which will much ſooner compel us to yield, than her to comply. The want of her North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican trade may hurt her, but it will not reduce her to extremity; and, if I may judge from my own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nothing but the utmoſt extremity will induce
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013224_0044_0F904516FAE85E38"/>
her, where ſhe believes ſhe has right of her ſide, and where her honour is deeply at ſtake, to give up the point in diſpute.</p>
            <p>At the time of our former non-importation, the caſe was materially different. The <hi>Stamp-act</hi> was ſo contrary to all our ideas of American rights, and ſo much was offered againſt the policy of the act, both here and at home, that there was no difficulty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing it. Afterwards when we exclaimed againſt the duties impoſed upon paper, glaſs, &amp;c. and agreed not to import the ſeveral articles loaded with duties; our views were comparatively moderate, and we had a large body of friends in England to ſupport us. And were the propoſition now only not to import, or to conſume, the tea that is charged with the duty; the caſe would be the ſame that it was then—we ſhould have the ſame friends that we then had—and the duty would probably be removed, on the ſame principle that thoſe duties then were. But our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct now is ſo wild and diſtracted—our tumults and diſorders are carried to ſo unreaſonable and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable a length—nay, ſuch a ſpirit of rebellion has broke forth among us, and ſuch a determined enmity againſt the <hi>ſupremacy</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> now predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the Colonies, that we have hardly a ſingle friend remaining in <hi>England.</hi> Even the Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers join with all other orders of people, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our extravagance; and, which is ſtill more, the Writers and Speakers againſt the King's miniſtry allow that it is inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>It appears, therefore, that nothing will be likely to procure a repeal of the <hi>Tea-act,</hi> or the removal of any other grievance of the like kind, but, the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of peace and order amongſt ourſelves— a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did acknowledgment of our political errors and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013224_0045_0F9045181AD191F0"/>
—a formal allowance of the rightful ſupremacy in general, of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> over the American Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies—a declaration of our averſion to a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, with a <hi>correſponding behaviour</hi>—a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remonſtrance on the ſubject of taxation—an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of our willingneſs to contribute, in ſome equitable proportion, towards defraying the public expences—and the propoſal of a reaſonable plan for a general American conſtitution. This, it is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceived, was to have been the buſineſs of the <hi>Congreſs</hi>; and if they had acted upon theſe principles, and with ſuch views, not only the preſent, but all future generations, would <hi>call them bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all unfavorable ſymptoms and appearances, I would not preſume to form a final judgment of the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> till their whole plan of proceedings ſhall be known. It is poſſible, that all that has been wrong may be rectified in the end; and that moderate and wiſe meaſures, tending to reſtore the tranquility, the happineſs, the honour and ſafety of the Colonies, may at laſt be concerted. Should this appear, in the general reſult of their councils, the members will be entitled to the grateful reſpect of every American, and the miſtakes made in the former part of their proceedings ought never to be mentioned to their diſadvantage. But, on the other hand, ſhould it appear, that they mean to encourage acts of hoſtility againſt Great Britain, or to ſupport the madmen of <hi>New-England</hi> in their ſcheme of an <hi>Independent Republic:</hi> in that caſe, I affirm, that the <hi>Original Contract</hi> between them and the <hi>moſt reſpectable</hi> part of their conſtituents will be <hi>diſſolved</hi>—that we ſhall be at full liberty to conſult our own ſafety, in the manner we ſhall think moſt conducive to that end— and that we ſhall owe them no greater reſpect and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013224_0046_0F9045183B4D4A28"/>
obedience, than they themſelves pay to the Britiſh Parliament.</p>
            <p>The foregoing conſiderations are addreſſed—not to thoſe obſtinate, hot-headed Zealots, who are at the bottom of all our confuſions; for arguments would be as much waſted upon them, as upon men that are intoxicated with liquor—but to <hi>all reaſonable Americans,</hi> to thoſe who are ſtill in the exerciſe of their underſtandings, and whoſe minds are open to convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. People of this character, it is preſumed, will ſee the neceſſity of giving up the preſent ſyſtem of American politics, as eſſentially wrong and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and of entering unanimouſly upon moderate and conciliating meaſures, as they regard the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace and tranquility in this, heretofore, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py country.</p>
            <p>The great object in view, ſhould be a general <hi>American Conſtitution,</hi> on a free and generous Plan, worthy of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to give, and of the colonies to receive. This is now become neceſſary to the mutual intereſt and honour, both of the Parent Kingdom and its American offspring. Such an eſtabliſhment is only to be obtained by decent, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and reſpectful application; and not by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or threatening. To think of ſucceeding by force of arms, or by ſtarving the nation into compliance, is a proof of ſhameful ignorance, pride and ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All ſuch projects muſt operate ten times more forceably againſt ourſelves, than againſt <hi>Great Britain.</hi> They are, at beſt, but <hi>Penny wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Pound fooliſh</hi>; and therefore inconſiſtent with every maxim of ſound wiſdom and genuine Patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>All violent oppoſition to lawful authority partakes of the nature of rebellion; and a rebellion of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, whether it ſhould prove ſucceſsful or unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013224_0047_0F904518FA7433F0"/>
would neceſſarily terminate in ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. We are now in the utmoſt danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurried, before we are ſenſible of it, into this deſperate and dreadful ſtate <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <p>Among the various denominations of Americans, moſt men would be ſtartled and ſhocked at the propoſal of entering into an open <hi>rebellion</hi>; but ſeditious principles, that directly lead to, and muſt finally bring on, a rebellion, have been gradually inſtilled into many of them, without alarming their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, under the cover of fair and ſpecious pretences. Wrong principles are naturally productive of wrong conduct; and one wrong ſtep prepares the way to another, and that to another, till at laſt there can be no retreating.</p>

                     <hi>Nemo repente fit turpiſſimus, i: e.</hi> No one arrives at a groſs and enormous pitch of wickedneſs at once, is an old and juſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and it is particularly true with regard to <hi>rebellion.</hi> The grand Engliſh rebellion, in the laſt century, was a remarkable proof of it. In the firſt place, men gave way to unfavourable ſuſpicions concerning the King and his Miniſters, and thus loſt the reverence that is due to the regal authority. They then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take pleaſure in blackening the King's character, and in giving an invidious turn to all his actions. From this they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>caballing</hi> againſt him; and, at laſt, they took up arms, deluded with the pretence of liberty and property, and religious rights. And when they had once taken up arms againſt their Sovereign, they found it neceſſary to deſtroy him, for their own ſecurity. This ſoon brought on a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, of liberty and property, and the ruin of the nation, as well as of themſelves. Such is the common progreſs, and the effect, of rebellions in general.</p>
               </note>, when moſt of us think that we have grievances to complain of, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the exerciſe of unconſtitutional power; and when many are practicing every wicked art to ſeduce us from our allegiance. It therefore highly concerns us to be upon our guard, at ſuch a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſeaſon as this. A ſmall degree of reflection would convince us, that the grievances in queſtion, ſuppoſing them to be real, are, at moſt, no more than a juſt ground for decent remonſtrance, but not a ſufficient reaſon for forcible reſiſtance. Theſe two
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013224_0048_0F904519BB9138C8"/>
things are widely and eſſentially different; and if we miſtake one for the other, the conſequence may be fatal.</p>
            <p>It has been fully ſhewn, that a rebellion of the colonies can have no reaſonable proſpect of ſucceeding; and that it muſt prove the deſtruction of all that are concerned in it. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that it were likely to ſucceed, it is of the utmoſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to conſider, what we ſhould gain by it; which would be, after the deſolation of our country, and the ſacrifice of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of lives, an exemption from the authority of the Britiſh Parliament, and ſubjection to the authority of an American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. A bleſſed exchange this! eſpecially if we take into the account the character of our future maſters. The principal conductors of the rebellion, would naturally have the principal authority in the republic; and theſe are men, whoſe tyrannical uſurpation would be more oppreſſive, than the ſcorpion power of the moſt deſpotic Prince in Europe. There would be no peace in the colonies, till we all ſubmitted to the republican zealots and bigots of New-England; whoſe tender mercies, when they had power in their hands, have been ever cruel, towards all that preſumed to differ from them in matters either of religion or government.</p>
            <p>As ſoon therefore, as people of this ſtamp come to be in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an eſtabliſhed authority, which would be the caſe ſhould the rebellion ſucceed, the dire effects of their perſecuting, and intolerant ſpirit will be diſmally felt by all that ſhall have cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to <hi>diſſent</hi>; particularly, the members of the Church of England, the Friends or people called Quakers, the Baptiſts, thoſe that belong to the German and Dutch Churches, and the moderate and candid part of the Preſbyterians themſelves. All theſe claſſes of people then, by promoting the preſent ſcheme for an independent government, are abſurdly acting againſt their own intereſt and honour, and contributing to prepare yokes for their own necks.</p>
            <p>O my infatuated Countrymen! My deluded Fellow-Subjects, and Fellow-Chriſtians! Open your eyes, I entreat you; awake from your dreams, and regard your own ſafety!</p>
            <p>As to you, who are members of the <hi>Church of England</hi>; it is amazing, that any of you ſhould be ſo blind to your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and ſuch apoſtates from common ſenſe, as to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and co-operate with a plan of procceedings, which, if it ſucceeds, will at once diſtreſs and diſgrace you. You are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to provide arms for your enemies, and to put power into the hands of thoſe who will uſe it againſt you. You are ſetting up a ſort of people for your maſters, whoſe principles you deſpiſe, and who were always fond of ſubduing by the iron

or become victims of their intolerance. Indeed it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and I am ſorry to ſay, that many of you appear already to have renounced one half of your principles; or you could not proceed, as you do, in direct oppoſition to the eſtabliſhed rules and doctrines of the Church. The principles of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and obedience to lawful authority, are as inſeparable from <hi>a ſound, genuine member</hi> of the Church of England, as any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious principles whatever. This Church has always been famed and reſpected for its <hi>loyalty,</hi> and its regard to order and government. Its annals have been never ſtained with the hiſtory of plots and conſpiracies, treaſons and rebellions. Its members are inſtructed in their duty to government, by Three <hi>Homilies</hi> on <hi>Obedience,</hi> and ſix againſt <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which are ſo many ſtanding leſſons to ſecure their fidelity. They are alſo taught to pray in the Litany, that the Almighty would preſerve them, "from all ſedition, privy conſpiracy and rebellion." And more than one ſolemn office is provided, for the annual commemoration of former deliverances from the power of thoſe, whether Papiſts or Proteſtants,
<q>who turn religion into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and faith into faction.</q>
But if you regard none of theſe things, you are untoward, undutiful, and degenerate ſons of the Church; and ſhe will be aſhamed to own you for her children.</p>
            <p>However, even thoſe of you who are but half-principled in the doctrines of the Church, will be looked upon with an evil eye, under the intended republic; and they muſt give up the other moiety of their principles, before they can be ſecure againſt harm or moleſtation. The Church of England has always been the great obſtacle in the way of thoſe republican fanaticks; and when once they are eſtabliſhed, no appearance of a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will eſcape their reſentment, or be tolerated among them.</p>
            <p>Nor will it fare better with the <hi>Friends,</hi> or people called <hi>Quakers</hi>; however peaceable in their diſpoſition, or however uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful members of ſociety. What they formerly ſuffered in <hi>New-England</hi> under the ſame ſort of men that muſt and will govern this country, if it ſhould be withdrawn from the juriſdiction of the Britiſh parliament, is too well known, and can never be forgotten. You, my reſpected friends, have experienced the genuine ſpirit and temper of their authority; and you can never wiſh to have your necks again encumbered with that <hi>Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> yoke of bondage, which neither you nor your fathers were able to bear. On the other hand, you have the ſenſe to ſee, and the gratitude to confeſs, that you have been happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the relief and protection afforded you by the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in common with other good ſubjects. You will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013224_0051_0F90451C0B044448"/>
               <hi>remember</hi> (to uſe your own expreſſive language) "that, as under divine Providence, you are indebted to the King and his royal anceſtors, for the continued favour of enjoying your religious liberties, you are under deep obligations (on <hi>this</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) to manifeſt your loyalty and fidelity; and to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage every attempt which may be made by any, to excite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection, or diſreſpect to him."</p>
            <p>The <hi>Baptiſts</hi> have never had fair quarter allowed them by the demagogues of <hi>New-England</hi>; and they are perpetually complaining, from year to year, of the acts of oppreſſion and violence with which they are haraſſed by them. Now if the people of <hi>New-England</hi> have been thus intolerant, towards thoſe that differed from them only with regard to the caſe of baptiſm, while they poſſeſſed an authority that was ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Britiſh Parliament; what cruelty, towards all that diſſent from them, may be expected, ſhould they be armed with abſolute and incontrolable power?</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> to whoſe induſtry and good behaviour the Colonies are greatly indebted; if they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubject to the juriſdiction abovementioned, they will be conſidered as perſons, not only of a different religion, but of different nations and languages, from whom they have ſuch an averſion, that they have never admitted them to ſettle in <hi>New-England</hi>; and conſequently all the Coloniſts who are of a <hi>foreign</hi> growth or extraction, muſt expect to meet with a double portion of rancour and ſeverity from their new maſters.</p>
            <p>Nor can the moderate part of the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts</hi> themſelves, have any proſpect of continuing free from moleſtation under their government. Nothing can be more odious to bigots, than generoſity and candour; or more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the opinion of the furious, than moderation and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This aſſertion might be ſupported by the hiſtory of all ages and nations; but we need not go far for a confirmation of it. For among the Preſbyterians and Independents in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, when the meek and the moderate, the candid and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous have been brought before the tribunals of the bigotted and furious, as has frequently happened; they have been treated with as much unrelenting rancour and roughneſs, as if they had been Mahometans and Heathens. So that there is no chance or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, if the latter ſhould come to the poſſeſſion of deſpotic power, which is the aim of the revolution they propoſe; that their diſpenſations towards the former, would be leſs cruel than they commonly have been.</p>

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:013224_0052_0F90451CC4FB92E0"/>In a word: no order or denomination of men amongſt us would enjoy liberty or ſafety, if ſubjected to the fiery genius of a New-England Republican Government; the little finger of which we ſhould ſoon experience to be heavier than the loins of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>This</hi> has ſometimes chaſtiſed us with <hi>whips,</hi> when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment; but <hi>that</hi> would torment us with <hi>ſcorpions,</hi> whether we deſerved it or not.</p>

                  <q>And for the more perfect ſecurity and eaſe of the minds of the inhabitants of the ſaid province, it is hereby declared, that his Majeſty's ſubjects profeſſing the religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of and in the province of <hi>Quebec, may</hi> have, hold and enjoy the free exerciſe of the religion of the Church of <hi>Rome, ſubject to the King's ſupremacy,</hi> declared and eſtabliſhed by an act made in the firſt year of the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> over all the dominions and countries which then did, or thereafter ſhould belong, to the Imperial Crown of this realm; and that the clergy of the ſaid Church <hi>may</hi> hold, receive and enjoy, their accuſtomed dues and rights, <hi>with reſpect to ſuch perſons only,</hi> as ſhall profeſs the ſaid religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Provided nevertheleſs,</hi> that it ſhall be lawful for his Majeſty, his heirs and ſucceſſors, to make ſuch proviſion out of the reſt of the ſaid accuſtomed dues and rights, for the <hi>encouragement</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and for the <hi>maintenance</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> of a <hi>Proteſtant Clergy</hi> within the ſaid province, as he or they ſhall, from time to time, think neceſſary and expedient.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next clauſe of the act provides an oath of allegiance, to be taken by the Canadian Papiſts, inſtead of the oath required by the 1ſt <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The ſucceeding clauſe enacts,
<q>that all his Majeſty's Canadian ſubjects, within the province of <hi>Quebec, the religious orders and communities only excepted,</hi> may alſo hold and enjoy their property and poſſeſſions,</q>
&amp;c. The laſt clauſe provides, that the King ſhall have the power of

               <p>Thus we ſee in what manner the toleration of the Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was ſecured to the Canadians by treaty; and the act of Parliament allows them no more than, <hi>the free exerciſe of their religion, without being moleſted,</hi> in the public uſe of it, and that <hi>entire liberty</hi> in religious matters, for which they had ſtipulated.</p>
               <p>Indeed the parochial Clergy, are permitted to enjoy thoſe <hi>tithes,</hi> by which they had been always ſupported. This was propoſed in the treaty; but in was neither granted, nor rejected,

by the Britiſh General, who left it to depend upon the King's pleaſure. After thirteen years experience of the dutiful, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and good behaviour of his Canadian ſubjects, and at a time when his other American ſubjects were become turbulent, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and refractory, the King, to whoſe goodneſs the matter had been referred, thought proper, with the approbation and conſent of Parliament, to comply with the reaſonable expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and requeſts of the Canadians, in allowing the clergy to enjoy their wonted ſupport, under certain reſtrictions and limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But this indulgence by no means converts the ſtipulated toleration into an eſtabliſhment, as the Gentlemen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs are pleaſed to aſſert.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tithes</hi> in <hi>Canada</hi> are the <hi>property</hi> of the Remiſh church; and permitting a tolerated church to enjoy its own property, is far ſhort of the idea of an eſtabliſhment. If the city of New-York ſhould be conquered by the Papiſts from <hi>France,</hi> or the Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents from <hi>New-England,</hi> (which I believe in my conſcience would be much the worſt event of the two) and at the time of its ſurrender, the corporation of <hi>Trinity-Church</hi> ſhould contract for the <hi>free exerciſe of their religion,</hi> &amp;c. the confirmation of this liberty, with a permiſſion ſtill to enjoy the eſtate that belongs to them, (upon which ſome people have long caſt an envious and wiſhful eye) would not amount to what is commonly underſtood by a religious eſtabliſhment. An eſtabliſhed religion, is a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which the civil authority engages, not only to protect, but to ſupport; and a religion that is not provided for by the civil authority, but which is left to provide for itſelf, or to ſubſiſt on the proviſion it has already made, can be no more than a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated religion.</p>
               <p>Now the Popiſh religion in <hi>Canada</hi> the Government is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no engagement to provide for; it is only allowed to enjoy ſuch proviſion as it has made for itſelf, in a general way; and when this propoſition is curtailed, whenever a Papiſt embraces the Proteſtant religion; and the various religious orders and communities are entirely diſpoſſeſſed of their reſpective effects. But it evidently appears from the act, that it is the object of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to make proviſion, as faſt as the ſtate of the country will admit of it,
<q>for the <hi>encouragement</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant religion,</hi> and for the <hi>maintenance and ſupport</hi> of a <hi>Proſteſtant Clergy.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been offered, the inference is clear, that the Popiſh religion is only tolerated in <hi>Canada</hi>; and that it is meant to eſtabliſh the Proteſtant religion in that colony. If, after all, men will confound the meaning of words, and make no diſtinction between <hi>toleration</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhment,</hi> they degrade themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rank of quibblers and praters, and it is loſs of time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with them.</p>
