            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS CONCERNING <hi>Religious Societies.</hi> Humbly Offered unto GOOD MEN, in the ſeveral Towns of the Country: For the REVIVAL of DYING RELIGION.</head>
            <p>IT has been propoſed, as a Thing that might be attended with many good Conſequences, To Animate and Regulate PRIVATE MEET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS <hi>of Religious People for the Exerciſes of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Decay coming upon them, in many Places, it is thought proper to Reprint what was Publiſhed in a Treatiſe of, <hi>Eſſays to Do Good,</hi> more than Ten Years ago. Which is in ſuch Terms as theſe. —</p>
            <p>¶ IT is very certain, That where ſuch <hi>Private Meetings</hi> under a good Conduct, have been kept alive, the Chriſtians which have compoſed them,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002558_0003_0FDB6F59CD9631F8"/>
have like ſo many <hi>Coals of the Altar</hi> kept one another alive, and kept up a <hi>lively Christianity</hi> in the Neighbourhood. Such <hi>Societies</hi> have been tried, and ſtrong Engines, to uphold the <hi>Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The throwing up of ſuch <hi>Societies,</hi> has been accompanied with a Viſible <hi>Decay of Godlineſs,</hi> The leſs <hi>Love</hi> to them, the leſs <hi>Uſe</hi> of them, there has been in a Place, the leſs has <hi>Godlineſs</hi> flouriſhed there; the leſs there has been of the <hi>Kingdom of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Rules obſerved by ſome, ASSOCIATED FAMILIES may be offered on this Occaſion with ſome Advantage. They will tell us what Good may be done by ſuch <hi>Societies</hi> in a Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IT is to be propoſed, that about a <hi>Dozen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> more or leſs, of a Vicinity, agree to meet (the Men and their Wives) at each others Houſes, once in a <hi>Fortnight,</hi> or a <hi>Month,</hi> at ſuch a Time as may be agreed upon, and ſpend a convenient quantity of Time together, in the <hi>Exerciſes of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THE <hi>Exerciſes of Religion</hi> for a Meeting, are; For the Brethren to Begin and Conclude with PRAYERS in their Turns; for PSALMS to be Sung; and for SERMONS to be Repeated.</p>
            <p n="3">III. IT were deſireable, for the <hi>Miniſters</hi> now and then, to afford their Preſence at the Meeting, and pray with them, and Inſtruct them, and Exhort them, as they may ſee Occaſion.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THE <hi>Candidates of the Miniſtry</hi> may do well, to perform ſome of their <hi>First Services</hi> here; and here ſhapen and mould themſelves for further Services.</p>
            <p n="5">V. ONE ſpecial Deſign of the Meeting, ſhould be, with United <hi>Prayers,</hi> to ask the Bleſſings of

Heaven on the <hi>Family,</hi> where they are Aſſemble, as well as on the reſt: That with the wondrous Force of <hi>United Prayers, Two or Three may agree on Earth to aſk</hi> ſuch things, as are to be done for the Families, by our <hi>Father which is in the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. SUCH a Meeting ſhould look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as bound up in one <hi>Bundle of Love,</hi> and count themſelves obliged, in very cloſe, and ſtrong <hi>Bonds,</hi> to be ſerviceable unto one another.</p>
            <p>IF any One in the Society ſhall fall into <hi>Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> all the Reſt ſhould ſtudy preſently to Relieve and Support the Afflicted Perſon in all the ways imaginable.</p>
            <p>IF any ſhould fall into <hi>Temptation,</hi> the Reſt ſhould watch over him, and with the <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> with the <hi>Meekneſs of Wiſdom,</hi> endeavour to recover him.</p>
            <p>IT ſhould be like a <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> to the whole Society, that they will upon all Occaſions, lovingly <hi>Give,</hi> and as lovingly <hi>Take</hi> mutual <hi>Admonitions</hi> of any thing that they ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in one another.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. AND it is not eaſy to reckon up the <hi>good Offices,</hi> that ſuch a <hi>Society</hi> may do to many <hi>others</hi> as well as to the Members whereof it is itſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. The <hi>Prayers</hi> of ſuch well diſpoſed <hi>Societies</hi> may fetch down marvellous Favours from Heaven on their <hi>Pastors,</hi> whoſe <hi>Lives</hi> may be prolonged, and <hi>Gifts</hi> augmented, and <hi>Graces</hi> brightned, and <hi>Labours</hi> proſpered, in anſwer to the Supplications of ſuch <hi>Aſſociated Families</hi>; and the <hi>Intereſts of Religion</hi> may be mightily preſerved and promoted in the whole Flock, by their Fervent Supplications, and the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> mightily poured out upon the Riſing Generation. Yea, <hi>All the Land</hi> may fare the better for them.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>VIII. ESPECIALLY, when a <hi>Society,</hi> ſhall ſet apart, <hi>whole Days for Prayer with Fasting</hi> before the Lord, as it may be proper for them to do now and then upon ſome Occaſions: The Succeſs of ſuch <hi>Days</hi> has been ſometimes very marvellous: And the <hi>Savour</hi> of them left on the Minds of the Saints, who carried them on, has been ſuch as nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to prepare them, to <hi>ſhow forth the Death of the Lord</hi> at his Table; Yea, to <hi>meet with their own Death</hi>; when GOD pleaſes to Order it.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. IT is very ſure, the <hi>Devotions</hi> firſt, and then after them the <hi>Conferences</hi> carried on in ſuch a <hi>Society,</hi> will not only have a notable Tendency to produce the <hi>Comfort of Love</hi> in the Hearts of Good Men towards one another; But alſo their <hi>Abilities</hi> will be thereby ſharpened and quickened; they will be rendred more <hi>Able,</hi> to ſerve many valuable Intereſts.</p>
            <p n="10">X. UNEXPECTED Opportunities to <hi>Do Good,</hi> will ariſe unto ſuch a <hi>Society:</hi> But eſpecially if a Practice of this Importance were once taken up; That the <hi>Men</hi> who compoſe the <hi>Society,</hi> would now and then ſpend half an Hour together by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in conſidering on that Queſtion, <hi>What Good is there to be done?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>WHAT Contention or Variance may there be among any Neighbours, and what may be done for the healing of it?</hi>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Finally; <hi>WHAT is there to be done for the Advantage and Advancement of our Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Primitive Times of Chriſtianity, there was much uſe made of a ſaying which they aſcribed unto <hi>Matthias</hi> the Apoſtle; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. If <hi>the Neighbour of an Elect, or Godly Man Sin, the Godly Man has alſo Sinned.</hi> The Obligations of <hi>Neighbours</hi> watchfully to <hi>Admoniſh one another,</hi> were what that Saying intended. Oh! How much may <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Aſſociated</hi> in Religious Combinations, do by watchful and faithful Admonitions to prevent being <hi>Partakers in other Mens Sins!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Man that ſhall produce, and promote ſuch <hi>Societies</hi> will do an unknown deal of good in the Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>AND ſo will he, that ſhall help forward another ſort of <hi>Societies</hi>; Namely, thoſe of YOUNG MEN ASSOCIATED.</p>
            <p>THESE duely managed, have been incomparable <hi>Nurſeries</hi> to the Churches, where the faithful Paſtors have countenanced them. <hi>Young Men</hi> are hereby preſerved from very many <hi>Temptations,</hi> reſcued from the <hi>Paths of the Deſtroyer,</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>right Ways of the Lord,</hi> and prepared mightily for ſuch <hi>Religious Exerciſes</hi> as will be expected from them, when they come themſelves to be <hi>Houſholders.</hi> I will make a tender of ſome ORDERS, which have been obſerved in ſome ſuch <hi>Societies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. LET there be <hi>two Hours</hi> at a Time ſet apart; and let there be <hi>two Prayers</hi> made by the Members of the <hi>Society,</hi> in their Turns; between which let a SERMON be repeated; and there ſhould be the <hi>Singing</hi> of a PSALM annexed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002558_0007_0FDB6F608170D1F8"/>II. LET all the Members of the <hi>Society</hi> Reſolve to be <hi>Charitably watchful</hi> over one another: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Divulge one anothers <hi>Infirmities</hi>; always to <hi>inform</hi> and <hi>adviſe</hi> one another of every thing that may appear to call for an <hi>Admonition,</hi> and to <hi>take it kindly,</hi> when they are Admoniſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">III. LET all who are to be admitted, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Society,</hi> be accompanied by two or three of the reſt, unto the <hi>Minister</hi> of the Place, that they may receive his holy Counſels and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that every thing may be done with his Approbation; and ſo let their <hi>Names</hi> be added unto the <hi>Roll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. IF any Perſon thus enrolled among them, fall into a <hi>Scandalous Iniquity,</hi> Let the <hi>Rebukes</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> be diſpenſed unto him, and let them forbid him to come any more among them, until he bring ſuitable Expreſſions and Evidences of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> with him.</p>
            <p n="5">V.

               <hi>WHO</hi> ſpoke theſe Words, and of <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>why,</hi> is well known unto us. What I am immediately to endeavour, is to anſwer Three QUESTIONS upon them. Firſt, What are the <hi>Things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto our Peace</hi>? Then, What it is for us to <hi>know theſe things?</hi> And laſtly, When it may be ſaid, that <hi>a Day</hi> for that Purpoſe is vouchſafed unto us?</p>
            <p>WE are to Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHAT are the <hi>Things that belong unto our Peace:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PEACE is a very comprehenſive Word. It may in the <hi>Notation</hi> of it be ſomewhat <hi>Narrow.</hi> The Engliſh Word, <hi>Peace,</hi> as the Latin <hi>Pax,</hi> comes [<hi>a Pactione</hi>] from a Word that ſignifies, <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The Greek Word, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Connectendo,</hi>] ſtrictly taken intimates no more than a <hi>Knitting together.</hi> But in the <hi>Acceptation</hi> of it, it is <hi>exceeding Broad.</hi> It comprehends <hi>all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Good.</hi> The moſt comprehenſive Salutation the Holy Language can find, is, <hi>Peace be to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN One Word, then, Whatever Tends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Preſent and Future <hi>Welfare,</hi> is to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among <hi>the Things that belong unto our Peace.</hi>
            </p>

                   facs="unknown:002558_0012_0FDB6F6A48E15890"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>YOU ſhall hear what the chief of them are.</p>
            <p>THE Firſt is, FAITH. GOD and the <hi>Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> are in Ill Terms with each other. As the <hi>Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt GOD,</hi> ſo, <hi>GOD is angry with the Wicked every Day.</hi> Yea, ſuch is His <hi>Anger</hi> as to <hi>Swear in His Wrath against him,</hi> [Heb. III. 18.] if he continue ſo. The <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer,</hi> if he continue ſuch, is indeed as ſure of <hi>Damnation,</hi> and of a <hi>Wrath unto the Uttermoſt,</hi> as if he were already faſt bound in the dark Fetters and impriſoned in the <hi>Tophet ordained of old.</hi> When CHRIST is offered, then a <hi>Peace</hi> is offered. The offer of a CHRIST, is an offer of <hi>Peace,</hi> to unbelieving Rebels. When a CHRIST was born, the <hi>Morning-Stars that ſung for Joy,</hi> triumphed in the mention of, <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> upon it. Our JESUS is indeed, Iſai. IX. 6. <hi>The Prince of Peace.</hi> And He is called, Eph. II. 14. <hi>Our Peace.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, I will not ſay, <hi>When the Aſſyrian comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Land,</hi> but, when the Almighty comes down in the black Garments of His Vengeance, with the Keen Darts of Juſtice in His Hand, ready to ſtrike and tread us down in the Place of Dragons. <hi>Then! This Man (who is more than a Man) ſhall be our Peace</hi>! Now by <hi>Faith</hi> it is, that we get an Intereſt in a CHRIST, and in the <hi>Peace</hi> which He has wrought; an Intereſt in <hi>Peace with GOD</hi>; For, Rom. V. 1. <hi>Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</hi> This infers <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi>; For, <hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>Good Conſcience</hi> go hand in hand. Moſt certain it is, the <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of GOD for us, would have been Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002558_0013_0FDB6F6BC2044FC8"/>
His Wrath againſt us Irremediable and Unappeaſable; and the <hi>Never-Dying Worm,</hi> would be an <hi>Ever-gnawing</hi> one: But, FAITH, <hi>Faith,</hi> is that which brings all to <hi>Peace</hi>; And it may be ſaid of the Believer, as it was of <hi>Solomon,</hi> He <hi>has Peace on all ſides round about him.</hi> If a Soul become in this way a <hi>Son of Peace,</hi> then <hi>Peace will reſt upon it.</hi> But if it be not ſo, then <hi>ſhall be heard a Voice of Trembling and Fear, and not of Peace.</hi> I conclude this Article as <hi>Peter</hi> concludes his Epiſtle: <hi>Peace be with all them that are in CHRIST JESUS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Second is, REPENTANCE. 'Tis our <hi>League</hi> with Sin, that produces a <hi>War</hi> between GOD and Man. <hi>Your Iniquities have ſeparated!</hi> Indeed, the Sinner bleſſes himſelf, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall have Peace.</hi> But what an Alarum of <hi>War</hi> has GOD ſounded againſt him? [See Deut. XXIX 19, 20.] Where <hi>Joram</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Jehu, Is it Peace, Jehu?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>What Peace as long as the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms &amp; the Witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> So may it be ſaid unto the Impenitent Sinner, <hi>What Peace, as long as thy Indulged Impieties are ſo many?</hi> And that Peal may be rung in his Ears; Iſai XLVIII. 22. <hi>There is no Peace, ſaith my GOD, unto the Wicked.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unjuſt man his thoughts</hi>; and All ſhall be well. But, <hi>If be turn not,</hi> the Almighty hath <hi>what a Sword, and bent a Bow; and prepared for him the Instruments of Death.</hi> Every Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinner, is a Deſperado of that Number, [Act. V. 39.] They are <hi>found even to fight againſt GOD</hi>; Yea, That <hi>ſtretch out their hand againſt GOD, and strengthen themſelves

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
against the Almighty, and run upon Him, even upon His Neck, upon the thick Boſses of His Buckler.</hi> Alas, <hi>The way of Peace they have not known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Sinner <hi>Fights</hi> againſt Heaven, ſo long as he <hi>Sins</hi> againſt the GOD of Heaven. The <hi>Arms</hi> of his Rebellion are the <hi>Weapons of Unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Now <hi>Repentance,</hi> this lays down thoſe <hi>Arms</hi> of Rebellion; and like the Man in the Goſpel, the Sinner ſeeing that he cannot grapple with the Almighty, and <hi>is not ſtronger than He,</hi> he humbles himſelf, and he <hi>deſires Conditions of Peace.</hi> One <hi>Sin</hi> unrepented of will iſſue in the Confuſion of the Soul. <hi>Had Zimri Peace, who ſlew his Maſter?</hi> So, Shall that Man have <hi>Peace,</hi> who tranſgreſſes the Law, and who tramples on the Authority of his <hi>Maſter,</hi> a <hi>Master</hi> that is his <hi>Maker</hi> too, and his GOD? He alone is at <hi>Peace</hi> with GOD, who is at <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Third is, HOLINESS. An <hi>Holy Life.</hi> It is ſaid, Prov. XVI. 7. <hi>When a Mans Ways pleaſe the Lord, his Enemies ſhall be at Peace with him.</hi> Yea, Now not only <hi>the Hoſts of the Lord,</hi> but the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> Himſelf, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Friend; and his <hi>Exceeding great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> We read, Rom. VIII. 6. <hi>To be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally-minded is Peace.</hi> Yea, all the ways of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> are <hi>paths of Peace</hi>; And at Laſt, <hi>Behold the upright man, for the End of that man is peace. Peace,</hi> is a ſilken Thread, ſtrung thro' the Actions of an <hi>Holy Life.</hi> Tho' without a Reliance on the Righteouſneſs of our SAVIOUR
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002558_0015_0FDB6F704E45A7F0"/>
for our Acceptance with GOD, our moſt <hi>Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Services</hi> will give no other <hi>Peace,</hi> than that which will be <hi>like the Crackling of Thorns under a Pot,</hi> and they who <hi>warm themſelves with the ſparks of their own kindling</hi> muſt <hi>lie down in Sorrow:</hi> Alas, the Ragged and Sordid Garments of our own <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> will never ſhelter our naked Souls from the Storms of Divine Vengeance; Yet I may ſay, The <hi>Peace</hi> of a Believer, ariſes not only from his <hi>Justification,</hi> but from his <hi>Sanctification</hi> alſo. Thus we ſee the Lord owning the <hi>Generation of them that ſeek Him,</hi> with many Soul quieting Diſpenſations of His Providence. The <hi>Light of</hi> GOD <hi>ſhines on the Tabernacle</hi> of the Godly Man. The preſerving of his <hi>Garments undefiled,</hi> keeps him from the Horrors and Sorrowful Reflections of a Guilty Mind. And Laſtly, <hi>A Good Days Work</hi> meets with a <hi>Good Evenings Wages.</hi> And he ſees the Bleſſing which the Saints of GOD in the ancient Days highly Prized; Even, To <hi>go to the Grave in Peace.</hi> Of all this I may ſay, <hi>This is the Heritage of the Servants of the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHO can expreſs the Sweet Quiet of Heart, and raviſhing Comfort of Soul, which a <hi>Life led in all Godlineſs &amp; Honeſty</hi> is attended withal: There is a <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> in the <hi>Work</hi> it ſelf; ſuch, that the Servants of CHRIST have thought their very <hi>Work</hi> to be their <hi>Wages,</hi> There<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a Joyful <hi>Serenity of Soul,</hi> that flows in and from a Courſe of Obedience to GOD. A <hi>Conſcience void of Offence</hi> towards GOD and towards Man, how <hi>peaceable</hi> is it! Let the Chriſtian, who thro' Careleſneſs has fallen from

GOD, and thro' an <hi>Evil Heart of Unbelief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted</hi> from Him, declare how much Salt Water, and how deep Humiliations it has coſt him, to obtain a recovery. Verily, Iſai. XXXII. 17. <hi>The work of Righteouſneſs, it ſhall be peace.</hi> To be daily beating down our Corruptions, and ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <hi>Sins that eaſily beſet us</hi>; Daily Endeavouring to <hi>Grow in the Grace &amp; Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> getting on <hi>from Strength to Strength</hi>; Daily maintaining an Intimate <hi>Communion</hi> with GOD; Shall not the <hi>Fruit</hi> of this be, <hi>Peace, Peace?</hi> And, <hi>Is not this to know me, ſaith the Lord!</hi> To <hi>Endure Hardneſs as good Soldiers of Jeſus CHRIST</hi>; and <hi>Work out our own Salvation</hi>; and be always doing the Will and Work of our Heavenly <hi>Father</hi>; Is not this the <hi>way of Peace?</hi> Yea, <hi>Great Peace have they</hi> (O Lord,) <hi>that Love thy Law!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are to conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHAT it is for us to <hi>KNOW the Things that belong to our Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now,</p>
            <p>Firſt; THE <hi>Nature</hi> of the Things; we muſt have a Right <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>That.</hi> So we read about, <hi>Knowing the Grace of GOD. Ignorance</hi> is indeed the <hi>Mother of Deſtruction.</hi> The <hi>Blind</hi> fall into the <hi>Ditch.</hi> The way to Heaven is a <hi>Narrow way</hi>; And tho' it be ſaid, <hi>The way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring men, tho' Fools, ſhall not err therein</hi>; yet <hi>fooliſh</hi> Man, who is <hi>born like the wild Aſſes Colt,</hi> muſt have a CHRIST for his <hi>Prophet,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002558_0017_0FDB6F764F7CD800"/>
in that way be <hi>made Wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> or elſe he will <hi>Err,</hi> and be for ever a Stranger to the <hi>way of peace.</hi> O Ignorant Creature, The <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of thy <hi>Mind,</hi> will bring thee down to the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of the <hi>Pit. Ignorance,</hi> Ah, Bloody Cur-throat unto Millions of Precious and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls! How ſhould People be Saved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Knowing</hi> the way of Salvation; or, Enjoy <hi>Peace</hi> without <hi>Knowing</hi> the way to the <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?</hi> The <hi>Goſpel of Peace</hi> is therefore ſuch an ineſtimable Jewel; Becauſe we have the means of <hi>Knowledge</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>IT was once preſcribed, <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with GOD, and be at peace.</hi> Even ſo, Let People <hi>Acquaint</hi> themſelves with <hi>Faith,</hi> and with <hi>Repentance,</hi> and with <hi>Holineſs,</hi> if they would <hi>ſeek peace and purſue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in <hi>Faith.</hi> People often delude themſelves with an <hi>Historical Faith,</hi> as if it were enough to yield ſome Kind of <hi>Aſſent</hi> unto the Truth; or with a <hi>preſumptuous Faith,</hi> taking it for granted that their Sins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether ever they have with a diſtreſſed Soul ſought for it, or no; or with an <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Faith,</hi> receiving a CHRIST in ſome of His Offices, but not in all of them. So, forſooth, now they have Commenced <hi>Believers.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>REPENTANCE</hi> has <hi>Myſteries</hi> in it. Hence People fancy, and harbour Conceits, that now and then, a, <hi>Lord, Forgive me</hi>! Or, A few ſleight <hi>Convictions</hi> of what they have done when they have Sinned; Or the <hi>Reluctancies</hi> of an

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOLINESS</hi> has <hi>Myſteries</hi> in it. Hence People take and miſtake, a few <hi>Formal Duties,</hi> or ſuch Things as are the meer <hi>Bark</hi> or <hi>Shell</hi> of Religion; A <hi>Partial Obedience</hi>; or ſome notable Works done, but then vainly truſted in, (and ſo, but <hi>Splendid Sins</hi> after all!) ——To be the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Godlineſs which has the Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY hear much about <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> who never arrive to any other, than a Superficial <hi>Knowledge</hi> of theſe Things; They have no real Inſight into them.

            <p>Secondly, THE Things are to be <hi>Prized,</hi> Valued, Eſteemed; There muſt be ſeen an <hi>Excellency</hi> in them. To <hi>Know</hi> is to know the <hi>Worth</hi> of them. <hi>Faith</hi> is to be Prized, as, 2 Pet. I. 1. <hi>Precious Faith. Repentance</hi> is to be Prized, as, 2 Cor.

peace.</hi> They who have ſtudied the <hi>Style of the Scripture,</hi> tell us, <hi>Words of Knowledge imply Affection.</hi> So when our SAVIOUR ſays to ſome, <hi>I never knew you,</hi> He means, <hi>I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver liked you.</hi> Which is what He will ſay to them, who <hi>know not</hi> what we are now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. <hi>Reprobate Silver, the Lord has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, THE Things are to be <hi>Cloſed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. To <hi>know Sin,</hi> [Iſaiah LIX. 12.] is, to <hi>be</hi> a Sinner; To <hi>know the only True GOD, and JESUS CHRIST whom He hath ſent,</hi> is to <hi>Cleave</hi> unto Him. To <hi>know Faith,</hi> is to <hi>be</hi> a Believer. To <hi>know Repentance,</hi> is to <hi>be</hi> a Penitent. To <hi>know Holineſs</hi> is to <hi>be</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and <hi>Holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi> 'Tis an <hi>Experimental Knowledge</hi> in theſe things, that is the only <hi>profitable Knowledge.</hi> They are like the <hi>New Name</hi> whereof we read, Rev. II. 17. <hi>No man knows it but he that HAS it.</hi> The Chriſtian muſt have [an, <hi>Intus Exiſtens</hi>] a, <hi>Something within</hi>; Some Divine Sparks of a <hi>Supernatural Knowledge,</hi> that give him other Viſions of theſe Heavenly Things, than what thoſe have, who can only talk like <hi>Parrots</hi> of them. <hi>Regeneration</hi> muſt be <hi>known</hi> and <hi>felt</hi> by us, in another manner than by a <hi>Nicodemus, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> muſt be <hi>known</hi> with a ſenſible <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of thoſe things. It muſt be an <hi>Impreſſive Knowledge.</hi> There muſt be ſuch an <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of thoſe things upon us, as to give us a very <hi>Lively Apprehenſion</hi> of them. To <hi>Know</hi> them, is to <hi>Taste</hi> them; to <hi>Taſte</hi> theſe <hi>powers of

the World to come</hi>; To <hi>Live</hi> them, and ſo have the <hi>Life of GOD</hi> within us.</p>
            <p>WE are to Conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">III. WHEN may it be ſaid, That we have <hi>OUR DAY Vouchſafed us to Know the Things belonging to our Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE true and proper Limits of our DAY, will be found in the <hi>Motions</hi> of the Holy SPIRIT upon us. But then there are ſome Other Things, which ſo far make <hi>Our Day,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Our Day</hi> is <hi>done,</hi> when they are gone; tho' it may alſo be <hi>done</hi> before it.</p>
            <p>Firſt. <hi>DAY</hi> Laſts as long as <hi>Life</hi> laſts.</p>
            <p>IN this, the Children of GOD have <hi>Their Day.</hi> They are therefore ſo inſtructed; John IX. 4. <hi>I muſt Work while it is Day; the Night comes in which no Man can Work.</hi> Our Time of <hi>Living,</hi> is our Time for <hi>Working.</hi> As the Fourth Commandment has it, <hi>Six Days ſhalt thou Work and Reſt the Seventh</hi>: So GOD ſends us into the World, and ſays, <hi>I have ſome Work for thee to do; ſome Glory to be brought about by thee in the World; Thou haſt but a little Time to do it in. What thy Hand finds to do, do it with thy might. I have betrusted thee with ſome Talents. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them Faithfully, Prudently, Diligently. And when I ſend my Meſſenger DEATH to call thee, thou ſhall find a Crown reſerved for thee.</hi>

            <p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>YEA, and in this they lie ſtill <hi>Dead in their Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> have <hi>Their Day</hi> too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> GOD is all their Days Calling on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Stretching out His Hands unto them all the Day long.</hi> Earneſtly Calling, <hi>How long, ye Fools; Will you hate Knowledge?</hi> But when the Term of <hi>Life</hi> is juſt Expiring, and the laſt Sand in the Glaſs is running, and He has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued inviting them into His Vineyard, until the <hi>Eleventh Hour</hi> be out, and the <hi>Laſt Hour</hi> be upon them; and their <hi>Destruction comes as a Whirlwind,</hi> GOD then laughs <hi>at their Destruction,</hi> and leaves them in the Dimneſs of the Anguiſh of Death, and the Griping Talons of a dreadful Eternity. <hi>The Living, The Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> They may <hi>Praiſe</hi> GOD, and get into <hi>Peace</hi> with GOD. <hi>But they that go down into the Pit cannot Hope</hi> for any more. The <hi>Things of our Peace</hi> have taken an Eternal Farewell of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THE <hi>Means of Grace,</hi> help to make <hi>Our Day</hi> for us. The Old World, whoſe <hi>Foundation was overflown with a Flood,</hi> enjoyed a <hi>Day,</hi> while they had <hi>Noah,</hi> a <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Righteouſneſs</hi> among them. This <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was no ſooner over, but their <hi>Day</hi> was done. Cries to Heaven for Succour were now to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Purpoſe. The <hi>Ark</hi> being now ſhut, the Ear of GOD was alſo ſhut upon them. <hi>Sodom</hi> had a Day, whilſt <hi>Righteous Lot</hi> was beating his Teſtimonies there. But when he is gone, their <hi>Day</hi> goes with him. The <hi>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</hi> ſeizes them. They ſadly found,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002558_0023_0FDB6F819B4A8E98"/>
when the <hi>Mouth</hi> of GOD leaves off <hi>Speaking,</hi> his <hi>Ear</hi> leaves off <hi>Hearing</hi> too. When the <hi>Means of Grace</hi> are gone from a People, <hi>Their Day</hi> is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er with them. It is often ſo, that upon the Death of an Excellent Miniſter, the People that had his <hi>Light for a Seaſon,</hi> but would not be brought home to GOD, have <hi>Their Day</hi> brought unto a Period. GOD leaves them under an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Obduration. He Reſolves, <hi>They ſhall never taſte of my Supper! Never Enter into my Reſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>OUR Day</hi> is Enlightened, when it is accompanied with many <hi>Opportunities</hi> to make ſure of <hi>The Things belonging to our Peace.</hi> A <hi>Peaceable Time</hi> with us, and a Proſperous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, makes a <hi>Day</hi> to ſhine upon us. A Day of <hi>Proſperity,</hi> Oh! how much is it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved with us! We generally allow, that <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> has a <hi>Voice</hi> in it: GOD <hi>Speaks</hi> to us by our <hi>Afflictions.</hi> But in <hi>Proſperity</hi> our <hi>Fat Hearts</hi> are inſenſible of any thing <hi>ſpoke</hi> to us: As if <hi>Mercy</hi> were a very <hi>Dumb Thing</hi> indeed! Whereas, Jer. XXII. 21. <hi>I ſpake to thee in thy Proſperity, ſaith the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Still Voice</hi> of <hi>Proſperity</hi> is not ſo plainly heard, as the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the Tempeſt and the Whirlwind of <hi>Calamity:</hi> Yet there is the <hi>Voice</hi> of GOD in it And what is the <hi>Voice</hi> but This; <hi>Oh! That this man would now know the Things of his Peace, at least in this his Day!</hi> What but This; <hi>Oh! That this man were wiſe, and would conſider his latter End.</hi> How pittyable the Caſe of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</hi> Lam. I. 7. <hi>Jeruſalem remembred in the days of her Affliction and of her Miſeries,

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
all her pleaſant things that ſhe had in the days of old!</hi> So it is; Many a Man lives in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>pleaſant things;</hi> If he will <hi>Now</hi> Turn and Live unto GOD, there ſhall be nothing to diſturb him, nothing to divert him. He loiters the Time away; His Luſts like noiſome Inſects, do but multiply by the Sune-ſhine. At laſt, a provoked GOD comes with heavy Blows, with bitter, blaſting, ruining Strokes of His Indignation; Strips him of all his Comfortable Advantages; and now the poor Man cannot Serve GOD as once he could; His Way is every where <hi>hedged up with Thorns</hi>; and he hath nothing left, but a grievous Reflection on his <hi>Expired Opportunities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Mans <hi>Proſperous Time</hi> is often his <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Time.</hi> If he be not <hi>NOW</hi> brought home to GOD, he ſhall never be ſo. <hi>Saul</hi> Exalted and Victorious, falling into a Remarkable Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, never ſees a <hi>Good Day</hi> after it.</p>
            <p>HENCE 'tis, that <hi>Early Religion</hi> is to be Commended unto us. <hi>Children,</hi> If ever you would Serve GOD with Comfort, <hi>Begin Betimes</hi> to do it; <hi>Betimes,</hi> before the <hi>Evil Days come,</hi> whereof you will ſay, <hi>I have no pleaſure in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. THE Holy SPIRIT of GOD at work upon the Soul; This conſtitutes <hi>Our Day</hi> in the faireſt and brighteſt Appearance of it. The other Circumſtances give <hi>Time</hi> to us; <hi>This</hi> does inveſt us with <hi>Opportunity.</hi> The <hi>Opportunity</hi> to approach and addreſs the <hi>Maſter of the Houſe</hi> muſt be before, Luk. 13.25. <hi>He hath
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002558_0025_0FDB6F87DBBBF5D8"/>
riſen up, and ſhut to the Door.</hi> Men may ſit under the Goſpel all their Days; But they will not come into the <hi>Peace of GOD,</hi> except <hi>they ſeek Him while He may be found,</hi> and <hi>call upon Him while He is near.</hi> There is a Time when our SAVIOUR ſays. Rev. III. 20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door and knock.</hi> The Soul which <hi>Then</hi> does <hi>Open</hi> to Him, is an Happy Soul. But, thy Delays, O Dilatory Soul, may render thee like <hi>Eſau,</hi> who <hi>Afterwards,</hi> when he came, and would have <hi>Inherited the Bleſſing,</hi> miſs'd of it, tho' he <hi>Sought it carefully with Tears.</hi> We ſhould, as we ſay, <hi>Strike while the Iron is hot.</hi> The Godly themſelves may pay dear for their Neglect of doing ſo. <hi>My Beloved has withdrawn Himſelf and is gone!</hi> — may be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But this is that which above all iſſues in the <hi>Perdition of Ungodly Men.</hi> The SPIRIT of GOD viſits them with His <hi>Motions.</hi> He does it in <hi>Sermons</hi>; He does it in <hi>Troubles</hi>; He does it in various <hi>Methods.</hi> He ſtirs up <hi>Affections</hi> in them, for the Things that are <hi>Holy and Juſt and Good.</hi> They have ſuch an <hi>Opportunity</hi> to enter the <hi>Strait Gate,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had for an Entrance into the <hi>Land of Promiſe.</hi> They neglect it; And now, when they come <hi>too Late,</hi> and <hi>Weep</hi> unto the LORD, the LORD will not hearken to them. The <hi>Door</hi> is now ſhut, and if they come with the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, Open to me!</hi> the cry avails nothing; He anſwers, <hi>I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR this Cauſe it is, that the Bible does inſiſt ſo much upon <hi>preſent Obedience.</hi> Thus, Eccleſ. XII. 1. <hi>Remember NOW thy Creator.</hi>
               <pb n="17"
                   facs="unknown:002558_0026_0FDB6F892AB4E068"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus, Jer. XXV. 5. <hi>Turn ye NOW every One from his Evil Way.</hi> Thus, 2 Cor. VI. 2. <hi>Behold, NOW is the Acceptable Time, NOW is the Day of Salvation.</hi> q. d. This is all the <hi>Day</hi> you are ſure of; Loſe this NOW, and you ſhall never have another. Look into the Third Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; 'Tis urged there, <hi>To DAY if you will hear His Voice.</hi> And over and over again it comes, <hi>To Day! To Day! To Day!</hi> As if the taking of, <hi>To Day,</hi> were that which <hi>Eternity</hi> depended on.</p>
            <p>AND now, My Brethren; Will you <hi>Know the Things of your Peace?</hi> O <hi>Unregenerates,</hi> Defer not a Moment the <hi>Things that Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Salvation.</hi> Yea, Let none remain at all Unacquainted with the Things which muſt be done by all that would be <hi>Saved.</hi> If you do <hi>Know</hi> ſomething of them, Take that Advice, Hoſea VI. 3. <hi>Follow on to Know.</hi> Perhaps, My Friend, Thy <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> may be yet but at the beſt, as a <hi>Grain of Muſtard Seed.</hi> Yea, The beſt of us all have need of <hi>more Grace</hi> than we have. You are not yet come to <hi>Perfection.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, You need more Weanedneſs from the World, more Heavenly-Mindedneſs, more <hi>Fervency of Spirit</hi> in <hi>Serving</hi> the Lord; a more <hi>United Heart</hi> in <hi>Fearing</hi> of His Name; a more Self-Abaſing, and CHRIST-Exalting Diſpoſition. May not the beſt of us Complain, <hi>My Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! My Leanneſs</hi>! Yea, May they not come into the Herd with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Lean Kine; which though they had <hi>Eaten much,</hi> it could

not be known, that they had <hi>Eaten at all</hi>! Truly, When our GOD comes to look upon us, He may ſay, <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens! Is this the people whom I fed ſo daintily? Fed with my Word and Sacraments; yea, Fed with my Son! Are theſe the Perſons, whom I made to ſit down at my Table, ſit down at a Feast of Fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well-refined. O</hi> Ephraim. <hi>What ſhall I do unto thee?</hi> O Judah, <hi>What ſhall I do unto thee?</hi> Oh! That the <hi>Things of our Peace</hi> were better <hi>Known</hi> among us! But then, The <hi>Day of our Peace</hi> muſt be ſo too. In the <hi>Day</hi> for that Purpoſe beſtowed upon us, Let us Preſs after the fulleſt <hi>Knowledge</hi> of theſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Things.</hi> The Time we now ſpend in the Exerciſes of <hi>Religion,</hi> be aſſured, O Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler towards another World, It will be <hi>no grief of Mind unto thee another day. Religion,</hi> 'Tis thy Buſineſs, Make it ſo; and Mind not thy <hi>Inn</hi> more than thy <hi>Home.</hi> Soul Bound for Heaven, In thy <hi>Opportunities</hi> to <hi>Know the Things of thy Peace,</hi> and make ſure of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>Peace,</hi> What a <hi>Price</hi> is there put <hi>into thy Hand?</hi> Oh! Let it not be in the <hi>Hand of a Fool.</hi> My Friends, Our Formation this Day into a RELIGIOUS SOCIETY brings the <hi>Things of our Peace</hi> near unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gives us a <hi>Day</hi> to <hi>know</hi> thoſe Things; and furniſhes us with Uncommon <hi>Advantages</hi> for the <hi>getting</hi> and the <hi>doing</hi> of <hi>Good.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> of old wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Oh! that they were Wiſe</hi>: Give my Strammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tongue leave to ſay; Oh!

That the <hi>Day of our Peace</hi> were duly perceived and obſerved with us, and highly accounted of, and ſo husbanded, that we may give a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it! Oh! That we may to Improve our Ineſtimable <hi>Opportunities,</hi> to Converſe with our SAVIOUR, and become <hi>Full of Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>build up</hi> our ſelves and one another in the <hi>moſt holy Faith,</hi> as that when we are to be taken from theſe <hi>Opportunities,</hi> we may be found <hi>ſo doing,</hi> and hear it ſaid, <hi>Well-done, Good and Faithful Servant, Enter into the Joy of thy LORD.</hi>
