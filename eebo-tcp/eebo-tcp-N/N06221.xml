            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WHEREAS the King's Pleaſure has been ſignified to us by Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> one of his principal Secretaries of State, that, upon Conſideration of the ſeveral Advices which have been received relating to the ſuppoſed Intention of the <hi>French</hi> to attack the Iſland of <hi>Minorca,</hi> a Squadron of <hi>Ten</hi> Ships of the Line do forthwith ſail for the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> under your Command; and whereas we have appointed the <hi>Ramilies, Buckingham, Culloder, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Revenge, Lancaſter, Trident, Intrepid, Kingſton</hi> and <hi>Defiance,</hi> for this Service. You are hereby required and directed, immediately to put to Sea with ſuch of them as are ready (leaving Orders for the Reſt to follow you as ſoon as poſſible) and proceed with the utmoſt Expedition to <hi>Gibraltar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon your Arrival there, you are to enquire whether any <hi>French</hi> Squadron is come through the <hi>Straits;</hi> and if there is, to inform your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as poſſible, of their Number and Force, and if any Part of them were Tranſports: And as 'tis probable they may be deſigned for <hi>North-America,</hi> and as his Majeſty's Ships the <hi>Grafton, Stirling-Caſtle, Fougueux, Nottingham, Litchfield, Centurion, Norwich, Succeſs</hi> and <hi>Vulture</hi> Sloop, are either at, or going to <hi>Halifax,</hi> and are to cruize off <hi>Louisbourg</hi> and the Mouth of the River <hi>St. Lawrance,</hi> you are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to take the Soldiers out of ſo many Ships of your Squadron, as, together with the Ships at and going to <hi>Halifax,</hi> will make a Force ſuperior to the ſaid <hi>French</hi> Squadron (replacing them with Landmen, or ordinary Seamen from your other Ships) and then detach them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Rear Admiral <hi>Weſt,</hi> directing him to make the beſt of his Way off <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> and taking the aforementioned Ships, which he may expect to find there, under his Command, to cruize off the ſaid Place, and the Entrance of the Gulf of <hi>St. Lawrance,</hi> and uſe his utmoſt Endeavours to intercept and ſeize the aforeſaid <hi>French</hi> Ships, or any other Ships belonging to the <hi>French,</hi> that may be bound to, or returning from that Part of <hi>North-America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If, upon your Arrival at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> you ſhall not gain Intelligence of a <hi>French</hi> Squadron having paſſed the <hi>Straits,</hi> you are then to go on, without a Moment's Loſs of Time, to <hi>Minorca;</hi> or, if in Conſequence of ſuch Intelligence, you ſhall detach Rear Admiral <hi>Weſt,</hi> as before

directed, you are to uſe equal Expedition in repairing thither with the Ships which ſhall remain with you; and if you find any Attack made upon that Iſland by the <hi>French,</hi> you are to uſe all poſſible Means in your Power, for its Relief: If you find to ſuch Attack make, you are to proceed off <hi>Toulon,</hi> and ſtation your Squadron in the beſt Manner you ſhall be able, for preventing say <hi>French</hi> Ships getting out of that Port or for intercepting and ſeizing any that may get out; and you are to exert the utmoſt Vigilance therein, and in protecting <hi>Minorca</hi> and <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> from any hoſtile Attempt.</p>
               <p>You are alſo to be very vigilant for Protecting the Trade of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Subjects from being moleſted, either by the <hi>French,</hi> or by Crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers from <hi>

               <p>You are likewiſe to be as attentive as poſſble to the intercepting and ſeizing, as well Ships of War and Privateers, as Merchant Ships belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>French,</hi> where ever they may be met with, within the Limits of your Command: But in Purſuance of the King's Order in Council, you are not to ſuffer any of the Ships in your Squadron to take any <hi>French</hi> Veſſels out of any Port belonging to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, upon any Pretence; nor to moleſt, detain, or impriſon the Perſons of any of the Subjects of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; and alſo, not to ſeize and detain any <hi>French</hi> Ship or Veſſel whatſoever which they ſhall meet with in the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas, bound from one Port to another in thoſe Seas, or to or from any Ports of <hi>Egypt,</hi> having any Effects of <hi>Turks</hi> on board.</p>
               <p>Upon your Arrival in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> you are to take under your Command, his Majeſty's Ships and Veſſels, <hi>Princeſs-Louiſa, Portland, Deptford, Cheſterfield, Dolphin, Phoenix, Experiment,</hi> and <hi>Fortune Sloop,</hi> which are at preſent there.</p>
               <p>If any <hi>French</hi> Ships of War ſhould ſail from <hi>Toulon,</hi> and eſcape your Squadron, and proceed out of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> you are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſend, or repair yourſelf, to <hi>England,</hi> with a proportionable Part of the Ships under your Command; obſerving, that you are never to keep more Ships in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> than ſhall be neceſſary for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting the Services recommended to you.</p>

               <p>THIS comes to you by Expreſs from hence by Way of <hi>Madrid,</hi> recommended to Sir <hi>Benjamin Keene,</hi> his Majeſty's Miniſter at that Place, to be forwarded with the utmoſt Expedition.</p>
               <p>I arrived here with the Squadron under my Command the 2d Inſtant, in the Afternoon, after a tedious Paſſage of Twenty-ſeven Days, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by contrary Winds and Calms, and was extremely concerned to hear from Captain <hi>Edgecumbe,</hi> who I found here with the <hi>Princeſs-Louiſa,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> Sloop, That he was obliged to retire from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norca,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> having landed on that Iſland, by all Accounts from thirteen to fifteen thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>They failed from <hi>Toulon</hi> the 10th of laſt Month, with about 160, or 200 Sail of Tranſports, eſcorted by 13 Sail of Men of War, how many of the Line I have not been able to learn with any Certainty.</p>
               <p>If I had been ſo happy to have arrived at <hi>Mahon</hi> before the <hi>French</hi> had landed, I flatter myſelf, I ſhould have been able to have prevented their getting a Footing on that Iſland; but as it has ſo unfortunately turned out, I am firmly of Opinion, from the great Force they have landed, and the Quantity of Proviſions, Stores, and Ammunition of all Kinds they brought with them, that the throwing Men into the Caſtle, will only enable it to hold out but a little Time longer, and add to the Numbers that muſt fall into the Enemy's Hands; for the Garriſon in Time will be obliged to ſurrender, unleſs a ſufficient Number of Men could be landed to diſlodge the <hi>French,</hi> or raiſe the Siege: However, I am determined to ſail up to <hi>Minorca</hi> with the Squadron, where I ſhall be a better Judge of the Situation of Affairs there, and will give General <hi>Blakeney</hi> all the Aſſiſtance he ſhall require, though I am afraid all Communication will be cut off between us; as is the Opinion of the chief Engineer of this Garriſon (who has ſerved in that Iſland) and that of the other Officers of the Artillery who are acquainted with the Situation of the Harbour: For if the Enemy have erected Batteries on the two Shores near the Entrance of the Harbour (an Advantage ſcarce to be ſuppoſed they have neglected) it will render it impoſſible for our Boats to have a Paſſage to the Sally Port of the Garriſon.</p>

The Admiral, however, to vindicate his own Conduct, and to ſtop the Torrent of Calumny, which came pouring upon him from every Quarter, thought proper to publiſh ſome Pamphlets, wherein he affirms that the Letter publiſhed in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> as coming from him, was ſo altered, mutilated and curtailed, by thoſe who conveyed it to the Preſs, that a quite different Turn was given to his true Senſe and Meaning, with a Deſign, as he ſuppoſes, to bring upon him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of his King and Country, and the general Odium for the Loſs of <hi>Minorca;</hi> which, he ſays, ought rather to be attributed to thoſe who had the Direction or the Expedition, than to him who was only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as an Inſtrument in the Execution of it. But whether the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral was deficient in his Duty or not, yet I think, to ſpeak impartially, his Letter ought to have been given to the Public in his own identical Words, for which only he could be anſwerable, and the doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, was certainly inconſiſtent with that Honour and Juſtice which is due to an Officer of ſuch Diſtinction, whether guilty or innocent of the Crime laid to his Charge, ſince, at that Time, it was the only authentic Information the Public could have of ſuch an important Tranſaction, of which he was the ſole Manager.</p>
            <p>Upon Receipt of the Admiral's Letter, and other Advices from the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> that the Garriſon at Fort <hi>St. Philip</hi>'s had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and was in the utmoſt Danger of falling into the Hands of the Enemy, the Government thought fit to ſend out another Squadron, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Sir <hi>Edward Hawke,</hi> with a Commiſſion to examine into the Conduct and Behaviour of the Admirals and Officers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Cauſes of the ill Succeſs of that Expedition. Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> purſuant to his Inſtructions, when he came to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and had got what Intelligence he could by Enquiry, delivered to Admiral <hi>Byng,</hi> the Order for his Suſpenſion, and ſent him home Priſoner in the <hi>Antelope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Admiral's Arrival at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> an Order was ſent to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Oſborne</hi> to put him under Arreſt, and for his Removal to <hi>London;</hi> but he was not got far on his Way, before his Guard were met by a Meſſenger from the Admiralty, with an Order to convey him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Ship. In a few Days after, a ſtrong Detachment of the Guards brought him away, and lodged him in the Houſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Greenwich</hi> Hoſpital, where he was ſtrictly confined, under a ſtrong Guard, till the Time of his Trial.</p>

As ſoon as the Admiral was made acquainted with the Nature of the Charge againſt him, as contained in the Warrant of the Lords of the Admiralty to their Marſhal, he writes to Mr. <hi>Cleveland,</hi> their Lordſhip's Secretary, deſiring the Liberty of ſending for ſuch a Number of Witneſſes as he judged neceſſary for his Defence, and gave a Liſt of Thirty-ſeven, with their Names; which their Lordſhips complied with. This Letter was dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4, and he was further told by the Secretary, that they would be ſent for Home in the <hi>Colchester.</hi> The Admiral how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, about a Month afterwards, <hi>September</hi> 6, deſires, in a Letter to the Secretary, Permiſſion of their Lordſhips, to ſend for another Set of Witneſſes from the Fleet, to the Number of Thirty-one. But their Lordſhips conſidering how detrimental to the public Service, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſuch a Number of Officers from their Duty might be, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that Mr. <hi>Byng</hi>'s Deſign was only to gain Time and delay his Trial, did not think fit to comply with his Requeſt; and acquainted him, that as ſoon as the Witneſſes already ſent for ſhould come over, they intended to bring on his Trial, which they ſaw no Reaſon to poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone any longer.</p>
            <p>The Witneſſes being all arrived and in Readineſs, the Trial was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to come on on <hi>Monday, December</hi> 27, on Board the <hi>St. George,</hi> lying in <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Harbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 23, the Admiral arrived at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in a Coach and Six, guarded by a Party of fifty Horſe, and went directly to Mr. <hi>Hutchins</hi>'s, Boatſwain of the Dock-yard, where a Marine Guard mounted every Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, December</hi> 27. A Jack in the Mizen Shrouds was hoiſted on Board the <hi>St. George</hi> as a Signal for a Court Martial; about nine a Gun fired for all Captains in the Harbour to come on Board; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was read, and the Members of the Court were ſworn; which was all that was done this Day; and then adjourn'd till next Morning nine o'Clock.

            <p>Five Hours were appointed for their ſitting each Day; but none of them allowed to go aſhore till the Trial ſhould be finiſhed; but Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> and his Witneſſes might come aſhore every Night, if they thought fit. The Court was order'd to be open, and free Admittance given to every Body who had the Curioſity to hear the Trial, which occaſion'd a numerous Concourſe of People on Board every Day.</p>
            <p>All Things being in Order, and the Witneſſes ready, the Charge was open'd, which was to this Effect,</p>
            <p>
               <q>THAT he, <hi>John Byng,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Admiral of the <hi>Blue</hi> Squadron of his Majeſty's Fleet in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> during the Engagement of His Majeſty's ſaid Fleet, and the Fleet of the <hi>French</hi> King, on the 20th of <hi>May</hi> laſt, did withdraw, or keep back, and did not do his utmoſt to take, ſeize and deſtroy the Ships of the <hi>French</hi> King, which it was his Duty to have engaged, and to aſſiſt ſuch of his Majeſty's Ships as were engaged in Fight with the <hi>French</hi> Ships, which it was his Duty to have aſſiſted; and for that he the ſaid <hi>John Byng</hi> did not do his utmoſt to relieve St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Caſtle, in his Majeſty's Iſland of <hi>Minorca,</hi> then beſieged by the Forces of the <hi>French</hi> King; but acted contrary to, and in Breach of his Inſtructions given the Lords of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, by his Majeſty's Command.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After which he made the following Speech to the Court:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think myſelf extremely happy in my preſent Situation, to have my Conduct enquired into by Gentlemen of your well-known Abilities, Integrity, and Candor; and, from thence I hope to anſwer for my ſelf with Honour, and to demonſtrate my Innocence of the Accuſations exhibited againſt me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> 29. The firſt Witneſs ſworn was Admiral <hi>Weſt,</hi> who depoſed to the Effect following:</p>
            <p>Being aſk'd, whether he had ever delivered his Opinion, anſwered: This Queſtion appears to me of an extraordinary Nature, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that, as a Witneſs, I am at all called upon to know at what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Diſſatisfaction. It is not a Matter of Fact as to my particular
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007892_0009_102DF6ECEB805658"/>
Opinion: There might be Appearances at which I might expreſs Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and they not Facts. When I ſaw the Rear of our Fleet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, I could not but be diſſatisfied with that Appearance. I ſaw the Fleet in that Situation, but cannot tell the Reaſon: Therefore my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that I may have given, may be founded upon what was not really Fact, tho' it appeared to me to be ſo. As to the other Ships, I know nothing of their Situation. I went down and engaged my proper Ship till ſhe bore away; after that I went and engaged a-head with the <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> then the Rear came up, and engaged them as long as they ſtaid. I have given in all theſe Particulars; and if the Court deſires to know my Opinion without Facts, it was what I did not expect. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to give every Light into this Matter that may inform the Court, but the Court may be miſled by my Opinion, without Facts. Where a Judgment is drawn from Evidence, it is drawn from Evidence of Facts. I may have conceived a wrong Opinion, either from its not being well founded on Facts, or from my making a wrong Judgment of thoſe that did appear. I only mean to ſay, that this is a Queſtion, my Anſwer to which may miſlead, becauſe it may be founded on Appearances; there was an Appearance from the Fleet's being ſo far a-ſtern; there was an Appearance of ſome Want in ſomebody, but with whom I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay.</p>
            <p>His Examination laſted till near Five in the Evening. When the Court was adjourning, he begged they would complete his Examination that Night, becauſe he was going out upon an Expedition of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, by the King's Special Order: But as the Court and Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> had many Queſtions to aſk him, the Court informed him, they ſhould be glad to go through, but that there was not Time; and then the Court adjourn'd till next Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> 30. Admiral <hi>Weſt</hi> appeared, and finiſhed his Examination about three in the Afternoon. In the Courſe of his Examination, ſome of the moſt material Queſtions were, Whether any unneceſſary Delay was made at St. <hi>Helen</hi>'s, or at <hi>Gibraltar?</hi> Anſwered in the Negative. At what Diſtance the <hi>Ramillies</hi> was from the <hi>Buckingham</hi> at the Time of the Engagement? He replied, about three Miles. Whether the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral and the Rear could have come up to the Aſſiſtance of the Van, and come to a cloſe Engagement with the Enemy? He anſwer'd, he knew no Impediment to the contrary; but that he would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007892_0010_102DF6EFAD0A6928"/>
to mean that there was none. How the Wind and Weather was? He replied, very calm and fine. Whether he could keep his lower Ports open? He replied, yes; and that he knew of but one Ship that could not, and that was the <hi>Deptford,</hi> who lower'd her Ports occaſionally. How many Men he had kill'd and wounded? He anſwer'd, Three kill'd and Seven wounded. What Damage he receiv'd in his Hull, Maſts, Yards, and Rigging? For an Anſwer to which he referred them to a written Account he had deliver'd into Court thereof. He was aſked in what Condition the Ship was in regard to Men, on the 20th of <hi>May,</hi> the Morning of the Engagement? He replied in very good. Whether he ſaw any Fire from the Admiral's Ship during the Engagement? He ſaid, when he was looking towards the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> which was in Diſtreſs a-ſtern of her, he did ſee ſome Smoak, which probably might be from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's Ship, or ſome of his Diviſion; but he could not diſcover at what Ship it was directed. Whether on the 24th of <hi>May,</hi> the Day of the Council of War, his Ship was repaired, fit for a ſecond Engagement? He anſwer'd, yes, before that. When? He anſwer'd, the very next Night after the Engagement.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> aſked him, whether it was not in the Power of the Enemy to decline coming to a cloſe Engagement, as the two Fleets were ſituated? He replied, yes; but as they lay to for our Fleet, he apprehended they intended to fight. Whether he was of Opinion, that the Forces on board the Fleet could have relieved <hi>Minorca?</hi> He ſaid, He believed not.— Whether ſome of the Ships were not deficient in their Compliment of Men, ſome of the Ships out of Repair, and whether not deficient in Point of Force with the Enemy? To which he anſwered in the Affirmative.</p>
            <p>The Court having done with Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> Lord <hi>Blakeney</hi> was ſworn. In the Courſe of the Examination, he informed the Court of the Time the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet was diſcovered by the Garriſon, and the Time of its diſappearing; that upon Sight of it he wrote a Letter to be carried off by Mr. <hi>Boyd</hi> the Store-keeper, and Aid de Camp to Col. <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> to inform the Admiral of his Situation, &amp;c. A Copy of which Letter he had in his Hand, and deſired it might be read. But Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting thereto, as it was only a Copy, and not the Original, it was not read, becauſe Mr. <hi>Boyd</hi> was to be examined thereto, and could produce the Original.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:007892_0011_102DF6F152ECE8E0"/>
Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> asked the General, Whether he thought the Forces could be landed? He anſwered very eaſily. Whether there were not Faſcines in the Way? He ſaid, Yes; but they might eaſily have been deſtroyed. Whether the Attempt to land the Men would not have been attended with Danger? The General replied, <q>Danger! moſt certainly. It could not be ſo eaſy as ſtopping into this Ship. I have been upwards of 50 Years in the Service, and I never knew any Expedition of Conſequence carried into Execution, but what was attended with ſome Danger; but of all the Expeditions I ever knew, this was certainly the worſt.</q> Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> aſk'd, Whether the French had not a Caſtle at the Point, which might have prevented their Landing? The General anſwered, Not the 20th of <hi>May;</hi> and ſaid, that the Enemy were in ſuch Diſtreſs for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, that they fired Stones at the Garriſon. Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> aſk'd the General, Whether the Officers and few Men he had on board the Fleet, would have been of any great Service to the Garriſon? He anſwered, Yes, of very great Service; for that he was obliged, at that Time to ſet ſome of his Men to plaiſter the Breaches. He added, That he believed, had the Detachment been landed, he might have held out, 'till Sir <hi>Edward Hawke</hi> came, tho' without ſufficient Force to drive the Enemy away, he could not ſave the Iſland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> 31. Mr. <hi>Boyd</hi> was ſworn. In the Courſe of his Examination it appeared that he was ſent off with a Letter, in a Boat, to deliver to the Admiral, but could not be particular to the Time; that he kept out as long as he thought it probable to reach the Admiral; but when he found it impracticable to cloſe the Admiral, as he was then going to the Southward, he returned without delivering the Letter.</p>
            <p>The Preſident of the Court aſking him, if a 20 Gun Ship could have come and deſtroyed the Battery? Anſwered, Yes, if there had been deep Water, which he could not ſay, not having ever ſounded it, tho' he had often heard it reported that there was deep Water at that Place.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> aſk'd him, How long he waited before the Boat was ready to bring him off. He could not recollect, but remember'd he waited for it till he was very impatient. Whether he in the Boat did not paſs thro' ſome Firings of the Enemy? Anſwered, There was ſome ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Fire of ſmall Arms, and about three or four Cannon Shot. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it did not do them ſome Damage? He anſwered, No; he did not know that ſo much as one of them touched the Boat. How long
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007892_0012_102DF6F3865F7C28"/>
he might be off in the Boat? About an Hour and a Half. Whether there was not a Breeze of Wind? Anſwer'd, When he got from the Land, he found a Breeze. Whether he thought the Admiral could ſee the Boat? Anſwered No; he believed not at that Diſtance, and ſo late in the Evening.</p>
            <p>The next Witneſs examin'd was Capt. <hi>Everitt,</hi> who, before he gave his Evidence, deſired to hear the Articles of the Charge, he not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to be in Court when they were formerly read, which Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> objected to, as contrary to the Cuſtom of the Court; but on the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Requeſt they were read. Captain <hi>Everitt</hi> being ſworn, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome Papers in his Hand, was aſked what they were? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, They were Minutes he had taken from the Ship's Log-Book, and his own Journal, to refreſh his Memory. To the uſing of which Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> objected, the Log-Book not being a proper Teſtimony. Whereupon the Court was cleared, to deliberate upon the Point. Upon the Court's being opened again, their Opinion was, That thoſe Minutes might be uſed to refreſh his Memory upon ſuch Points only as fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under his own Obſervation.</p>
            <p>In the Courſe of his Examination it appeared, that there was all poſſible Diſpatch made, and no unneceſſary Delay in the Sailing of the Fleet from St. <hi>Helen</hi>'s to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Mabon;</hi> that the <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Men were healthy, having but two incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Quarters; that they had 90 or 100 Tons of Water on Board; that they got Sight of the Iſland of <hi>Minorca</hi> about Six in the Morning of the 19th of <hi>May;</hi> that about Eleven in the Forenoon they were two Leagues diſtant from <hi>St. Philip</hi>'s Caſtle, and believed that was the neareſt Diſtance he was to it; that about Two in the Afternoon the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was ſeen diſtinctly, ſtanding to the Weſtward, but could not ſay at what Diſtance; that our Fleet was ſtanding to the S.E. the Wind at S.S.W. moderate fine Weather; that on the 20th of <hi>May,</hi> about Eight in the Morning, they ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Fleet preparing for Engagement.</p>
            <p>The like Queſtions were propoſed to him as to Admiral <hi>West;</hi> and in his Anſwers was of Opinion, That the Admiral's Diviſion might have carried all their Sail, and thereby aſſiſted the Van, and prevented them from receiving ſo much Fire from the Enemy's Rear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:007892_0013_102DF6F64210E670"/>
Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> was aſked. Whether he choſe to aſk Captain <hi>Everitt</hi> ſay Queſtions? To which he replied. He had no Queſtions to propoſe then, but ſhould have Occaſion to aſk him ſome hereafter, therefore deſired he might be kept in the Way for that Purpoſe. Captain <hi>Everitt</hi> ſaid, He ſhould have been very glad if thoſe Queſtions could then be aſked, as he was under Sailing Orders with Admiral <hi>West.</hi> Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> anſwered, He could not propoſe them at that Time, but would as ſoon is poſſible; upon which Capt. <hi>Everitt</hi> was ordered to attend the Court.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> then informed the Court, that he wanted to aſk Lord <hi>Blakeney</hi> ſome Queſtions. Whereupon the General was ordred to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the next Morning at Nine o'Clock; to which Time the Court then adjourned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Jan.</hi> 1. Lord <hi>Blakeney</hi> appeared in Court, in Conſequence of Mr. <hi>Brag</hi>'s Requeſt; when the Admiral propoſed a Queſtion, the Subſtance of which, and the Anſwers were as follows: Whether if the Admiral had landed his Troops, it could have ſaved <hi>St. Philip</hi>'s from falling into the Hands of the Enemy? His Lordſhip ſaid, It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to anſwer that Queſtion with any Certainty; but he was of Opinion, that had they been landed, he ſhould have been able to have hold out the Siege till Sir <hi>Edward Hawke</hi> had come to his Relief.</p>
            <p>Then the four <hi>Firſt Lieutenants</hi> of the <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Captain <hi>Everitt,</hi> Admiral <hi>West</hi>'s Ship, were examined, and all agreed, that they knew of no Impediment to hinder the Admiral and his Diviſion, from coming to the Aſſiſtance of the Van, which was cloſely engaged, and raked by the Enemy's Rear as they came up; and that the Admiral was not ſeen by them to go to a cloſe Engagement with the Enemy, agreable to his own Signals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 3. Captain <hi>Everitt</hi> was croſs-examined by the Court and Mr. <hi>Byng;</hi> and being aſked, How many Guns the Ships in the Van carried? anſwered, That the Sides of thoſe next the <hi>Buckingham</hi> had 14 on the lower Deck, all the others 13. Of what Rats they were? anſwered, One a 74 Gun Ship, the others 64, and ſix in Number. Whether, if Admiral <hi>Byng</hi> had come to a cloſe Engagement, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Victory might not have been obtained? Anſwer, There was all the Reaſon in the World to expect it; it being well known that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>West</hi> beat off two Ships, though he had but five Ships to their ſix, and ours ſmaller Ships than theirs, and their Metal heavier. How the

Wind? as fair a Gale as could be wiſhed for. Whether he had too much or too little? Anſwer, Juſt enough, and no more. What Sail had Mr. <hi>Byng?</hi> Anſwer, His lower Courſes, Top and Top-Gallant Sails full; but his Main-Sail, Main-Top-Sail, and Top-gallant Sail, a-back.</p>
            <p>The Court then aſked Mr. <hi>Byng,</hi> If he ſhould have Occaſion to aſk Capt. <hi>Everitt,</hi> or any of the <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s People, any more Queſtions? and being anſwered in the Negative, the Captain, and the reſt of the Officers of the <hi>Buckingham,</hi> were diſcharged from any further Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Court, and were informed they might repair on Board their Ship.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Gilebriſt</hi> ſworn. He acquainted the Court, that he was ſituated oppoſite the Rear Admiral on the 20th of <hi>May</hi> to repeat Signals. In the Courſe of his Examination he ſaid, Every Ship did not bear down at a proper Diſtance to attack the Enemy, according to Signals thrown out by the Admiral, about Half an Hour paſt Two o'Clock; but the Rear-Admiral and his Diviſion bore down before the Wind, and hauled up oppoſite to their proper Ships, and attacked the Enemy, except the <hi>Defiance,</hi> which appeared to be a-head; that the Ships in the Rear were in a Line of Battle a-head; upon which the <hi>Defiance</hi> threw all a-back, and fell down upon her proper Ship, the Head-moſt Ship of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; that the Admiral did not bear down before the Wind upon the Enemy, nor any of his Diviſion; that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, at the Time of the Signal, were all lying too with their Main-Top-Sails to the Maſts; and that our Van was in the ſame Poſition. He could not take upon him to ſay, whether the Admiral ever engaged at a proper Diſtance, on Account of the Smoak from the Firings of the <hi>Revenge, Princeſs Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa,</hi> and <hi>Trident,</hi> He agreed that the Wind, Weather, and Situation of the Enemy's Fleet, were ſuch as to enable them to engage at a proper Diſtance; that the Ships in the Rear did not make all the Sail they could to cloſe with the Enemy, from the Time the Signal was given for Battle till the Action was over; but that, in the latter Part of the Action, Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> ſet all his Sail, except his Top-Gallant Sails; that the Wind and Weather was ſuch, that he could have carried all the Sail in the Ship that he commanded, and knew no Reaſon why he did not; that the Van of our Fleet was engaged about an Hour and a Quarter; that the Admiral did not continue in the ſame Poſition, but kept laſking away, angling upon the Enemy; that he ſaw the <hi>Ramillies</hi> fire; that the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007892_0015_102DF6FA1093E198"/>
Diſtance of the Rear Diviſion from the Van ſeemed to be about three Miles; that he made no Doubt, if the Admiral had carried Sail all along, but they might have prevented the Enemy's Rear from pouring ſome of their Fire into our Van; and that the Diſtance between our Rear and Van, was occaſioned by the Rear throwing their Top-ſails a-back when they began to fire.</p>
            <p>Being aſked, If the Admiral had engaged, whether he might have defeated the <hi>French?</hi> anſwered, That his Opinion was, he might.</p>
            <p>Another Officer, whoſe Name is forgot, was peremptorily aſked, If he ſaw the Admiral engaged? anſwered, He ſaw a Firing. When one of the Gentlemen ſaid ſomewhat ſmartly, Is not firing engaging? The Officer replied, He did not call firing of Guns at ſo great a Diſtance engaging.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Hervey,</hi> of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> ſworn. He was ſtationed a-breaſt the Admiral to repeat Signals. He ſaid, that about Forty-three Minutes after Two, Signal was made for the <hi>Deptford</hi> to quit the Line; and about fifty Minutes after Two the <hi>Ramillies</hi> began to fire upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, having before that received the Fire of the three ſternmoſt Ships of the Enemy for about ten or twelve Minutes, in which Time he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome of the Enemy's Shot to fall between the <hi>Ramillies</hi> and his Ship the <hi>Phoenix;</hi> about the ſame Time he obſerved the <hi>Intrepid</hi>'s Fore-top Maſt to be loſt; he obſerved then the quick Motion of the <hi>Intrepid</hi> in bearing down, had occaſioned her to be raked by the Enemy, to have loſt her Top-Maſt, and to have run the Riſque of falling on Board the Admiral, who was then engaged, and might not ſee them Time enough to prevent it. Some Time after the <hi>Ramillies</hi> ceaſed Fire, the eleventh Ship in the Enemy's Line bore away from the <hi>Ramillies</hi> Fire, as was concluded by the People on Board; that the <hi>Culloden</hi> fired but a few Times, and at a greater Diſtance than the <hi>Ramillies;</hi> that the whole Fire ceaſed about Five in the Afternoon; that the Enemy ſeemed to go off from the Fire of our Van, ſome of them not damaged. This in general; but the Preſident deſiring him to give as diſtinct and particular Account as he could of the Action, after the Signal to engage; he gave his Evidence as follows:</p>
            <p>I preſume, I am to begin with the Signal to engage; the Minutes I have in my Hand are only in reſpect to Time. The Signal was made about 20 Minutes after Two for engaging. At the Time the Signal was made, ſome
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007892_0016_102DF6FBB679E088"/>
of the Engliſh Fleet bore away more than others; which I take to be owing to the Ships in the Van not having obſerved the Signal before for leading large, which was made by the Admiral, and which I repeated about Two; I recollect to have repeated it two or three Times after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The Admiral bore down with his Topſails, and, as near as I can recollect, with his Foreſail ſet at that Time; and I very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſaying, that the Admiral ſeemed to me to bear away rather more than either of the Seconds. The <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> bore down alſo on the Ships of the Enemy, which, as I imagined, they took to have fell to their Lot. The <hi>Intrepid</hi> I ſaw bear right down. I cannot ſay, I was exceſſively minute upon the Proceedings of the Van then, I was more attentive to the Admiral, whole Signals I was to repeat; and another Reaſon was, I was then employed in ſhifting Men and Things into a Schooner, which was ordered to attend me, and in compleating and fitting my Ship for burning as a Fire-ſhip.</p>
            <p>It was about half an Hour paſt Two, I think, when ſome of the French Van began to fire, and ſoon after that the Fire became general, except from two or three of the Sternmoſt of the Enemy, and they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be reſerving their Fire for the Admiral Commander in Chief, who was then going down upon them. About 43 Minutes after Two, the Signal was made for the <hi>Deptford</hi> to quit the Line; I had my Watch in my Hand, and therefore can be more particular, and I think it was about fifty Minutes after Two that the <hi>Ramilies</hi> began to fire, having before received the Fire of theſe ſternmoſt Ships of the Enemy for about 10 or 12 Minutes (I am not certain as to a Minute or two) in which Time, I obſerved ſeveral of the Enemy's Shot to fall between the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> and the Ship I commanded. It was about this Time, when I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the <hi>Intrepid</hi>'s Foremaſt to be ſhot away; it might have been done ſooner, but I did not obſerve it till then; ſhe ſeemed then to lay muzzled, her Fore-ſail a-back, or in the Wind, and her Main top-ſail in the Wind alſo; I imagined that to be from her Fore-tack being ſhot away, or ſome of that Kind. About Three I ſaw the <hi>Revenge, Princeſs Louiſa</hi> and <hi>Trident,</hi> all three with their Topſails a-back, the <hi>Revenge</hi> very near the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> under her Lee Quarter, and a little a-ſtern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. I remember then to have ſaid upon Deck, that quick Motion of the <hi>Intrepid's,</hi> in bearing down right before the Wind, occaſioned her being raked and loſing her Fore-top-Maſt, and the Ship next to her not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007892_0017_102DF6FDE10A82E8"/>
her would bring thoſe Ships a-ſtern of her, and a-head of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, in ſuch a Cluſter, that they would run the Riſque of dropping on Board of the Admiral, who was then engaged, and probably might not ſee them ſoon enough to prevent it. About five or ſix Minutes after Three, I ſaw the <hi>Ramilies</hi>'s Topſails a-back, and at the ſame Time, a Yellow Flag at the Mizen-top-Maſt-Head, which was hauled down while I was endeavouring to repeat it, and a Yellow Flag hoiſted at the Fore-top-Maſt Head. I take that Yellow Flag at the Mizen-top-Maſt Head to have been up five or ſix Minutes, becauſe, while the Men at the Mizen-top-Maſt were bending it, I was obliged to order it down again, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat that which was hoiſted on Board the Admiral at the Fore-top-Maſt Head, I having but one Yellow Flag on Board. About ſix or ſeven Minutes afterwards, a red Enſign was hoiſted at the Mizen-top-Maſt Head; and I believe it was much about the Time of the Signals being made to bring to, that the <hi>Ramilies</hi> ceaſed firing. In Narratives of this Kind, one cannot keep Time ſo exactly as I could wiſh, but muſt go back from one Thing to another.</p>
            <p>At the Time of the Smoak being cleared away by their ceaſing firing, I obſerved the eleventh Ship in the Enemy's Line to have kept away large with his Main-topſail Yard down, which I remember, on board, we then concluded was from the <hi>Ramillies</hi> Fire, for the <hi>Culloden</hi> had fired but very few Guns, and thoſe at a greater Diſtance than the <hi>Ramillies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was about Three when the <hi>Ramillies</hi> filled and made Sail, Fore-ſail, Jibb and Stay-Sail; I think that was the Sail at that Time; and at Four the Signal was made for the <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> to lay by the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> and then the <hi>Revenge, Princeſs Louiſa,</hi> and <hi>Trident</hi> were recovering their Stations in the Line a-head of the Admiral, who then had his Courſes, Top-ſails, Jibb, and Stay-ſails ſet; I think the Main-ſail was ſet then, it was juſt then I ſaw it; it might have been ſet before, but I did not obſerve it till then; at that Time, or about that Time, the <hi>Intrepid</hi> being then got clear of the Line, I then ſaw the <hi>Deptford</hi> ſhifting her Pendant to the Fore-top-Maſt Head, hoiſting a red Enſign, and ſhe crowded Sail, ſeemingly to me, to be ſtanding for the <hi>Intrepid</hi>'s Station in the Line.</p>
            <p>About Five the whole Firing ceaſed; I then ſaw the <hi>Buckingham</hi> with her Main-top-Sail Yard down, and I think her Fore-top-gallant Sail and Sprit-ſail ſet. The <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Portland</hi> were then at ſome
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007892_0018_102DF70180995200"/>
Diſtance from the <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> rather upon the <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Weather Quarter, and a-ſtern withal, and the <hi>Defiance</hi> cloſe upon the <hi>Captain</hi>'s Weather Quarter. The <hi>Defiance,</hi> before that ſeemed to be diſabled in her Sails and Rigging, which I imagined, occaſioned her to fall a-ſtern out of her Station.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> fourth or fifth Ship from the Van, ſeemed to me to have bore away from the Fire of our Ships in the Van, and very ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the three headmoſt of the Enemy did the ſame; but none of them appeared to me to be diſabled: So that, whether it was to avoid the Action, or by a Signal from the Commander in Chief (for I ſaw Flags flying on board the <hi>French</hi> Admiral) I ſhould rather imagine the latter, as I had not obſerved any ſuch cloſe Engagement as to oblige Ships of their ſeeming Force, to avoid an Action, which I imagine they had in their Power from the Beginning, by out-ſailing the Ships of our Fleet, as well as I could obſerve, when our Ships had more Sail ſet than what I obſerved the Enemy to have.</p>
            <p>Being aſked, If the Flags which he ſaw on board the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, might not be Signals to recal his retreating Ships, as well as to call them off? anſwered, <hi>Certainly Yes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Admiral with the reſt of the Ships, were then edging down under their Top-ſails and Fore-ſails to cloſe their Van; and tho' I obſerved, that the Rear of the Fleet cloſed our Van very faſt, which was then very much diſordered, yet they did not appear to me to gain any thing of the Enemy. A little after Five, the Rear had cloſed the Van; when I ſpeak of the Van, I mean the <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who then had the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Defiance</hi> upon her Weather Quarter; the <hi>Portland</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> were then a conſiderable Way a-head.</p>
            <p>About thirty Minutes after Five, the Signal was made to bring to; and a little before Six, the Signal was made to fill and ſtand on. The <hi>Intrepid</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> were then a conſiderable Way a-ſtern, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Weather Quarter withal.</p>
            <p>At twenty Minutes after Six, the Signal was made to tack; and for the Ships that led before with the Larboard Tack, to continue to lead with the Starboard Tack. At Seven, the Signal of the Line was haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down.</p>
            <p>I then ceaſed from repeating Signals, and went on Board the Admiral to receive his Commands. That is all I know in general of the Action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007892_0019_102DF703ABFFA430"/>
               <hi>Tueſday,</hi> 4. Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> was re-examined till near Two, with very little Variation from the Narrative he had given the Court the Day before.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Amburſt,</hi> on his Examination, ſaid, he thought Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> would have fought, if the <hi>French</hi> had ſtaid: But the Confuſion this Evidence was in, his advancing no plauſible Reaſon for his Belief, and his negative Anſwers to the Queſtions reſpecting Diſtance, Sailing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> added to the Circumſtance of the <hi>French</hi> Rear's lying to an Hour and a Quarter, and in Fact, not going away till their Van retreated, made his Opinion too weak to be depended upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> 5. Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> a Lieutenant, and Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> a Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer on board the Fleet, but now a Captain, were examin'd; in whoſe Examination nothing particular appeared further than has been already noted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday,</hi> 6. The Lieutenant of the <hi>Lancaster</hi> was examined, and then a Gentleman who was a Volunteer on board. Their Evidence ſeemed very clear and certain as to ſome particular Facts which fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under their Obſervation, but were not much in Favour of the Admiral.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Young</hi> being called and ſworn, depos'd, That the Rear might have went down as well as himſelf, who had only his Topſails and Foreſails; but the moſt remarkable Thing in his Evidence was, his ſaying, that the <hi>loſing his Topmaſt</hi> could neither then make him run ſoul of the Rear, he being to Leeward, nor was it probable they could on him, the Diſtance being ſo great; though this was the Admiral's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, in his Letter publiſhed in the <hi>Gazette:</hi> and what Captain <hi>Hervey,</hi> the Admiral's principal Advocate, intimated in his Evidence, was very likely to have happened, had not the Admiral thrown his Sails a-back to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Young</hi> added, that after he had cut his Rigging away, he hoiſted Main Topſail and Foreſail, and fought again, till the <hi>Revenge</hi>'s Boat came with Notice from Captain <hi>Cornwall,</hi> that he was coming to his Aſſiſtance, to deſire him to ceaſe firing, and he would place himſelf betwixt him and the Enemy, which he did.</p>
            <p>But this Matter being more fully explained in the Captain's Croſs-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, we ſhall give it <hi>verbatim</hi> as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> 7. Did the Loſs of your Fore-top-Maſt put any of our Ships in our Rear in Danger of being on board you? <hi>A.</hi> Not as I could
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007892_0020_102DF7054EE39988"/>
perceive, <hi>Q.</hi> Did it occaſion any Impediment to the Admiral and his Diviſion from going down, and engaging the Enemy cloſely? <hi>A.</hi> Not as I could perceive. <hi>Q.</hi> Did any of the Ships tack at that Time? <hi>A.</hi> I did not obſerve juſt then; they were to Windward of me; and I ſaw ſeveral of the Ships upon my Weather Quarter with their Topſails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you think at that Time they were in any Danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-board you? <hi>A.</hi> No; I was to Leeward of them, ſo could not drive a-thwart them. <hi>Q.</hi> Could they at that Time have wore clear of you, and gone down to the Center and Rear of the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> Yes; becauſe I was a-head and to Leeward. <hi>Q.</hi> Did the Admiral and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion bear down on your Stern, and go to the Center and Rear of the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> No; not when my Top-maſt went away. <hi>Q.</hi> Did they at any Time afterwards? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, near an Hour after, and went to Leeward of me, and paſſed me. <hi>Q.</hi> Did they go down to the Center and Rear to engage properly? <hi>A.</hi> The French were then gone, and left me a-ſtern. <hi>Q.</hi> What Sail had the French Rear ſet when they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you? <hi>A.</hi> I think their Topſails and Foreſails. <hi>Q.</hi> What Sail had the Admiral and his Diviſion abroad then? <hi>A.</hi> Foreſails and Stayſails, and the <hi>Calloden</hi> her Top-gallant-Sails. <hi>Q.</hi> How long after you loſt your Top-maſt was it before the Admiral and his Diviſion paſſed to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of you? <hi>A.</hi> About three Quarters of an Hour or an Hour. <hi>Q.</hi> With the Wind as it then was; could the Admiral and his Diviſion, if they had ſet all their Sails, from the Time the Signal for engaging was made and borne away properly, could they have come to a cloſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> Yes; the French were lying to for us; I went down only under my Top-ſails, and they might have added Sails in Proportion to the Diſtance and Going of their Ships. <hi>Q.</hi> During the three Quarters of an Hour, or an Hour, which you mentioned juſt now, did you obſerve what Sail the Admiral and his Diviſion were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? <hi>A.</hi> No, not particularly. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you obſerve any Motions that were made for going down to the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> No. <hi>Q.</hi> How long after you loſt your Fore-maſt did the Center and Rear of the French Line lay to? <hi>A.</hi> Till the <hi>Revenge</hi>'s Boat came on board me; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired I would leave off firing, that they might make Sail and go between me and the Enemy, which they did directly; the French Fleet then run, who were oppoſite to me, and the Rear followed them. <hi>Q.</hi> After the Admiral and his Diviſion had made Sail, did they get up with the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007892_0021_102DF706FB27AD40"/>
and Rear of the Enemy, ſo as to come to a cloſe Engagement <hi>A.</hi> There was very little Action after that Time. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you, before the French run, ſee the Admiral and his Diviſion cloſely engaged with the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> No; they were a-ſtern and to Windward of me. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you ſee the Admiral and his Diviſion engage from firſt to laſt? <hi>A.</hi> Yes; ſome of the Ships; they fired. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you obſerve at what Diſtance they were one from the other? <hi>A.</hi> I did not take Notice. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you ſee any of their Shot fall? <hi>A.</hi> No; I was too much employed to take Notice. <hi>Q.</hi> Was you within point-blank Shot of the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> I can't judge that exactly. <hi>Q.</hi> At what Diſtance do you ſuppoſe you were at that Time? <hi>A.</hi> Within random Muſquet Shot, I believe, as the Lieutenant was wounded with a Muſquet Ball. <hi>Q.</hi> How far were the Rear off at that Time? <hi>A.</hi> I did not take Notice. <hi>Q.</hi> When you bore down on the Enemy, did the Admiral and his Squadron do ſo too? <hi>A.</hi> No. <hi>Q.</hi> Under what Sail were the Admiral and his Diviſion at that Time. <hi>A.</hi> Under their Top-ſails and Fore-ſails. <hi>Q.</hi> If they had bore down as the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> could they have cloſed the Enemy ſo as to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged properly? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, the <hi>French</hi> were laying to. <hi>Q.</hi> Did they lay to long enough to admit of it, ſuppoſing the Admiral and his Diviſion had ſet all their Sails? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, long enough for me, and I ſuppoſe for the reſt too. <hi>Q.</hi> Were our Ships in a proper Line of Battle a-head of one another, when the Signal for engaging was made? And had all our Ships bore away at the ſame Time, would it not have prevented the running aboard each other? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, there was a very good Line for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; they were not ſo near together but every Ship had Room to wear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday,</hi> 8. Capt. <hi>Cornwall</hi> was ſworn. In the Courſe of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, he ſaid, that he went to his Windows abaft to take a View of the Fleet when in Line of Battle; that he was greatly ſurprized to ſee the Admiral and his Diviſion at ſo great a Diſtance, as he was upon the Weather Quarter; that ſeeing the <hi>Intrepid</hi> in Diſtreſs and no Signal given for removing her out of the Line, he ſell into her Station, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Foudroyant</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, as the Ship he imagined fell to his Lot, according to the then Line of Battle; ſaid, he knew of no Impediment to prevent the Admiral's engaging at a proper Diſtance, any more than the reſt of the Fleet; obſerved, he was upon his Oath to ſwear the whole Truth, and would do ſo, though ſome Things he was going to ſay would affect himſelf; confeſſed, he went without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007892_0022_102DC79A13AC4140"/>
to aſſiſt the <hi>Intrepid;</hi> and being aſked by the Admiral, If he did not break through an Article of his Inſtructions in going without his Command? anſwered, Yes; but added, If I did go beyond my Duty, it was my <hi>Zeal for my Country,</hi> though he mentioned another Article that favoured him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Byng,</hi> upon this, obſerved to the Court, that his Reputation, which was dearer to him than his Life, nay his Life alſo, were in the Hands of the Court Martial, and in better Hands he deſired them not; but ſaid, he ſhould prove, that the <hi>Revenge,</hi> by breaking the Line, was a great Impediment in his Way; and that if he could not prove that, or Something like it, <hi>The Lord have Mercy upon me.</hi>

               <hi>Monday,</hi> 10. Captain <hi>Cornwall</hi>'s Croſs-Examination was finiſhed. <hi>Capt.</hi> Cornwall <hi>gave his Teſtimony with great Clearneſs; and behaved like the Gentleman, the Sailor, and the Man of Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Durell,</hi> of the <hi>Trident,</hi> being ſworn, depoſed much the ſame as Captain <hi>Cornwall;</hi> did not accuſe the Admiral of any unneceſſary Delay to <hi>Minorca;</hi> was of Opinion, that the Admiral and his Diviſion did not ſet all their Sail to join the Van of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet; but could not ſay the Admiral had not any Impediment to prevent it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday,</hi> 11. Captain <hi>Gardiner,</hi> Admiral <hi>Byng</hi>'s Captain, was under Examination and Re-examination all Day. He could not ſay all their Sails were ſet, or that the Rear Diviſion could not come up to a cloſe Engagement, as well as the Van; but ſaid he adviſed the Admiral to bear down, to which the Admiral objected, and gave his Reaſons againſt it; leſt an Accident of a ſimilar Nature with that of Admiral <hi>Matthews</hi> in the ſame Seas, ſhould be the Conſequence; and had nothing to ſay againſt the Admiral's perſonal Behaviour; ſaid, he believed the Admiral intended a cloſe Engagement, by his telling the Sailors, whoſe Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Action had engaged them to fire without Orders, to ſave their ſhot till they came nearer to do Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> 12. Captain <hi>Gardiner</hi> was again examined, and made it appear, that the Admiral took the whole Command of the Ship from him, and that nothing was done that Day but what he ordered.</p>

Then the Land Officers on board the <hi>Ramillies</hi> were examined. The Lord <hi>Robert Bertie's</hi> Examination was as follows: <hi>Q.</hi> Was not your Lordſhip, with your Regiment, ordered to ſerve in the Fleet under Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Byng's</hi> Command? <hi>A.</hi> The Orders I received are dated the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> from the Secretary at War. They are to put myſelf under the Command of Admiral <hi>Byng,</hi> and obey ſuch Orders as I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, from Time to Time, from him, or any other commanding that Squadron. <hi>Q.</hi> Do you know of any Troops embarked in the Fleet, beſides your Regiment, except ſome few Officers and Recruits, and the Detachment from the Garriſon at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> that were put on Board the Ships of Mr. <hi>Edgcumbe</hi>'s Squadron, in the room of ſome of their Men that were left in the Garriſon of <hi>St. Philip? A.</hi> No. <hi>Q.</hi> Do you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that the throwing in about an hundred Men, conſiſting of Officers and Recruits, would have enabled the Garriſon to hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy's Attacks? <hi>A.</hi> No; I apprehend they were of much more Service on Board the Fleet. <hi>Q.</hi> Was you upon the Quarter-Deck near the Admiral, during the whole Time of the Enemy's firing? <hi>A.</hi> Yes; I was near the Admiral during the whole Time that the <hi>Ramillies</hi> was fired upon. <hi>Q.</hi> Did the Admiral, from the Time the Signal was made to engage, continue going down upon the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that he was going down ſtanding to the Enemy, till ſuch Time as the Admiral laid a-back. <hi>Q.</hi> Will you be pleaſed to inform the Court, if, during the Time of Action on the 20th of <hi>May,</hi> the Admiral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed any Impatience or Uneaſineſs at any Accident the Admiral judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impede his engaging the Enemy properly? <hi>A.</hi> At the Time the Admiral lay a-back, I heard him ſay, he wonder'd what the Ships a-head were about. <hi>Q.</hi> While the <hi>Ramillies</hi> continued going down upon the Enemy, did not their Shot reach her and paſs over her? <hi>A.</hi> At the Time the <hi>French</hi> fired at the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> they reached her, paſſed over, and ſome hulled her. <hi>Q.</hi> At the Time that the Enemy were firing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and their Shot paſſing over us, did you hear the Admiral ſay any Thing on that Occaſion? <hi>A.</hi> I recollect, that when the <hi>French</hi> were firing upon us, the Admiral deſired Captain <hi>Gardiner</hi> not to fire, till ſuch Time as we were down along ſide of them. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you not inform the Admiral, during the Time of the Firing, that you diſcerned thro' the Smoak, one of your Ships cloſe under the Starboard Bow; and that if we did not immediately ceaſe firing, we ſhould fire into her? <hi>A.</hi> The
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007892_0024_102DF70DA15C0618"/>
Words I made uſe of to the Admiral, as well as I can recollect, were <q>Do you, or Captain <hi>Gardiner,</hi> ſee that Ship upon our Starboard Bow? I apprehend her to be one of ours; if you do not take Care we ſhall fire into her.</q> 
               <hi>Q.</hi> Did firing ceaſe on board the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> as you apprehend, to avoid firing through our own Ship? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. Then Admiral <hi>Byng</hi> delivered ſome Queſtions to the Preſident, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Judge Advocate might aſk of the Witneſs. The Preſident anſwer'd, I will aſk them. <hi>Q.</hi> Was you near the Admiral's Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, during, and after the Action, and did you obſerve his Behaviour? <hi>A.</hi> I was near him the whole Day of the Action. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you perceive any Backwardneſs in the Admiral during the Action, or any Marks of Fear or Confuſion, either from his Countenance or Behaviour? <hi>Q.</hi> He ſeem'd to me to give his Orders cooly and diſtinctly; and I don't ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend he was in the leaſt wanting in perſonal Courage. <hi>Q.</hi> Did the Admiral appear ſollicitous to engage the Enemy, and to aſſiſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Ships that were engaged with the Enemy? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. <hi>Q.</hi> Did you, on or after the Day of Action, hear any Murmuring or Diſcontent among the Officers or Men, upon any Suppoſition that the Admiral had not done his Duty? <hi>A.</hi> I never heard any one of the <hi>Ramillies</hi> ſpeak diſreſpectfully of the Admiral.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Smith,</hi> who was alſo upon the Quarter-Deck with the Admiral, confirmed the above in every Particular with this additional Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that a Shot from the Enemy paſſed between him and Lord <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> as they were a-baſt the Mainmaſt, which took off the Head of a Timber upon Deck, and went thro' the Hammocks in the Main Shrouds; ſaid, the Admiral ſhewed no Signs of Fear, but quite the Reverſe.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Edgar,</hi> who was quartered upon the Poop, confirmed ſuch of the above Circumſtances as came immediately under his own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but was not aſked any Queſtions relative to the perſonal Behaviour of the Admiral, his Situation not giving him an Opportunity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> being ſworn, ſaid, that lie was on Board the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> could give no Account of the Action, and was willing to anſwer any Queſtions the Court demanded, or Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> would propoſe; but none were aſk'd.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Gough</hi> firſt Lieutenant of the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> being ſworn, ſaid, That at the Time of the Signal being made for engaging, the Fleet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007892_0025_102DC79CAB42FB50"/>
in a cloſe and regular Line; that two Ships, which he believed to be the <hi>Trident</hi> and <hi>Louiſa,</hi> were under their Lee-Bow; could not ſay at what Diſtance the <hi>Ramillies</hi> was from the Enemy at the Time of the Signal for engaging, being moſtly at his Quarters, but believed when they began to engage, they were nearly at Point-Blank with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Beſſet,</hi> Second Lieutenant, being quartered upon the Lower-Deck, could not anſwer to the Diſtance, nor how long they continued firing; ſaid, that ſeveral of the Enemy's Shot ſtruck the Sides of the <hi>Ramillies;</hi> and one in particular cut one of the Hinges of the Ports cloſe to him, but did not afterwards go thro' her Sides; but muſt have done ſo it had been properly loaded. He alſo ſaid, that as the Enemy's Shot reached the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> he doubted not but her Shot reached them alſo.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Welbey,</hi> Third Lieutenant of the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> quartered upon the Middle Deck, ſaid, that the <hi>Ramillies</hi> was bearing down when the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was made; that he was ordered to double-ſhot the Guns, for the Admiral did not intend to fire all he came cloſe up with the Enemy, and confirmed the above Teſtimony of a Ship or Ships being on their Lee-bow; agreed there was a commanding Breeze, and if all their Sails had been ſet, they ſhould have been cloſer to the Enemy, and ſaid, he believed they were within half a Mile of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> the Fourth Lieutenant, was called, but not being on board, Mr. <hi>Waterfall,</hi> the Fifth Lieutenant, was examined, who ſaid, he was quartered on the Lower-Deck, knew not the Diſtance from the Enemy, but apprehended they were within proper Diſtance for Engaging; that he received Orders by Lord <hi>Robert Berlie,</hi> to leave off firing on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Ship on the Lee-bow.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Sixth Lieutenant of the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> who was quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the upper Gun-Deck, by the Mainmaſt forward, confirmed the preceeding Teſtimony chiefly, and ſaid, when the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> begun to bear down, it might be about two Miles Diſtance, and was at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about half a Mile when they began to fire; ſaid, that thro' the Smoak he diſcovered the <hi>Trident</hi>'s red Stern, and Part of her blue Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and that ſhe was then upon her Lee-bow very near.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday,</hi> 13. Lieut. <hi>Clark</hi> was examined, whoſe Evidence agreed in general with the other Lieutenants. The Carpenter of the <hi>Intrepid</hi> was ſworn, and was aſked but one Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> If he could juſtify the Defects of the Ship, as he had given them in? which he anſwering poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in the Affirmative, the Court diſcharged him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007892_0026_102DF70FD20791F0"/>
The Gunner of the <hi>Ramillies</hi> was examined as to the Powder expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Day, who anſwered 20 Barrels, and 300 double-headed Shot. He was much confuſed, and ſaid, the <hi>Intrepid</hi> was in their Way, and they could not bear down; but was told, he could not be Judge of that, being quartered on the Lower Gun-Deck. The Carpenter ſaid, he could give no Account, being at his Duty in the Wings. The Boatſwain ſaid, he was minding his Rigging, and therefore could give no Account of the Matter. The Maſter gave his Evidence very confuſedly, and by ſaying and unſaying, did the Admiral more Detriment than Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> 14. Several Midſhipmen were examined, and the Surgeon of the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> whoſe Evidence was not very material one way or the other. Capt. <hi>H. Ward,</hi> of the <hi>Culloden,</hi> was likewiſe examined, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Admiral was retarded by backing his Top-ſails near or quite half an Hour; and that had the Admiral ſet more ſail at firſt, and bore down upon the Enemy, it was his Opinion, they might have taken every Ship. After him, ſeveral of his Lieutenants were examined, who all depoſed to the very ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday,</hi> 15. Capt. <hi>Perry,</hi> was examined, whoſe Evidence was near the ſame with the reſt of the Captains, <hi>viz.</hi> that he thought the Admiral might have carried his Top-gallant Sails that Day.</p>
            <p>Here the Evidence for the King was cloſed by the Judge Advocate, and the Court adjourned to <hi>Monday</hi> Morning nine o'Clock, when Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Byng</hi> was to begin his Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday,</hi> 17. Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> appeared to make his Defence; but nothing material was done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday,</hi> 18. Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> delivered his Defence into Court, which was read by the Judge Advocate, in which he took Notice of the many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities which he had undergone, by an enraged and deluded People; that he had been treated like a Felon; had been hanged and burnt in Effigy; his Perſon cloſely confined, and the Windows of his Priſon bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricaded. He then obſerved to the Court, That he humbly preſumed, no Proof had been given againſt him of any unneceſſary Delay in the Fleet's ſailing to <hi>Minorca,</hi> nor of his diſcovering any Backwardneſs or Signs of Fear, againſt engaging the Enemy; therefore moved the Court to give their Opinion thereon, as it might be a Means in ſaving ſome Time in the Courſe of his Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[The Defence is annexed to the Trial.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007892_0027_102DF7128E386180"/>
The Court was then ordered to be cleared upon this Motion, and in about an Hour and a Half was opened again. The Judge Advocate then read the unanimous Reſolution of the Court; which was, That they could not give any Opinion till the Witneſſes in his Defence were examined. Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> then called Capt. <hi>Gardiner</hi> again, and aſked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Queſtions, moſt of which being Matter of Opinion, he begged Leave to refer them to the Court. Capt. <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Croſs-Examination being gone through, the Court aſked Mr. <hi>Byng,</hi> Who he ſhould have Occaſion to call To-morrow? He replied, Capt, <hi>Amburſt, Hervey</hi> and <hi>Phillips.</hi> The Court then adjourned till next Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> 19. Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> delivered a Paper, declaring he had no more Evidence to produce but his Secretary, and would give the Court no farther Trouble; and likewiſe ſaid, That his not going down to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Enemy, was not owing to his Want of Courage, but muſt be an Error in his Judgment. The Admiral having nothing more to ſay in his Defence, the Court cloſed. The next Morning the Members of the Court met, in order to reviſe the Evidence that had been given by the Witneſſes during the Courſe of this long Trial, to conſider the Strength of the Proofs for and againſt him, and to paſs ſuch an equitable Sentence as might do Juſtice both to their Country and the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>Full eight Days were taken up in canvaſſing the Proceedings; and the Variety of the Evidence gave Occaſion for ſeveral warm Debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and they were a good while divided in their Opinions as to his Guilt or Innocence. Five of them found him guilty of the whole Charge, and conſequently that he ought to ſuffer Death. Four of them were only for breaking him, and thought the Loſs of his Commiſſion was a ſufficient Puniſhment. And four of them were for entirely acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him. But as they could not deviate from the Articles of War, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by Act of Parliament, they at length unanimouſly agreed to Thirty-Six Reſolutions. <hi>[See</hi> Page 34. <hi>after the Admiral's Defence.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following Letters were ſent to the Secretary's Office, who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to the Preſident of the Court-Martial at <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> The firſt was wrote in Engliſh by the celebrated M. <hi>Voltaire,</hi> and directed to Admiral <hi>Byng.</hi> The other the Tranſlation of a Letter in French from the Marſhal D. <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and ſent to M. <hi>Voltaire.</hi> But with what View they were wrote is not eaſy to be conceived. Surely theſe Gentlemen muſt have very mean and unworthy Notions of Engliſh Equity and Juſtice, to ſuppoſe that his Judges would condemn him, unleſs on the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007892_0028_102DF714B79E20F0"/>
Teſtimony of unexceptionable Evidence; or that they were not as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to acquit as to puniſh him. Or, rather, is it not a <hi>French</hi> Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conade, to magnify the Bravery of their Fleet, and banter the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for their Folly and Temerity in pretending to cope with a Power ſo much their ſuperior? In whatever Light we view theſe Letters, we plainly diſcover the Impertinence and Inſult of their Writers. If the <hi>French</hi> were really victorious, as the Marſhal has the Front to affirm, how came they to quit the Field of Battle, and not return to ſee what was become of their Enemy? Or, for what other Reaſon than their Miſbehaviour in the Engagement, did they break four of their Captains immediately on their Arrival at <hi>Marſeilles?</hi> But let the Reader judge for himſelf, after he has peruſed the two following Letters.</p>

                  <p>I Am very ſenſibly concerned for Admiral <hi>Byng:</hi> I do aſſure you whatever I have ſeen or heard of him does him Honour. After having done all that Man could reaſonably expect from him, he ought not to be cenſured for ſuffering a Defeat. When two Commanders contend for Victory, though both are equally Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet one muſt neceſſarily be worſted, and there is nothing againſt Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> but his being worſted; for his whole Conduct was that of an able Seaman, and is juſtly worthy of Admiration. The Strength of the two Fleets was at leaſt equal; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had thirteen Ships, and we twelve much better furniſhed and much cleaner. Fortune that preſides over all Battles, and eſpecially thoſe that are fought at Sea, was more favourable to us than our Adverſaries, by ſending our Balls into their Ships with greater Execution. I am perſuaded, and it is the general received O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had obſtinately continued the Engagement, their whole Fleet would have been deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, there can be no higher Act of Injuſtice than what is new attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Admiral <hi>Byng,</hi> and all Men of Honour, and all Gentlemen of the Army, are particularly intereſted in the Event.</p>
