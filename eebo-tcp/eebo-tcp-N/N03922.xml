            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do here preſent you with that <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> which I delivered unto you, upon the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> of One of your <hi>Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> by that fatal Sickneſs (as we ſuppoſed) of the <hi>Throat-Diſtemper;</hi> and which you ſo earneſtly deſired might be made Publick.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, that it was with ſome <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> I brought my ſelf to be willing to ſuffer this Diſcourſe to appear in Print, as thinking, that it wanted many <hi>Ornaments,</hi> to render it acceptable, nor was well eno' <hi>Labour'd</hi> to be made publick; and there were already many
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004829_0004_100DFCF90165B250"/>Exhortations to early Piety publiſhed, done by able Hands, after whoſe, I might be aſham'd, that mine ſhould be read.</p>
            <p>But then, when I conſidered the particular <hi>Occaſion</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of this Diſcourſe, I was fain to own it was yours; and dare not deny you the Uſe and Improvement of it. It was at your <hi>Motion</hi> &amp; <hi>Deſire,</hi> that at <hi>that Time,</hi> I made a Diſcourſe to you: The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Time were ſuch, that I could not but be pleaſed with the Motion; it ſeem'd as if there was the Hand of Heaven in it; I could not but think my ſelf obliged from Duty to comply with the Motion. And as God was pleaſed to make the Diſcourſe <hi>Acceptable</hi> to you, and you ſtill asked my Conſent for the Publication of it, <hi>for your further Uſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,</hi> it ſeem'd as if Providence made it my Duty, ſtill to comply: I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider my ſelf as your Servant, in the Cauſe of Chriſt and your Souls, and not own my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to gratify You.</p>
            <p>Such therefore, as it is, a Serious, Plain Diſcourſe, deſigned for the Benefit <hi>of Youthful Auditors,</hi> deſtitute of the Ornaments of a beautiful Stile or any well ſtudied Method, it is offered unto you.</p>

               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004829_0004_100DFCF90165B250"/>
And, as you have deſired the Publication of it <hi>for your Benefit,</hi> ſo I hope, you will conſider, that I may, juſtly expect from you, a ſerious Improvement of it; and, if you make not a good Uſe of it, may charge you with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kon my ſelf abuſed by you, as well as be diſappointed in all the Hope and Encouragement I had of ſeeing you excited to early Piety.</p>
            <p>Nor may you think, that you make any good Uſe of ſuch a ſerious Warning and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, as this is, if you indulge your ſelves in Youthful Vanities and Sins, put off the Work of Repentance till a Hereafter, and ſtill live without God in the World, — Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Unconverted.</p>
            <p>GOD forbid then, that any of You, who have <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rged</hi> the Publication of this for your <hi>Improvement,</hi> as tho' you were reſolved to make a good Uſe of it, ſhould ſtill, after the Reading of it, be found walking in the Ways of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Heart, pleaſing your ſelves in the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paths of Sin, ſaying, <hi>You ſhall have Peace, though you walk in the Imagination of your Hearts, to add</hi> Sin to Sin.</p>
            <p>I have one Thing to add by way of <hi>Caution, viz.</hi> That you take Heed of ſaying, that <hi>the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004829_0005_100DFCFB55DB46A0"/>Bitterneſs of Death is paſt,</hi> and the Danger over, <hi>becauſe the ſeared Diſtemper,</hi> ſince the Death of the juſtly remembred Youth, who was taken from us, <hi>hath not prevailed among us.</hi> For if GOD is gracious and ſpares a little while, are You ſure, he will ſpare for ever? Are you ſure that, if GOD ſeeth you hardening your ſelves, the Diſtemper ſhall not be ſent again? Is it not poſſible, that GOD be provoked to give a new Commiſſion to the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel? Or, will not the affrighting Sickneſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend GOD's ſovereign Order, and go when and where he bids it? Or, if you ſhall not be viſited with this Sickneſs, hath GOD no other Judgments, with which to plead againſt ſecure and provoking Sinners? Have you never known a Young Perſon haſtened from among the Living, to the Number of the Dend by any other Sickneſs? Hath GOD but one way <hi>to puniſh the Inhabitants of the Earth?</hi> If GOD ſhall not make your outward Man a Theatre of any remarkable Plagues &amp; waſting Sorrows, yet, are you ſure, he will not inflict many ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Miſeries upon your Souls? Or, are not ſpiritual Plagues as formidable, as thoſe that are inflicted upon the Body? If an offended GOD gives you over for incorrigible, puniſhes you with Hardneſs of Heart, and ſaith, <hi>Why ſhould you be ſtricken any more?</hi> Would not this be ſad and amazing?</p>

Anſwer theſe Quaeries ſo as to diſcover any Knowlege or Reaſon, and you will ſee, that you are never out of Danger, till lodged under the Wings of the ALMIGHTY.</p>
            <p>I add no more, but my ſincere <hi>Wiſh,</hi> &amp; <hi>Prayer</hi> unto Almighty GOD, that this weak Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour may be bleſſed to the ſaving Advantage of your Souls, and you <hi>by this and other Means</hi> under the Powerful Preſence and Influence of the Holy Spirit, may be perſwaded to an <hi>early Choice of,</hi> and <hi>ſtedfaſt adherence to</hi> the Ways of Religion; that ſo you may be a pious and a happy Generation; <hi>hoping for,</hi> and <hi>earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring your Remembrance of me always</hi> in your Prayers,</p>

            <p>ISHALL not make any <hi>Apology</hi> here, for <hi>Appearing</hi> thus in <hi>Publick,</hi> nor any <hi>Excuſe</hi> for my <hi>Method, Weakneſs, Deficiencies, &amp;c.</hi> I only purpose to give a brief <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> of it; which a Stranger will find alluded to in the Diſcourſe, but not be thoroughly acquainted with.</p>
            <p>He muſt be a Stranger indeed in theſe Parts of the World, who hath not heard of the <hi>Deſolations</hi> made in ſundry Parts of the Country, by that Diſtemper, that is uſually called, The <hi>Throat-Diſtemper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near Five Years ago, we in this Pariſh were <hi>Viſited</hi> with the ſame; and ſundry very pleaſant and hopeful Young Perſons were taken away.</p>
            <p>Since which Time, we have had an Account of more <hi>awful Deſolations</hi> made by it, in many <hi>Other Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near the Latter End of <hi>July</hi> laſt, a very hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſerious and likely Young Perſon, Named
<pb facs="unknown:004829_0006_100DFCFCFB19C6A8"/>
               <hi>Prudence Biſhop,</hi> the Eldeſt Daughter of Mr. <hi>John Biſhop,</hi> was taken <hi>Sick</hi> amongſt us; At firſt indeed, we hoped, that her Sickneſs might be only a hard Cold, a common ſore Throat attended with a Feaver, Or the Effects of the Raſh, as we called a Diſtemper, that was then among us.</p>
            <p>But her Sickneſs preſently increaſed, and ſhe was brought into uncommon Difficulty and Diſtreſs. The juſtly <hi>Famous and well known Phyſician</hi> of theſe Parts was conſulted; who judged her <hi>Sickneſs</hi> to be the <hi>Throat-Diſtemper.</hi> And to be ſhort, the Diſtemper made <hi>Quick</hi> Work and carried her off, <hi>Auguſt 2d,</hi> and her Corps was interred on Lords-Day, <hi>Auguſt 3d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Young Perſon gave us Ground to hope, that the Lord had been merciful to her Soul; begun and carried on a good Work of Grace in her: ſo that we could hope, that <hi>for ther to die was Gain:</hi> But then, it ſeem'd a dark <hi>Omen</hi> to the <hi>Living,</hi> and a loud <hi>Warning</hi> to our <hi>Surviving</hi> Youth <hi>to be alſo ready.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before this happened, our Young People had agreed among Themſelves, to Meet together on Tueſday, the <hi>Fifth Day of Auguſt,</hi> for Youthful <hi>Diverſion</hi> and <hi>Recreation;</hi> Or to uſe their own <hi>Terms,</hi> had agreed it ſhould be a Day of <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licking</hi> among Them.</p>

But Struck with this <hi>Sudden Death</hi> of one of their Number, and Alarumed with the Thought of ſuch a <hi>Sweeping Diſtemper</hi>'s Entring the Place <hi>the Second Time,</hi> Many of them get together at the Funeral, and agree to <hi>deſire</hi> me to give them an <hi>Exhortation,</hi> in the Houſe of God, on ſaid Tueſday, <hi>before intended for Mirth and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accordingly,</hi> On the Evening following the Sabbath, ſome appointed by the Reſt came, and informed me of their Deſign of <hi>Turning their Meeting,</hi> before deſigned for Diverſion, <hi>into a Religious Meeting;</hi> and deſired my <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> and a Word of <hi>Exhortation:</hi>
            </p>

            <p>SO great is the Corruption, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravedneſs of the Humane Nature, that a ſpirit of Vanity and Sin, and an Inclination to depart from the Living GOD, are become natural to Men.</p>
            <p>Hence, perhaps there hath not been found any Nation or people, of any long Standing upon the Face of the Earth, who have not run ſuch a length in Sin and Wickedneſs, and ſo increaſed their Iniquities, as to render it neceſſary, for the Vindication of the Divine Providence and Perfections, that awful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be ſent upon them, to be Teſtimonies from Heaven for GOD, and againſt impious blaſpheming Mortals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:004829_0008_100DFD01072BD4A8"/>
Indeed GOD is abundantly, yea infinitely good; he is kind to the rebellious Nations, and doth not at once <hi>ſtir up all his Wrath.</hi> But yet, if he ſpares for the Preſent, and <hi>being full of Compaſſion</hi> does not ſpeedily raiſe up Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to deſtroy them, he doth not forget their Wickedneſs and Sins, but writes them down in his Book; and when their Iniquities are ripe, he will viſit their Sin upon Them. <hi>Exod. xxxii.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>So the Prophet Amos in the Name of the LORD, aſſures the great and populous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which then were famous in the World, that they had Iniquities remembred by GOD, that muſt, when they had filled up their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, be puniſhed upon them. See <hi>Chap. i</hi> &amp; <hi>ii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judah and Iſrael, tho' they were the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People of God, the ſingularly favoured of Heaven, have their Sins remembred before GOD, as well as the Other Nations; and ſo might expect that a Woe-Day would ſooner or later come upon them, <hi>Chap. ii.</hi> 4—8. Yea, the Sins of Theſe eſpecially needed to be puniſhed upon Them: For GOD had done more for them than Others; laid them under ſtronger Obligations: So that their Sins were attended with very aggravating Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſhewed more Ingratitude, Unkindneſs and Stubbornneſs; were greater Affronts to an indulgent Heaven, <hi>Chap. ii.</hi> 9—13.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004829_0008_100DFD01072BD4A8"/>
The Prophet, in our Context, in the Name of the LORD, declares the Neceſſity and Certainty of GOD's Judgments againſt his own backſlidden and greatly provoking People of Iſrael; tells them, that as GOD hath been eſpecially good to them, ſo their Sins eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially call for Puniſhment; as he had peculiarly undertook the Care &amp; Government of them, and made them in a peculiar Manner his own Family, ſo it was but congruous and fitting, that he ſhould ſee the Laws of his Family executed upon Them; correct them for their Offences, and puniſh them for their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. 'Tis indeed neceſſary, that they be forſaken and left of God, and given up to Miſery and Evil, when their Ways are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and provoking to God; when they deſpiſe his Laws, and give him no becoming Reverence and Glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Can Two walk together, except they be agreed?</hi> Can any Two walk together, and ſo have Communion and Fellowſhip one with the Other, when they are not enough of one mind to walk the ſame Way, or take the ſame Courſe? The Similitude is eaſily applied; when GOD and his People are contrary one to the other, there is no Communion between them: In this Caſe, as they walk contrary to GOD, ſo he to them; and that implies his Forſaking and Puniſhing them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004829_0009_100DFD0329D33EB0"/>
And as 'tis neceſſary that they be puniſhed for their Iniquities, ſo 'tis certain, that the LORD is offended, and about to puniſh them; And therefore they may be ſure, that there are Sins found with them, rendring this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. <hi>A Lion will not roar in the Foreſt,</hi> nor <hi>a young Lion cry out of his Den,</hi> for Nothing; <hi>a Bird is not caught without ſome Sanre or Gin; and no Man will think it worth his while to take up a Snare that has taken Nothing:</hi> In every one of theſe Inſtances, whither a Lion's Roaring, a Young Lion's Crying, a Bird's being caught, or a Snare taken from the Earth, there is ſome Reaſon and Occaſion for the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. In which the Prophet ſeems to lead us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there is Nothing done by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of any Agent, without ſome Reaſon or moving Occaſion: And his Intention doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is, to convince us, that God does not threaten, nor ſend his Judgments for Nothing, or without any Cauſe: So that, if God utters his Voice, brings any Judgments upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they may Konw, that there is ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore; God is offended, and is about to puniſh them for their Iniquities; and that therefore it becometh them to <hi>prepare to meet God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſame Thing, the Prophet in a moſt convincing Way, further inſiſts upon in our Text: <hi>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004829_0009_100DFD0329D33EB0"/>
               <hi>the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid?</hi> Shall there be an Alarum given, and the People take no Notice, nor be concerred? When a Trumpet is ſounded for ſuch an End, men conclude there is Danger; their Hearts are preſently filled with Fear; they conclude there is not this Warning for Nothing The Deſign and Application of this is eaſily ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> That if God has ſounded his Trumpet, given an Alarum, there is good Reaſon to conclude it is not for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but he warns us that he is coming forth in the Way of his Judgments; and it concerns us to be ready to meet Him.</p>
            <p>But perhaps this would not be convincing to ſome, except they better underſtood what Alarum was given by God, or what Trumpet of the Lord had been blown amongſt them: They had heard, perhaps they would ſay, No Voice from Heaven; knew not of any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God had given them that might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Trumpet ſounding an Alarm.</p>
            <p>To inform the Minds of ſuch, and faſten the Conviction, 'tis added, <hi>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the LORD hath not done it?</hi> Shall there be any Judgments in the City, any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and the LORD not have a Hand in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004829_0010_100DFD04CFC22630"/>the ſame? If there be Evils, any ſore Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or any terrible Providences, are not theſe the Doings of the LORD? By theſe God ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his Voice, warns and threatens you.</p>
            <p>From which Words thus opened, we may gather theſe Things as plainly implied and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated in them, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <item>
                  <hi>III.</hi> That it is the Duty of All, when GOD warns them in the Way of his Providence, to take the Warning, hear the Voice, fear the Danger, and endeavour to Eſcape it: The Simile made uſe of and improved upon this Occaſion, plainly teacheth us, that as a People, who hear the Trumpet ſounding an Alarm, fearing the Danger betake themſelves to their Arms or Forts ſo ſhould a People take War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Trumpet of the LORD; be afraid of approaching Danger, and prepare to meet Him.</item>

            <p>Theſe Things, we purpoſe at this Time, to conſider, as ſo many Doctrinal Propoſitions.</p>

I. <hi>GOD hath an holy Hand in all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, brought upon us or our Friends.</hi> Nothing is more Evident, than that the ſame Almighty Being, who at firſt commanded the univerſal World to exiſt, exerciſeth a Providence over the World he hath made This may be proved from the Perfections of the Deity, from the neceſſary Dependence of the Creature upon the Creator, from the continued Harmony and Order in the Viſible World, and from Tokens of the Preſence &amp; over-ruling Power of GOD in Providences that happen:</p>
               <p>But at this Time, it is not our Deſign to offer Proofs for a Divine Providence; but to conſider the Extenſiveneſs of GOD's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Many allow that GOD exerciſeth a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World, who yet have but ſtingy Tho'ts of his Providence: They allow, that he beholds the Children of Men from the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his Throne; takes Notice how Things are managed in the World; doth Good to his Friends; yea, is kind to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>to the Evil and Vnthankful;</hi> ſometimes alſo, he frowns upon the Workers of Iniquity: They look for a Time alſo, when he will gloriouſly reward his Friends with immortal Bleſſings, and ſpurn his Enemies from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence into outer Darkneſs and everlaſting Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004829_0011_100DFD06DCCC5C38"/>But yet, there are a Thouſand Things happening in Providence, that they don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Almighty as having any Thing to do with, only as a Spectator.</p>
               <p>But, if we well conſider Things, we ſhall find the Providence of GOD to be more extenſive than ſuch imagine; yea that it extends to all Things, and all the Accidents and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending Them. What we call natural or ſecond Cauſes, are conducted and influenced by GOD's Providence: 'Tis by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the regular Returns of Day and Night, and the Succeſſions of Summer and Winter are made. 'Tis by his Providence, that <hi>the Sun ſhines upon the Good and Bad, Mat. v.</hi> 45. 'Tis by his Providence, that <hi>the Heavens are covered with Clouds, and the Rain prepared for the Earth, Pſal exlvii</hi> &amp;. And even thoſe Events, that to us may ſeem caſual and fortuitous, are ordered and over-ruled by his Providence; So we are informed, <hi>Prov. xvi.</hi> 33 <hi>The Lot is caſt into the lap; but the whole Dispoſing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> And altho' it be true, that there are ſome Events, which happen by the Deſign of rational created Agents, yet theſe alſo are over-ruled by Divine Providence: If any ſuch Agents do us Good, we ſhould conſider them as Inſtruments, which God improves; and if we ſuffer Evil from them, they are the Rods, wherewith the Almighty pleaſeth to correct
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004829_0011_100DFD06DCCC5C38"/>us. Thus the Aſſyrian, that had it in his Heart to deſtroy, and grievouſly wounded Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael is called <hi>the Rod of God's Anger;</hi> and <hi>the Staff in their Hand is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>his Indignation, Iſa. x</hi> 5 The deſtroying Aſſyrian is again compared, <hi>to the Ax in</hi> the Hand <hi>of him that hewith therewith,</hi> and <hi>to a Saw ſhaken</hi> or <hi>liſted up by him,</hi> that maketh uſe of the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Again, he is compared <hi>to a Razor that is hired,</hi> in the Hand of him that ſhaveth, <hi>Iſa. vii.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole then, let us meet with what Things ſoever in the World, and from what Cauſe ſoever, the Hand of GOD is to be acknowleged in the ſame; whither good or evil Things b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l us, GOD's Providence is ſtill concerned in the ſame: <hi>I form the Light,</hi> ſaith the LORD, <hi>and create Darkneſs: I make Peace, and create Evil: I the</hi> LORD <hi>do all theſe Things, Iſa, xlv</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Not only then, are we to acknowlege the Hand of God in all our Bleſſings but, if there be any Evil in the City, we are to acknowlege, <hi>GOD hath done it;</hi> if there be any ſore Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heavy Calamity, any Sickneſs or Death amongſt us, there is the Hand of the Lord in the ſame. So doubtleſs, Eliphaz underſtood the Matter, when he ſaith, <hi>Job v.</hi> 6. <hi>Affliction cometh not forth of the Duſt; neither doth Trouble Bring out of the Ground:</hi> And therefore, as for himſelf, he ſays, if at any Time he ſhould be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004829_0012_100DFD09B3285FE0"/>brought into Affliction, <hi>he would ſeek unto GOD and unto GOD he would commit his Cauſe, ver</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>But we proceed to conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">II. That <hi>One End of</hi> GOD's <hi>Judgments, is, to be the Warning of a People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judgments of GOD may be conſidered as his awakening Voice to a ſtupid World: They are Signs or Effects and Fruits of his Anger againſt Sin; Tokens from GOD that Sin ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle makes the Judgments of GOD brought upon any, even in diſtant Ages, that come to our Ears, to be our <hi>Examples,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned for our Admonition,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. x.</hi> 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Apoſtle Jude makes the Fall and Miſery of the Angels to be Warnings to us, <hi>Jude,</hi> 5, 6, And tells us, <hi>That Sodom and Gomor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ha, and the Cities about them, are ſet forth for an Example, ſuffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire, ver.</hi> 7. So the Apoſtle Peter repreſents <hi>the Bringing in the Flood of old upon the World,</hi> to be a Warning to all that hear of the ſame, 2 <hi>Pet. ii.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And, if the Judgments of GOD, that we hear of in ſuch diſtant Ages, have ſuch a ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voice, how much more the Judgments of GOD that are juſt at Hand, and fall within our Sight? Moſes ſeem'd to think, that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD, that fall out within the Sight
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004829_0012_100DFD09B3285FE0"/>and Knowlege of Any, have a clearer Voice than thoſe we hear to have been in diſtant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Deut. ii.</hi> 2,—7 <hi>Know ye this Day: for I ſpeak not with your Children which have not known and which have not ſeen the Chaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>GOD's Judgments then, that overtake us, in our Perſons, Families or Friends, are a loud Warning to us of the Danger of Abiding in Sin, and of the Neceſſity of hiding our ſelves under the Wings of the ALMIGHTY, before the Floods of Divine Indignation come upon us. Thus GOD's Judgments are called <hi>his Voice crying unto the City, Mic. vi.</hi> 9. Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet repreſents the Moſt HIGH, as uttering a mighty Voice, and ſpeaking very loud to Men in the Way of his Judgments; <hi>Jer. xxv.</hi> 29, 30, 31. <hi>Lo, I begin to bring Evil on the City which is called by my Name, and ſhould ye be utterly unpuniſhed? Ye ſhall not be unpuniſhed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propheſie, and ſay unto them, The</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall rore from on High, and utter his Voice from his holy Habitation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We come now to conſider,</p>
               <p n="3">III. That <hi>it is the Duty of All, when GOD warns them in the Way of his Providence, to take the Warning, hear the Voice, fear the Danger,</hi> and <hi>endeavour to eſcape it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

When the LORD's Voice cryeth to the City, <hi>the Man of Wiſdom will hear, Mic. vi</hi> 9. If GOD ſends his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this End, <hi>Namely,</hi> to be a Warning to a careleſs World, it is evident, that Sin will lie at the Door of thoſe, that receive not Warning: For we then only comply with the Deſign of God in his Judgments, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Hand, hearken to his Voice, and do our beſt to be ready to meet him, that we may eſcape the ſeverer Judgments of Heaven, and be hid in the Day of the LORD's Anger.</p>
               <p>Indeed, this Propoſition is ſo evident from what has been offered under the fore-going and from the End and Deſign of GOD's Judgments, that I need not detain you to offer any Thing more in Confirmation of it: For ſhall GOD himſelf give us Warning, and we not think out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to receive it? Shall GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf blow his Trumpet and we not be afraid When the Almighty gives Notice, that <hi>he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Wrath for his Enemies, and the Day of the Lord haſteth,</hi> ſhall we not think it reaſonable, that <hi>moved with Fear,</hi> if it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Young People are ſtrangely apt to imagine a <hi>more convenisent Seaſon</hi> before them; but 'tis a Deluſion, and ungrounded Imagination. The Time of Youth is really the beſt Time for this Work.</p>
               <p>GOD directs his Offers of Mercy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to Young Perſons: He calls to them in a partcular Manner to come and partake of his Love; <hi>Paſal. xxxiv.</hi> 11. <hi>Come, ye Children, hearken unto me, &amp;c.</hi> See alſo <hi>Eccl.xii.</hi> 1. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, there is not ſo much contracted Obſtinacy in the Hearts of Youth, as in thoſe of more advanced Years. Not but that they have natural Corruption and Principles of Sin in them, as well as Others; and Hearts ſo hard, as to need an Omnipotent Power to ſoften the ſame. But yet there is an incereaſing Obſtinacy in the Hearts of Men; and Young Perſons have not made ſuch Advances in it, as by longer Continuance in Sin, they will arrive unto. But then by every Day's continuance in Sin, this will increaſe upon Them; the Heart will grow more harden'd againſt the Counſels of Grace, more ſet againſt Religion and averſe to a Compliance with the Term of Peace; Repentance will become more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and Hazardous: <hi>Jer xiii 23. Can the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? then may ye alſo do Good, that are accuſtomed to do Evil.</hi>

                  <hi>Again,</hi> the Encumbrances of Life increaſe upon Perſons, as they increaſe in Years.

               <p>Nor may we expect to be freer from Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to delay, and put off this Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hereafter than now. There will be as many Temptations hereafter, ſtill to put off, without any doubt, as now. Delaying will not make it better, but worſes upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

And is it any better upon that Account now, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Are there not as ſtrong Temptations to defer as ever? And ſo you may expect there will be, if you delay longer.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>If you will not hearken to the Counſels of GOD, nor take Warning by his Judgmens, who know but GOD will ſay in righteous Judgment, Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more, an leave you in the Congregation of dead Souls?</hi> It would be but a righteous Retribution, if we reſolve to delay the Work of Repentance any longer, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our Hearts againſt the Warnings of God,

               </p>
               <p>And how ſad a Judgment would this be? Then we might <hi>hear indeed, and underſtand not, ſee but perceive not:</hi> Then, if we remain'd longer in the World, we ſhould be but like the barren Fig-tree, <hi>upon which no Fruit grew:</hi> Or like <hi>the dejected Earth, which beareth Thorns and Briars; whoſe End is to be burned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have thus been left of God. — So when GOD had Counſelled and warned Iſrael, and it proved to no Purpoſe; he righteouſly <hi>gave them up to their own Hearts Luſts, and ſaid, Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? Ye will revolt more and more, Iſa. i.</hi> 5. And ſo ſomtimes, he lets Perſons alone to go on in their own Ways; takes away his holy Spirit, and ſtrives no more with them.</p>
               <p>And it hath been ſomtimes obſerved, that when GOD begins early to warn Perſons, and to ſtrive with them by his Spirit, if his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings be ſlighted, and the Strivings of his Spirit reſiſted, GOD early leaves them, and takes away his holy Spirit from them.</p>
               <p>Thus Many, who have had awakening Means, and the Strivings of GOD's Spirit in their Youth, have been left when they advance
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004829_0024_100DFD249347BEC8"/>in Years, and ſuffered to walk in their own Counſels all their days. O then whil'ſt GOD warns, whil'ſt his Spirit ſtrives, whil'ſt we have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before I conclude this Diſcourſe, let me plead with all the Earneſtneſs I poſſibly can; and Oh! that I could do it in a more moving Way, and in a deeper Senſe of the Worth of your Souls!

Why will you ſo expoſe your precious, immortal Souls, and abide in the Way of GOD's Indignation? Why will you run ſo dreadful a Venture of Meeting the Almigh cloathed with Vengeance, and armed with the Inſtruments of his devouring Wrath? Oh! conſider the awful and amazing Threatnings againſt the Sinner; open your Eyes, behold the preparing Storm of Wrath! ſee the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Clouds! and who ſhall be able to abide the Storm, or ſtand before the Indignation? <hi>Whoſe Heart can endure,</hi> or <hi>Hands be ſtrong,</hi> when he comes forth <hi>in the Fierceneſs of his Anger,</hi> the <hi>Mountains</hi> ſhaking, the <hi>Hills</hi> moving, the <hi>Earth</hi> trembling <hi>at his Preſence, Yea, the World, and all that dwell therein?</hi> I hope, that None of you, the Youth of my Charge &amp; Love, will harden your ſelves againſt the threatned Vengeance, and the Terrors of GOD's Wrath: For, alas! how ſoon, when the threatned Storm ſhall come, will your Countenances change, your Courage fail, and you cry for Mercy, and wiſh you had hearkened and prepared your ſelves to meet the LORD? I hope you may never know by Experience the Dreadfulneſs of being purſued, overtaken &amp; bor'n down by the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of an angry GOD, as his implacable &amp; obſtinate Enemies muſt.
