            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <stage>And then he delivered the three Strings to the Governour.</stage>
               <p>The Governour ſent for Three of Us, but uſually more of us come than are ſent for, we are Eight inſtead of Three.

               <p>We deſire nothing may be taken amiſs by Your Excellency; if a wrong Word ſhould happen to fall from us, we deſire it may be taken up and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed; it is what has been uſual, and we deſire it may be ſo now.</p>
               <p>The Way is now clear, and the Door open for Freedom of Speech; but we have nothing to ſay at preſent. We were ſent for, and it is not cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary for thoſe that are drawn by the Hand to ſpeak firſt, and therefore wait to hear what Your Excellency has to ſay, and deſire You would pleaſe to appoint the time, when we ſhall be ready to attend.</p>

                  <p>THere has been a long Friendſhip between King GEORGE's Subjects, and the <hi>Five Nations</hi> from whence you originally came, and there was a ſpecial Covenant made between this Government and You (the <hi>Cagnawaga</hi> Indians) at <hi>Albany,</hi> eleven Years ago, which you on Your part as well as we on Ours, have faithfully obſerved hitherto; and we now readily acknowledge that you have

teſtified your Faithfulneſs in divers Inſtances of your Friendſhip; and I now come by the deſire of the People of this Government to renew that Covenant, and to brighten the Chain, that a good Underſtanding of Peace and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may be Cultivated and Continued for ever, that ſo the Children unborn may in times to come rejoyce in Our meeting together this day.</p>

And we give thanks to the Great GOD that has given Your Excellency and Our Brethren of the BROAD WAY, an Heart to continue of the ſame Mind as when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was entred into: We alſo rejoyce that GOD has continued Us of the ſame Mind, and that there is no ſeeking of any kind, but Good.</p>

If it ſhould be War, there is no queſtion but your Juſtice and Faith, as well as your Intereſt will hold you to Peace with us; You will be always honeſtly dealt with by Capt. <hi>Kellogg</hi> at the Truck Houſe, where you may have ſuch things as you need, at a cheaper rate than any others can or will let you have them.</p>
                  <p>It is with a great deal of Pleaſure I have undertaken the fatigue of this Journey to meet you here, and ſave you the trouble of going to <hi>Boſton.</hi> The Way to <hi>Boſton</hi> is open and clear, and I ſhall always be glad to ſee you there, whenever you pleaſe to come. On Monday I hope you will be ready to be going home, when you ſhall have Proviſion for your Journey: But you muſt dine with me to Morrow — when you ſhall have the Preſent, and take leave after dinner.</p>
