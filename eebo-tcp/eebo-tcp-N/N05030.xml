            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Author to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THIS HISTORICAL SUMMARY concerning the <hi>British</hi> Continent Plantations in <hi>North-America,</hi> we published in loose Sheets by way of Pamphlet, <hi>feuille volante,</hi> or <hi>los-blad</hi>; which in their Nature are temporary, and soon lost: but as it is generally well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it may be more permanent, we publish it in two large Octavo Volumes, each Volume divided into two Parts:</p>
            <p>Vol. I. Part 1. contains general Affairs, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Account of ancient and modern Colonies, the first Grants and settling of our Continent Colonies and <hi>West-India</hi> Islands, and the adjoining <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, with Remarks of various Natures.</p>
            <p>Vol. I. Part 2. contains, 1. The <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's-Bay</hi> Companies Settlements, Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Lodges, and their Fur and Skin-Trade. 2. <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Cod-Fishery. 3.

            </p>
            <p>Vol. II. Part 1. Concerning the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other <hi>British</hi> Provinces, Colonies, or Plantations in the Continent of <hi>North-America,</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:006307_0003_0F652D5D1BBA9260"/>
viz. <hi>New-Hampshire, Rhode-Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Connecticut, East</hi> and <hi>West-Iersies, Pensylvania</hi> higher and lower, <hi>Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vol. II. Part 2. is by way of Appendix, containing miscellaneous Affairs, such as the natural History, the Distempers at Times epidemical, and the endemial Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases in these various Climates, with their Paper-Currencies; as also some <hi>Addenda</hi> and <hi>Corrigenda,</hi> particularly, if by Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Freedoms used, any just Offence (<hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum est errare</hi>) is given to Person or Persons, it shall be candidly rectified.</p>
            <p>The Writer with Candour acknowledges that in the Affair of Commodore <hi>Knowles</hi>'s Impress in the Harbour of <hi>Boston,</hi> Nov. 1747, there was somewhat of passionate Warmth and Indiscretion, meerly in Affection to <hi>Boston,</hi> and Country of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> his <hi>Altera Patria</hi>; but not with Rancour or Malice, having no personal Acquaintance nor Dealings with Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>; therefore from common Fame, he (as Historians do) only narrate his <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Temper,</hi> his <hi>Severity</hi> in Discipline, and not so much <hi>Regard</hi> as some other Sea-Commanders have for the <hi>mercantile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:006307_0004_0F652D5DE48F5830"/>
by impressing their Men, when he thought the publick Service required it: His <hi>general Courage</hi> as a Sea-Officer is not questioned; the <hi>Insinuation</hi> concerning his <hi>personal Courage,</hi> has been construed <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss</hi>; the refusing of <hi>passionate Challenges</hi> from private Masters of Merchant Ships, whose Men he had impressed, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might deprive the Nation of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is <hi>no Slur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Writer declares that he had no other Intention, than by setting the Affair in a strong Light, to contribute towards extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Continent Colonies, particularly to <hi>New-England,</hi> a <hi>late Act of Parliament against impressing of Sailors</hi> in the Sugar West-India Islands. Therefore as this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was temporary, of no Use, and may give Offence, it is suppressed in the present Publication of this first Volume of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary. Admiral <hi>Knowles</hi> since he sail'd from <hi>Boston,</hi> has been happy in successful Expeditions, particularly in reducing the Fort of <hi>Port Louis</hi> of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> and in beating a superior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Spanish</hi> Squadron off the <hi>Havannah</hi>; he has been in a Course of <hi>Preferments</hi>; and prosperous as to his private Fortune.</p>

               <head>SECT. I. Concerning the Boundaries, between the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Settlements in <hi>NORTH-AMERICA.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS a Treaty of Peace seems to be upon the Anvil in <hi>Europe</hi> between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Matter of this Section, is to propose a Scheme (the more Proposals or Projections, the more Choice) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards determining and settling the Territorial Limits, and of an exclusive Indian Trade, between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in <hi>North-America.</hi> The Scheme must be short, else it will not be attended to, and therefore requires some previous Elucidations, and some short anticipating Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Things.</p>
               <p>Our principal Interest is to rival the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Trade and Navigation, without Distinction or Partiality to either. In this present War, the <hi>French</hi> Court seem to neglect their Colonies, Trade and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the principal Care of their late good and great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Cardinal <hi>de Fleury</hi>; and do run into their former Romantick Humour of Land-Conquests. This is the Opportunity to take the Advantage of their Inattention, more especially with Regard to <hi>North America,</hi> our present Subject.</p>
               <p>The FRENCH are the common Nusance and Disturbers of <hi>Europe,</hi> and will in a short Time become the same in <hi>America,</hi> if not mutilated at Home, and in <hi>America</hi> fenced off from us by Ditches and Walls, that is, by great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and impracticable Mountains. They are a numerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> powerful, rich and polite Nation, they have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us in three grand Articles.</p>

It therefore becomes the Representatives of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> narrowly to inspect into the Conduct of their Ministers, and other great Officers in Trust, especially in making Treaties with <hi>France</hi>; the infamous Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> 1713, was procured by the <hi>French</hi> Court bribing our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Administration, that Part of it relating to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Northern American Colonies,</hi> will in Time be their Ruin, if not rectified and explained. 2. <hi>By Custom Time out of Mind, they are above, and do upon all Occasions dispense with the Principles of Honesty and Honour</hi>; Supe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Germany.</hi> 3. The greatest and most essential real Article is, <hi>The Largeness of their Dominions in the best Country of</hi> Europe, and thereby are become an Overmatch for their Neighbours, and more capable of swarming into their Colonies than we are; in order to preserve a Ballance in <hi>Europe,</hi> they ought to be curtail'd or dismembred there, which will effectually at the same Time prevent their too great Growth in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Louisbourg</hi> being now in our Possession, there can be no great Difficulty in reducing of <hi>Canada</hi>: at present it is not populous (perhaps not exceeding 12,000 Men capable of marching) neither is it compact (from the Mouth of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> River to its Rise from <hi>Lake Ontario,</hi> at <hi>Fort Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenac</hi> are about 800 Miles;) and the <hi>French</hi> (without a Pun) are like Cocks which fight best upon their own Dunghill: Witness, their late Behaviour in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> their late <hi>Poltronnerie</hi> in <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and at Sea. <hi>Flanders</hi> is their own Dunghill, and perhapsfor politick Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Allies allow them to over-run it, it will be to them a chargeable Possession, and a Diminution of their Army in garrisoning of so many Towns: Thus by giving them Scope, they may run themselves out of Breath, that is, out of Men and Money, and become an easy Prey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> Islands and <hi>Canada</hi> being reduced, would be to us an immense Advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Monopoly</hi> of all the <hi>American</hi> Fish, Fur and Skins Trade, provided these Acquisitions could be annexed to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Possession: but unless in the present Treaty we could absolutely give the Law to <hi>France,</hi> and perswade the other Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> to allow us this Monopoly, we should to no Purpose, incur (if not reimbursed from Home) an inextricable Expence or Debt, and by extending or stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Colonies, render them more slender and weak; we are not capable of settling Inland Countries in a short Time, our European Dominions, cannot allow or spare People sufficient for that Purpose.

There Cod-Fish are so plenty and fall in so near the Shore, that the <hi>French</hi> Fishermen without the Charge or Trouble of Hook and Line, catch them by a Kind of Grapling, as our Privateers discovered when they made Prizes of several <hi>French</hi> Fish Traders in the Summer, 1744, in the Northern Harbours of <hi>Newfoundland</hi>: By this unaccountable Concession, the <hi>French</hi> had already the better of us in the Fishery Trade, and in a few Years more would have supplied all the Markets in <hi>Europe,</hi> and by underselling, entirely excluded us from the COD-FISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERY, <hi>which is more beneficial and easier wrought than the</hi> Spanish <hi>Mines of</hi> Mexico <hi>and</hi> Peru.</p>

                  <p>IT is said, That one great Inducement to <hi>Columbus</hi>'s Adventure Westward, was to try for a Western Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation to the <hi>Spice Islands</hi>; and luckily, by Islands and a great Continent intercepting him, <hi>America</hi> was discovered.</p>
                  <p>As the several great Continents of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> Eastward, and <hi>America</hi> Westward lay in the Way; the Case was, how to double the extreme North or South Points or Lands-Ends of these Continents; or to find some pr c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable

Straits or Thorough-Fares in these Continents.</p>
                  <p>Before we proceed, we shall insert by way of Amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as not impertinent to the Subject, the following Digression.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Dutch</hi> Fishers missing of Whales, are said to have sailed in Quest of them, several Degrees North of <hi>Cape Purchas</hi> of <hi>East Greenland,</hi> which lies in N. Lat. 82 d; there was no Ice, only an open Sea, but very hollow. Whalers say, that the further North, on <hi>Spitsbergen,</hi> or <hi>East Greenland,</hi> they found the greater Plenty of Grass, and other green Herbs; therefore towards the <hi>Pole</hi> it must be hotter: This seems to be probable from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things: In <hi>Iune</hi> at the <hi>North Pole</hi> the Sun is 23 d. 30 m. high, and for some Months always above the Horizon; whereas, for Instance, at <hi>London,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in N. Lat. 51 d. 30 m. the Sun in <hi>December</hi> is only about 15 d. high, and only for one Third of its Revolution or Day, above the Horizon.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Frazier,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Navigator, says, in the Account of his South-Sea Voyages; that on the 13th of <hi>March</hi> 1714, N. S. in returning to <hi>France,</hi> South of <hi>Cape Horn,</hi> in Lat. 58 d. 30 m. and 68 d. 30 m. W. Longitude from <hi>Paris,</hi> he discovered several Islands of Ice, whereof one was four or five Leagues long; Ice is not frequently met with hereabouts, and as Ice is formed by an Adherence to some Land or Shore, there must be Land towards the <hi>South Pole</hi>; but not within 63 d. S. Lat. for the Extent of about 200 Leagues from 55 d. to 80 d. West Long. from <hi>Paris</hi>; because this Space has been run by several Ships, which the S. W. and S. S. W. Winds have oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to stand far to the Southward, to weather <hi>Cape-Horn,</hi> the Lands-End of <hi>South-America,</hi> in 55 d. 55 m. S. Lat. This is the Reason, why that Chimera or Fancy of a <hi>Terra Australis</hi> is at present left out of our Charts or Maps. If Lands are discovered South of 64 d. S. Lat. they must be inhospitable and uninhabitable, considering that the Weather is more stormy, and Winters more rigid, in the high South Latitudes, than in the same Northern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006307_0034_0F652D774DB60E38"/>
the same Climates South of the <hi>Equator,</hi> are much colder than to the Northward of the <hi>Equator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Southern Latitudes are much colder, than in the same Degrees of Northern Latitudes. 1. The Sun is annually eight Days longer on the Northern Side of the Equinoctial than on its Southern Side. 2. The Sun in our North Country Winters is in <hi>Perigee,</hi> that is, nearer the Earth, than in the Southern Winters, being then in his <hi>Apogee.</hi> 3. The highest Cod-Fishery according to Capt. <hi>Frazier,</hi> in the Southern Latitudes is in 31 d. S. Lat; our Cod Fishery in <hi>North-America</hi> (there are some stragling Cod-Fish caught more to the Southward) extends to <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucket New-England</hi> in 41 d. N. Lat: Therefore 41 d. N. Lat. is nearly of the same Temper or Coolness as 31 d. S. Lat.</p>
                  <p>To obtain navigable Passages, into the Indian and South Seas, the extreme North and South Promontories or Lands-Ends of the several Continents above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were to be doubled. They are reduceable to four, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The S. E. Passage by doubling the <hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> the South Point of <hi>Africa.</hi> 2. The S. W. Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by doubling <hi>Cape Horn</hi> the South Point of <hi>America, Megallan</hi>'s Streights is a Thorough-Fare. 3. The N. E. Passage, North of the North Cape of <hi>Europe,</hi> but hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to not discovered. 4 The N. W. Passage, or rather Thorough-Fare between the North Shore of <hi>America,</hi> and the South Shore of <hi>West-Greenland,</hi> commonly called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>'s Streights (to double the North Parts of this <hi>West-Greenland,</hi> has hitherto not been imagined) this has at Times been endeavoured in the last Century and half, M. <hi>Dobbs</hi> is at present, in Pursuit of it. Lastly, We shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion some Tentatives for discovering Thorough-Fares in several Openings in the Body of the Continentof <hi>America.</hi>

In very good Policy, they have an Independent Court of Judicature for civil and criminal Matters, to whom the Governor-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is subject, and by whom he may be condemned even to Death. Under the Governor-General are six conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Governments or Colonies; each has a Governor, Director of Trade,  besides several lesser Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Commanderies and Factories.

As the Northerly and Easterly Winds in these Parts, cause very intense Frosts, there must be to Windward vast Continents covered with Snow or large Fields of impenetrable Ice. Thus the very hard Frost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

N. Lat. (the Men were saved and came home in the Prosperous Pink) they found Ice along to the Northward with Soundings, therefore Land is not far off, and <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> (a Conjecture) may range North West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, until it meets with <hi>East Greenland,</hi> consequently no North-East Passage between them, unless by some Straits; the Flood sets from the S. or S.

Why did they not proceed in Quest of a Passage? If a clear Sea could be found, that is without Continents or Islands to fasten and fix the Ice, a Passage might be possible: But a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through Straits cannot be practicably safe, their Ice is generally fixed; if accidentally in the Height of some Summers they be open, it can be only for a short Time, and the Uncertainty, when a Frost may set in, renders the Navigation too hazardous to run the Risk of the

W, being a Sort of <hi>Diagonal</hi> or <hi>Compositiun</hi> between the Southerly Direction towards the Southern rarified Air, and its Westerly Reflux or eddy Direction) crosses a deep large Ocean, consequently warm and mellow: In the <hi>American</hi> high North Latitudes, these Winds glide along vast Continents of Snow and Ice, and consequently more and more chilled; this <hi>enpassant,</hi> may be a good Surmise, against a practicable N. W. Passage, because the warm Ocean and its Influence must be at a great Distance. This Way of Reasoning does not hold good in the high Southern Latitudes, where from this Doctrine the Winds ought to be S. W, whereas they are in a Manner fixed at N. W, but perhaps may intimate, that there is no Continent of Land or Ice to the S. W, and a vast Ocean to the West Northward to Windward which by a boisterous hollow Sea carries the Wind along with it; in Fact the Ships that sail'd to near 70 d. S. Lat. seldom found any floating Ice.</p>

Researches until 25 Aet. the Air of the Soil and juvenile Conversation do not much contribute towards this: Therefore a Person not a Native, but not a Foreigner, who comes into any Country at that Age, and enters upon and prosecutes such Investigations from personal Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and credible Correspondencies for a Course of thirty Years, may be said, as if born in the Country. I hope Criticks, Natives of any of these our Colonies, will not reckon it a Presumption in me to essay the following Accounts; especially as at present, no Native appears to undertake this laborious but useful Performance; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be a Performance not of Genius, but of Labour, and Method to render it distinct and clear.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>American</hi> Colonies can not be claimed by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>European</hi> Nations from Preocupancy (they were not Derelicts but in Possession of the aboriginal <hi>Indians</hi>) nor by Inheritance, nor by what the Law of Nature and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deem a justifiable Conquest; therefore the adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>European</hi> Powers, could only give to some of their particular Subjects, an exclusive Grant of negociating and purchasing from the natural Proprietors the native <hi>Indians,</hi> and thereupon a Power of Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>Formerly Priority of Discovery, even without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Occupancy or Possession was deem'd a good Claim: Thus we originate our Claims in <hi>North America</hi> from the <hi>Cabots</hi> coasting from <hi>Prima Vista</hi> in 66 d. to 34 d.

                     <pb n="153" facs="unknown:006307_0160_0F652DE4D6BB8CB0"/>The Boundaries of their united Tribes, called Nations or Empires, are natural, viz. Seas, Bays, Lakes, great Rivers, high Mountains, thus for Instance, our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nation of <hi>Abnaquies</hi> are bounded by the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Ocean, or rather at present by the <hi>English</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements upon the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Shore, by the Bay of <hi>Fundi,</hi> by the great River <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> by Lake <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain</hi> and <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River.</p>
                  <p>The Tribes which, at least nominally, compose their general Denomination of a Nation, are generally named from the Rivers upon which they live; as in <hi>Lapland</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the <hi>Laplanders</hi> are distinguished by the Names of the Rivers <hi>Uma, Pitha, Lula, Torneo,</hi> and <hi>Kimi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>China</hi> seems to be the elder Brother of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mankind as to their <hi>Politia</hi> and Improvements in Nature; so <hi>America</hi> may with much Propriety be called the youngest Brother and meanest of Mankind; no Civil Government, no Religion, no Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>French</hi> call them <hi>Les Hommes des Bois,</hi> or Men-Brutes of the Forrest: They do not cultivate the Earth by plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or grazing: Excepting a very inconsiderable Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Mays</hi> or <hi>Indian Corn,</hi> and of <hi>Kidney-Beans</hi> (in <hi>New England</hi> they are called <hi>Indian Beans</hi>) which some of their <hi>Squaas</hi> or Women plant; they do not provide

for To-Morrow, their Hunting is their necessary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence not Diversion; when they have good Luck in Hunting, they eat and sleep until all is consumed and then go a Hunting again.</p>
                  <p>The higher the Latitudes, the <hi>Indians</hi> are fewer in Numbers and more straggling, Nature not affording ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Subsistence for many, and only in small Bodies or Herds: Their Trade or Commerce is trifling, having no Produce, no Manufacture, but little Game; the Difficulty of subsisting requires almost their whole Time to provide for themselves.</p>
                  <p>Excepting that Constitution of Body, which by Use they have acquired from their Birth, of enduring Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of Hunger and Weather; they are tender, and not long-lived, and generally very simple and ignorant, some of their old Men by Use and Experience in the World, acquire a considerable Degree of Sagacity. New Negroes from <hi>Guinea</hi> generally exceed them much in Constitution of Body and Mind. In the Province of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay New-England,</hi> there was formerly a very good Project or Design, to educate at College, some of their most promising Youths, to serve as <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaries</hi> for civilizing, instructing and converting of the wild <hi>Indians</hi>: This good Purpose turn'd abortive from the Tenderness of their Constitution and Aukwardness in Learning, and at present is laid aside.</p>
                  <p>They are not so polite as the wandring <hi>Tartars,</hi> no Dairys. Like the <hi>wild Irish</hi> they dread Labour more than Poverty, like Dogs they are always either eating or sleeping, excepting in Travelling, Hunting, and their Dances; their Sloth and Indolence inclines them to Sottishness; before Christians arrived amongst them, they had no Knowledge of strong Drink; this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vice not only destroys their bodily Health, and that of their Progeny, but creates Feuds, Outrages, and horrid Murders. They are much given to Deceit and Lying, so as scarce to be believed when they speak Truth. See <hi>Annotations</hi> Page 116. Their Temper is
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:006307_0162_0F652DE65C881B90"/>
the Reverse of the <hi>East Indians,</hi> whereof some Casts or Sects will not kill any Animal; the <hi>West Indians</hi> or <hi>Americans</hi> are barbarous, and upon small Provocations kill their own Species; some of them exceed in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, and in Revenge and Fury eat the Flesh of their Enemies, not from Hunger or Delicacy; such formerly were the <hi>Florida Indians,</hi> they said that the Flesh of the <hi>English</hi> eat mellow and tender, that of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hard and tough, the <hi>Bermudian</hi> fishy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aboriginal Americans</hi> have no Honesty, no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that is, they are of no Faith, but meer Brutes in that Respect. They generally have great Fortitude of Mind; without any Appearance of Fear or Concern, they suffer any Torture and Death. In Revenge they are barbarous and implacable; they never forget nor forgive Injuries; if one Man kills another, the nearest in Kindred to the murdered, watches an Opportunity to kill the Murderer; and the Death of one Man may occasion the Deaths of many; therefore when a Man is guilty of Murder, he generally leaves the Tribe, and goes into a voluntary Kind of Banishment. They are a sullen close People. The <hi>Indian Wars</hi> ought to be called <hi>Massacres,</hi> or inhumane barbarous Out-rages, rather than necessary Acts of Hostility.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> have their Hunting, Fowling and Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grounds, by a forked pointed Pole, they strike or harpoon their Fish; but their Wives and Children reside mostly on their planting Grounds, they plant but little. They do not wander like the <hi>Tartars</hi>; there are said to be some wandering <hi>Indians,</hi> they cannot be many; because the settling <hi>Indians</hi> are very jealous of their hunting and fishing Grounds or Properties.</p>
                  <p>Their ancient Navigation was only crossing of Rivers upon <hi>Bark-logs,</hi> travelling along Rivers, Rivulets and Sides of Lakes in <hi>Canoes</hi> or <hi>Schuyties,</hi> portable by two Men in their Carrying-Places from one River or Pond to another, they are of Birch-Bark upon Ribs of Ash, sow'd together by some tough wooden Fibres, and

paid (as Sailors express it) with Rozin from some Pine Kind; they use no Sails and Oars, only Paddles and Setting-Poles; they are capable of carrying a Man, his Wife, Children and Baggage. Narrow Rivers are better travelling than Ponds or Lakes, because upon the Lakes, if stormy or much Wind, they cannot proceed, but must put to the Shore.</p>
                  <p>Many of our intermixed <hi>Indians</hi> are of good Use as Servants. It is observable, that amongst the <hi>Indian</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and <hi>Negro</hi> Slaves; the silly, thoughtless, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silanimous answer best; some perhaps may observe from this, that the blind passive Obedience and Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence Men, make the best Subjects and Court Slaves in <hi>Europe.</hi>

Amongst the <hi>West India Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneers</hi> the most morally vicious of Mankind; the <hi>French</hi> immovably adhered to one another because of their being all <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as being <hi>Protestants,</hi> and not from any other Regard.

                        <p>As to Religion, all Mankind may be divided into three Sects.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. They who believe in a supreme Intelligence (or Intelligences) who by Omnipotence created and framed the World, and by infinite Wisdom manages it: They may be called the <hi>Godly.</hi> With this Class, the divine Attribute INCOMPREHENSIBLE ought to resolve and compose all Altercations concerning this <hi>Being: Plutarch</hi> says, there is but One and the same <hi>supreme Being</hi> or Providence, that governs the World, though worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Multiplicity of Names, by various Nations and Sectaries. This Sect admits of three Sub-divisions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Theists,</hi> commonly called <hi>Deists,</hi> who admit of no Modifications in the <hi>Deity</hi>; in ancient Times and to this Day, they are improperly called <hi>Atheists.</hi> Amongst us, he who denies the <hi>Trinity,</hi> is in Law deemed <hi>Atheist</hi> and <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer. Anaxagoras</hi> the Philosopher passed at <hi>Athens</hi> for an <hi>Atheist,</hi> because he denied that the Sun, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets and the Stars were Gods. <hi>Socrates</hi> is said to have been a <hi>Martyr</hi> for the Unity of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> refusing to pay Homage to the various Gods of <hi>Greece.</hi> This is the national (if we may thus express) Religion

of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> having the largest Extent of all national Religions.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Tritheists</hi> or <hi>Trinitarians.</hi> The distinguishing Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of all true Orthodox Christians: They worship Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity under three distinct Modifications, which I shall not pretend to explain or illustrate, because a Mystery.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Polytheists.</hi> Such were the ancient <hi>Egyptians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> The Poets had a greater Variety of Gods than the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> many of them to be looked upon as a Machinary introduced to embellish a Poem, and to amuse the Mind: They deified various Parts of Nature, and were great Promoters of <hi>Polytheism.</hi> All the Gods and Goddesses of the Ancients were only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications, Words or Names, to express several Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of a <hi>supreme Being,</hi> the Excellencies in Nature, and the Virtues of <hi>Heroes</hi> and very eminent Men; as if in <hi>Britain</hi> we should say NEWTON the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophy and Mathematicks, ADDISON, the God of the <hi>Belles Lettres</hi> and polite Learning.</p>

                  <p>GOVERNOR DUMMER'S WAR against the <hi>Indians</hi> may be reckoned purely <hi>Indian,</hi> we shall give some short Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. The <hi>Canada French</hi> perceiving our Eastern Settlements advance apace, set their <hi>Quenebec</hi> Missionary Father <hi>Ralle</hi> a Jesuite to Work; he made these <hi>Indians</hi> jealous of the <hi>English</hi> by telling them, that these Lands were given by GOD unalienably to the <hi>Indians</hi> and their Children for ever, according to the Christian sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Anno 1717 The <hi>Indians</hi> began to murmur, and after some Time gave the <hi>English</hi> Settlers formal Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leave the Lands within a set Time, at the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Time they committed Depredations by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying their Cattle and other Stock:
The Missionary, with a Priestly Heat began the Affair too precipitately, before the receiving of Directions from <hi>France,</hi> as appears by a Letter from M. <hi>Vandreuil</hi> Governor-General of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> to this Father "he could not tell, how far he might intermeddle in the Affair, until he had particular Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Council of the Navy in <hi>France</hi>;" all the <hi>French</hi> Colonies are under the Direction of that Board:
And the Small-Pox (which the <hi>Indians</hi> with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son dread) prevailing in <hi>New-England, Anno</hi> 1721, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a declared Rupture until <hi>Anno</hi> 1722. <hi>Iuly</hi> 5. the Government of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> proclaimed them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and ordered 100 £. per Scalp to Voluntiers fitted out at their own Charge, and afterwards 4 <hi>s.</hi> per Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides: Our most considerable Action against them was at <hi>Noridgwoag</hi> of <hi>Quenebec</hi> River <hi>August</hi> 12.

and about 14 of his Men were killed, and many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> were concern'd in this War, they made a vain Assault upon the Fort of <hi>Annapolis-Royal,</hi> and did some Damage at <hi>Canso.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Delegates from the 5 or 6 <hi>New-York Indian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from the <hi>Mohegin</hi> or <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River <hi>Indians,</hi> and from the <hi>Scatacooks,</hi> came to <hi>Boston,</hi> received Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, gave fair Promises of acting in our Favour, but did nothing.</p>
                  <p>We sent Commissioners to the Governor-General of <hi>Canada,</hi> to expostulate with him concerning his encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Indian</hi> Depredations, and to reclaim Captives: His Answer was, that these <hi>Indians</hi> were independant Nations, and not under his Direction; this was a meer Evasion.</p>
                  <p>After many Bickerings, by good Management in the wise Administration of Lieutenant-Governor <hi>Dummer,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> beg'd and obtain'd a Cessation of Arms, <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 15, Anno 1725, and a Peace the <hi>May</hi> following at <hi>Casco</hi>; saving to the <hi>Indians</hi> all their Lands not hitherto convey'd, with the Privilege of Hunting, Fowling, and Fishing as formerly: Signed by the <hi>Noridgwoag, Penob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot, St. Iohns,</hi> and <hi>Cape-Sable Indians.</hi>

                  <p>Three or four Years since, some interspersed <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Maryland</hi> were troublesome and occasionally kill'd some <hi>English</hi> Men; they were soon quelled.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Virginia,</hi> in the Beginning, the <hi>Indian</hi> Incursions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded them much, and <hi>Anno</hi> 1610, from 500 they, were reduced to 80; from 1612 there was uninterrupted Peace with the <hi>Indians</hi> till 1622, by a sudden general Insurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they massacred 347 <hi>English</hi> People, reckoned at that Time half of the Colony.

                     <p>No Religion (I hope the above Character may admit of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Abatements) is inconsistent with Society. The Form of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Oath in that Colony
"Upon the Peril of the Penalty of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury" seems not to answer the Intention of an Oath, which is a solemn Invocation of GOD's Judgments hereafter, over and above the Penalties which may be inflicted in this World; thus by Cunning and Secresy they may evade the one, but by no Means can be supposed to escape the other:
It is true, that in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> the Affirmation of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> the Declaration of the <hi>Menists,</hi> are equivalent to our Oaths. Upon the other Hand the Frequency of Oaths upon small Occasions, makes them too familiar, and by taking off the Solemnity and Awe of an Oath renders them nearly upon a Par with common profane Swearing; the many Oaths in the several Branches of the Revenue, particularly in the Customs, are of bad Effect, hence the Proverb, <hi>A Custom-House Oath,</hi> that is, an Oath that may be dispensed with; Oaths give a profligate Man of no Religion (that is who does not think himself bound by an Oath) a vast Advantage over an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest conscientious religious Man: The same may be said of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Tests of Conformity, and occasional Conformity practised by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

British</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Colonies, transported to form a Settlement in a foreign or remote Country.</p>
                  <p>The first Settlers of our Colonies, were formed from various Sorts of People. 1. Laudably ambitious <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers.</hi> 2. The Malecontents, the Unfortunate, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous from Home. 3. Transported <hi>Criminals.</hi> The present Proportion of these Ingredients in the several Plantations varies much, for Reasons which shall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the particular Sections of Colonies, and does depend much upon the Condition of the first Settlers: Some were peopled by Rebel <hi>Tories,</hi> some by Rebel <hi>Whigs</hi> (that Principle which at one Time is called <hi>Royalty,</hi> at another Time is called <hi>Rebellion</hi>) some by <hi>Church of England Men,</hi> some by <hi>Congregationalists</hi> or <hi>Independants,</hi> some by <hi>Quakers,</hi> some by <hi>Papists (Maryland</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serrat)</hi> the most unfit People to incorporate with our Constitution.</p>
                  <p>Colonies have an incidental good Effect, they drain from the Mother-Country the Disaffected and the Vicious (in this same Manner, subsequent Colonies purge the more ancient Colonies); <hi>Rhode-Island</hi> and <hi>Providence Plantations,</hi> drained from <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Quakers,</hi> and other wild <hi>Sectaries.</hi> Perhaps in after Times (as it is at Times with the Lord Lieutenants and other high Officers in <hi>Ireland</hi>) some <hi>Malecontents</hi> of Figure, capable of being troublesome to the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Home, may be sent in some great Offices to the Plantations.</p>
                  <p>In our Colonies we have four Sorts of People. 1. <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> that is Planters and Merchants. 2. <hi>White Servants.</hi> 3. <hi>Indian Servants.</hi> 4. <hi>Slaves</hi> for Life, mostly <hi>Negroes.</hi> White Servants are of two Sorts, viz. Poor People from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> mostly, these are bound or sold, as some expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the transporting Charges, with some additional Profit; the others are Criminals judicially transported, and their Time of Exile and Servitude sold by certain Undertakers and their Agents.</p>
                  <p>In our <hi>American</hi> Settlements, generally the Designations are, <hi>Province,</hi> where the King appoints a Governor; <hi>Colony,</hi> where the Freemen elect their own Governor: This customary Acceptation is not universal; <hi>Virginia</hi> is called a <hi>Colony,</hi> perhaps because formerly a Colony, and the most ancient.</p>
                  <p>We have some Settlements with a Governor only; others with Governor and Council, such are <hi>Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Nova-Scotia, Hudson</hi>'s-<hi>Bay,</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> without any House orNegative deputed by the Planters, according to the Essence of a <hi>British</hi> Constitution: These, may be said, not colonized.</p>
                  <p>There are various Sorts of Royal Grants of Colonies. 1. To one or more <hi>personal Proprietors,</hi> their Heirs and Assigns; such are <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Pennsylvania</hi>; both Property and Government. 2. The Property to perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Proprietors; the Government and Jurisdiction in the Crown; this is the State of <hi>Carolinas</hi> and <hi>Iersies.</hi> 3. Property and Government in the <hi>Crown,</hi> viz. <hi>Virginia, New-York,</hi> and <hi>New-Hampshire</hi> commonly called <hi>Piscataqua.</hi> 4. Property in the People and their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives; the Government in the Crown; as is <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusetts-Bay.</hi> 5. Property and Government in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Company, called the Freemen of the Colony, such are <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Island.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This last seems to be the most effectual Method of the first <hi>settling</hi> and peopling of a <hi>Colony</hi>; Mankind are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally desirous of Parity and Leveling, without any fixed Superiority; but when a Society is come to Maturity, a more distinct fixed Subordination is found to be requisite. <hi>Connecticut, Rhode-Island,</hi> and some of the <hi>Proprietary</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, are of Opinion, that they are not obliged to attend to, or follow any Instructions or Orders from their <hi>Mother-Country</hi> or Court of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; they do not

send their Laws home to the Plantation-Offices to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King in Council for Approbation or Disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance: They assume the Command of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which by the <hi>British</hi> Constitution is a <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Crown: Some Time ago, they refused not only a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive Custom-House Office, but likewise a Court of Vice-Admiralty's Officers appointed from Home; but these Points they have given up, especially considering that the Royal Charter grants them only the Privilege of trying Causes, <hi>Intra corpus Comitatus,</hi> but not a-float or <hi>Super altum mare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a small Country, though rich and thriving, cannot afford large Numbers of People; it ought not to run upon Discoveries and Conquests, beyond what they can well improve and protect; because by over-stretching, they weaken or break the Staple of their Constitution: But they may in good Policy distress as much of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy's Country as is possible, and for some short Time keep Possession of some of their most important Places, though at a great Charge, even, by hiring of foreign Troops; in Order to obtain some suitable profitable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent. <hi>New-England</hi> with the incidental Countenance of a small <hi>British</hi> Squadron, did easily reduce the <hi>North America Dunkirk,</hi> or <hi>Louisb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Upwards of thirty Years since, upon some Complaints concerning the Colonies, particularly of <hi>South Carolina</hi>; the Court of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> judged, that it might be for the general <hi>British</hi> Interest, to have all Charter and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary Governments vacated by Act of Parliament, and accordingly a Bill was brought into the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; but the <hi>New England</hi> Agent <hi>Dummer</hi> by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Piece which he publish'd at that Time giving the true State of the Colonies, by his Vigilancy, Assiduity, proper Sollicitations and personal Address, and Interest with some of the leading Men, occasioned the Bill to be dropt.</p>
                  <p>The vacating of all Charter and Proprietary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is not the ultimate Chastisement that may be used with delinquent Colonies; the Parliament of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> may abridge them of many valuable Privileges which they enjoy at present; as happened in an Affair relating to <hi>Ireland</hi>; the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> Anno 1720 passed an Act for the better securing the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>: Therefore the Colonies ought to be circumspect, and not offend their Mother-Country; as for Instance, 1. In abusing that Privilege which our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies have of raising Taxes and assessing of themselves; <hi>South Carolina</hi> had not supplied the nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bills of Credit for a Medium of Trade and Commerce, and making them legal Tenders; this is equivalent to Coinage (and of a base Standard) a Prerogative of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>British American</hi> Colonies have many valuable Privileges. 1. Enacting of their own Laws, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their not being repugnant to the Laws of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but may be otherways various from them. 2.

No private Purchase from the <hi>Indians</hi> shall be valid (formerly much Deceit and Cheat has been discovered in these Purchases, tending to alienate the <hi>Indians</hi> from the <hi>British</hi> Interest) without the Confirmation of the Governor and Council in some Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To avoid Prolixity, but with Impatience, I must defer the Iniquity of a <hi>multiplied Plantation Paper Currency</hi> to the Appendix; it is of no Benefit only to the fraudulent Debtor, they are not ashamed to acknowledge that Equity and natural Justice, they ought to repay the same in real Value which they received; but they say, their Province Laws excuses and indemnifies them, by paying any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Value; and that the compassionate good Creditor, must blame himself for his Forbearance and long Credit, while Money is depreciating: That a multiplied <hi>Paper-Currency</hi> naturally <hi>depreciates</hi> it self, I shall at present only evince by the Instance of the Province of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> November 1747; where are about <hi>Two Millions, One Hundred Thousand Pounds</hi> current publick Bills of Credit not cancelled or burnt, whereof a small Matter is in the Hands of the Receivers of the Taxes; the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> with <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are risen to the extravagant incredible Height of <hi>One Thousand

                  <p>The Differences in the Modes of BAPTISM are not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential; my Voucher is the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> our Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesian, noted by his printed pious super-excellent Pastoral Letters; in a Letter to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Miles,</hi> a Rector of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Boston,</hi> dated <hi>Fulham</hi> Sept. 3. 1724.
<q>I have been informed within these few Days, by a Bishop who had a Letter from <hi>Boston,</hi> that some of the Ministers there, begin the Dispute about the Validity and Invalidity of <hi>Baptism</hi>; administred by Persons not <hi>episcopally</hi> ordained.

                  <p>In <hi>Great-Britain</hi> there are three distinct <hi>Societies</hi> for propagating Christian Protestant Knowledge or Religion in foreign Parts, incorporated by Royal Charters.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Anno</hi> 1649.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Anno</hi> 1709 by Charter there was established in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a Society for propagating Christian Knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Highlanders</hi>; 4 <hi>Geor.</hi> I. their Charter was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all Infidel Countries beyond Seas; they have a considerable Fund, they have had a Missionary upon the <hi>New-England</hi> Western Frontiers, and another upon its Eastern Frontiers; the laborious Mr. <hi>Brainard,</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, was their Missionary amongst the Indians upon the Northern Frontiers of <hi>Pensylvania</hi> and the <hi>Iersies.</hi>

Many good Things were originally intended by this Charter, and doubtless the same good Intentions continue with the Society; but in all publick distant Affairs the Managers at Home may be imposed upon: here I beg Leave of the Missionaries, as an His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian to relate Matters of Fact; if any Missionary thinks that I deviate from the Truth, he may correct me, and I shall be more explicit and particular in the Appendix.

                        <p>This Gentleman (a Gentleman by Office, not by Birth) has for many Years been of a valetudinary Constitution, a Distemperature of the Nerves (I do not mean ludicrous) which sometimes seizes his Bowels by violent Cholicks, sometimes his Head with a Kind of Fury or Frenzy: His Courage is not genuine and true, but a Sort of Frenzy, witness his ill conducted, therefore unsuccessful Expeditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>La Guira</hi> and <hi>Port<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>impressing</hi> of Seamen has in Part been redressed by a late Act of Parliament. There had long subsisted a Dispute between the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and the <hi>Trade,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>impressing of Sailors</hi>: The first insisted that, Commanders of Privateers, and Masters of Merchant-Men, did encourage Desertion from his <hi>Majesty's</hi> Ships of War by entertaining and hiring Deserters; the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants complain'd of the great Hardships upon Trade and Navigation, from the arbitrary unreasonable <hi>Impress</hi> of Hands by indiscreet <hi>Captains</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi>: To accommodate this Affair the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="unknown:006307_0247_0F652E2CE7619E88"/>
in their Wisdom passed an Act <hi>Anno</hi> 1746, that Privateers or Merchant-Men harbouring Deserters from the King's Ships, should forfeit 50 £. St. per Man; and any Officer of a Man of War <hi>impressing</hi> any Sailor (De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters excepted) on Shore or on Board should pay 50 £. St. for each Man <hi>impressed.</hi> This Act is only in Relation to the <hi>Sugar-Island Colonies</hi>; it might easily when in Agitation have been extended to the Continent Colonies of <hi>North-America</hi> by proper Application of their several Agents; in a particular Manner <hi>New-England</hi> claimed this <hi>Exemption</hi> (if their Agents had had that Address, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, Vigilancy and Assiduity which their Duty required) by having lately suffered so much in their Persons and Purses by a voluntary Expedition in Favour of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Country against <hi>Louisbourg</hi>: I am apt to think that being too forward beyond our natural Abilities, may give the Ministry at Home some Reason to imagine, that <hi>New-England</hi> is so encreased in People, as to have many Idlers to spare; as appears by their Order for two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Soldiers (or 2000 Men) from hence, in Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Garrison of <hi>Louisbourg</hi>: At present I hope the Ministry are convinced that <hi>New-England</hi> can not spare Idlers sufficient to make one Regiment compleat. I speak for the Interest of the Country, and impartially in general, my Interest being in that Country some may wrongly think that I am partial.</p>
                  <p>Before the Plantation or Colony-Trade took Place, the Trade of <hi>England</hi> consisted only in the Exportation of some <hi>Lead, Tin, Leather, Grain,</hi> and <hi>Wool</hi>; by <hi>Colonies</hi> our Trade and Navigation is vastly improved; <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> had good Notions of Trade in general, and particularly of the Plantation-Trade; they had a Scheme to bring the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for some Outrages they had done us in our <hi>Spice-Trade</hi> and other Affairs, but the subsequent Reigns of the indolent <hi>Charles</hi> II, and of the Popish-Priest-Rid <hi>Iames</hi> II, were great Damps. The Addition which the Factories and Colonies have made to our Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:006307_0248_0F652E2DA0B34AC8"/>
is immense, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>India</hi> Trade, <hi>Fur</hi> and <hi>Skin</hi> Trade, <hi>Cod-Fishery</hi> and <hi>Fish-Oil, Naval Stores, Tobacco, Rice, Sugar</hi> and other <hi>West-India Island</hi> Produce. Besides theProfits they afford to the Planters, Merchants and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation Owners; they yield great Branches of Revenue, to the publick Treasury, the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade about 300,000 £. St. <hi>per An. Tobacco</hi> 200,000 £. St. <hi>Sugars</hi> 150,000 £. St. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>multiplying of Colonies</hi> there are Boundaries which to Advantage cannot be exceeded; thus our Sugar-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies produce as much Sugar as we can vent to Profit, the same may be said of <hi>Rice,</hi> and perhaps of <hi>Tobacco</hi>; if we increase in these, their Prices at Market from their Plenty must fall, and not yield a sufficient Profit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Regulations in the Colony-Trade,</hi> ought to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according as Circumstances of Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may require, for Instance, seeing by an <hi>Arret</hi> of the Council of State 1726, the <hi>French</hi> Colonies are allowed to carry their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce directly to other Ports of <hi>Europe,</hi> but the Vessels to return directly to the Ports of <hi>France</hi> from whence they set out; therefore <hi>Great-Britain</hi> seems to be under a Necessity to take off all <hi>Enumerations</hi> (that of <hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Rice</hi> is lately in Part taken off) but that the Vessels which carry Plantation-Goods to foreign Ports, shall clear out from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> before they return to the Plantations, this would prevent their carrying foreign Goods to our Plantations directly, and would maintain the proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of the Colonies upon their Mother-Country.</p>

                           <p>This <hi>Mobish</hi> Assembly imagining that those Officers had sheltered themselves (the Government was in Duty obliged to protect them) in the Governor's House, or in the Provincial Court-House; at Noon they appeared before the Governor's House, and in the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Provincial Court-House; by this Time being much intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated (which after a few Hours Sleep subsides) they used the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who appeared in the Balcony, with indecent Language; and some naughty Boys and Children, who in Frolicks take Pleasure in the rattling of Glass (sometimes they use the Window-Glass of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Houses with the same Freedom) with Brick Batts broke some Window-Glass of the Court-House, but were reproved by the real <hi>Mob.</hi>

                           <p>This <hi>Mob</hi> was less impetuous than the Generality of <hi>Mobs</hi>; they used the Sea-Officers well and dismissed them, before the Commodore had dismissed the impressed Town Inhabitants: They did not seize Capt. <hi>Auscough</hi> or <hi>Erskine,</hi> but left him at large upon his Parole.</p>
                           <p>After the Tumult had subsided, the Commodore advanced with his Fleet to insult <hi>Boston,</hi> which he imagined had insulted him. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in his Letter from Castle-Island to the Secretary, <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. writes,
"I will endeavour to divert him from such Thoughts, and to influence him to discharge the Inhabitants, and as many as I can in the End, but I cannot promise Success from the present Temper he is in;" this insinuates that the Commodore was not Master of his Temper, which is absolutely requisite in a Statesmen, Commander of an Army, or Commodore of a Squadron of Men of War Ships.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. in the Morning after the Tumult had subsided, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore makes an Offer to the Governor, to come in Person to the Castle for the Defence of the Governor's Person and of the Fort, this appears with an Air of Vanity and Assuming; but the Governour in Answer, justly and with Propriety of Character, acquaints him,
"That he did not retire to the Castle for Safety of his Person, and that he had not the least Apprehension of the Castle's being in Danger from any <hi>Mob.</hi>"
Finally the Commodore found it advisable to retire with his Squadron, and after a few Days put to Sea for the <hi>West-India Islanas.</hi>

                           <p>The Affair of the Town-Militia not appearing in Arms when call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, is not easily to be accounted for. Some say, that 1.

That as they were called upon, in Quality of <hi>Posse Comitatus,</hi> that is, in Aid of the civil Officers, and as the civil Officers did not appear to do their Duty they might think it preposterous to appear first; but in Exigencies such Formalities must not be insisted upon. 3.

The different Nature of the several Colonies, will not admit of any general Taxations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the various Taxes must be local, adapted to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of each Colony; here I shall only observe, 1. That in these Colonies (in <hi>North-Carolina</hi> there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tax) where there is a Poll-Tax upon all Male Whites from 16 Aet. and upwards, it seems not equitable that a Chimney-Sweeper or the meanest of the People should pay as much (as at present in <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi>) as a Counsellor or Prime Merchant; the People ought to be classed and pay in Proportion, according to their Rank and Substance, 2. That as <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> are not the Necessaries of Life (and therefore Hardship upon the Poor, is not in the Case) there may be a considerable Impost or Custom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Importation, and where Spirits are manufactured (for Instance <hi>Rum</hi> in <hi>Boston</hi>) an Excise at the Still Head. Thus private Tippling Houses that pay no Excise, will have no Advantage over the licensed Houses; upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation to draw back the Duties of Impost or Excise. 3.

South of the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> in the middle Parts of this Ocean there must be a Tract of Western Variations.</p>
                     <p>This 3 d <hi>no Variation</hi> Line seems to be a Continuation of the first inflected Westward into a circular Arch whose <hi>Vertex</hi> at present seems to be in about 34 d. N. Lat, and 80 d. W. Long. from <hi>London.</hi>

It is observable, that all <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation Lines</hi> the nearer they approach to the <hi>Poles</hi> of our Earth, the more they converge towards a Parallelism with the Meridians, as if to terminate in the Poles.

                     <p>The Alterations in the Variations are not from any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form circulatory or libratory Power; but as these mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick Powers seem to be accumulated and act connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, it must be by some Kind of Fluctuation; in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to this, it may be said, that the Fluctuation of any dense or specifically heavier considerable Part of the Earth would alter the <hi>Equilibrium</hi> and diurnal <hi>Rotation</hi> of the Earth, and make strange Changes in the fluid Surface of the Earth by Inundations and Ebbs.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>Summer</hi> Anno 1686 in Time of Peace, the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Canada</hi> became Masters of all our <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, Port <hi>Nelson</hi> excepted. <hi>Anno</hi> 1693 The <hi>English</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their Factories, but the <hi>French</hi> got Possession of them again soon after. <hi>Anno</hi> 1696 two English Men of War retook them. In Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s War, the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Canada</hi> were again Masters of these Factories; but by the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> Anno 1713, the <hi>French</hi> quit-claim'd them to the <hi>English</hi> so far South as 49 d. N. Lat; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we have not heard of any Attempt made upon them by the <hi>Canadians</hi> in this <hi>French</hi> War which commenced in the Spring 1744.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dobbs</hi> reckons that this Country called <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay, may be esteemed from 51 d. to 65 d. N. Lat, and from 78 d. to 95 d. W.

Capt. <hi>Midleton</hi> in 23 Voyages never could arrive at the Factories, above 5 or 6 Times, before the 10th of <hi>August</hi>; and it is a standing Order not to attempt coming back the same Year, unless they can fail from the Factories by Sept. 10; it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasant Weather; <hi>Midleton</hi> in all his Voyages never suffered Shipwreck; <hi>August</hi> is the proper Month for the Navigation of <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay and Straits; always good Soundings.</p>
               <p>This Grant is divided into the West Main or Continent formerly in Charts called <hi>New-North</hi> and <hi>South Wales,</hi> and the East Main called <hi>Terra de Labradore</hi> or <hi>New-Britain</hi>: The <hi>French</hi> claim'd the Bottom of the Bay as belonging to <hi>New France</hi> or <hi>Canada,</hi> but they disclaim'd it by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht.</hi>

used both Sides of the Question, in Favour of, and in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice against a N. W. Passage to <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Favour of a N. W. Passage. 1. The Whales found in Plenty on the West Side of <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay, as there is no Mention of Whales in <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Straits, they do not come that Way; they cannot come from <hi>Davis</hi> Straits by the frozen Straits of <hi>Midleton,</hi> because of a wide and large Field of Ice; Whales cannot pass under a large Tract of Ice, they cannot live without blowing at Times in the open Air; therefore these Whales must come from the Western orPacifick Ocean, by some Straits or Thorough-Fare in <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay: It is more probable that the great Whales in <hi>Davis</hi> Straits, when the Sea there begins to be froze up, pass into the Ocean, or deeper Water, because warmer; Thus the Cod-Fish upon the Coast of <hi>New-England</hi> in very cold Winters, retire into deep Water: Mr. <hi>Dobbs</hi> affirms that <hi>Midleton</hi> see no Whales near <hi>Cape Hope</hi> or the frozen Straits; he judges the frozen Straits to be only a <hi>Chimaera</hi>; therefore the Whales in <hi>Button</hi>'s Bay must come from the Westward. 2. <hi>Wager</hi> River, where was <hi>Midleton</hi>'s principal Enquiry, in N. Lat. 65 d. 24 m. W. Long. 88 d. 37 m; from 7 Miles wide at its Entrance, further up increased to 8 Leagues wide, and from 14 to 80 Fathom Water, and Whales were seen 20 Miles up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Dobbs</hi> conjectures that these Whales came from the Western Ocean, by some Strait or Passage South of <hi>Wager</hi> River from N. Lat. 65 d. to 62 d; here it is where the <hi>Eskimaux Indians</hi> follow Whaling, and traded with Capt. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="286" facs="unknown:006307_0293_0F652E56D0527B68"/>
therefore the Tide did not come from the frozen Straits and <hi>Baffins</hi> Bay Eastward, but from some Straits West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the same malecontent Officers assured Mr. <hi>Dobbs,</hi> that the higher up <hi>Wager</hi> River, the Water became the salter, and the Flood was from W. S. W. <hi>Midleton</hi> says the Tide came from North-Easterly.</p>
                  <p>To evince the Impracticableness of a N. W. Passage. 1. The <hi>French</hi> very inquisitive and mindful of their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, seem to give up any Prospect of this Passage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

W Passage to <hi>China</hi> from <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay or <hi>Davis</hi> Straits when discovered. 2. The Whales on the WestSide of <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay, by the frozen Straits, came from <hi>Davis</hi> Straits where they are plenty. 3. <hi>Midleton</hi> says (we cannot answer for his Vouchers) that <hi>Indian</hi> Travellers have gone by Land from <hi>Churchill</hi> River, as high as the Aretick Circle, but met with no Thorough-Fares; his Northern <hi>Indians</hi> which he took on Board, in <hi>Churchill</hi> River were chiefly designed to shew him theCopper-Mines. 4. The further up<hi>Wager</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Tides rise less; the Water from salt becomes break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, and the higher the more fresh. 5. <hi>Midleton</hi> writes, that from his own Experience, there is no Thorough-Fare from <hi>Churchill</hi> River in N. Lat. 59 d. to N. Lat. 67 d; and further North, if there be any Straits or Thorough-Fare, it cannot be clear of Ice (if ever clear) above a Week or two in the Year, and therefore impracticable: From the River <hi>Wager</hi> to N. Lat. 62 d, he stood into every Bay and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </head>
               <p>THIS is a Fishery of longer standing, than are any of our Colony or Plantation Settlements; it is noColony, it is not confined to any Patent or exclusive Company, but is an open general <hi>British</hi> Cod-Fishery, consisting of many Lodges, or commodious Harbours for curing of Cod-Fish, for the <hi>Spanish, Portuguese,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Markets.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The <hi>Cod-Fishery,</hi> profitable, and sufficient to supply many and large Markets; is peculiar to <hi>Newfoundland, Nova Scotia,</hi> and <hi>New-England:</hi> A Monopoly of this Fishery in these Seas, to be called a <hi>Mare Clausum,</hi> would be a vast Advantage to the Trade and Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> if it could be obtained at the ensuing Congress for a general Peace amongst the States in <hi>Europe</hi>: it is true, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a considerable Claim to some Interest in the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland</hi> Cod-Fishery, because the <hi>Guipiscoers</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Bayon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of <hi>France</hi> were contemporary, if not more early in that Fishery than <hi>England.</hi> By the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> the <hi>Guipiscocans</hi> and the other Subjects of <hi>Spain,</hi> were allowed their claimed Privilege of fishing at the Island of <hi>Newfoundland:</hi> by the same Treaty the <hi>French</hi> were allowed to fish, and cure their Fish on that Part of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> from Cape <hi>Bonavista,</hi> N. Lat. 49 d. 30 m. to the Northermost Part of the Island in N. Lat. 51 d. 30 m; and from thence running down by the Western Side to <hi>Point-Riche</hi> in N. Lat. 50 d. 30. m; by the Cod-Fish being more plenty, and by falling in nearer the Shore, the Cod-Fishery of the North Part of the Island, seems to be more profitable than upon the Southern Harbours of the Island; by this Concession before the War <hi>An.</hi> 1744 the <hi>French</hi> had the better of us in the Cod-Fishery Trade.—King <hi>Charles</hi> I. bubled by the <hi>French,</hi> gave them a Liberty of fishing and curing Fish in <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> upon the silly Pretext of supplying an <hi>English</hi> Convent in <hi>France</hi> with Fish.</p>
                     <p>This Cod-Fishery is not only a considerable Addition to the Trade and Wealth of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; but by the many Men employed in catching and curing of the Cod-Fish, is a good Nursery for our Navy and other Navigation (the Plantation Trade, the Fishery of <hi>Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Coal Trade of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and the Watermen upon the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> are the great Nurseries or Seminaries of our Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) if the <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Some <hi>Fish</hi> not exportable or merchantable, but of great Benefit in present spending especially for the Poor.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. WHALES. See a Digression concerning Whaling, P. 56. we shall further add the following Remarks; Whales, that is the true or Bone Whales go South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (they are Passengers according to the Seasons) towards Winter, and return Northward in the Spring. Formerly in <hi>New-England Cape-Cod</hi> embay'd them, but being much disturbed (they seem to have some Degree of Reason) they keep a good Offing. The smaller Whales, viz. <hi>Sperma Ceti, Fin-Backs, Hump-Backs,</hi> &amp;c. which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go far to the Northward, but stroll considerably South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, are apt to strand upon the Shoals of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Bahama</hi> Banks: They become Drift Whales, and some afford drift <hi>Sperma-Ceti.</hi> In their Passages North and South, having kept an Offing to the Banks, tho' they were incommoded by the Whale-Fishers; at present in their Passages they keep deep Water; and upon a Peace the Whalers are to fish for them in deep Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>New-England</hi> Whaling at present is by Whaling Sloops or Schooners with two Whale-Boats and 13 Men; each Boat has an Harpooner, a Steersman, and four Rowers: The Whale-Boats do not use Thaughts but Nooses for their Oars, upon Account of Expedition; because only by letting go their Oars, without loosing of them, they keep expeditiously long Side of the Whale. The best Place of striking a Whale is in her Belly, about one Third from her Gills; the Fast is a Rope of about 25 Fathom; then a Drudge or Stop-Water, a Plank of about 2 Feet square, with a Stick through its Center; to the further End of this Stick, is fastned a Tow-Rope, called the Drudge Rope of about 15 Fathom; they lance, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> Whales do not go far North; they are gregarious, or in Sholes; they go Southward to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hama</hi> Islands in <hi>October,</hi> and return in the Spring: Most of the <hi>Bermudas</hi> Whales are Finbacks, 20 to 30 <hi>pr.

The Whalers in deep Water, or at a considerable Distance from <hi>Nantucket,</hi> fit out in the Beginning and Middle of <hi>March.</hi> Third Week of <hi>Iuly</hi> Anno 1738 arrived our Whalers from <hi>Davis Straits.</hi> The <hi>New-England</hi> True Whale, is the same with the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> North-Cape Whales, are not easily kill'd, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile and very wild; the <hi>Dutch</hi> do not fish them. <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> Whales do not go far North, they pass by <hi>New-England</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> and return in the Spring. <hi>Grampus's, Bottle-noses,</hi> and the other small <hi>Cetaceous</hi> Kind are called <hi>Black Fish.</hi>

                  <p>It is not easily to be accounted for, that Whales do not in Course of Years become scarcer; considering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued great Slaughter of them by the Whaling Nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Cod-Fish. 5. That from the Blubber or <hi>Penicula adiposa</hi> of Seals and Sea-Cows. There are two Sorts of Seals, one Sort has its Skin dappled or in small Spots, the other Sort called the <hi>Ice-Seal,</hi> hath a large black Patch, runs slow, and is kill'd by a small Blow on the Head; 500 have been killed in a Harbour at <hi>Newfoundland</hi> in a Morning; the Skins and Blubber is their mercantile Produce.

                  <p>In cold Winters the Whales, as do other Fish, keep in deep Water. The <hi>New-England</hi> People whale with a Drudge or Stop-Water, not with long Ropes or Warps as the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Upon the Coast of <hi>New-England,</hi> Whales go Northward from the Middle of <hi>March</hi> to the Middle of <hi>May.</hi> About 30 Years ago, <hi>Communibus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> were exported from <hi>New-England</hi> about 5,000 Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Fish-Oil, at this Writing <hi>Anno</hi> 1748, about 10,000 Barrels, notwithstanding the Whales keeping a greater Offing.</p>

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> had early Settlements in <hi>L'Accadie</hi> or <hi>Nova Scotia</hi>; Capt. <hi>Argol</hi> from <hi>Virginia</hi> Anno 1613 visited <hi>Port-Royal</hi> and <hi>St. Croix</hi> and brought away two <hi>French</hi> Vessels. M. <hi>Biencourt</hi> was at that Time Governor of <hi>Port Royal: Argol</hi> broke up some <hi>French</hi> Settlements in <hi>Sagadahock</hi> and <hi>L'Accadie</hi> called Part of <hi>New France,</hi> or <hi>Terra Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densis</hi>; at present the Country North of <hi>St. Laurence</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, only, retains this Name: This Expedition of <hi>Argol</hi>'s made Way for Sir <hi>William Alexander</hi>'s Patent.

Governor <hi>Shirley</hi> in a Speech, observes, that "scarce such an Instance is to be found in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:"
A Colonel in this Expedition, gave it this Turn "That if the <hi>French</hi> had not given up <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> we might have endeavoured to storm it with the same Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Success, as the Devils might have stormed Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven."

"The wonderful Success GOD has given your <hi>American</hi> Forces:"
A Clergyman from <hi>London</hi> writes "This prosperous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, can hardly be ascribed to any Thing short of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition from above truly uncommon and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: These Expressions of the Governor's, &amp;c. ought not to be construed as derogating from the most bold Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>New-Englanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reduction of <hi>Louisbourg</hi> was much above our Capacity; in short, if any one Circumstance had taken a wrong Turn on our Side, and if any one Circumstance had not taken a wrong Turn on the <hi>French</hi> Side, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition must have miscarried, and our Forces would have returned with Shame, and an inextricable Loss to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; as this was a private or Corporation Adventure without any Orders from the Court of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the Charges would not have been reimbursed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and the People of <hi>New-England</hi> from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Generation would have cursed the Advisers and Promoters of this unaccountably rash Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <p>Here is a notorious Instance of the <hi>French</hi> too forward rash Conduct; contrary to express Instructions sent by the Court of <hi>France</hi> to the Garrison of <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> along with the Declaration of War (my Information was from M. <hi>le Marquis de la Maison Forte</hi> Capt. of the <hi>Vigilant</hi>) that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering

                  <p>After a short Description of the late <hi>French</hi> Colony of <hi>Cape Breton</hi> Islands, I shall briefly, without Interruption, and at one View relate that memorable Event of reducing <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> the <hi>French American Dunkirk,</hi> by a few <hi>New-England</hi> Militia, with the Countenance of some accidental <hi>British</hi> Men of War.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Louisbourg</hi> was given to us by the <hi>French,</hi> we found 600 regular Troops in Garrison, with about 1300 Militia, whereof about one half were called in from the adjacent Settlements; the main <hi>Fossee</hi> or <hi>Ditch</hi> 80 Feet wide, the Ramparts 30 Feet high (the <hi>Scalado</hi> or Scaling Ladders which we sent by the Direction of Mr. <hi>Bradstreet</hi> at present Lieut.-Governor of a Fort in <hi>St. Iohns</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> were too short by 10 Feet, and never were used) upon the Town Ramparts were mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 65 Cannon of various Sizes; the Entrance of the Harbour defended by a Grand Battery of about 30 Guns of 42 Pound Ball, and by the Island Battery of 30 Guns of 28 Pound Ball; Provisions for six Months, Ammunition sufficient, if well husbanded from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;

                     </note> As to the Affair of the Siege of the Town, it was in this Manner. In the beginning upon <hi>Greenhill</hi> 1550 Yards distant from the King's Bastion called the <hi>Citadel,</hi> we erected a Battery of a very few small Cannon, one 13 Inch, one 11 Inch, and one 9 Inch Mortars; they could
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:006307_0361_0F652E8F0DCFB4A0"/>
do no Execution; <hi>May</hi> 7, a Battery was made at 900 Yards Distance, and we summoned the Town; <hi>May</hi> 17, a Battery was advanced to 250 Yards Distance from the West Gate; <hi>May</hi> 20, on the other Side of a Creek was erected aBattery of five 42 Pounders, called <hi>Tidcomb</hi>'s Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, to batter the Circular Battery and Magazine.</p>
                  <p>We made no regular Approaches by Trenches, that is, by Parallels and Zigzags, but bombarded the Town at Random, and did much Damage to the Roofs of the Houses; the West Gate was defaced, the adjoining Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Flank of the King's Bastion were much hurt, but no practicable Breach.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Sunderland</hi> being arrived it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to storm the Town by Sea <hi>Iune</hi> 18, by three 60, one 50, and four 40 Gun Ships, while the Land Forces ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Place was put under the joint Administration of <hi>Pepperrell</hi> and <hi>Warren</hi>; and all future Charges were to be defray'd by their Bills upon the Pay-Master General and Ordnance. According to the enlisting Proclamation, our Militia were to be discharged so soon as the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was over; Governor <hi>Shirley</hi> arrived in <hi>Louisbourg</hi> Aug. 17, and persuaded them to continue; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, if the <hi>Vigilant,</hi> the <hi>Chester,</hi> and <hi>Louisbourg</hi> Fire Ship had not continued there over Winter, the Militia might have been discouraged, and the Place in Danger of being surprized by the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, Nova Scotia,</hi> and <hi>St. Iohns</hi> Island.</p>

The Project of raising two Regiments in <hi>New-England</hi> was faulty in two Respects. 1. A young Settlement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready much reduced in their young Men, by late Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; to exhaust them more by standing Levies, is a grievous Hardship; it not only retards or stunts the Growth of the Colony, but in Fact, miniorates them, and puts them backwards; this is the general Complaint of the Country, extravagant Price of Labour, and Want of Labourers. 2. The publick Disappointment of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where 2000 Men are depended upon; of these 1000 perhaps are and ever will be Non-Effectives, it being impracticable for the Country to spare so many Men, for standing or continued Regular Troops.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the speculative original Design, at Home might appear specious, that is, 1. A Garrison of Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digenous, Natives of, or habituated to the Climate. 2. That by reserving some Officer's Commissions, to the Disposal of the Colonels; the Gentlemen of our Militia, who had distinguish'd themselves in the Expeditions, might have some Reward for their Merit; this last De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was attended with the <note n="*" place="bottom">When I write with Freedom, impartial, disinterested Readers, will excuse me in Quality of a disinterested Historian; I have no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Disregard or Malice, and do write of the present Times, as if these Things had been transacted 100 Years since.</note> Inconveniency of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; by bestowing these Commissions to Purchasers, to Relations, and to Friends.</p>

                        <p>From Time to Time, anticipating the Affair of Currencies referred to the Appendix, may be excused: this pernicious desolating Torrent becoming more and more violent, requires a more speedy Resistance.</p>
                        <p>The Colony of <hi>Massachusetts Bay</hi> was the Leader of Paper Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the <hi>British</hi> Plantations, and have now at Length carried this Fraud to the utmost (even beyond <hi>North Carolina</hi> Management) if car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried further the Staple must break, and the Fraud of the wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors (in all Affairs there are Limits which in the Nature of Things cannot be exceeded) cease.</p>
                        <p>I shall enumerate some of the many Mischiefs attending the bad fraudulent Management of Paper Currencies. I. From an Equality with Sterling, afterwards with Proclamation Value, they have reduced the Value of our Currency to 10 for 1 8t. II. The Governor and Legislature keep up their Salaries and Wages to the Sterling Value, but seemingly allow all other Transactions to run into Confusion and ruinous Depreciations. III. The Depreciations might have in a great Measure been obviated, even when there were great Exigencies for present Money; thus after the first Emissions being 40,000 £. Anno 1690 and 1691 to pay off the publick Debts incurred by <hi>Phips</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada Expedition, when there was an Appearance of an ensuing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation, if more were emitted; the Government did wisely borrow the Bills already emitted, from the Possessors, with good Effect, and these Bills did not depreciate: If, in the <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> and amusing late <hi>Canada</hi> Expeditions, we had done the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would have had the like good Effect with Respect to the Publick, but would not have answered the wickedIntentions and Occasions of thePromoters of these Bills, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of those who had acquired the Craft of negotiating (in troubled Waters good Fishing) these depreciating Bills to their own Advantage. 2. Of those who were to liberate their mortgaged E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states by defrauding their Creditors with a depreciated nominal Value, instead of the true contracted Value<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well knowing that a multiplied Paper Credit, depreciates itself more and more.

               <p>THE next four following Sections concern the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of <hi>New-England,</hi> at present divided into four several <hi>Colonies</hi> or Governments; to render the Accounts of them more clear and distinct, we shall begin this Section with an introductory Article, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concerning the sundry Grants and Settlements made, before they were colonized by Royal Charters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: As <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> Province, is composed of many different Grants, united at present in one Charter; some general Account of these several Territories may be useful; afterwards we proceed to more particular Accounts of these Territories in so many distinct Articles, beginning from the Northward.</p>
               <div n="1" type="article">
                  <head>ARTICLE I. Some general Account of the Dominions of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a general Account of the Territories incorporated by royal Charter into one Province or Colony by the Name of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>

                  <p>This is a laborious Affair, being obliged to consult MSS Records; the many printed Accounts are, 1. Too credulous and superstitious. 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>New-England</hi> was first discovered to any Purpose, by Capt. <hi>Gosnold</hi> 1602, and the Fish, Train Oil, Skin, and Fur Trade thereof, with the <hi>Indians</hi> for some Years, was principally carried on by some <hi>Bristol</hi> Men. A rascally Fellow Capt. <hi>Hunt,</hi> carried off some <hi>Indians,</hi> and in the Mediterranean Sea of <hi>Europe</hi> sold them to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as Slaves, <hi>Mores</hi> of the Coast of <hi>Barbary</hi>; during some following Years the <hi>Indians</hi> had an Aversion to, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy of the <hi>English</hi> Traders; but at Length <hi>Anno</hi> 1619 they were brought to a thorough Reconciliation, which made the Beginning of the <hi>New Plymouth</hi> Settlement more easily carried on.</p>
                  <p>This Capt. <hi>Gosnold</hi> of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> was an Associate of <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s; Anno 1602 from <hi>England</hi> instead of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wide indirect Course to <hi>Virginia</hi> by the <hi>Canary</hi> and <hi>Caribee</hi> Islands; he sail'd a more direct or Northern Course, and fell in with this Coast, was embay'd in N. Lat. 42 d. 10 m, where he caught many Cod Fish, and called it <hi>Cape Cod</hi>; thence sailing Southward he gave Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Name to one Island; and to the next Island, where he found Quantities of wild Grape Vines, he gave the Name of <hi>Martha</hi>'s <hi>Vineyard</hi>; these Names are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this Day.</p>
                  <p>Capt. <hi>Gosnold</hi> at his Return to <hi>England</hi> gave a good Character of this new Country, which induced several Gentlemen jointly to obtain a Royal Grant <hi>Anno</hi> 1606 (Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> from his Attainder having forfeited his Grants in <hi>North America) April</hi> 10, they were two

The other was called the Northern District, <hi>North Virginia,</hi> or the Company of <hi>Plymouth</hi> or West Country Adventurers; Lord chief Justice <hi>Popham</hi> and Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> were of this Company; Lord chief Justice <hi>Popham</hi> was their Patron and principal Promoter, he dying soon after, the Settlement dropt, but some Trade for Fish, Skins and Furs was carried on for some Years. Their first Adventure was taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Anno 1606. Capt. <hi>George Popham</hi> appointed President or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of a Settlement to be made there, came over with Capt. <hi>Gilbert</hi> in 2 Ships with Families and Stores <hi>Anno</hi> 1607; some Families wintered at <hi>Sagadahoc</hi> near the Mouth of <hi>Quenebec</hi> River (here many good Rivers meet and discharge themselves into a Bay called Merry-meeting Bay) <hi>Anno</hi> 1608, but soon left it with the Character of a cold, barren, inhospitable Desert.</p>
                  <p>Capt. <hi>Smith</hi> called the Traveller, sometime President of <hi>Virginia,</hi> an ingenious Man, <hi>Anno</hi> 1614 with two Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels came upon this Coast for Trade and Discovery of Mines of Minerals, Metals, and Precious Stones, <hi>Auri sacra fames</hi> promoted most of our <hi>American</hi> Discoveries; he survey'd the Coast well, and gave Names (still upon Record) to many of the Head Lands, Bays and Rivers, which are now obsolete, and other Names have taken Place: He presented a Plan of the Country to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and it was called NEW-ENGLAND, which Name it retains to this Day.</p>

                  <head>ARTICLE 2. Concerning <hi>Sagadahoc,</hi> formerly called the <hi>Duke of York's</hi> Property.</head>
                  <p>KING <hi>Charles</hi> II, <hi>March</hi> 12. 1663, 4 granted to his Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> a certain Territory or Tract of Land, thus described,
"All that Part of the main Land of <hi>New-England,</hi> beginning at a certain Place, called or known by the Name of <hi>St. Croix</hi> adjoining to <hi>New-Scotland</hi> in <hi>America;</hi> and from thence extending along the Sea Coast, unto a certain Place called <hi>Pemaquin</hi> or <hi>Pema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,</hi> and so up by the River thereof, to the furthest Head of the same, as it tendeth Northwards, and extending from thence to the River of <hi>Quenebec,</hi> and so up by the shortest Course to the River of <hi>Canada</hi> Northwards."
This was called the <hi>Duke of York</hi>'s Property, and annexed to the Government of <hi>New York.</hi> The Duke of <hi>York</hi> upon the Death of his Brother K. <hi>Charles</hi> II, became K. <hi>Iames</hi> II; and upon K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Abdication these Lands reverted to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>At present the Territory of <hi>Sagadahoc,</hi> is supposed to extend from the River <hi>St. Croix</hi> Eastward, to the River of <hi>Quenebec</hi> Westward, and from each of these two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers due North to the River of <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> thus <hi>St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> or <hi>Canada</hi> River is its Northern Boundary, and the Atlantick Ocean is its Southern Boundary. When <hi>Nova

Scotia</hi> was in Possession of the <hi>French, Sagadahoc</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was included in the Commission of the <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>L'Accadie</hi> or <hi>Nova Scotia</hi>; thus it was in the Time of granting a new royal Charter to <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> therefore to keep up the <hi>English</hi> Claim to this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, as well as to <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> the Jurisdiction of both were included in that Charter.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> 1713, <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadahoc</hi> were quit claim'd by <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; and the Court of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> reassumed the Jurisdiction of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and after a few Years more, the Crown purchased the Property of the Soil or <hi>Seigneurie</hi> of all the <hi>French</hi> Claimers; it is now a separate King's Government, with the Property in the Crown: But this Territory of <hi>Sagadahoc</hi> remains in the Jurisdiction of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> and sends one Member to the Council, but hitherto not any to the House of Representatives of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay:</hi> The General Assembly cannot dispose of Lands there, without the Consent of the King in Council. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of peculiar Grants there, remain good to the several Claimers, until the Crown do purchase the same as was the Case in <hi>Nova Scotia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Col. <hi>Dunbar</hi> projected <hi>Sagadahoc</hi> Territory to be set off as a separate Government for himself; this was introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by obtaining a royal Instrument or Instruction, to set off 300,000 Acres of good Mast and Ship-Timber Land, for the Use of the Crown or Navy; it was forwarded by a royal Instruction to Col. <hi>Phillips</hi> Governor of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> April 27, 1730. to take Possession of the Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>St. Croix</hi> River and <hi>Quenebec</hi> River; accordingly a Detachment of 30 Men with an Officer, was made from the four Companies of his Regiment in Garrison at <hi>Canso</hi> in <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> was sent to take Possession of that Country, to keep Garrison at <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Fort on <hi>Pemaquid</hi> River, here the Detachment kept for some Time: Upon Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Home of the <hi>Muscongus</hi> Company, Proprietors in Part of <hi>Sagadahoc,</hi> by their indefatigable Agent Mr. <hi>Waldo,</hi> this Instruction was revoked <hi>August</hi> 10, 1732, and
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:006307_0391_0F652F4559FC7358"/>
Col. <hi>Phillips</hi>'s Detachment was called off. At present, the Province of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> to obviate Cavils or Complaints; of their relinquishing the Occupancy of this Territory; keep a Truck-House and Garrison at <hi>Georges,</hi> and a Garrison at Fort <hi>Frederick,</hi> and is likely to continue under the Jurisdiction of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> and is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present annexed to the County of <hi>York,</hi> or Province of <hi>Maine.</hi>

By no Evidence it was made appear that the Water (a salt Water <hi>Sinus,</hi> commonly called a Continuation of <hi>Taunton</hi> River, it is called <hi>Taunton</hi> great River in their private Deeds) between the main Land on the East, and the Island of <hi>Rhode Island</hi> on the West, was ever at any Time called <hi>Naraganset</hi> River.</p>
                     <p>The Determination of the Commissioners <hi>Anno</hi> 1741 was by the King in Council 1746 confirmed as final.

This, together with other Lands, included all the late Province of <hi>New-Hampshire</hi>; the Claim was revived by Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> and others about 30 Years since, when some <hi>Irish</hi> Presbyterians petitioned both Assemblies of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> and of <hi>New-Hampshire,</hi> for a Settlement or Township of Lands; these Emigrants are settled upon Part of those Lands by Charter or Grant from the Governor and Council of <hi>New Hampshire</hi>; their Township is called <hi>Londonderry</hi> (formerly <hi>Nutfield</hi>) and flourishes much; they are a noted Pattern and Example of Industry and Frugality, particularly they excel in the Fabrick or Manufacture of Linnen Cloth: May the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Townships of <hi>New-England</hi> copy from them!

                  <p>AS we before hinted by a Charter <hi>October</hi> 7. 1691, sundry Territories, under several Grants and Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for their better Accommodation and Conveniencies,

were united by Charter into one Property and Jurisdiction, that is, into one General Assembly.</p>
                  <p>The Bill for restoring the <hi>New-England</hi> Charters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dropt by the Dissolution of the Revolution-Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Parliament; the <hi>New-England</hi> Agents were puzzled, whether, to stand a Trial at Law, by a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> for reversing the Judgments against the old Charters, or to accept of a Draught of a new Charter; at length they acquiesced in the King's Pleasure, and the King directed a new Charter.</p>
                  <p>The Nature of this Union of several Colonies into one Jurisdiction, the new Charter with a subsequent explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Charter, and sundry other general Affairs, have been by Way of Anticipation already narrated, see P. 374, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the general Account of <hi>British North-America,</hi> we omitted the Post-Office, a very beneficial Institution; and as the present Province of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> is its most considerable Branch, here it may naturally take Place.</p>
                  <p>The Post-Office in <hi>England</hi> was settled by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 12 <hi>Carol.</hi> II. In the Beginning of this present Century Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>New-Iersies</hi> projected a Post-Office for <hi>British North-Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

paying to the Deliverer One Penny Sterl. per Letter. N. B. This Clause is not much attended to, because the Act exempts Merchants Letters, and those of Masters of Ships, so as such Letters be delivered to the Persons to whom they are directed without receiving any Profit for them: And any Letters sent by private Friends, or by any Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger about private Affairs or Business.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Piscataqua</hi> or <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Postage, from thence to <hi>Williamsburg</hi> is uncertain, because the Post does not proceed until Letters are lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, sufficient to pay the Charge of the Post-Riders: From <hi>Williamsburg</hi> in <hi>Virginia</hi> to <hi>Charles-Town</hi> in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> the Post-Carriage is still more uncertain.</p>
                  <p>There is a Deputy Post-Master-General for <hi>America</hi> appointed by the Post-Master-General in <hi>London; New-York</hi> is appointed for his Official Residence, but by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance he resides any where, <hi>v. g.</hi> at present in <hi>Virginia Elliot Benger,</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>This Administration may be divided into the legislative supreme Court, called the <hi>General Court</hi> or <hi>General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> of the Province; and the subordinate <hi>executive</hi> Courts.</p>
                     <p>The Great and General Court or Provincial Assembly, consists of <hi>three Negatives,</hi> viz. the Governor, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and House of Representatives.</p>
                     <p>The Governor is by Patent or Commission from the King <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> with a Book of Instructions; which Instructions though binding to the Governor (fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently broke in upon by some Governors) are not so to the House of Representatives, as they have from Time to Time represented to the Governor; for Instance, one of the Instructions requires a Sallary of <hi>One Thousand Pounds</hi> Sterl. <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be settled upon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; this is always obstinately refused, but are willing to grant him a yearly Support, sutable to the Dignity of his Excellency, and consistent with the Ability of the People their Constituents, of which it may be supposed they only are the proper Judges.</p>
                     <p>The military Government by Sea and Land, is sole in the King's Governors; they grant all Commissions in the Militia, which gives the Governors a vast Influence; Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Plantations are readily bribed by distinguishing Titles.—
The Governors in the Plantations have that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Power of negativing or suspending Counsellors without assigning Reasons; Governor <hi>Belcher</hi> at one Time negatived 13 Councellors in the pernicious Land-Bank Interest; this Management of Mr. <hi>Belcher</hi>'s was in a high Manner approved of by the passing an Act of the British Parliament soon after; this Land-Bank is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in the Words of the Act "mischievous Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings in <hi>America,</hi> and unlawful Undertakings;" but so it is, that this Act of Parliament is not fully put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

being, with the Militia Officers of the several Townships, a great Majority in the lower House, gives the Governor a very great Influence there: the Power of negativing the Members of the upper House makes his Influence there so considerable, that he has in a great Measure two <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi> in the Legislature; the King at Home cannot <hi>negative</hi> or suspend any Member of the upper House cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the House of Lords.</p>
                     <p>The Governor has the Opportunity of recommending to the House, Agents or Provincial Attorneys, his Friends or Creatures; to manage their Affairs and his own at the Court and Boards in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and to procure for them handsome Gratuities: For Instance, the Governor in a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ssage to the Assembly, <hi>March</hi> 16. 1743, 4, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends a generous Allowance to Mr. <hi>Kilby,</hi> he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing served the Province upon particular Orders of this Court, with great Industry, Faithfulness and Success. A Governor by frequent and long. Speeches and Messages to the House of Representatives (sometimes near one half of the Journal or Votes of the House of Representatives consists of these Speeches and Messages) seems to act as a Member of that House, or rather as the Speaker or Orator (a <hi>French</hi> Expression) of the House; sometimes Governors proceed further, for Instance, <hi>Anno</hi> 1744 the Governor desires of the House of Representatives; that in the Recess of the General Assembly (which must be short Intervals, because of late Years the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at a great Charge to the Province have had very frequent and long Sittings) upon any sudden Emergency, the Governor and his Council may be impowered to draw upon the Treasurer. The Governor has a Negative not only in all Bills of Assembly, but also in all their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that of a Speaker not excepted.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Governor commissions all Militia, and other military Officers, independently of the Council or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; he nominates all Civil Officers, excepting those concerned in the <hi>Finances</hi> or Money-Affairs, and with Consent of the Council, they are accordingly appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

He calls, dissolves, prorogues, adjourns, removes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways harrasses the General Assembly at Pleasure; he frequently refuses his Assent to Bills, Resolves, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the General Court; whereas our Sovereign in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> excepting upon very extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, does not exert this Prerogative; thus we see a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated Power assuming more than the sovereign consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Authority chuses to venture upon.</p>
                     <p>His just pecuniary Perquisites are considerable, an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance or Grant of 1000 £.

                     <p>Notwithstanding of this great Authority, a Governor's Station is very slippery; upon frivolous and sometimes false Complaints he is liable to be called to Account, <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Province of <hi>Massachusetts</hi> is represented in their Lower House, not by a Deputation from Counties, Cities and Boroughs, as in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and in some of the <hi>British</hi> Colonies; but from certain Districts of Land or Country, <hi>incorporated</hi> by the Names of Townships, very unequal in Extent, thus <hi>Springfield</hi> contains upwards of 100,000 Acres, <hi>Medford</hi> does not exceed 2000 Acres; but generally they are the Value of six Miles square, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearly 23,000 Acres: Their Number of Inhabitants is as various, and consist of one to five <hi>Parishes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Charter declares "each of the said Towns and Places, being hereby impowered to elect and depute two Persons and no more, to serve for and represent them respectively in the said great General Court or Assembly.
<q>To which great General Court or Assembly, to be held as aforesaid, we do hereby, for us, our Heirs and Successors, give and grant full Power and Authority from Time to Time, to direct, appoint, and declare what Number, each County, Town, and Place, shall elect and depute, to serve for, and represent them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, in the said great and General Court or Assembly.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This last Clause gives a very <hi>great Latitude</hi> to our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assemblies to regulate the Representation of the Country. 1. The Charter says, each Place is impowered to depute two Persons and no more; <hi>Boston</hi> is allowed to send four; it is true, that equitably, considering their Taxes and Number of Inhabitants in Proportion to the whole Colony Representation; they might be <hi>allowed to send Twenty,</hi> but such Proportions are not observed in <hi>Great Britain</hi> our Mother-Country, perhaps for Reasons

of State. 2. By Acts of Assembly all Townships under 120 qualified Voters are restricted to send <hi>one</hi> and no more, whereas by Charter any Township may send <hi>two.</hi> 3. The Charter does not limit the Number of qualified Voters in any Township or Place constituted, to enable them to send Representatives; they seem to be limited by Acts of Assembly, but with this reasonable Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no Township consisting of less than 80 legal Voters shall be obliged, that is fined for the not sending of a Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

I shall mention a few, 1.

the Words of the Charter are, "the Assembly to impose and levy proportionable and reasonable Assess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rates, and Taxes; upon the Estates and Persons of all and every the Proprietors or Inhabitants of our said Province or Territory; to be issued and disposed of, by Warrant under the Hand of the Governor of our said Province for the Time being, with the Advice and Consent of the Council."

                        <p>Because all Acts of Assembly, are required by the Charter to be sent Home for Allowance or Disallowance, therefore many Things are done, by the Name of <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Resolve.</hi>

                        <p>The General Assembly by their accepting of an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory Charter upwards of Thirty Years since; have curtailed the House of Representatives, from the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of electing their own <hi>Speaker absolutely</hi>; that is, a Power is reserved to the Governor, or any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, to negative or disapprove any Speaker elected and presented; and that the Representatives so assembled, shall forthwith elect any other Person to be Speaker, to be approved or disapproved, in Manner as

                        <p>Although the Military, are the absolute Prerogative of the King and of his Representative the Governor; the Assembly, especially the House of Representatives, do upon extraordinary Occasions, in Faithfulness to their Constituents <hi>complain,</hi> and in some Measure <hi>admonish</hi> the Governor: We shall adduce a few late Instances. — 1746, The House by Message to the Governor, say, that they suspect the Governor's <hi>inlisting</hi> Men for his <hi>Louisbourg</hi> Regiment, out of the impressed Frontier Forces: The Governor denies this, but acknowledges that he had allowed the Frontier Soldiers to be inlisted in the <hi>Canada</hi> Expedition, and to impress Men in their Place —It does not appear to us necessary or convenient, for this Government, any Ways to concern themselves in building of a Fort at the great Carrying-Place from <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s River to <hi>Wood Creek</hi> in the Government of <hi>New-York.</hi>
—The Forces, particularly upon the Eastern Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, have been very negligent in <hi>scouting,</hi> and all other military Services; there have been many <hi>Ineffectives,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of several Townships; to do Duty in their own Townships, have been inlisted, paid, and victualled, though they only followed their own private Business, "this is very abusive to the Government, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to these exposed Parts."
— 1747,
The Assembly represent "the Husbandry, Manufactures, and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Province; have suffered much by multiplied Expeditions."
— "We have by our past Actions proved our selves <hi>zealous</hi> for his <hi>Majesty's Service</hi>; but our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness is, that although the same Disposition remains, yet we are in a Manner <hi>incapacitated</hi> to promote it for the future.</p>

"A Creditor who has the Misfortune of having an out standing Debt, of the Value of 1000 £.

"It is the <hi>Injustice</hi> of those Bills, which has plunged us into those <hi>Difficulties</hi>— in some subsequent Assemblies

                              <p>On the other Side of the Question; we may observe, that, 1. Of late Years, the Sessions of Assembly, are <hi>longer</hi> and <hi>more frequent,</hi> than ever; for Instance, the annual Assembly of 1746, did sit about 30 Weeks at the daily Charge (our Assembly-Men are all in Pay) of near 150 £. 2. Our Provincial Debt 1741, when Mr. <hi>Belcher</hi> was superseded, was about 130,000 £.; at present 1749, it is about <hi>two Millions.</hi>—3.
"The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>sudden</hi> Depreciations of Province-Bills, is owing to the immoderate Price of Exchange and Silver— 4. <hi>Ian.</hi> 15. 1741, 2,
" The Instruction, containing a restraining Clause in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Bills of Credit, is remitted: As this is an Alteration, which I am perswaded (Speech to the Assembly) will be <hi>very agreeable</hi> unto you, and has been occasioned through my Accession to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I mention it to you with no SMALL SATISFACTION.— 5.
In a Speech to the Assembly, "from 1718 to 1743, in constant Practice all Debts upon Book, Note, Bond, or Mortgage, were discharged in Province Bills Penny for Penny, that is, in the <hi>nominal Sum</hi>; which he deems to be equitable, because both Creditor and Debtor, tacitly run the Chance of the rising or falling of those Bills."
<hi>N. B.</hi> This was the <hi>common Cant</hi> of the <hi>Land Bank Managers</hi> and <hi>other Debtors</hi>; the Forbearance and Indulgence of Creditors is ridiculed, as much, as if a Person intrusted by another with Money or Goods, should turn <hi>Bankrupt</hi> and laugh at his Friend for his Trust, alledging, that it was in his Option, to trust or not trust him. How provoking is this, to an honest Man, for his Good Nature and Compassion to have his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate first by a <hi>private,</hi> and afterwards by a <hi>more open</hi> and <hi>daring Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi> of the Debtors reduced in a reverse Proportion of 12 <hi>s.</hi> to 30 <hi>s.</hi> the Price of Silver from <hi>Anno</hi> 1718 to 1743, and from 30 <hi>s.</hi> to 60 <hi>s.</hi> as it is <hi>Anno</hi> 1749; and afterwards be laughed at as a silly Fool.</p>
                              <p>And in Fact, how could a Person remedy himself with the strictest Sagacity in the following Cases? A Man lets out Money upon Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <hi>May</hi> 1745, Exchange with <hi>London</hi> 650 £. Currency for 100 £. Sterl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; in the Space of three Years <hi>May</hi> 1748, Exchange is 1100 £. Currency for 100 £. Sterl.: A Creditor all this Time cannot recover his Money, because by the Laws of the Province, near one Year (by Appeals and Reviews) is required to bring a Bond to final Judgment, and the Equity of Redemption is three Years more: Moreover, the publick Loans and the private Bank Loans were conditioned at 10 to 15 Years Forbearance, which with the abovesaid four Years additional; makes an unavoidable Forbearance of 14 to 19 Years: Further, some of the Loan 1716 (a great Damage to the Publick) is not sued out at this present Writing. How is it possible to provide against the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued great Depreciations during so many Years?</p>
                              <p>As it does not belong to any Provincial Assembly, to explain Acts of Parliament; because they may be deemed sufficient to execute themselves, under the Agency of the Colony executive Courts; I do not pretend to be Statesman sufficient, to account for a Bill brought into our Court of Legislature yearly, for these eight Years last past; entitled, <hi>A Bill for the more speedy finishing of the Land-Bank Scheme</hi>; as it is never brought to an Issue, perhaps some may call it, rather a <hi>Bill of Grace.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Governor <hi>Shirley</hi> in his Speech <hi>October</hi> 14. 1741,
"Nothing is <hi>more easy,</hi> than to secure to <hi>every Creditor</hi> his <hi>just Due,</hi> let the Bills de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate never so much, by enabling the King's Judges to do Justice to every Creditor in that Particular— It is the <hi>Injustice</hi> of our Bills which has plunged us into these <hi>Difficulties.</hi>"
But as this Advice has not been followed or repeated, the Creditors have generally suffered in the reverse Proportion of 60 to 30 in a few Years; such is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Nature of this <hi>depascent Ulcer,</hi> that nothing but the Extirpation or Excision of this, can save our Body Politick; <hi>delenda est.</hi>

                              <p>This Scheme for <hi>fraudulent Debtors</hi> to cheat their Creditors, was first projected <hi>Anno</hi> 1714, by <hi>I. C.</hi> The Maxim or Basis was by multiplied Emissions to depreciate the nominal Value of our Currency; thus the Difference between the nominal Value, at any Time when paid, and its real Value when lent or contracted for; was a fraudulent Gain to the Debtor, and a very injurious Loss to the honest Creditor; for Instance, <hi>Anno</hi> 1713, Exchange with <hi>London</hi> 150 £. Currency for 100 £. Sterl.; at present 1749, by Depreciations we are at 1100 £. Currency for 100 £. Sterl.; that is in successive Dealings, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor has lost six in seven of his Debts or Contracts, which is the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's crafty Gain. There were various Essays made from Time to Time, to arrive to this Depreciation, the last was <hi>miraculously</hi> the most successful. 1.

Postponing the cancelling of Emissions; thus Emissions yearly multiplied, and the cancelling of them delayed, increased this Flood of a base Currency. 3. Notes of private Associations designed to be upon a Par, current with publick Bills of Credit, would have multiplied this false Currency immensly, but from private Complaints sent Home, this was crushed in <hi>Embrio,</hi> by Act of the <hi>British</hi> Parliament 1741. 4. At length by multiplied expensive Expeditions, they compassed their Designs to the greatest Extent, or to a <hi>ne plus Ultra,</hi> which it is to be hoped the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in their wonted Goodness, will rectify in their present Session.</p>
                              <p>I am sorry that upon any Occasion, or in any Respect; I should give Offence to any particular Person, or to any Number of Men: It is not from Malice or Resentment: It cannot be imagined, that in Course, writing unavoidable historical Truths, I should designedly and maliciously reflect upon the Country and its municipal Jurisdiction; this is my <hi>Altera Patria,</hi> from upwards of thirty Years Residence.</p>

                           <hi>N. B.</hi> Anno 1731 Some Townships were taken from the Counties of <hi>Suffolk, Middlesex,</hi> and <hi>Hampshire</hi>; and formed into a new County called the County of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As this History seems to swell too much for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusal of the People in our Infant Colonies, who in general are not <hi>Bookish,</hi> and do not apply themselves to read Books of any considerable Bulk; I must forbear insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the long List of the Townships in <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> Province.</p>
                        <p>We shall here only observe, that our Townships or Districts of Land, may be distinguished into four Sorts. 1. Incorporated Townships which are served with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and generally send Representatives, this Year they are in Number 95. 2. Incorporated Townships, which are served with Precepts, but generally do not send Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives, this present Year they are 58; their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being so large, is occasioned by their Poverty, which proceeds from their labouring young Men being taken away, that is, <hi>depopulated</hi> by <hi>multiplied Expeditions,</hi> and their being <hi>peculated</hi> by <hi>multiplied Taxes</hi>; formerly our Province Tax was from <hi>Six Thousand</hi> to (in great Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies)

                           <hi>Forty Thousand Pound</hi> per Ann; whereas this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Year 1748 the Provincial Tax upon Polls and Estates is <hi>Three Hundred seventy-seven Thousand nine Hundred ninety two Pounds,</hi> and Excises doubled; thus they cannot well spare 30 <hi>s.</hi> a Day the present Wages of aRepresentative. 3. Townships incorporated, but in express Words debarred from sendingRepresentatives; these are but few inNumber, because lately introduced; this seems <hi>Anti-Constitutional,</hi> that (as we have no County Representatives) Persons of good Estates real and personal should in no manner be represented, as if they were Aliens, Servants or Slaves. 4. Townships or Districts granted to a Number of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, but as the Conditions of the Grant, particularly the settling of a certain Number of Families in a limited Space of Time, are not fully performed, they are not as yet qualified to be constituted, by Act of Assembly, with all Town Privileges; of those there are many, especially in those Lands which lately were taken from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> and annexed to the Crown in Property, and to the Province of <hi>New-Hampshire</hi> in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.

                              <p>About 20 Years since, and for some following Years, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly of the Province were in the Humour of dividing and appropriating most of the then reckoned Provincial or unoccupied Lands; that in Case of future Claims by the Crown, &amp;c. by Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they might retain at least the Property: This was provident and good Policy, and accordingly upon settling the Line between the two Provinces, the Property of the abovesaid Districts, was in the Commission reserved to these Possessors; but lately the Heirs and Assigns of Mr. <hi>Mason,</hi> original Grantee of <hi>New-Hampshire,</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated the <hi>Massachusetts</hi> Proprietors, and brought sundry of them to compound for a valuable Quit-Claim, whereas if by Contribution of the present Proprietors (a meer Trifle to each of them) they by Petition had carried the Affair before the King in Council, they would have been quieted in their Property, and obviated any further Claims, such as the Claims of Col. <hi>Allen</hi>'s Heirs, Mr. <hi>Mason</hi>'s general Assignee; and of the Claims of the Million Purchase lately revived, which may likewise be converted into Bubbles.</p>
                              <p>Our General Assembly at that Time were in such a Hurry to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the vacant Lands, that several old Townships were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to petition for an additional new Township; and when they were satiated, the Assembly introduced by Way of Bounty to the Descendents of the Soldiers in the <hi>Indian</hi> War of King <hi>Philip</hi> (so called) 1675, and of the Soldiers in Sir <hi>William Phipps</hi>'s Expedition against <hi>Canada,</hi> Anno 1690; thus nine Townships were granted to each of these Expeditions: Thus no Lands (excepting in the inland back Wilderness of the Province of <hi>Main</hi>) were left to recompence the Descendents of the particular Sufferers (the Province in general was an unaccountable Sufferer) in the unforeseen and inconceivable (because rash) Expedition against <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> our Administration per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps did not understand the Doctrine of Chances; but by good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, though the Chance was upwards of a Million to One against us, we gained the Prize, not by playing away Men (as is the Phrase in <hi>Flanders</hi>) in being killed, but by the <hi>Poltroonery</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Garrison; this must not be understood as detracting from the <hi>New-England</hi> Militia Troops, who are noted for their Courage as <hi>Bull-Dogs</hi> (excuse the Expression) where they fix, they never quit hold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they conquer, or are cut to Pieces.</p>

                        <p>There are a few Things, in which the House of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives of the Province of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> (which in all Respects is the principal <hi>British</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony) do vary from the Practice of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> I shall mention two, which must not be deemed constitutional, as being only by sundry Acts of the General Assembly, and consequently if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, may be repealed or altered by some subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Act.</p>

a Gentleman of good natural Interest and Resident in the Province, a Man of Reading, Observation, and daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with Affairs of Policy and Commerce, is certainly better qualified for a Legislator, than a Retailer of Rum and small Beer called a Tavern-Keeper, in a poor obscure Country Town, remote from all Business; thus this Countryman will not be diverted from the most necessary and beneficial Labour of cultivating the Ground, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Qualification; to attend State-Affairs, of which he may be supposed grosly and invincibly ignorant; thus the poor Township, by Gentlemen at large <hi>serving gratis</hi> or <hi>generously</hi> as the Quota of the Township, will be freed from the growing (in one Year from <hi>Anno</hi> 1747 to 1748 this Charge was advanced from 20 <hi>s.</hi> to 30 <hi>s.</hi> per Day) Charge of subsisting an useless Representative: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if this Clause of Residence in the Act of Assembly 1693, is not absolutely repealed, may it not be qualified in this Manner? <hi>viz.</hi> The Representative if not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in the Township, being a Resident in the Province, shall have a Rent Roll of **** <hi>per Annum</hi> in the Place, or shall be the Proprietor of **** Hundred Acres in the Township for which he is elected.</p>

As the Affair I mean is only temporary, I shall subjoin it amongst the Annotations.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>It is arrogant, in some Measure seditious, and a great Sin against the divine Institution of Society; for any Person or Persons, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against the Acts of Legislature: the following are only some private Speculations, concerning the negotiating of the late <hi>Cape-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Expedition Reimbursement Money, and the <hi>sudden Transition</hi> from an immense base Paper-Currency, to that good and universal Medium of Silver Money.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The late Act for receiving and negotiating our <hi>Reimbursement</hi> Money granted by the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> impowers Sir <hi>Peter Warren,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bollan,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> or two of them, the said <hi>Bollan</hi> to be one; perhaps the giving of a Negative to Mr. <hi>Bollan,</hi> may disgust the other two Gentlemen, so as to prevent their acting, and consequently occasion a further Delay of the <hi>Reimbursement</hi>; did not, Mr. <hi>Bollan</hi>'s being formerly appointed sole Agent in this Affair, disgust his Fellow Provincial Agent Mr. <hi>Kilby,</hi> a Gentleman of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Spirit in transacting of Business; and occasion a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Merchants and others, <hi>Sept.</hi> 21. 1748, to the Treasury of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to delay the Remittance of the <hi>Reimbursement</hi> Money, for Reasons therein specified? This Delay is a Damage to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try after the Rate (I mean the Interest of the Money) of 11,000 £. Sterl: or 110,000 £. Old Tenor per Annum; as if some Debtors Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers, studied Methods to delay the <hi>Melioration</hi> of the Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Currencies, by clogging the Affair.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The Amount of our Provincial Debt (that is of our publick Bills, or Paper Currency) <hi>Anno</hi> 1748, was about 2,405,000 £. Old Tenor; by thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ct a Part of it 712,000 £. is to be sunk by very heavy Rates upon a reduced poor People, in the Years 1748 and 1749; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                 </gap>maining 1,693,000 £. Old Tenor, to be redeemed or exchanged by the Reimbursement Silver; Commissions, Freight, Insurance, and some petty Charges being first deducted.</p>
                              <p>I use the Words, a poor reduced People, 1.
In Conformity to sundry Expressions used at several Times by the House of Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, in their Messages to the Governor, "with publick Taxes we are burdened almost to Ruin."—
"The Province is at a prodigious daily Charge beyond their Strength, which has involved us in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Load of Debt, and in a manner exhausted our Substance."—
"Although the same Disposition remains, yet we are in a manner incapable to promote (the <hi>British</hi> Interest) it for the future."
2. The Loss of about 3000 robust, labouring young Men by Expeditions; Major <hi>Little</hi> lately Commander of the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sent to <hi>Annapolis</hi> in <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> in his Book published in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> 1748, concerning the Nature of the present Trade of our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Colonies, writes, that by multiplied Expeditions they had lost 7000 Men, and many Thousands perverted to Idleness: here I may, by Way of Amusement observe, that according to the Estimates of Political Arithmeticians, in all well settled Countries the Numbers of Males and Females are nearly equal (some are very particular, and suppose 18 Male Births, to 17 Female Births) therefore as we have lately by Expeditions lost about Three Thousand <hi>young Men,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with us a Ballance of Three Thousand <hi>young Women,</hi> good Breeders, but idle in that Respect; the Ballance may be transferred to settle <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> under the Cover of some Regiments of Soldiers, that must be disbanded, which in the Interim may be transported to <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> cantoned, and continued in Pay for two or three Years, with Portions of Land, at an easy Quit-rent; thus the <hi>French</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers, our perfidiousSubjects may be elbowed out. 3. The inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Decay of our Trade and Business: Fishery and Ship building are the most considerable Articles: Formerly from <hi>Marblehead</hi> our principal Cod-Fishery-Port, there were about 160 Fishing Scooners, at present 1748 only about 60 Scooners: Formerly there have been upon the Stocks in <hi>Boston</hi> 7000 Ton of Top-sail Vessels, at present not much exceeding 2000 Tons. 4. Some of our Townships, and consequently their Proportion of Taxes, have lately by the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King in Council, been set off to the neighbouring Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of <hi>New-Hampshire</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Island.</hi> 5. The late sudden and considerably enhanced Pay of the three Negatives of the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, notwithstanding Exchange, Silver, and Necessaries of Life (Cloathing growing cheaper) being nearly at the same Price <hi>Anno</hi> 1747 and 1748.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Our Combination of Debtors who formerly were for postponing of Paper Money, all of a sudden inconsistently with their proper Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                                 </gap> in troubled Waters; perhaps as Paper-Currency arrived by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to a vast Sum, and great Depreciation; it would be more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to sink it gradually in the Space of half a Dozen, or half a Score of Years; and by Act of Parliament (not by precarious Instructions) no more Paper-Money to be emitted, a Governor consenting to any such Emissions to be rendred incapable and mulcted. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I always was a professed Enemy to all Paper, as being a base fallacious, and fraudulent Contrivance of a Currency, I cannot avoid thinking that this is the most salutary Method.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. The honest and honourable Way of paying a Bill, is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Face of the Bill, that is, all Bills with us of 6 <hi>s.</hi> in the Face of the Bills, should be paid in a Piece of Eight; whereas by the Act 1748, a Piece of Eight shall be received in Payments for 11 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> New Tenor; thus these Bills in their own pernicious Nature, from <hi>Anno</hi> 1742 to 1748 have suffered a Discount of about 10 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound: Mr. <hi>S—l—y</hi> in a Speech or Message in Relation to the first Emission of these New Tenor Bills insinuates, that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived Bills which could not depreciate: But notwithstanding, these Bills have greatly depreciated in passing through several Hands, and as it is impossible to adjust the Proportion of Depreciation in each of these Heads, it is <hi>unreasonable</hi> that the <hi>last Possessor</hi> should have the Allowance of the successive Depreciations: Therefore the Assembly in Equity have allowed the Possessor only the current Value, but here the Assembly seem to allow themselves to be Bankrupts at the Rate of 10 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound, from 1742 to 1748. Perhaps if a Piece of Eight had been in the new Projection enacted equal to 12 <hi>s.</hi> New Tenor, which is 48 <hi>s.</hi> Old Tenor, the general Price amongst Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; it would have been no Injustice to the Possessors, it would have prevented their being hoarded up, and the Reimburse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Money would have paid off about 6 <hi>per Cent</hi> more of our Debts, that is, cancelled so much more of our <hi>iniquitous Currency.</hi> N. B. Perhaps, the stating of a Piece of Eight (seven Eights of an Ounce of Silver) at 6 <hi>s.</hi> Currency, and one Ounce of Silver at 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> is out of Proportion: the true Proportion is 6 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> two 7ths.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. In Place of sending over the Reimbursement in foreign Silver-Coin, if the Provincial Treasurer were empowered from Home and here, to draw partial Bills for the same upon the <hi>British</hi> Treasury, or where else it may be lodged; this would save Commissions, Insurance, Freight, and small Charges, to the Value of about 12,000 £. Sterl. upon the 183,000 £. Reimbursement, sufficient to discharge 120,000£. Old Tenor, of our Debts. I shall not say that private pecuniary Views, but not Oeconomy are in the Case.</p>
                              <p>Upon the Supposition of this Reimbursement Money being remitted by Bills of Exchange, consulting the best Advantage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; perhaps by appropriating one half of the Reimbursement for that End, 910,000 £. O. T. of our Debt or Bills would in the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious Manner be instantly sunk; all Merchants, Shop-keepers, and others would gladly purchase with our Paper such good and punctual Bills preferable to any other private Bills of Exchange: The other half of the Reimbursement to be by the like Bills of Exchange pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased here by Silver to introduce a Silver Currency, the <hi>only proper commercial Medium</hi>; providentially in Favour of this Purpose, we have lately had imported a Capture from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of 54 Chests of Silver, which the Owners would gladly have exchanged for such Bills; all Merchants and others in <hi>New-England</hi> and the adjacent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces who send Pieces of Eight Home as Returns, or to purchase fresh Goods, would be fond of bringing their Silver to purchase such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ood Bills free from all the Charges of other Remittances: Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                                 </gap> a Silver Currency commencing, of 910,000 £. Old Tenor Value, we shall have a remaining Paper-Currency of 1,495,000 to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled gradually by Rites and other Taxes, suppose in 10 Years, is about 150,000 £. Old Tenor, or 37,500 £. New Tenor <hi>per Annum</hi>; thus the two Years 1748 and 1749, perhaps oppressively loaded, will be much eased, and the infatuated Paper-Currency Men made easy by sinking of it gradually; with the Proviso of an Act of Parliament prohibiting, <hi>for ever</hi> hereafter, any more publick Bills of Credit to be emitted.</p>
                              <p>This remaining 1,495,000 £. Paper Currency, abstracting from the 910,000 £. Silver, Part of the Reimbursement, is more than a sufficient Medium for Trade and Business, in a quick Circulation, in the Province of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay.</hi> Let us recollect, that in the latter Part of Governor <hi>Belcher</hi>'s Administration 1741, immediately preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Governor <hi>Shirley</hi>'s Accession, this Province in its full Vigour and Extent of Trade, seemed to be sufficiently supplied, by a Sum not exceeding 160,000 £. a Fund for Taxes not assessed, for Taxes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed but not collected, and for Arrears of Loans; let us suppose a like Sum of 160,000 £. from the neighbouring Governments, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Credit of Circulation with us (the four Colonies of <hi>New-England</hi> hitherto as to Currencies have been as one Province) makes 320,000 £.; at that Time Silver was at 29 <hi>s.</hi> per Ounce, at this Time 1748 it is 58 <hi>s.</hi> per Ounce; therefore upon this Foundation we must suppose 640,000 £. Old Tenor Value, the Medium sufficient or requisite for our Trade and Business, whereas we have allowed 1,495,000 £. Old Tenor Value, being more than double that Sum, to remain for a Paper Currency.</p>
                              <p>A Stranger may think it unaccountable that in the Beginning of Governor <hi>Shirley</hi>'s Administration, <hi>Anno</hi> 1741, the projected speedy cancelling of about 130,000 Old Tenor Bills by the Taxes for 1741 should be judged too oppressive for one Year, and was therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongst three subsequent Years; whereas the 103,000 £. New Tenor, or 412,000 Old Tenor, Taxes of 1748 (although, we have the Reimbursement Money, to alleviate this grievous Weight) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the End of his Administration, is not lightned.</p>

By Charter all vacant or not claimed Lands were vested in the collective Body of the People or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; and their Representatives in General Court as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, with Consent of the Governor and Council; make Grants of these Provincial Lands, to a Number of private Persons, to be incorporated, upon certain Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, into Townships; there are also some peculiar Grants, which after some Years are by Acts of Assembly annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to some neighbouring Township.</p>
                        <p>If in granting of these Lands, they had been subjected to an easy Quit-rent to the Province; these Lands would have settled compactly, and improved sooner; whereas at present, some Proprietors of large Tracts of Lands do not settle or sell, because being at no Charge of Quit-Rent, and not in the Valuation of <hi>Rates</hi> or <hi>Taxes</hi> for the Provincial Charge of Government; they chuse to let them lie unimproved many Years, for a Market. That this might have been practicable, appears by Lands in the Township of <hi>Hopkinton</hi> subjected to an annual Quit-rent for the Benefit of our Provincial Seminary called <hi>Harvard-College</hi>; which notwithstanding of Quit-rent is well settled and improved; the Rev. Mr. Commissary <hi>Price</hi> is their present Missionary Minister, and is a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Proprietor there under Quit-rent.</p>
                        <p>The Townships are generally granted in Value of six Miles square (some old Grants of Townships are much larger) to be divided into Sixty-three equal Lots, viz. One Lot for the first settled Minister as Inheritance, one Lot for the Ministry as Glebe-Lands, one Lot for the Benefit of a School; the other sixty Lots, to sixty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

have not given up this Point, but the Person ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Governor and Council is the acting Officer.</p>
                        <p>Because all Acts of Assembly are required to be sent Home for Allowance or Disallowance, therefore some Transactions <hi>formerly</hi> have passed by Way of <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Resolve</hi> only.</p>

                        <p>Every Session there is a Committee appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a List of the Travel (20 Miles Travel is the same with one Day's Attendance) and Attendance of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House for the Sessions— Their Wages are paid out of the general Provincial Supply or Bills of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Credit emitted for the ordinary and extraordinary Charges of the Province for the Year; the Bills of this Article are drawn in again not by a general Provincial Rate or Tax, but by a peculiar Rate imposed upon the several Towns who send Representatives.</p>
                        <p>The Townships that have Precepts sent to them, but make no Returns, are liable to be fined at the Discretion of the House; but are generally excused, and perhaps out of 50 Delinquents (some are excused by Law, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Number of eighty Families) very few are fined; this Article though very small, is one of the Articles for calling in the publick Bills of Credit from Year to Year.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps an Assembly Grant, as is the present Practice, in the Beginning of every Year's Administration of a Governor for his Services to be done during the next sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Year, may be thus qualified; to be paid after 12 Months, if the present Governor's Life or Administration continue so long, otherwise in Proportion to the Time of Service: We have a remarkable Instance of this in the worthy Governor <hi>Burnet</hi>; some short Time before his Death, there was a Vote of 6000 £. for the last Year and current Year's Service, which for Want of Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence did not take Place; soon after the Commencement

of the then current Year, Governor <hi>Burnet</hi> died, and his Heirs received only 3000 £. Old Tenor, for all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, being for about 13 Months, thus the Province honestly saved about 3000 £.</p>

                        <p>By Act of Assembly, occasionally, but not statedly, the Times of the sitting of these several Courts are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.

                        <p>The Juries never were appointed by the Sheriffs of the Counties, every Township of the County at a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly called Town-Meeting, elected their Quota for the County; but as some evil, designing Men, upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Occasions, officiously attended these Township-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,

in Order to obtain a packt or partial Jury; lately the Jurors are by Lot, being partly by Chance, partly by Rotation. N. B. The Privilege of Juries, seems to give the People a Negative, even in the executive Part of the civil Government.</p>
                        <p>In each County the Governor and Council appoint one High Sheriff with a Power of deputizing, and any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Coroners.</p>
                        <p>The Judges of the several Courts, appoint the Clerks of their several Courts, but generally conform to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation from the Governor. N. B. Judges should be independent of, and in no Respect under the Direction of a King or of his Governor.</p>
                        <p>The other Civil Courts, some are appointed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Charter; a Court for Probate of Wills, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Administrations, which is vested in the Governor and Council; they appoint a Substitute called the Judge of Probate, with a Register or Clerk in each County, from which there lies an Appeal to the Ordinary, the Governor and Council. 2. In Time of War, a Court-Martial by Commission from the Governor with Consent of the Council, to exercise the Law-Martial upon any Inhabitants of the Province.— Some are by Commission from the Court and Boards in <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; 1. A Court of Vice-Admiralty, see P. 483. 2. A Justiciary Court of Admiralty for Trial of Pirates, &amp;c. see P. 484. All these have occasionally been formerly mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Generally in all our Colonies, particularly in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> People are much addicted to Quirks in the Law; a very ordinary Country Man in <hi>New-England</hi> is almost qualified for a Country-Attorney in <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>In Gratitude, we ought not to forget the compassion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Goodness of the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the Parent of all our Colonies. The Expences of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> in taking, repairing and

securing of <hi>Louisbourg</hi> on <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> till <hi>May</hi> 1746, when his Majesty's regular Troops arrived there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, amounted to 261,700 £. New Tenor Paper <hi>New-England</hi> Currency, which according to the Exchange of that Time, amounted to 183,649 £. Sterl.; but when the Accounts were sent Home, our Currency was so much depreciated, that the 261,700 £. New Tenor, was in Value equal only to 104,680 £. Sterl.; making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of 78,969 £. Sterl. This produced a Question at Court and in Parliament; whether the said Province, ought to be paid a Sterling Sum, equal in Value, to the Sum in Bills of Credit, expended upon the Expedition, according to the Value of these Bills at the Time the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence was contracted, or only a Sterling Sum, equal to the Value of these Bills in their present depreciated State? In Goodness they determined according to the favourable Side of the Question, and allowed us the full Sum of 183,649 £. Sterl.</p>
