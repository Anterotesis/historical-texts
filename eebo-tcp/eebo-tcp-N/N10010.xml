            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>FROM a consciousness of inability, MY FRIENDS AND FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, I have repeatedly declined the duties of this ANNIVERSARY. Nothing but a firm at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the tottering <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Periculosae plenum opus aleae Tractas, incedis per ignes Suppositos cineri doloso.</note> added to the irresistable importunity of some valued friends; could have induced me (especially with a very short notice) so far to mistake my abilities, as to render the utmost Extent of your candor truly indispensable.</p>
            <p>WHEN man was unconnected by social obligations; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent to every idea of dependence; actuated by a savage ferocity of mind, displayed in the brutality of his manners; the necessary exigencies of each individual naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him, to acts of treachery, violence and murder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012721_0005_0F8BC2A1C173FA90"/>THE miseries of mankind thus proclaiming eternal war with their species, led them probably to consult certain measures to arrest the current of such outrageous enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>A SENSE of their wants and weakness in a state of nature, doubtless inclined them to such reciprocal aids and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as eventually established society.</p>
            <p>MEN then began to incorporate; subordination succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to independence; order to anarchy; and passions were disarmed by civilization: Society lent its aid to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the weak from oppression, who wisely took shelter within the sanctuary of law.</p>
            <p>ENCREASING society afterwards exacted, that the tacit contract made with her by each individual at the time of his being incorporated, should receive a more solemn form to become authentic and irrefragable; the main object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to add force to the laws, proportionate to the power, and extent of the body corporate, whose energy they were to direct.</p>
            <p>THEN <hi>society</hi> availed herself of the sacrifice of that <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and that <hi>natural equality</hi> of which we are all consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012721_0006_0F8BC2A407308BB0"/>
superiors and magistrates were appointed, and mankind submitted to a civil and political subordination. This is truly a glorious inspiration of reason, by whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, notwithstanding the inclination we have for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, we accept controul, for the establishment of order.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH, unrestrained power in one person may have been the first and most natural recourse of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from rapine and disorder; yet all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> apparent improvements upon what began in unlimited power.</p>
            <p>IT would shock humanity, should I attempt to describe those barbarous and tragic scenes, which crimson the his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric page of this wretched and detestable constitution, where absolute dominion is lodged in one person: Where <hi>one</hi> makes the <hi>whole,</hi> and the <hi>whole</hi> is <hi>nothing.</hi> What motives, what events, could have been able to subdue men, endowed with reason, to render themselves the mute instruments and passive objects of the caprice of an individual!</p>
            <p>MANKIND apprized of their privileges, in being rational and free; in prescribing civil laws to themselves, had sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no intention of being enchained by any of their equals:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012721_0007_0F8BC2A4B9F5BCF0"/>
and although they submitted voluntary adherents to certain laws for the sake of mutual security and happiness; they no doubt intended by the original compact, a permanent exemption of the subject body, from any claims, which were not expressly surrendered, for the purpose of obtaining the security and defence of the whole: Can it possibly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they would voluntarily be enslaved, by a power of their own creation?</p>
            <p>THE constitution of a <hi>magistrate,</hi> does not therefore take away that lawful defence against force and injury, allowed by the law of nature; we are not to obey a Prince, ruling above the limits of the power entrusted to him; for the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> by constituting a head does not deprive itself of the power of its own preservation. <note n="*" place="bottom">The celebrated Mrs. Maccauley.</note> 
               <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>Magistracy</hi> whether supreme or subordinate is a mere <hi>human ordinance,</hi> and the laws of every nation are the measure of magistratical power: And Kings, the servants of the state, when they degenerate into tyrants, forfeit their right to government.</p>

            <p>"IF the King (says Grotius) hath one part of the supreme power, and the other part is in the senate or people, when such a King shall invade that part which doth not belong to him, it shall be lawful to oppose a just force to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his power doth not extend so far."</p>
            <p>THE question in short turns upon this single point, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the power of the civil magistrate: Is it the end of that office, that one particular person may do what he will without restraint? or rather that society should be made happy and secure? the answer is very obvious — And it is my firm opinion that the <hi>equal Iustice</hi> of GOD, and <hi>natural freedom of mankind</hi> must stand or fall together.</p>
            <p>WHEN rulers become tyrants, they cease to be Kings; they can no longer be respected as GOD's <hi>vicegerents,</hi> who violate the laws they were sworn to protect: The <hi>preacher</hi> may tell us of <hi>passive obedience,</hi> that tyrants are scourges in the hands of a righteous GOD to chastise a sinful nation, and are to be submitted to like plagues, famine and such like

            <p>WITHOUT this, the distinctions among mankind, are but different degrees of misery; for as the true estimate of a man's life consists in conducting it according to his own just sentiments and innocent inclinations, his being is degraded below that of a free agent, which heaven has made him, when his affections and passions are no longer governed by the dictates of his own mind, and the interests of human society, but by the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, unrestrained will of another.</p>
            <p>I THANK GOD we live in an age of rational inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, when the unfettered mind dares to expatiate freely on every object worthy its attention, when the privileges of mankind are thoroughly comprehended, and the rights of distinct societies are objects of liberal enquiry.

               <hi>JUNIUS</hi> well observes; when the constitution is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaded, when the first original right of the people from which all laws derive their authority is directly attacked; inferior grievances naturally lose their force, and are suffered to pass by without punishment or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
