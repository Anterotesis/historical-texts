            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF VITALITY.</head>
            <p>WERE the European Philoſopher to turn his eyes on this new Empire, to ſee in what order and degree thoſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and arts, which characterize poliſhed humanity, ariſe among us, he would undoubtedly perceive that the extenſion of benevolence has kept exact pace with the diffuſion of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Our venerable anceſtors early ſowed the ſeeds of ſcience in this land, and watched their growth with pious care; and it is not difficult to diſcover the diffuſive ſpirit of benevolence following every where the encreaſing light of ſcience.</p>
            <p>Without being particular on this head, one inſtance of it honourable to humanity, is the cordial adoption, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſupport given to this <hi>Humane Society,</hi> which is formed on a very extenſive ſcale of benevolence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:023038_0006_0FBC1BF5E459AA00"/>
I decline giving a hiſtory of this or ſimilar inſtitutions; nor ſhall I deſcant on the beneficial influence of thoſe numerous humane aſſociations, which mark and dignify the age in which we live. Suffice it to ſay, that the ſucceſs attending the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties eſtabliſhed for reſtoring drowned perſons at <hi>Amſterdam, Hamburgh, London, Padua, Vienna, Paris</hi> and elſewhere, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome reſpectable characters to form one in Boſton. But they have gone beyond the European Societies, and have extended their plan not only to the reſtoration of life, when apparently loſt, but to the preſervation of it when in imminent danger.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarcely neceſſary to ſay that the plan of this Society is totally void of all private intereſted views. None of its members receive any other recompence than the ſublime joy of doing good.</p>
            <p>I ſhall avoid ſpeaking of any particular mode of treating perſons apparently dead, and ſhall confine myſelf to the great principle of VITALITY, ANIMATION, or LIFE. I feel the difficulty of doing juſtice to ſo copious a ſubject in the ſhort ſpace allotted to a diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of animation is not merely curious, but leads to uſefulneſs. It has arreſted the attention of Philoſophers in almoſt every age of the world. Some of the antients reaſoned thus on it, matter of itſelf cannot move, yet it is evident all
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:023038_0007_0FBC1BF7610F0B10"/>
things change, and that nothing is truly loſt; that the ſum total of matter in the Univerſe remains perfectly the ſame; and as it was the work of OMNIPOTENCE to create ſomething out of nothing, the ſame Omnipotence is required to reduce any thing back to nothing.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Bacon's account of antient opinions.</note> It is apparent that there is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal change, or mutation of all things into all, then muſt there be ſome <hi>one primary matter,</hi> common to all things out of which they were made—They went ſtill further, and enquired into the <hi>moving principle,</hi> the <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>that cauſe,</hi> which aſſociates the elements of natural ſubſtances, and which employs them when aſſociated, according to their various and peculiar characters<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Harris philoſ. arrang.</note> This moving principle they called the <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THALES, one of the ſeven wiſe men of Greece, maintained, that <hi>Water</hi> was the ſubtile principle that moved all things. He concluded ſo, from obſerving that matter was chiefly dealt out in moiſture; that the ſeeds of plants ſo long as they are in a growing ſtate, are moiſt; and that a vegetable will grow to a conſiderable ſize from water alone; that the Earth is refreſhed, recruited and made fruitful by water:—that the Air itſelf is but an expanſion, or expiration of water. He reminds us of the immenſe quantities in the ſubterraneous regions, whence fountains, and rivers, like ſo many veins in the body, convey water over the ſurface, and through the bowels of our Globe, to vivify and ſuſtain the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:023038_0008_0FBC1BF8FAEB1588"/>
HERACLITUS maintained a very different doctrine. He taught that <hi>Fire</hi> was the vivifying principle of all things. He allowed the truth of <hi>Thales'</hi> doctrine, but obſerved that <hi>fire</hi> had ſuch an univerſal ſway in nature, that water itſelf was not without a mixture of it; for that water grows hard and congeals into Ice when fire leaves it, and is only reſtored to its fluidity by entering it again. He remarked that the whole maſs of waters in the ſea, was actually an ocean of fire, ſeeing there were not two diſtinct drops of water, which do not owe their fluidity to ſome portion of fire encloſed within them. So deeply rooted was the doctrine that fire was the firſt or animating principle, that there were, and ſtill are whole nations who worſhip it as a Deity.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>That venerable ſect of Philoſophers, the <hi>Stoics,</hi> taught that there was one infinite eternal, almighty mind, which being diffuſed through the whole univerſe of well ordered and regularly diſpoſed matter, actuates every part of it, and is as it were the ſoul of this <hi>vaſt body.</hi> The parts of this body they ſay, are of two ſorts, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>Celeſtial,</hi> as the Planets and fixed ſtars: and the <hi>Terreſtrial.</hi> as the Earth, and all the other elements about it. The celeſtial continue without change, or variation. But the whole ſublunary world, is not only liable to diſſolution, but often hath been, and ſhall again be diſſolved by <hi>fire</hi> and that the reciprocal deaths, diſſolutions and digeſtions, which ſupport by turns all the ſubſtances which we ſee, are the effects of <hi>fire.</hi>
                  </p>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>ANAXIMENES contradicted both theſe philoſophers; and contended that <hi>Air</hi> was the vivifying principle and firſt mover of all things. He obſerved that although the water of <hi>Thales</hi> could not ſubſiſt without the fire of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> yet fire itſelf could not exiſt without <hi>Air,</hi> which was the very ſpirit of flame and the breath of life. That no ſeed of vegetables, eggs
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023038_0009_0FBC1BFBA9D59C28"/>
of animals, be they ever ſo ripe, or pregnant, and cheriſhed with ever ſo kindly a warmth, will ever bring forth the embryos contained in them, if they be totally deprived of air. We ſhall ſee hereafter the neceſſity of attending to theſe powerful agents, <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>air,</hi> in the reſuſcitation of thoſe apparently dead by ſuſpenſion, ſubmerſion, or froſt.</p>
            <p>Let us now examine the ſubject of animation with the light afforded us by more modern Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>From them we learn that matter is inert, that any one particle of matter left to itſelf will continue always in the ſame ſtate, with regard to its motion or reſt. There are, however, certain powers. which <hi>two</hi> particles of matter have of acting on one another, as in gravitation and coheſion. We learn alſo that there is an attraction of <hi>chryſtallization,</hi> by which bodies when fluid become in time ſolid, and aſſume a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar figure; that there is an attraction of <hi>magnetiſm,</hi> by which a piece of iron in certain circumſtances, attracts another piece of iron: that there is an attraction of <hi>electricity,</hi> by which a ſubſtance charged with more electric matter flies to another charged with leſs. There is, moreover, <hi>chemical attraction,</hi> by which two particles of different bodies ruſh together, and form one. If we add that moſt of theſe have their oppoſite repulſions, we can ſay that they are all the known properties of mere matter; and there is nothing in them that can merit the name of <hi>vitality</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:023038_0010_0FBBA0FC0B52F8B8"/>
But there is in a growing vegetable a power beyond all this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a power which firſt moves, and then conducts that latent proceſs by which a ſeed becomes a plant.</p>
            <p>Now, every body capable of growing, has a certain internal adjuſtment, diſpoſition, or arrangement of its matter, which is called <hi>organization;</hi> and being capable of encreaſing in bulk has a certain degree of <hi>vitality.</hi> There is a ſcale of life, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in uniform gradation from human excellence downwards, till it diſappears in a ſhade of ambiguity, in the living ſtate of vegetables.<note n="†" place="bottom">Brown.</note> Life, ſays the <hi>Biſhop of Landaff,</hi> belongs alike to both the animal and vegetable kingdom, and ſeems to depend on the ſame principle in both. Stop the motion of a fluid in an animal limb, by a ſtrong ligature, the limb mortifies beyond the ligature and drops off; a branch of a tree, under like circumſtances, grows dry and rots away.—Both animals and vegetables are ſubject to be froſt-bitten and to conſequent mortifications; both languiſh in exceſſive heats; both experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence extravaſation of juices from repletion, and pinings from inanition; both can ſuffer amputation of limbs without being deprived of life, and in a ſimilar manner both form a callus; both are liable to contract diſeaſe by infection; both are ſtrengthened by air and motion.</p>
            <p>Every ſeed of a plant is an organized body endowed with veſſels, and contains under ſeveral membranes the plant in miniature.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Look at the engravings in <hi>Grew's anatomy of plants.</hi>
               </note> If this ſeed be put into the <hi>moiſt</hi> earth, and a

            <p>In like manner an Egg is an organized body, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains under ſeveral envelopements the chicken in miniature, and may be conſidered as a womb, detached from the body of the parent animal, in which the embryo is juſt beginning to be formed; if warmed to a certain degree, whether by the parent animal, or by art, the fluids which ſurround that ſpeck in the egg called the <hi>punctum vitae,</hi> expand, and the little veſſels ſwell and extend themſelves; and the motion, or oſcillation once began, it develops, by degrees, until it becomes a perfect animal, capable of all the functions common to its kind.</p>

            <p>From an attentive obſervation of animated nature, we diſcover that life is cauſed, and continued by ſomething which acts from without; and this ſomething is (as far as we can diſcover) <hi>heat,</hi> acting on the ſeed or egg.

                     <hi>Anatomical Deſcription of a Hen's-egg; with the hiſtory of the growth of the animal contained in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IMmediately under the ſhell, lies that common membrane, or ſkin, which lines it on the inſide, adhering cloſely to it every where, except at the broad end, where a little cavity is left, that is <hi>filled with air;</hi> which encreaſes as the animal within grows larger. Under this membrane are contained <hi>two whites,</hi> tho' ſeeming to us to be only <hi>one:</hi> each wrapped up in a membrane of it's own, one white within the other. In the midſt of all is the <hi>yolk,</hi> wrapt round likewiſe with it's own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At each end of this are two ligaments, called <hi>chalazae,</hi> which are white denſe ſubſtances, made from the membranes, and ſerving to keep the white and the yolk in their places.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>cicatricula</hi> is the part where the animal firſt begins to ſhew ſigns of life; it reſembles a vetch or ſmall pea, lying on one ſide of the yolk and within its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes. The outer membranes and ligaments preſerve the fluids in their proper places, the white ſerves as nouriſhment; and the yolk with its membranes, after a time, becomes a part of the chicken's body. This is the deſcription of the <hi>hen's egg,</hi> and anſwers to all others, how large or how ſmall ſoever.</p>
                  <p>Previouſly to putting the eggs to the hen, <hi>Malpighi</hi> and <hi>Haller</hi> firſt examined this cicatricula, which they conſider as the moſt important part of the egg. This (which ſome call the <hi>punctum ſaliens,</hi> or <hi>punctum vitae,</hi>) was found in thoſe that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the male to be large, but in others ſmall. Upon examination with the microſcope it was found to be a kind of bag, containing a tranſparent liquor, in the midſt of which the <hi>embryo</hi> was ſeen. The embryo reſembled a compoſition of little threads, which the warmth of future incubation tended to enlarge.</p>
                  <p>Upon placing the egg in a proper warmth, after ſix hours the <hi>vital ſpeck</hi> begins to dilate like the pupil of he eye. The head of the chicken is diſtinctly ſeen, with the back-bone ſomething reſembling a tadpole floating in its ambient fluid, but as yet ſeeming to aſſume none of the functions of animal life. About ſix hours more the little animal is ſeen more diſtinctly; the head becomes more plainly viſible, and the vertebrae of the back more eaſily perceivable. All theſe ſigns of preparation for life are encreaſed in ſix hours more; and, at the end of 24, the ribs begin to take their places, the neck begins to lengthen, and the head to turn to one ſide.</p>
                  <p>At this time, the fluids in the egg ſeem to have changed place; the yolk which was before in the center of the ſhell, approaches nearer the broad end. The watery part of the white is diminiſhed the groſſer part ſinks to the ſmall end; and the little animal appears to turn towards the part of the broad end in which a cavity has been deſcribed, and with its yolk ſeems to adhere to the membrane there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the end of 40 hours the great work of life ſeems fairly begun, and the animal plainly appears to move; the back bone thickens; the firſt rudiments of the eyes begin to appear; the eart beats, and the blood begins already to circulate. The parts, however, as yet are fluid; but, by degrees, become more and more tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. At the end of two days, the liquor in which the chicken ſwims. ſeems to encreaſe; the head appears with two little bladders in place of eyes; the heart beats in the manner of every embryo where the blood does not circulate through the lungs. In about 14 hours after this, the chicken is grown more ſtrong; the veins and the arteries begin to branch, in order to form the brain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſpinal marrow is ſeen ſtretching along the back-bone. In three days, the whole body of the chicken appears bent; the head with it's two eye-balls, with their different humours, now diſtinctly appear; and five other veſicles are ſeen, which ſoon unite to form the rudiments of the brain. The out-lines alſo of the thighs, and wings, begin to be ſeen, and the body begins to gather fleſh. At the end of the fourth day, the veſicles that go to form the brain approach each other the wings and things appear more ſolid; the whole body is covered with a jelly like fleſh; the heart, that was hitherto expoſed is now covered up within the body, by a very thin tranſparent membrane; and at the ſame time the umbilical veſſels, that unite the animal to the yolk, now appear to come forth from the abdomen. After the 5th and 6th days the veſſels of the brain begin to be covered over; the wings and thighs lengthen; the belly is cloſed up, and turned; the liver is ſeen within it, very diſtinctly, not yet grown red, but of a duſky white: both the ventricles of the heart are diſcerned, as if they were two ſeparate hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beating diſtinctly; the whole body of the animal is covered over, and the traces of the incipient feathers are already to be ſeen. The 7th day, the head appears very large; the brain is covered entirely over the bill begins to appear betwixt the eyes, and the wings, the thighs, and the legs, have acquired their perfect figure. Hitherto, however, the animal appears as if it had two bodies; the yolk is joined to it by the umbilical veſſels that come from the belly and is furniſhed with its veſſels, through which the blood circulates, as through the reſt of the body of the chicken, making a bulk greater than that of the animal itſelf. But towards the end of incubation, the umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical veſſels ſhorten the yolk, and with it the inteſtines are thruſt up into the body of the chicken by the action of the muſcles of the belly, and the two bodies are thus formed into one During this ſtate, all the organs are found to perform their ſecretions; the bile is found to be ſeperated, as in grown animals; but it is tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and without bitterneſs; the chicken then alſo appears to have lungs. On the 10th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the muſcles of the wings appear, and the feathers begin to puſh out. On the 11th, the heart which hitherto had appeared divided, begins to unite, the arteries which belong to it, join into it, like the fingers into the palm of the hand. All theſe appearances, come more into view, becauſe the fluids the veſſels had hitherto' ſecreted, were more tranſparent; but as the colour of the fluids deepen, their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and circulations are more diſtinctly ſeen. As the animal thus, by the 11th day, completely formed, begins to gather ſtrength, it becomes more uneaſy in its ſituation, and exerts its animal powers with encreaſing force. For ſome time before it is able to break the ſhell in which it is impriſoned, it is heard to <hi>chirrup,</hi> receiving a <hi>ſufficient quantity of air for this purpoſe,</hi> from that cavity which lies between the membrane and the ſhell, and which muſt contain air to reſiſt the external preſſure. At length upon the 20th day, in ſome birds ſooner, and later in others, the encloſed animal breaks the ſhell within which it has been confined, with its beak; and by repeated efforts, at laſt procures its enlargement.</p>
                  <p>From this hiſtory we perceive that thoſe parts which are moſt conducive to life, are the firſt that are begun: the head and the back bone, which no doubt encloſe the brain, and the ſpinal marrow, though both are too limpid to be diſcerned, are the firſt that are ſeen to exiſt; the beating of the heart is ſeen ſoon after; the leſs noble parts ſeem to ſpring from theſe, the wings, the thighs, the feet, and laſtly the bill. The reſemblance between the beginning animal in the egg, and the embryo in the womb, is very ſtriking—An egg may be conſidered as a womb, detached from the body of the parent animal, in which the embryo is but juſt beginning to be formed. It may be regarded as a kind of incomplete delivery. The ſimilitude between the egg and the embryo in the womb has induced many to aſſert (and with great probability) that all animals are produced from eggs.</p>

Now, a living animal has, beſides thoſe attributes common to all bodies, as ſolidity, extention and gravity, a <hi>peculiar ſomething,</hi> which diſtinguiſhes it from a dead one; for a muſcular fibre will contract, and that not by the power of gravitation, coheſion, chryſtallization, magnetiſm, or che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical attraction.</p>

Within every one of us, there is an <hi>innate</hi> and <hi>active power,</hi> which ceaſes not its work, when ſenſe and appetite are aſleep; which without any conſcious co-operation of the man himſelf, carries him from a ſeed, or embryo, to his deſtined magnitude. This is ſtrictly ſpeaking the <hi>Animal OEconomy,</hi> and is as perfect in the brutal Hottentot, as in the brighteſt genius of human kind.</p>
            <p>All this depends on a principle which ſome call the <hi>Vis Actuoſa,</hi> others the <hi>Impetum Faciens.</hi> This power is <hi>innate,</hi> and is that by which man lives; it forms him, it nouriſhes him, refreſhes him, moves him, animates him. By it he feels, he deſires, refuſes, ſleeps and wakes; nevertheleſs, it is totally different from the <hi>Mind:</hi> For,</p>
            <p>In our bodies is found ſomething of quite a different nature from what has been mentioned; a power of thinking, reflecting, comparing, chuſing, and repreſenting to itſelf paſt, preſent, and to come. This power, in relation to its ſeveral operations, is termed comprehenſion, underſtanding, reaſon, mind, will, freedom, or collectively, by the ſingle word SOUL.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Herpert.</note> But to return to the innate principle of animation in man.</p>
            <p>Every body knows that although the child is formed, and lives, and grows, and moves in the womb of its mother, it never breathes there. It receives its animating principle, its
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023038_0017_0FBBA10C15BF71A0"/>
heat, motion and life from the mother, by a nerve and artery, which enters at its navel and conveys the blood to the heart of the infant, <hi>without ever paſſing through the lungs.</hi> The blood in this caſe goes directly on through the body of the heart, by an opening called the <hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Aorta,</hi> or great Artery, by which it is driven to every part of its body; ſo that the circulation, nutrition and life, are kept up with the mother, as if they were not two bodies but one. It is remarkable that the fruit of vegetables is, in like manner, nouriſhed, and ſupported by a ſlender ſtalk iſſuing from the parent ſtock.</p>
            <p>When the child is born it becomes dependent on a <hi>new</hi> principle for the continuance of its exiſtence. When it paſſes from its watery habitation into the atmoſphere, a new determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation takes place; and inſtead of the <hi>umbilical cord</hi> from the mother, the common air becomes the <hi>main-ſpring</hi> of all its actions and functions. When the child opens it's mouth to cry, down ruſhes the air and expands the lungs. The blood, which had hitherto paſſed <hi>through</hi> the heart, now takes a wider circuit, and the <hi>foramen ovale</hi> cloſes forever. The lungs which had till this time been inactive, now firſt begin their functions, and they ceaſe not their motion as long as life continues.</p>
            <p>Hence then, it appears, that next to the expanding power of heat, <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> or <hi>breathing</hi> is the <hi>primum mobile</hi> in the human machine.</p>
            <p>

Atmoſpheric-air contains a certain <hi>vivifying ſpirit,</hi> which is neceſſary to continue the lives of animals, and this, in a gallon of air, is ſaid to be ſufficient for one man during the ſpace of a minute, and not much longer. Air that has loſt this vivifying ſpirit, deadens fire, extinguiſhes flame, and deſtroys life.<note n="†" place="bottom">Furguſon.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known that there is a ſet of veſſels in the lungs, which contain air, and another which contain blood.</p>
            <p>The air in the lungs is in conſtant motion, for either that which is at preſent contained in the cells, is paſſing through the wind-pipe into the atmoſphere, or a freſh parcel is paſſing from the external atmoſphere through the wind-pipe into thoſe cells. The whole of this compound motion is called <hi>Reſpiration.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If the air continue at reſt in the lungs for many minutes, or if a man continue to reſpire the ſame air, or if the breathes air that hath ſerved for the inflammation of fuel, or pure fixable air, or any other vapour, excepting reſpirable air, he dies<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fordyce.</note>

            <p>From the organs of reſpiration, or rather from what may be called the <hi>ſyſtema ſpirituale pneumonicum,</hi> all the actions of the body, and all the power which it exerts are ultimately derived.</p>

It appears from a train of experiments, that the common air communicates a vivifying ſomething to the blood, when drawn into the lungs, and gives to it a ſtimulating quality, by which it is fitted to excite the heart to action; and that the chemical quality, which the blood acquires in paſſing through the lungs, is neceſſary to keep up the action of the heart, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the health of the animal. For no ſooner are the lungs quieſcent than the heart ceaſes to contract, the blood ſtops, all the intellectual operations ceaſe, ſenſation and voluntary motion are ſuſpended, and all external ſigns of life diſappear. All which are admirably explained by Dr. <hi>Edmund Goodwin.</hi>

What (ſays <hi>Voltaire,</hi> is that unknown <hi>fluid,</hi> which is quicker and more active than light, and flies in the twinkling of an eye, through all the channels of life; produces memory, ſorrow or joy, reaſon or frenzy, recalls with horror what one would wiſh to forget, and makes of a thinking being, an object of admiration, or a ſubject of pity and tears!</p>

The intellectual ſcheme, (ſays the author of <hi>Hermes,</hi>) which never forgets DEITY, poſtpones every thing <hi>corporeal</hi> to the PRIMARY MENTAL CAUSE. It is here it looks for the origin of intelligible ideas, even of thoſe, which exiſt in human capacities. For though <hi>ſenſible</hi> objects may be the deſtined medium, to <hi>awaken</hi> the dormant energies of man's underſtanding, yet are thoſe energies themſelves; no more contained in <hi>ſenſe,</hi> than the exploſion of a cannon in the ſpark which gave it fire.</p>
            <p>This then, like all other ſound philoſophy, leads us at laſt, up to the GREAT FIRST CAUSE, the ENS ENTIUM, the SUPREME AUTHOR OF ALL, who is ever to be adored with the moſt profound reverence by the reaſonable part of his creation.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dr. Whytte.</note>

I paſs on to a more general and pleaſant theme, <hi>the Progreſs of Humanity.</hi> Perhaps we may diſcover the cauſes which have produced that ſpirit of benevolence, which gave birth to this ſociety.</p>
            <p>It is very common to praiſe antient times and condemn our own; yet, if we caſt our eyes back on the hiſtory of mankind, the view will ſhock us. Of ſix and twenty cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,

            <p>The Roman name ſtrikes us with ſuch veneration, that we are apt to include <hi>humanity</hi> among their virtues. But the moſt celebrated virtue of the moſt renowned Roman would paſs without much eulogium in this day. The truth is, their natural roughneſs of temper, their adoration of <hi>Victoria,</hi> that Deity ſo dear to the Romans, made them neglect and trample upon their fellow men, whom they ſcarcely diſtinguiſhed from brutes. And, when the glory, greatneſs, ſtrength and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that famous people were extinguiſhed, and when their Empire was finally overturned, the cauſe of humanity was ſtill leſs regarded.</p>
            <p>It was worſe, when a northern ſwarm of Barbarians, the <hi>Goths,</hi> quitting their inhoſpitable regions, ſpread through the more fertile parts of the world, and extinguiſhed the ſmall light of learning which remained.<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Boe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And when <hi>Mahomed</hi> and his ſucceſſors carried their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, with the rapidity of a torrent over moſt parts of <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> through <hi>Perſia, Arabia, AEgypt,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> they compleated the deſtruction the Goths began.</p>
            <p>When the Barbarians embraced chriſtanity, they made it bend to their prejudices, rather than ſubject their prejudices to it's principles; and from the mixture of chriſtianity with the antient cuſtoms of barbarians ſprang a diſcord in manners. From a mixture of the rights of ſovereigns with thoſe of the nobility, and of the prieſthood, ſprang a diſcord in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics and government. And from a mixture of the Pagans and Mahometans with the Chriſtians, ſprang a diſcord in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Anarchy and confuſion were the conſequences of ſo many contraſts:—Europe was one large field of battle, and ignorance and brutal force quenched almoſt every ray of knowledge, while the noble faculties of the ſoul were abſorbed by fear.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Robertſon, Ch. v. and Millot Element. of gen.

            <p>The extenſion of benevolence, keeps exact pace with the extenſion of knowledge, and the exertions of the one are circumſcribed by the limits of the other.</p>
            <p>Whenever the PARENT of UNIVERSAL NATURE chuſes to make a mighty change in the affairs of men, he ſeems to effect it by, what we call, mean and humble inſtruments.</p>

Two ſeemingly inglorious mechanical diſcoveries, changed the face of the world more than any conqueror, Sect or Empire ever did. I mean the <hi>Mariners Compaſs,</hi> and the <hi>Art of Printing.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See Novum Organ.</note> Theſe inventions gradually baniſhed bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm, and humanized the world. The antients were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with but a very ſmall part of the globe. They called all the northern nations, <hi>Scythians,</hi> and all the weſtern, <hi>Celtae,</hi> indiſcriminately. They had no knowledge of <hi>Africa</hi> beyond the neareſt part of <hi>AEthiopia;</hi> nor of <hi>Aſia</hi> beyond the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and as for our quarter of the world, <hi>America,</hi> they had not even a tradition about it.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Monteſq.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Commerce is a cure for the moſt deſtructive prejudices. It has every where diffuſed a knowledge of the manners of all nations.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Monteſq.</note> The multiplication of books by the <hi>are of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and of drawings and pictures by the <hi>art of engraving,</hi> produced a radiance of knowledge that made tyranny tremble, and will effectually ſecure the human race from thoſe horrid ſhocks of barbariſm and tyrranny, that once nearly laid waſte the old world. <hi>The Mariners Compaſs then opened the Univerſe,</hi> and Printing diſplayed it.</p>
            <p>At this time, ſuperſtition, and an odious eccleſiaſtical deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, received a fatal wound. Aſtronomical improvements, by diſcovering worlds beſides our own, expanded the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind. So that when the chriſtian religion began,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023038_0027_0FBBA120E56C6220"/>
again, to be taught in its purity, the Univerſe ſeemed to extend itſelf to do it homage. Then did KNOWLEDGE raiſe <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> HUMANITY from the duſt, and pointed with her blazing torch the way to happineſs and peace! Then did RELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GION, inſtead of daggers, wrecks and fetters, wear upon her graceful brow this everlaſting motto, <q>
                  <hi>My ways, are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all my paths are peace.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Need I ſay a word to prove to ſuch an audience as this, that the preſent prevailing ſpirit of benevolence is principally owing to the diffuſion of a Religion, as much above all others, as Heaven is above the Earth? Let him who doubts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the <hi>next beſt</hi> ſyſtem the world ever poſſeſſed. Did not Moſes bring famine and other plagues on the AEgyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians? Elijah deprived the earth of rain, and deſtroyed with fire thoſe who oppoſed him; as did <hi>Eliſha</hi> thoſe who mocked him. Did not David kill and curſe thoſe he hated or envied? But the <hi>Founder of the Religon of humanity</hi> came without judgment, anger, or revenge. All his tranſactions were for the benefit of man. He allayed the winds which threatned deſtruction to the mariners; he reſtored limbs to the lame, ſight to the blind, ſpeech to the dumb, clean fleſh to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, a ſound mind to the inſane, and <hi>life to the dead.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See Bacon's Eſſays.</note> All his, were works of beneficence, diffuſing charity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to men, accompanied too, with a ſpirit ſo ſublime and friendly, that the human heart, with unbidden veneration, bows down before it.</p>

While we conſider <hi>this</hi> HUMANE SOCIETY as a <hi>Stream</hi> deriving it's ſource from that inexhauſtible <hi>River of Joy,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters of Religion</hi> may be conſidered it's principal guardians.
