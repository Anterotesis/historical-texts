            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Rights of Conſcience inalienable, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THERE are <hi>four</hi> principles contended for, as the foundation of civil government, viz. Birth, property, grace, and compact. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe is practiſed upon in all hereditary monarchies; where it is believed that the ſon of a monarch is entitled to dominion, upon the deceaſe of his father, whether he be a wiſe man or a fool. The <hi>ſecond</hi> principle is built upon, in all ariſtocratical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where the rich landholders have the ſole rule of all their tenants; and make laws, at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which are binding upon all. The <hi>third</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is adopted by thoſe kingdoms and ſtates, that require a religious teſt to qualify an officer of ſtate; proſcribing all non-conformiſts from civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty. This was the error of Conſtantine's government, who firſt eſtabliſhed the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023495_0003_0FBFA250AF60E030"/>
by law, and then proſcribed the Pagans, and baniſhed the <hi>Arian hereticks.</hi> This error alſo filled the heads of the anabaptiſts in Germany (who were re-ſprinklers.) They ſuppoſed that none had right to rule but gracious men. The ſame error prevails in the See of Rome, where his Holineſs exalts himſelf above all who are called God's, (i. e. kings and rulers) and where no proteſtant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick is allowed the liberty of a citizen. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is alſo plead for in the Ottoman Empire; where it is death to call in queſtion the divinity of Mahomed, or the authenticity of the Alcoran.</p>
            <p>The ſame evil has twiſted itſelf into the Britiſh form of government; where, in the ſtate eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church of England, no man is eligible to any office, civil or military, without he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to the 39 articles and book of common prayer; and even then, upon receiving a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the army, the law obliges him to receive the ſacrament of the Lord's-ſupper: and no non-conformiſt is allowed the liberty of his conſcience, without he ſubſcribes to all the 39 articles but about four. And when that is done, his purſe-ſtrings are drawn by others, to pay preachers, in whom he puts no confidence, and whom he never hears.</p>
            <p>This was the caſe of ſeveral of the Southern States (until the revolution), in which the church of England was eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> principle (compact) is adopted in the American States, as the baſis of civil government. —This foundation appears to be a juſt one, by the following inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:023495_0004_0FBFA2526975EFF8"/>Suppoſe a man to remove to a deſolate iſland, and take a peaceable poſſeſſion of it, without injuring any; ſo that he ſhould be the honeſt inheritor of the iſle. So long as he is alone he is the abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the place; and his own will is his law; which law, is as often altered or repealed as his will changes. In proceſs of time, from this man's loins ten ſons are grown to manhood, and poſſeſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. So long as they are all good men, each one can be as abſolute, free, and ſovereign as his father: but one of the ten turns vagrant, by robbing the reſt. This villain is equal to, if not an over-match for any one of the nine: not one of them durſt engage him, in ſingle combat. Reaſon and ſafety both dictate to the nine, the neceſſity of a confed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, to unite their ſtrength together to repel or deſtroy the plundering knave. Upon entering into confederation, ſome <hi>compact</hi> or agreement would be ſtipulated, by which each would be bound to do his equal part in fatigue and expence. It would be neceſſary for theſe nine to meet at ſtated times, to conſult means of ſafety and happineſs. A ſhady tree or ſmall cabbin, would anſwer their purpoſe: and in caſe of diſagreement, 4 muſt give up to 5.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of things, their government would be perfectly democratical; every citizen being a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator.</p>
            <p>In a courſe of years, from theſe nine, there ariſes nine thouſand: their government can be no longer democratical—prudence would forbid it. Each tribe or diſtrict, muſt then chuſe their repreſentative, who (for the term that he is choſen) has the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023495_0005_0FBFA259704E5D10"/>
power of his conſtituents. Theſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, meeting in aſſembly, would have power to make laws, binding on their conſtituents; and while their time was ſpent in making laws for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, each one of the community muſt advance a little of his money as a compenſation therefor.— Should theſe repreſentatives differ in judgement, the minor muſt be ſubject to the major, as in the caſe above.</p>
            <p>From this ſimple parable, the following things are demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>1. That the law was not made for a righteous man, but for the diſobedient. 2. That righteous men have to part with a little of their liberty and property to preſerve the reſt. 3. That all power is veſted in, and conſequently derived from the people. 4. That the law ſhould rule over rulers, and not rulers over the law. 5. That government is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>compact.</hi> 6. That every law made by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators, inconſiſtent with the <hi>compact,</hi> modernly called a conſtitution, is uſurpive in the legiſlators, and not binding on the people. 7. That whenever government is found inadequate to preſerve the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and property of the people, they have an indubitable right to alter it, ſo as to anſwer thoſe purpoſes. 8. That legiſlators, in their legiſlative capacity, cannot alter the conſtitution, for they are hired ſervants of the people, to act within the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>From theſe general obſervations, I ſhall paſs on to examine a queſtion, which has been the ſtrife and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023495_0006_0FBFA25D471B0FB0"/>
contention of ages.—The queſtion is, <hi>"Are the Rights of Conſcience alienable, or inalienable?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>conſcience,</hi> ſignifies <hi>common ſcience,</hi> a court of judicature which the Almighty has erected in every human breaſt: a <hi>cenſor morum</hi> over all his conduct. Conſcience will ever judge right, when it is rightly informed; and ſpeak the truth when it underſtands it. But to advert to the queſtion, <q>Does a man, upon entering into ſocial compact, ſurrender his conſcience to that ſociety, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled by the laws thereof; or can he, in juſtice, aſſiſt in making laws to bind his children's conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences before they are born?</q> I judge not, for the following reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every man muſt give an account of himſelf to God, and therefore every man ought to be at liberty to ſerve God in that way that he can beſt reconcile it to his conſcience. If Government, can anſwer for Individuals at the day of judgement, let men be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled by it, in religious matters; otherwiſe, let men be free.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It would be ſinful for a man to ſurrender that to man, which is to be kept ſacred for God. A man's mind ſhould be always open to conviction; and an honeſt man will receive that doctrine which appears the beſt demonſtrated: and what is more common than for the beſt of men to change their minds? Such are the prejudices of the mind, and ſuch the force of tradition, that a man who never alters his mind, is either very weak or very ſtubborn. How painful then muſt it be to an honeſt heart, to be bound to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023495_0007_0FBFA25E5891C798"/>
obſerve the principles of his former belief, after he is convinced of their imbecility? and this ever has, and ever will be the caſe, while the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are conſidered alienable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſing it was right for a man to bind his own conſcience, yet ſurely it is very iniquitous to bind the conſciences of his children—to make fetters for them before they are born, is very cruel. And yet ſuch has been the conduct of men in almoſt all ages, that their children have been bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and worſhip as their fathers did, or ſuffer ſhame, loſs, and ſometimes life; and at beſt, to be called diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters; becauſe they diſſent from that which they never joined voluntarily. Such conduct in parents, is worſe than that of the father of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who impoſed an oath upon his ſon, while a child, never to be at peace with the Romans.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Finally, religion is a matter between God and individuals: religious opinions of men not being the objects of civil government, nor any ways under its control.</p>
            <p>It has often been obſerved, by the friends of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eſtabliſhment by human laws, that no ſtate can long continue without it; that religion will periſh, and nothing but infidelity and atheiſm prevail.</p>
            <p>Are theſe things facts?—Did not the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion prevail during the three firſt centuries, in a more glorious manner than ever it has ſince; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without the aid of law, but in oppoſition to all the laws of haughty monarchs? And did not religion receive a deadly wound by being foſtered in the arms of civil power and regulated by law? Theſe things are ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:023495_0008_0FBFA2602FAB2BB8"/>From that day to this, we have but a few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of religious liberty to judge by; for in almoſt all ſtates, civil rulers (by the inſtigation of covetous prieſts) have undertaken to ſteady the ark of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by human laws; but yet we have a few of them, without leaving our own land.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of Rhode-Iſland has ſtood above 160 years without any religious eſtabliſhment. The ſtate of New-York never had any. New-Jerſey claims the ſame. Pennſylvania has alſo ſtood from its firſt ſettlement until now upon a liberal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: and if agriculture, the mechanical arts and commerce have not flouriſhed in theſe ſtates, equal to any of the ſtates, I judge wrong.</p>
            <p>It may further be obſerved, that all the ſtates now in union, ſaving two or three in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, have no legal force uſed about religion, in directing its courſe or ſupporting its preachers.— And moreover, the federal government is forbidden by the conſtitution, to make any laws, eſtabliſhing any kind of religion. If religion cannot ſtand, therefore, without the aid of law, it is likely to fall ſoon, in our nation, except in Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts.</p>
            <p>To ſay, that "Religion cannot ſtand without a ſtate eſtabliſhment," is not only contrary to fact, (as has been proved already) but is a contradiction in phraſe. Religion muſt have ſtood a time before any law could have been made about it; and if it did ſtand almoſt 300 years without law, it can ſtill ſtand without it.</p>
            <p>The evils of ſuch an eſtabliſhment are many.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:023495_0009_0FBFA262B53C3838"/>1. Uninſpired, fallible men make their own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions teſts of orthodoxy, and uſe their own ſyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, as <hi>Rocruſtus</hi> uſed his iron bedſtead; to ſtretch and meaſure the conſciences of all others by.— Where no toleration is granted to non-conformiſts, either ignorance and ſuperſtition prevail, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution rages: and if toleration is granted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted non-conformiſts, the minds of men are biaſſed, to embrace that religion which is favored and pampered by law, (and thereby hypocriſy is nouriſhed) while thoſe who cannot ſtretch their conſciences to believe any thing and every thing in the eſtabliſhed creed, are treated with contempt and opprobrious names; and by ſuch means ſome are pampered to death by largeſſes, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined from doing what good, they otherwiſe could, by penury. The firſt lie under a temptation to flatter the ruling party, to continue that form of government, which brings them in the ſure bread of idleneſs; the laſt to deſpiſe that government, and thoſe rulers that oppreſs them.—The firſt have their eyes ſhut to all further light, that would alter the religious machine, the laſt are always ſeeking new light, and often fall into enthuſiaſm. Such are the natural evils of eſtabliſhment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by human laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such eſtabliſhments not only wean and alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the affections of one from another, on account of the different uſages they receive, in their religious ſentiments, but are alſo very impolitic, eſpecially in new countries; for what encouragement can ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023495_0010_0FBFA2662153A590"/>
have to migrate with their arts and wealth into a ſtate, where they cannot enjoy their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſentiments without expoſing themſelves to the law? when, at the ſame time, their religious opinions do not lead them to be mutinous. And further, how often have kingdoms and ſtates been greatly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by religious teſts! In the time of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in France, not leſs than twenty thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fled, for the enjoyment of religious liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe eſtabliſhments, metamorphiſe the church into a creature, and religion into a principle of ſtate; which has a natural tendency to make men conclude that <hi>bible religion</hi> is nothing but a <hi>trick of ſtate</hi>: hence it is that the greateſt part of the well informed in literature, are over-run with deiſm and infidelity; nor is it likely that it will ever be much better, while preaching is made a trade of emolument. And if there is no difference between <hi>bible religion</hi> and <hi>ſtate religion,</hi> I ſhall ſoon fall into infidelity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are no two kingdoms and ſtates that eſtabliſh the ſame creed and formularies of faith, (which alone proves their debility). In one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a man is condemned for not believing a doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine that he would be condemned for believing in another kingdom. Both of theſe eſtabliſhments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be right—but both of them can be, and ſurely are, wrong.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The nature of ſuch eſtabliſhments, further is, to keep from civil office, the beſt of men. Good men
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023495_0011_0FBFA26EA7B106A8"/>
cannot believe what they cannot believe; and they will not ſubſcribe to what they diſbelieve; and take an oath to maintain what they conclude is error: and as the beſt of men differ in judgement, there may be ſome of them in any ſtate: their talents and virtue entitle them to fill the moſt important poſts, yet becauſe they differ from the eſtabliſhed creed of the ſtate, they cannot—will not fill thoſe poſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas villains make no ſcruple to take any oath.</p>
            <p>If theſe, and many more evils, attend ſuch eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, What were, and ſtill are the cauſes that ever there ſhould be a ſtate eſtabliſhment of religion in any empire, kingdom, or ſtate?</p>
            <p>The cauſes are many;—ſome of which follow:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The love of importance is a general evil. It is natural to men, to dictate for others: they chuſe to command the buſhel and uſe the whip-row; to have the halter around the necks of others, to hang them at pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An over-fondneſs for a particular ſyſtem or ſect. This gave riſe to the firſt human eſtabliſhment of religion, by Conſtantine the Great. Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the chriſtian ſyſtem, he eſtabliſhed it in the Roman empire, compelled the pagans to ſubmit, and baniſhed the chriſtian hereticks; built fine chapels at public expence, and forced large ſtipends for the preachers. All this was done out of love to the chriſtian religion; but his love operated inadvertent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for he did the chriſtian church more harm than all the perſecuting emperors ever did. It is ſaid, that in his day, a voice was heard from heaven, ſaying,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023495_0012_0FBFA270D0243F78"/>
"Now is poiſon ſpued into the churches." If this voice was not heard, it nevertheleſs was a truth; for from that day to this, the chriſtian religion has been made a ſtirrup to mount the ſteed of popularity, wealth and ambition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To produce uniformity in religion. Rulers often fear that if they leave every man to think, ſpeak and worſhip as he pleaſes, that the whole cauſe will be wrecked in diverſity: to prevent which, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh ſome ſtandard of orthodoxy, to effect unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. But, is uniformity attainable? Millions of men, women and children have been tortured to death, to produce uniformity, and yet the world has not advanced one inch towards it. And as long as men live in different parts of the world, have differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent habits, education and intereſts, they will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in judgement, humanly ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Is uniformity of ſentiments, in matters of religion, eſſential to the happineſs of civil government?— Not at all. Government has no more to do with the religious opinions of men, than it has with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the mathematicks. Let every man ſpeak freely without fear—maintain the principles that he believes—worſhip according to his own faith, either one God, three Gods, no God, or twenty Gods; and let government protect him in ſo doing, i. e. ſee that he meets with no perſonal abuſe or loſs of property, for his religious opinions. Inſtead of diſcouraging of him with proſcriptions, fines, confiſcation or death, let him be encouraged, as a free man, to bring forth his arguments and maintain his points with all boldneſs: then, if his doctrine is falſe, it will be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023495_0013_0FBFA271DC72D640"/>
confuted, and if it is true (tho' ever ſo novel) let others credit it.</p>
            <p>When every man has this liberty, what can he wiſh for more?—A liberal man aſks for nothing more of government.</p>
            <p>The duty of magiſtrates is, not to judge of the divinity or tendency of doctrines; but when thoſe principles break out into overt acts of violence, then to uſe the civil ſword and puniſh the vagrant for what he has done, and not for the religious phrenzy that he acted from.</p>
            <p>It is not ſuppoſeable, that any eſtabliſhed creed contains the whole truth, and nothing but truth;— but ſuppoſing it did—which eſtabliſhed church in the world has got it? All bigots contend for it:— each ſociety cries out, "The temple of the Lord are we." Let one ſociety be ſuppoſed to be in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the whole—let that ſociety be eſtabliſhed by law—the creed of faith that they adopt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated ſo ſacred by government, that the man that diſbelieves it muſt die—let this creed finally prevail over the whole world. I aſk, what honor <hi>truth</hi> gets by all this? None at all. It is famed of a Pruſſian, called John the Cicero, that by one oration he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled two contending princes, actually in war: but, ſays the hiſtorian, "It was his ſix thouſand horſe of battle that had the moſt perſuaſive oratory." So when one creed or church prevails over another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed with (a coat of mail) law and ſword, truth gets no honor by the victory. Whereas if all ſtand upon one footing, being equally protected by law, as citizens, (not as ſaints) and one prevails over another
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023495_0014_0FBFA27347DD1790"/>
by cool inveſtigation and fair argument, then truth gains honor; and men more firmly believe it, than if it was made an eſſential article of ſalvation, by law.</p>
            <p>Truth diſdains the aid of law for its defence—it will ſtand upon its own merit. The heathens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped a goddeſs, called truth, ſtark naked; and all human decorations of truth, ſerve only to deſtroy her virgin beauty. It is error, and error alone, that needs human ſupport; and whenever men fly to the law or ſword to protect their ſyſtem of religion, and force it upon others, it is evident that they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their ſyſtem that will not bear the light, and ſtand upon the baſis of truth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The common objection, "that the ignorant part of the community are not capacitated to judge for themſelves," ſupports the popiſh hierarchy, and all proteſtant as well as turkiſh and pagan eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in idea.</p>
            <p>But is this idea juſt? Has God choſen many of the wiſe and learned? Has he not hid the myſtery of goſpel truth from them, and revealed it unto babes? Does the world, by wiſdom, know God? Did many of the rulers believe in Chriſt when he was upon earth? Were not the learned clergy (the ſcribes) his moſt inveterate enemies? Do not great men differ as much as little men in judgement? Have not almoſt all lawleſs errors crept into the world through the means of wiſe men (ſo called)? Is not a ſimple man, who makes nature and reaſon his ſtudy, a competent judge of things? Is the bible written (like Caligula's laws) ſo intricate and high that none but the letter learned (according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023495_0015_0FBFA278144EBB00"/>
phraſe) can read it? Is not the viſion written ſo plain that he that runs may read it? Do not thoſe who underſtand the original languages, that the bible was written in, differ as much in judgement as others? Are the identical copies of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, together with the epiſtles, in every univerſity, and in the hands of every maſter of arts? If not, have not the learned to truſt to a human tranſcription, as much as the unlearned have to a tranſlation? If theſe queſtions, and others of the like nature, can be confuted—then I will confeſs that it is wiſdom for a conclave of biſhops, or a convocation of clergy to frame a ſyſtem out of the bible, and perſuade the legiſlature to legalize it.— No.—It would be attended with ſo much expence, pride, domination, cruelty and bloodſhed, that let me rather fall into infidelity: for no religion at all, is better than that which is worſe than none.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ground work of theſe eſtabliſhments of religion is, <hi>clerical influence.</hi> Rulers, being perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the clergy that an eſtabliſhment of religion by human laws, would promote the knowledge of the goſpel, quell religious diſputes, prevent hereſy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce uniformity, and finally be advantageous to the ſtate, eſtabliſh ſuch creeds as are framed by the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy:—and this they often do the more readily, when they are flattered by the clergy; that if they thus defend the truth, they will become <hi>nurſing fathers</hi> to the church, and merit ſomething conſiderable for themſelves.</p>
            <p>What ſtimulates the clergy to recommend this mode of reaſoning is,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:023495_0016_0FBFA27B0FB8FE70"/>1. Ignorance—not being able to confute error by fair argument.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Indolence—not being willing to ſpend any time to confute the heretical.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But chiefly covetouſneſs, to get money—for it may be obſerved that in all theſe eſtabliſhments, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſalaries for the clergy, recoverable by law, are ſure to be interwoven: and was not this the caſe, I am well convinced that there would not be many, if any religious eſtabliſhments, in the chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>Having made the foregoing remarks, I ſhall next make ſome obſervations on the religion of <hi>Connecticut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the citizens of this ſtate, have any thing in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that looks like a religious eſtabliſhment, they ought to be very cautious; for being but a ſmall part of the world, they can never expect to extend their religion over the whole of it, without it is ſo well founded that it cannot be confuted.</p>
            <p>If one third part of the face of the globe is allowed to be ſeas, the earthy parts would compoſe 4550 ſuch ſtates as Connecticut. The American empire would afford above 200 of them. And as there is no religion in this empire, of the ſame ſtamp of the Connecticut <hi>ſtanding order,</hi> upon the Say-Brook plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they may expect 199 againſt 1, at home, and 4549 againſt 1 abroad.</p>
            <p>Connecticut and New-Haven were ſeparate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments till the reign of Charles II. when they were incorporated together by a charter; which char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſtill conſidered, by ſome, as the baſis of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>At preſent, there are in the ſtate about 168 preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023495_0017_0FBFA27C40CED538"/>
congregational and conſociated preachers; 35 baptiſts; 20 epiſcopalians; 10 ſeparate-congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and a few of other denominations. The firſt are the <hi>ſtanding order</hi> of Connecticut; to whom all others have to pay obeiſance. Societies of the <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order</hi> are formed by law: none have right to vote therein but men, of age, who poſſeſs property to the amount of 40<hi>l.</hi> and are in full communion in the church. Their choice of miniſters is by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor vote; and what the ſociety agree to give him annually, is levied upon all within the limits of the ſociety-bounds; except they bring a certificate to the clerk of the ſociety, that they attend worſhip elſewhere, and contribute to the ſatisfaction of the ſociety where they attend. The money being levied on the people, is deſtrainable by law; and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally binding on the ſociety till the miniſter is diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a council, or by death, from his charge.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to give a detail of all the tumults, oppreſſion, fines and impriſonments, that have heretofore been occaſioned by this <hi>law-religion.</hi> Theſe things are partly dead and buried, and if they do not riſe of themſelves, let them ſleep peaceably in the duſt forever. Let it ſuffice on this head, to ſay, that it is not poſſible, in the nature of things, to eſtabliſh religion by human laws, without perverting the deſign of civil law and oppreſſing the people.</p>
            <p>The certificate that a diſſenter produces to the ſociety clerk, muſt be ſigned by ſome officer of the diſſenting church, and ſuch church muſt be proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-chriſtian; for heathens, deiſts, jews and papiſts are not indulged in the certificate law: all of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:023495_0018_0FBFA27E282BB8D0"/>
as well as turks, muſt therefore be taxed to the ſtanding order, although they never go among them, or know where the meeting-houſe is.</p>
            <p>This certificate law is founded on this principle, "That it is the duty of all perſons to ſupport the goſpel and the worſhip of God." Is this principle founded in juſtice? Is it the duty of a deiſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that which he believes to be a cheat and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? Is it the duty of a jew to ſupport the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Jeſus Chriſt, when he really believes that he was an impoſtor? Muſt the papiſts be forced to pay men for preaching down the ſupremacy of the pope, whom they are ſure is the head of the church? Muſt a turk maintain a religion, oppoſed to the <hi>alkoran,</hi> which he holds as the ſacred oracles of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Theſe things want better confirmation. If we ſuppoſe that it is the duty of all theſe to ſupport the proteſtant chriſtian religion, as being the beſt religion in the world; yet how comes it to paſs that human legiſlatures have right to force them ſo to do? I now call for an inſtance where Jeſus Chriſt, the author of his religion, or the apoſtles, who were divinely inſpired, ever gave orders to, or intimated that the civil powers on earth ought to force people to obſerve the rules and doctrine of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomed</hi> called in the uſe of law and ſword to convert people to his religion; but Jeſus did not— does not.</p>
            <p>It is the duty of men to love God with all their hearts, and their neighbours as themſelves; but have legiſlatures authority to puniſh men if they do not? —So there are many things that Jeſus and the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023495_0019_0FBFA280F3D2F3D8"/>
taught, that men ought to obey, which yet the civil law has no concerns in.</p>
            <p>That it is the duty of men, who are taught in the word, to communicate to him that teaches, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond controverſy; but that it is the province of the civil law to force them to do ſo, is denied.</p>
            <p>The charter of Charles the ſecond, is ſuppoſed to be the baſis of government in Connecticut; and I requeſt any gentleman to point out a ſingle clauſe in that charter, which authorizes the legiſlature to make any religious laws, eſtabliſh any religion, or force people to build meeting-houſes or pay preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. If there is no ſuch conſtitutional clauſe, it follows, that the laws are uſurpaſive in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and not binding on the people. I ſhall here add, that if the legiſlature of Connecticut have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to eſtabliſh the religion which they prefer to all religions, and force men to ſupport it; then every legiſlature or legiſlator has the ſame authority; and if this be true, the ſeparation of the chriſtians from the pagans, the departure of the proteſtants from the papiſts, and the diſſention of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians from the church of England were all ſchiſms of a criminal nature; and all the perſecution that they have met with, is the juſt effect of their ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs.</p>
            <p>The certificate law ſuppoſes, 1. That the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have power to eſtabliſh a religion. This is falſe. 2. That they have authority to grant indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to non-conformiſts:—this is alſo falſe; for religious liberty is a <hi>right</hi> and not a <hi>favor.</hi> 3. That
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023495_0020_0FBFA287843F6ED0"/>
the legitimate power of government extends to force people to part with their money for religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. This cannot be proved from the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The certificate law has lately paſſed a new mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification. Juſtices of the peace muſt now examine them;—this gives miniſters of ſtate a power over religious concerns that the new-teſtament does not. —To examine the law, part by part, would be needleſs—for the whole of it is wrong.</p>
            <p>From what is ſaid, this queſtion ariſes, "Are not contracts with miniſters, i. e. between miniſters and people, as obligatory as any contracts whatever?" —The ſimple anſwer is, Yes. Miniſters ſhould ſhare the ſame protection of the law, that other men do, and no more. To proſcribe them from ſeats of legiſlation, &amp;c. is cruel. To indulge them with an exemption from taxes and bearing arms, is a tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emolument. The law ſhould be ſilent about them; protect them as citizens, (not as ſacred offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers) for the civil law knows no ſacred, religious officers.</p>
            <p>In Rhode-Iſland, if a congregation of people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to give a preacher a certain ſum of money for preaching, the bond is not recoverable by law.<note n="*" place="bottom">Some men, who are beſt informed in the laws of Rhode-Iſland, ſay, that if ever there was ſuch an a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> in that ſtate, there is nothing like it in exiſtence at this day; and perhaps it is only caſt upon them as a ſtigma, becauſe they have ever been friends to religious liberty.

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:023495_0021_0FBFA28A9DAC92A8"/>This law was formed upon a good principle, but, unhappy for the makers of that law, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent in the ſuperſtructure.</p>
            <p>The principle of the law, is, that the goſpel is not to be ſupported by law; that civil rulers have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with religion, in their civil capacities; What buſineſs had they then to make that law?— The evil ſeemed to ariſe from a blending religious <hi>right</hi> and religious <hi>opinions</hi> together. Religious <hi>right</hi> ſhould be protected to <hi>all</hi> men, religious <hi>opinion</hi> to none; i. e. government ſhould confirm the firſt unto all; the laſt unto none: each individual having a <hi>right</hi> to differ from all others in <hi>opinion</hi> if he is ſo perſuaded. If a number of people in Rhode-Iſland or elſewhere are of opinion, that miniſters of the goſpel ought to be ſupported by law, and chuſe to be bound by a bond to pay him; government has no juſt authority to declare that bond illegal; for in ſo doing, they interfere with private contracts, and deny the people the liberty of conſcience. If theſe people bind nobody but themſelves—who is injured by their religious opinions? But if they bind an individual beſides themſelves, the bond is fraudulent, and ought to be declared illegal. And here lies the miſchief of Connecticut religion. My lord, major vote, binds all the minor part, unleſs they ſubmit to idolatry; i. e. pay an acknowledgement to a power that Jeſus Chriſt never ordained in his church; I mean produce a certificate. Yea further, jews, turks, heathens, papiſts and deiſts, if ſuch there are in Connecticut, are bound, and have no redreſs: and further, this bond is not annually given, but for
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023495_0022_0FBFA2901B22BF30"/>
life, except the miniſter is diſmiſſed by a number of others, who are in the ſame predicament with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Although it is no abridgement of religious lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty for congregations to pay their preachers by legal force, in the manner preſcribed above, yet it is antichriſtian; ſuch a church cannot be a church of Chriſt, becauſe they are not governed by Chriſt's laws, but by the laws of ſtate; and ſuch miniſters do not appear like ambaſſadors of Chriſt, but like miniſters of ſtate.</p>
            <p>The next queſtion is this, "Suppoſe a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of people have agreed to give a miniſter a certain ſum of money annually, for life or during good behaviour; and in a courſe of time, ſome or all of them change their opinions, and verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the preacher is in a capital error; and really from conſcience, diſſent from him—are they ſtill bound to comply with their engagements to the preacher?"—This queſtion is ſuppoſeable, and I believe there have been a few inſtances of the kind.</p>
            <p>If men have bound themſelves—honor and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty call upon them to comply—but God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience call upon them to come out from among them, and let ſuch blind guides alone.<note n="†" place="bottom">The phraſe of <hi>blind guides,</hi> is not intended to caſt contempt upon any order of religious preachers; for, let a preacher be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox or hetrodox, virtuous or vicious, he is always a <hi>blind guide</hi> to thoſe who differ from him in opinion.</note> Honor and honeſty are amiable virtues; but God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023495_0023_0FBFA292B60986D0"/>
call to perfidiouſneſs. This ſhows the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of ſuch contracts—which always may, and ſometimes do lead into ſuch labyrinths. Time enough to pay a man after his labour is over.— People are not required to communicate to the <hi>teacher</hi> before they are <hi>taught.</hi> A man, called of God to preach, feels a neceſſity to preach, and a woe if he does not. And if he is ſent by Chriſt he looks to him and his laws for ſupport; and if men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their duty, he finds relief; if not, he muſt go to his field, as the prieſts of old did. A man cannot give a more glaring proof of his covetouſneſs and irreligion, than to ſay, "If you will give me ſo much, then I will preach, but if not, be aſſured I will not preach to you."</p>
            <p>So that in anſwering the queſtion, inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining which of the evils to chuſe; either to diſobey God and conſcience, or break honour and honeſty, I would recommend an eſcape of both evils, by entering into no ſuch contracts: for the natural evils of imprudence, that men are fallen into, neither God nor man can prevent.</p>
            <p>A miniſter muſt have a hard heart, to wiſh men to be forced to pay him, when (thro' conſcience, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, or a private pique) they diſſent from his miniſtry. The ſpirit of the goſpel diſdains ſuch meaſures.</p>
            <p>The queſtion before us, is not applicable to many caſes in Connecticut: the diſſenting churches make no contracts for a longer term than a year, and moſt of them make none at all. Societies, of the <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order,</hi> rarely bind themſelves, in contract with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023495_0024_0FBFA2943439C040"/>
preachers, without binding others beſide themſelves: and when that is the caſe the bond is fraudulent: and if thoſe who are bound involuntarily can get clear, it is no breach of honor or honeſty.</p>
            <p>A few additional remarks ſhall cloſe my piece.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The church of Rome, was at firſt conſtituted according to the goſpel; and at that time her faith was ſpoken of through the whole world. Being eſpouſed to Chriſt, as a chaſte virgin, ſhe kept her bed pure for her huſband, almoſt three hundred years: but afterwards ſhe played the whore with the kings and princes of this world; who with their gold and wealth came in unto her, and ſhe became a ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet:—and as ſhe was the firſt chriſtian church that ever forſook the laws of Chriſt for her conduct; and received the laws of his rivals; i. e. was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by human law, and governed by the legali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed edicts of councils; and received large ſums of money to ſupport her preachers and her worſhip, by the force of civil power—ſhe is called the MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER OF HARLOTS: and all proteſtant church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who are regulated by law, and force people to ſupport their preachers, build meeting-houſes and otherwiſe maintain their worſhip, are DAUGHTERS of this HOLY MOTHER.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am not a citizen of Connecticut—the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious laws of the ſtate do not oppreſs me, and I expect never will perſonally; but a love to religious liberty in general induces me thus to ſpeak. Was
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023495_0025_0FBFA295AD383F88"/>
I a reſident in the ſtate, I could not give or receive a certificate to be exempted from miniſterial taxes; for in ſo doing I ſhould confeſs that the legiſlature had authority, to pamper one religious order in the ſtate, and make all others pay obeiſance to that <hi>ſheef.</hi> —It is high time to know whether all are to be free alike; and whether miniſters of ſtate are to be lords over God's heritage.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall aſk the citizens of Connecticut, Whether, in the months of April and September, when they chuſe their deputies for the aſſembly, they mean to ſurrender to them the rights of conſcience, and authorize them to make laws, binding on their conſciences? If not, then all ſuch acts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intention of conſtituent power, as well as unconſtitutional and antichriſtian.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is likely that one part of the people in Connecticut believe, in conſcience, that goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be ſupported by the force of law; and the other part believe that it is not in the province of civil law to interfere or any ways meddle with religious matters. How are both parties to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by law, in their conſciencious belief?</p>
            <p>Very eaſily.—Let all thoſe whoſe conſciences dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that they ought to be taxed by law to maintain their preacher, bring in their names to the ſociety-clerk, by a certain day, and then aſſeſs them all, according to their eſtates, to raiſe the ſum, ſtipulated in the contract; and all others go free. Both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by this method would enjoy the full liberty of conſcience, without oppreſſing one another—the law
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023495_0026_0FBFA2A001CB7900"/>
uſe no force in matters of conſcience—the evil of Rhode-Iſland law be eſcaped—and no perſons could find fault with it (in a political point of view), but thoſe who fear the conſciences of too many would lie dormant, and therefore wiſh to force them to pay. Here let it be noted; that there are many in the world, who believe, in conſcience, that a miniſter is not entitled to any acknowledgement for his ſervices, without he is ſo poor that he cannot live without it, (and thereby convert a goſpel debt to alms):— Though this opinion is not founded either on reaſon or ſcripture; yet it is a better opinion than that which would force them to pay a preacher by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man law.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. How mortifying muſt it be to foreigners, and how far from conciliatory is it, to citizens of the American ſtates, who, when they come into Connecticut to reſide muſt either conform to the religion of Connecticut, or produce a certificate? Does this look like religious liberty or human friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Suppoſe that man (whoſe name need not be mentioned) that fills every American heart with pleaſure and awe, ſhould remove to Connecticut for his health, or any other cauſe—what a ſcandal would it be to the ſtate, to tax him to a preſbyterian min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, unleſs he produced a certificate, informing them that he was an epiſcopalian?</p>
            <p n="5">V. The federal conſtitution certainly had the advantage, of any of the ſtate conſtitutions, in being made by the wiſeſt men in the whole nation, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023495_0027_0FBFA2A28515E910"/>
after an experiment of a number of years trial, upon republican principles: and that conſtitution forbids congreſs ever to eſtabliſh any kind of religion, or require any religious teſt to qualify any officer in any department of federal government. Let a man be Pagan, Turk, Jew or Chriſtian, he is eligible to any poſt in that government. So that if the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religious liberty, contended for in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going pages, are ſuppoſed to be fraught with deiſm, fourteen ſtates, in union, are now fraught with the ſame. But the ſeparate ſtates have not ſurrendered that (ſuppoſed) right of eſtabliſhing religion, to Congreſs. Each ſtate retains all its power, ſaving what is given to the general government, by the federal conſtitution. The aſſembly of Connecticut, therefore, ſtill undertake to guide the helm of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and if Congreſs were diſpoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they could not prevent it, by any power veſted in them by the ſtates. Therefore, if any of the people of Connecticut feel oppreſſed by the certificate law, or any other of the like nature, their proper mode of procedure will be to remonſtrate againſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and petition the aſſembly for a redreſs of grievance.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Divines generally inform us, that there is ſuch a time to come (called the <hi>Latter-Day Glory),</hi> when the knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the earth as the waters do the ſea: and that this day will appear upon the deſtruction of antichriſt: If ſo, I am well convinced that Jeſus will firſt remove all the hindrances of religious eſtabliſhments, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023495_0028_0FBFA2A40213B148"/>
cauſe all men to be free in matters of religion.— When this is effected, he will ſay to the kings and great men of the earth, <q>Now ſee what I can do: ye have been afraid to leave the church and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in my hands alone, without ſteadying the ark by human law; but now I have taken the power and kingdom to myſelf; and will work for my own glory.</q>—Here let me add, that in the ſouthern ſtates, where there has been the greateſt freedom from religious oppreſſion; where liberty of conſcience is entirely enjoyed; there has been the greateſt revival of religion; which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other proof that true religion can, and will prevail beſt, where it is left entirely to Chriſt.</p>
