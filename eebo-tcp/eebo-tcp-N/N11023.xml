            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS country is now reduced to a ſituation really degrading and deplorable, through the ſtrange obſtinacy and week prejudices of the King, who is determined, even at the riſk of his own ſafety, the preſervation of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and contrary to the united voice of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to encourage and protect an abandoned ſet of men in the deſtruction of that conſtitution he was ſworn to ſupport and defend.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory fatally informs us, that the Engliſh have been driven to extremes, by cauſes of leſs moment than thoſe which have ſhaken this kingdom during the preſent reign.</p>
            <p>Since the laſt ſtupendous Revolution, it has been generally believed, that the nature of our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013973_0002_0F925A06C0E71828"/>became clearly aſcertained, and fixed on firmer and more laſting principles than it had known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that glorious aera; at leaſt the obtaining theſe ends, as well as redreſſing grievances, are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the motives to the tranſactions of thoſe times. For had the exorbitant power of the crown been left unlimited and unſettled, as before that event, and the liberties and privileges of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of England, in the ſame undecided ſtate; it would have been only to change the name of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not the nature of their ſovereignty. And if, inſtead of removing the cauſe of our ſufferings, and fixing our rights and liberties, we then gave to a Houſe of Commons, an unlimited power to diſpoſe of the laſt, according to their inclination, it was only changing the poſſeſſors of arbitrary power, by granting to a proſtituted ſet of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives what was denied the King; and thus this illuſtrious action of the Revolution muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the reſult of the faction, and averſion to one intereſt, or unwarrantable zeal for another. In what manner can a nation be more ſettled in its freedom, by transferring arbitrary power from one part of the conſtitution to another.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but that the laws, which were then enacted to eſtabliſh upon a foundation not to be again ſhaken, the freedom of the Engliſh nation, and the liberties of the people ought to be conſidered, as unalterable, the very baſis and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of the King's prerogative, and the rights of Engliſhmen, ſomething in the government like the center in the earth, the fixed point, round which all things move, and to which they tend.</p>
            <p>Thoſe acts which were made at the Revolution, relative to the conſtitution, ſuch as the bill of
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013973_0003_0F925A07D7DCD748"/>rights, and afterwards in conſequence of it the act of ſettlement, which may be juſtly deemed the compact between the Houſe of Hanover and the people of England, and which was preſerved invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate, till broken by the unhallowed hands of the preſent Sovereign and his miniſters, are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly of a nature more ſacred than thoſe which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a turnpike road.</p>
            <p>Thoſe acts, founded on our former rights in Magna Charta, ought to be conſidered as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential authority by which the Houſe of Commons exiſts, than laws which a Parliament may abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, through pure inclination to indulge a King or his Miniſters, to make them deſpotic, and the people miſerable; for it muſt appear ſtrangely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in a conſtitution, that the repreſentatives of the people, who form a third part of it, ſhould be authorized by them to deſtroy their liberties, and thereby exclude them from the rights which they poſſeſs in the government of the kingdom? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is contrary to the very idea of a free ſtate, that a people ſhould have given a power of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing their privileges to men choſen the guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of them.</p>
            <p>Something muſt exiſt in a free ſtate, which no part of it can be authoriſed to alter or deſtroy, otherwiſe the idea of a conſtitution cannot ſubſiſt; for unleſs we allow the freeholders and electors of Great Britain to be ſuperior to a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, we grant to them an abſolute power, a power inconſiſtent with the notion of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and deſtructive of the principles of a mixed government.</p>
            <p>Should it be acknowledged, that though the Commons have exerciſed a power of annihilating many privileges and rights belonging to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013973_0004_0F925A087564C708"/>and that they poſſeſs no legal title to it, then all laws ſubverſive of Magna Charta, the bill of rights, act or ſettlement, and ſpirit of the conſtitution, are an exceſs of their authority, and a violation of their truſt, for which the preſent infamous parliament ought not only to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but every member who viſibly engaged in the deſtruction of the peoples rights, ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death, together with thoſe helliſh miniſters who formed a deſign of enſlaving the people; and it muſt be equally juſt, as well as neceſſary, to call to a ſtrict account the firſt magiſtrate, who could be baſe enough to encourage the deſtruction of our liberties, and a ſubverſion of the nobleſt conſtitution in the world, as an example to future Kings and miniſters.</p>
            <p>If any miniſterial hireling ſhould aſſert that our repreſentatives, after the hour of election are no longer anſwerable for their conduct, and are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally inveſted with authority to deſtroy our rights and liberties at their pleaſure, then what did King James do more than by this his prerogative? And of what advantage has the Revolution proved to us, if ſubverting the conſtitution be legally placed in the hands of the repreſentatives? In what ſenſe does the idea of a free ſtate, or the liberty of the people exiſt, when it depends upon nothing more permanent or eſtabliſhed than the vague, rapacious, or intereſted inclination of a majority of five hundred and fifty eight men, open to the inſidious attacks of a weak or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince, and his miniſters? Surely it will be granted, that whether King or miniſter, who by undue influence ſhould prevail in paſſing laws ſubverſive of the ſtatutes before mentioned, muſt be deemed an offender againſt the moſt ſacred of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:013973_0005_0F925A0CD263F648"/>all human enjoyments, liberty and the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his country, and equally criminal with James the ſecond and his miniſters.</p>
            <p>The whole preſumptive title a parliament can pretend to have of diſpoſing of our rights and privileges can be but prerogative, which in many inſtances has been illegally carried beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of liberty and the conſtitution. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary we ſhould recur to the ſpirit of the conſtitution with the ſtricteſt rigour and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon that can be given, why our forefathers, in the antient fundamental ſtatutes of the realm, have delivered nothing verbally expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit on this head of limiting the power of their repreſentatives, derives it origin from the ſame cauſe that the Romans had no laws againſt parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, they never conceived that the thought of betraying or ſelling a peoples liberties, any more than murdering a father could enter the human heart; they never imagined that the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive could ever poſſeſs an intereſt diſtinct from that of his conſtituent, or that pecuniary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage could outweigh the public good in his breaſt; they did not foreſee that miniſters might have occaſion to oppreſs us, for the gratification of a weak or wicked Prince; or that Engliſhmen, no longer animated by the ſoul of public proſperity, might degenerate into granting oppreſſive taxes, till the nation would be brought within one ſtep of ruin; or that laws, eſſential to the eſtabliſhment of freedom and ſecurity of the ſtate, could be made to burſt at the mandate of a miniſter, by the breath of a majority of five hundred and fifty eight men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:013973_0006_0F925A0E49FACF40"/>
When the repreſentatives of the people act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the very elements of the conſtitution, betray and give up the rights, privileges, and liberties of the people, though nothing in the fundamental ſtatutes literally prohibit ſo ignominious a behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; the very nature of their ſtation, the innate ſenſe of right, and original ſpirit of government, directly contradict all poſſibility of their having title for ſuch proceedings; and whenever it is done, it is an unjuſt and wanton exertion of power, and not of authority; add to this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and heinous crime the indignant and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting conſideration, that our equals whom we chooſe to ſerve, have ſold us like our cattle to a weak (not to ſay worſe) King, and his accurſed miniſters, who have paid our betrayers with a part of that money which was moſt unjuſtly levied on us, not to anſwer the neceſſity of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for the moſt infamous and villanous purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The particulars mentioned in the bill of rights at the Revolution, were then conſidered as ſo many violations committed by King James, on the privileges of the people, and neceſſary to be remedied for the ſake of ſecuring our religion, and re-eſtabliſhing liberty and the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The grievances, at that time complained of againſt the Sovereign, had their foundation in juſtice, and the rights of the people and the redreſſing them in the nature of the conſtitution; otherwiſe, by what arguments could be aſſigned a cauſe of complaint againſt the Prince on the throne, or preſerve thoſe men, who accompliſhed the Revolution, from the imputation of traitors and rebels to their King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:013973_0007_0F925A0F02F18270"/>
They conſidered the conſtitution as the primary object of an Engliſhman, and the King but as the ſecondary; who, by his attempts towards deſpotiſm, became a rebel againſt this ſuperior power. They juſtly reaſoned, that as the people, who made a third of the conſtitution, are deemed traitors for plotting or attempting the life of, or taking up arms againſt the King, who forms another third of the conſtitution, and doomed to death in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch behavior, in like manner King JAMES rebelled againſt two thirds of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by attempting to ſubvert their religion and liberties; for our conſtitution ſuppoſes, that each part of it has a right to be preſerved; that two are more than one, and the happineſs of a whole people to be preſerved, in preference to the ambition or pernicious paſſion or deſigns of a King.</p>
            <p>Shall then the preſent Sovereign and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be exempted from a ſtrict and nice inquiry into their conduct, becauſe they have effected in one method the very deſpotiſm which was oppoſed in James, who was deſervedly drove into exile, for attempting it in another. Forbid it, Heaven! And every thing that is dear to Engliſhmen!</p>
