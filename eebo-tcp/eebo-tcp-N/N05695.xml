                  <note>Dated on p. 3: Quebeck, February 6. 1753; signed on p. 8: De Roche. Evidently spurious, the letter purports to discuss secret French designs on British North America, and was probably written and published to be used as anti-French propaganda. De Roche and L'Maine have not been identified.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Day of my Arrival at this Place, I sent Dispatches to all the commanding Officers in <hi>New-France,</hi> to meet me within ten Days at <hi>Montreal;</hi> I also imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately sent Expresses to all the commanding Officers at <hi>Missisippi,</hi> to muster with all Expedition, the Natives inlisted in His Most Christian Majesty's Service, to join our Troops from <hi>France,</hi> and proceed forthwith to <hi>Ohio,</hi> there to follow such Directions as from time to time they shall receive from us at <hi>Canada:</hi> And according to Time appointed, I met Mons. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verney</hi> at <hi>Montreal,</hi> with our other Officers; at which Interview, I received a most agreeable Account from them, in Favour of our Royal Master's Interest, which gives us a glorious Prospect of soon adding a Kingdom unto our dread Sovereign's Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for by their Account from North to South, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listed into his Majesty's Service Four or Five Thousand resolute young Natives among the several Tribes; and those have been for some Time disciplin'd, and well equipt with all Necessaries. They also inform me, that our Regulars from <hi>France,</hi> with the Natives included, at <hi>Missisippi,</hi> amount to near Two Thousand Four Hundred, who are to build many strong Forts at <hi>Ohio</hi> and Places adjacent, which in a little Time we expect will prove impregnable against any Force the <hi>English</hi> can raise in those Parts. The Cannon for said Forts is already dispatched.</p>
            <p>Our Army at <hi>Canada,</hi> with our Regulars included, will amount to near Five Thousand, which we determine to divide into three main Bodies, one to be commanded by Count <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007225_0003_102B402969992798"/>
the second by Mons. <hi>Boriel,</hi> and the third by Mons. <hi>Estrides.</hi> Count <hi>Montery</hi> to proceed to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and divide his Squadron into Parties on the Back of <hi>Albany.</hi> The second Division under Mons. <hi>Boriel,</hi> on the Back of <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Pennsylvania;</hi> and the third under Mons. <hi>Estrides,</hi> on the Back of <hi>New-England;</hi> which are all to be divided into Parties, as the commanding Officers shall judge proper. We design only to send small Parties of <hi>Indians</hi> into their back Settlements, to bring us fresh Supplies of Provision, until we are properly fortified. Father <hi>Anthony,</hi> by an uncommon Assiduity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, has gained over to our Interest, a Number of young Men of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> who by the <hi>English</hi> are look'd upon as our Enemies; let that Suspicion remain, and they may keep the old Men and Women.</p>
            <p>I must not omit to acquaint you, that our new Governor is more and more zealous and resolute to be a principal Instrument (with the united Assistance of the Houses of <hi>Bourbon</hi>) to subdue and extirpate <hi>Hereticks</hi> out of <hi>America.</hi> And such a glorious Acquisition, will add a Kingdom, which will prove superiour to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and furnish Stores of every Kind for His Most Christian and Catholic Majesty's Navy, and Provisions and other Necessaries even to Profusion, for the supply of their Royal Majesty's Possessions in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our young Hero, the present Governor of <hi>Canada,</hi> did not take this Task upon him, of making a Conquest of that Part of <hi>North-America</hi> possess'd by the <hi>English,</hi> only from a Motive which makes him Ruler thereof, and because he has not a superiour Title, but his present Disposition animates him to be reveng'd on the <hi>English Heretics</hi> for the late Indignities offer'd his illustrious Person and Royal Predecessors; and is come into these Parts, invested with the Power and Authority of Church and State, and supported with Money and other Assistance, by His Most Christian and Catholic Majesties, and has likewise received the supreme Sanction and sovereign Benediction of his Holiness the Pope, to drive out of <hi>America</hi> pestilent <hi>Heretics,</hi> to make Room for good <hi>Catholics.</hi> I have also the Satisfaction of acquainting you, that the Regiments raised in the <hi>Switz</hi> Cantons some Time past, which our Governor brought over
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007225_0004_102B402C04BE0CE0"/>
with him, are in high Spirits, zealous to assist as against the <hi>English,</hi> and conceive an infinite Satisfaction at our present Prospect of possessing those fruitful Lands now enjoy'd by the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have lately had a Conference with <hi>M'Laish,</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Jesuit, of the Order of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> a politic ingenious Man, who has been among the several Tribes, influencing and inlisting the Natives into His Most Christian Majesty's Service: He gives me a very succinct and satisfactory Account of the several Tribes of Natives near <hi>Canada,</hi> that upon any emergent Occasion, we may command what Numbers we shall have Occasion for. He gives me also a particular Relation of the several Provinces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by the <hi>English</hi> on the Sea Coasts, and appears perfectly acquainted with their Manners and Customs. He informs me there are many of our hearty Friends among them, with whom he has settled a Correspondence by Letters, by the way of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Quebeck.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> (he says) are our good Friends; that the Measures we have concerted, could not be so effectually carried on, were it not that one hundred Sail of their Vessels yearly arrive at <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> with Provision and other Necessaries from <hi>Philadelphia, New-York, Boston, Rhode-Island,</hi> &amp;c. which, by a moderate Computation, have brought this Year 10,000 Barrels of Flour, 5000 Barrels of Pork and Beef, 1500 Tons of Bread, and of Butter, Cheese, Hogs, Neat Cattle, and Poultrey, even to Profusion; some of which is sent to our southern Plantations, and the King's Commissioners sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Magazines at <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and send large Quantities to our Army at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> which elevates the Spirits of our Soldiers. We have also a good Supply of Powder by the Way of <hi>Cape-Breton. M'Laish'</hi>s Sentiments of the <hi>English</hi> bordering on the Sea-Coast is satisfactory; they having little or no Military Discipline among them, no Arms nor Ammunition, neither do they know properly how to use them, except those <hi>Oliverian Heretics</hi> who took our <hi>Cape-Breton;</hi> these cast a Damp on our Undertakings; they have the same Governor <hi>Shirley,</hi> who is an enterprizing, resolute Man; and when he, and the Puritan Ministers, say to the Inhabitants, <hi>Go, fight for your Religion and Country,</hi> they rush like Lions, and had rather die in Battle, than submit to the Dictates of our Holy Fathers, Jesuits,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007225_0005_102B402DDD5FE9A8"/>
Friers, and Monks, and become Members of our Mother Church. They retain the most martial Spirit of any in <hi>North America,</hi> and have a Tincture of <hi>Oliver Cromwell'</hi>s Blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, therefore for the present, we shall not erect any Forts bordering near them; should we attempt such a Thing, even with Ten Thousand Men, <hi>M'Laish</hi> is confident we should be prevented and all our Measures disconcerted, by the Vigilance of those <hi>New-England Heretics;</hi> for if they could take <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> (which we imagin'd to be impregnable) what can we suppose they could not effect, when their Indignation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment provokes them to oppose our Encroachments on their Territories? And they are sensible, that when once we become their Masters, Fire and Gibbet will be their Portion, if they do not fall down and worship the Images we shall set up.</p>
            <p>Our Design is to get Footing in the Western Provinces. Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> was one of our Mother Church, and a good Friend to King <hi>James;</hi> and in <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> and those Parts, there are many true <hi>Catholics</hi> that will not fight their Brethren. <hi>M'Laish</hi> acquaints me, the Inhabitants of <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> are a meek peaceable People, who will neither furnish Money, Arms, nor Ammunition, that if you take their Coat, they will give you their Cloak also: These we shall indulge with many Privileges, for their not opposing our Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and quietly surrendering their Lands, and submitting to the godly Admonitions of our holy Fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M'Laish</hi> likewise acquaints me, that from <hi>New-York</hi> West ward, the Inhabitants are not such Bigots to Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may more easily be prevail'd on to be of our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The rich Traders in those Parts, are not concern'd at our erecting Forts near them, from a View of private Gain in the Fur Trade. And <hi>M'Laish</hi> says, the <hi>English</hi> might have demolished <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> but many in <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>New-York</hi> have receiv'd considerable Advantages by our Fur Trade, by which, we have also been benefitted, in receiving Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Exchange.</p>
            <p>There is now a Dispute between our Grand Monarch and the <hi>English,</hi> relating to the Boundary Line in the <hi>North,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007225_0006_102B402FE7661328"/>
what are call'd the <hi>Neutral Islands,</hi> in <hi>South-America;</hi> but his most Christian Majesty is determin'd to decide the Controversy very soon. He is now peopling the <hi>Neutral Islands,</hi> and what Cannon will be requisite to fortify the same, is already at <hi>Martineco.</hi> From <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Missisippi</hi> we are to have a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Number, of regular Troops to join the Natives, so soon as we are prepar'd to receive them, and those to be dispers'd on the Back of the <hi>English,</hi> between <hi>Crown-Point</hi> and <hi>Ohio.</hi> Our Officers are directed to send proper Persons into the <hi>English</hi> Provinces, to make a more perfect Discovery of their Strength and Weakness: Those are to deceive the <hi>English</hi> [which <hi>French Policy</hi> has frequently done!] by amusing them, with being Deserters.</p>
            <p>Our Grand Monarque's Will and Pleasure is, that we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately build strong Forts between <hi>Crown-Point</hi> and <hi>Ohio,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to secure Fifty Thousand Men, and so situated, that upon any extraordinary Occasion, they may immediately unite and oppose the <hi>English,</hi> if they should attempt to oppose us, but, at present, they appear unconcern'd and secure: However, their Numbers cannot terrify us, when they have no Discipline or Union. Had they as many as <hi>Mexico,</hi> before the Conquest, could boast of, our Regulars, headed by our Hero, the present Governor, would destroy as many Thousands as <hi>Cortes</hi> did of the <hi>Mexicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must, with secret Pleasure to ourselves, tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> that we are pitying, not envying, the <hi>English</hi> who are peopling <hi>Nova-Scotia:</hi> in thus fatiguing themselves in clearing Land, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending considerable Sums in building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as his most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Majesty's Pleasure is, to prepare a large Squadron to deprive them of their Labour and Possessions: Then will they cry out, <hi>Who would have imagined this would have befallen us, when no more Disturbance has been at Home?</hi> When this is effected, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> may undertake by Remonstrances, to complain of a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Infringement of Treaties.—</p>
            <p>I need not inform you, <hi>Sir,</hi> of our well concerted Plan, which is, to keep <hi>New-England, South-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to defend their own Territories, in order to prevent
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007225_0007_102B40328ED71E38"/>
their assisting the intervening Provinces, which will fall an easy Prey, as their Ports will be block'd up by our Ships, and those of his Catholic-Majesty's, who have also a sufficient Number to divert the <hi>English</hi> Squadrons, and keep them at Home; at which Time, with our numerous Indian Allies, we shall enter the <hi>English</hi> Provinces of <hi>New-York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, &amp;c.</hi> Our <hi>Indian</hi> Allies Eastward, are to attack the Eastward Settlements; and his Catholic Majesty to transport a Number of Regulars from the <hi>Havanna,</hi> who are to attack <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> which will be added to his other Dominions of <hi>New-Spain;</hi> and his most Christian Majesty to possess all the Land from <hi>South-Carolina</hi> to <hi>Newfoundland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not caution you, <hi>Sir,</hi> to conceal the Contents of this Letter, which you must be sensible should remain an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Secret, lest the <hi>English</hi> should discover the Measures we have concerted: And while they are amusing themselves with idle Disputes and Debates, and one Province contending, and promoting Jealousies, and raising groundless Suspicions of each other, without making any Preparations for Defence, let u unite as one Body, as loyal Subjects and good Catholics, then shall we accomplish our glorious Undertaking, and sing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and celebrate Mass in those Places which have been long defil'd by the Breath of <hi>Heretics.</hi>
