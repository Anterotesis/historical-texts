         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE ſubſtance of the following pages is chiefly drawn from thoſe excellent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Home, Cullen, and M'Bride; whoſe names alone are a ſufficient recommendation: They were compiled at the requeſt of our friend Mr. Aſbury.</p>
                  <p>The work contains a good deſcription of each diſorder, and its remote cauſes, as far as known The proximate cauſe is generally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, being unintelligible to thoſe who are not acquainted with medicine, of little uſe, and much diſputed by phyſicians. The cure is as ſimple as poſſible, ſo as not to interfere with efficacy: few medicines being recommended, and no compounds where they could be omitted. To this is prefixed the management of the ſick, about which the attendants are uſually much at a loſs.</p>
                  <p>Such medicines as are frequently uſed are put at the end, numbered and referred to, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents frequent repetition, but thoſe that are not ſo general are inſerted in the reading. Will not this be much more agreeable to the reader, than a general reference or a general inſertion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:029891_0003_0FE2C3BC3759B168"/>A few diſorders are omitted, becauſe they are not proper to this country, or becauſe they are unmanageable even in the hands of phyſicians, or for other as good reaſons: otherwiſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends as many diſorders as Dr. Cullen has treated on.</p>
                  <p>It is recommended to the Methodiſt Society in particular, by the author, their Friend.</p>

                     <p>FEVERS admit of a two-fold diſtinction: firſt, with reſpect to their duration; as into continued, Remittent and Intermittent Fevers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Continued fevers</hi> go on to their end, without any very obvious change for better or worſe, in a period of twenty-four hours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Remittent fevers,</hi> either obviouſly abate at ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod or periods during twenty-four hours, or are like a number of ſhort continued fevers linked together, abating once in the courſe of two or three or more days.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Intermittents</hi> go perfectly off every day and return the next, which is called a Quotidian; or every other day, leaving an intermediate well day, called Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; or every fourth day incluſive, leaving two well days, called Quartans. In this manner they go and come till they change, or finiſh their courſe.</p>

INFLAMMATORY FEVER.</head>
                     <p>THIS fever moſt frequently attacks the young in the vigour of their life; ſuch as are of a ruſtic ſanguine athletic conſtitution, who indulge themſelves in living freely: though ſufficient cauſes will bring it on in ſome degree, in almoſt any conſtitution and way of living. It attacks at all ſeaſons, but moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſpring and beginning of ſummer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes.</hi> Heat and cold alternately, or variouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, fatigue, anger, immoderate uſe of ſpirituous liquors, watching, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It diſcovers itſelf by a laſſitude, with a dull ſenſation of the body, debility, alternating chills and heats, tremors, pains throughout the whole body, but more particularly about the ſhoulders, back, knees and head. Theſe are ſucceeded by an intenſe and burning heat, an inextinguiſhable thirſt, inflamed eyes, tumefaction or fulneſs of the face, ſickneſs and vomiting, inquietude, anxiety, full and ſtrong pulſe, dry ſkin, red (though ſometimes watery) urine; rough, dry, yellow, or dark coloured tongue, covered with a cruſt; difficult breathing, coſtiveneſs, cough, watching, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, ſtupor; and if the fever is not checked, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029891_0006_0FE2C3CDA44E9610"/>or conſtant tendency to ſleep, tremors, partial convulſions as of the hands, &amp;c. hiccough, involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcharges of the belly and bladder take place and cloſe the ſcene in death. This is a deſcription of it in its moſt violent degree. In the greateſt number of caſes, we meet with it far more moderate; a ſtrong pulſe, ſick ſtomach and thirſt being the chief ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be confined to his bed, in a cool, dark and ſilent room; the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be regulated by the ſeaſon. He ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all kinds of meats and ſtrong drinks. For food; panada, barley, jellies, light unſeaſoned puddings and pies, may be given in ſmall quantity. For drink; lemonade, vinegar and water, barley water, herb teas with lemon juice, apple water, tamarind water or jelly and water, may be given largely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> If the fever be violent, and the patient as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the firſt paragraph of the caſe, from half to two thirds of a pint of blood ſhould be taken away (according to the age and cuſtoms of the patient) as quick as poſſible; which may be repeated the next day in leſſer quantity, if the fever has not abated. After the firſt bleeding let him take one ounce of Glauber ſalts, which will frequently exclude the neceſſity of another bleeding. After this the bowels ſhould be opened daily if required, by a common clyſter. if after one bleeding and a doſe of ſalts, the fever does not go off, which it ſeldom does, let the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent have one of the powders No. 1. every two hours, provided they will remain on his ſtomach: but if they will not, give the ſaline mixture No. 2. two table-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls every two hours; and after this has been given ſome time, if the patient's ſkin become ſoft and moiſt, it ſhould be continued in, otherwiſe lay it aſide and try the powders again. If theſe when given for a day or two do not leſſen the fever, or if they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and the ſaline mixture is ineffectual, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> bleeding has been practiſed as far as prudent; it will then be neceſſary to put a bliſter to the back of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029891_0007_0FE2C3D41E097FB8"/>neck, and to ſoak the patient's feet in lukewarm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for an hour if he can bear it; after this try the powders, or the mixture again, and they will then have their only chance, and in many caſes will be effectual.</p>
                     <p>In the ſlighter caſes of this fever, ſuch as I have ſaid, we moſt commonly meet with. If the patient will allow of it, one bleeding will be proper, after which or in ſuch as will not allow bleeding, give a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ke; two grains of tartar emetic divided into three doſes and taken in half an hour, or fifteen grains of ipecacuana, or half a table-ſpoonful of antimonial wine will anſwer; after which give the powders or the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and open the bowels with a doſe of ſalts. After the fever has gone off, which uſually is attended with a ſweat, if the patient is much reduced, let him take a tea-ſpoonful of bark in port wine, or in water eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry three hours till he has taken an ounce, after which he may take one or two more at longer intervals.

NERVOUS FEVER.</head>
                     <p>THOSE of relaxed fibres and weak nervous ſyſtem, are the perſons moſt ſubject to this fever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes.</hi> Exceſſive evacuations, repeated ſalivations, immoderate venery, depreſſions of the mind from grief, watching and night ſtudy, humid ſtagnant air of ſubterraneous apartments, indigeſtible food, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as is unfit for nutrition; as of cold watery fruits and vegetables; thin cloathing, rainy ſeaſons, ſoft moiſt winter, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> This fever approaches with dejection of mind, loſs of appetite, oppreſſion, ſleepleſſneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary groans, repeated ſighs, fear, unuſual laſſitude after motion, and alternate ſucceſſions of cold and heat.</p>
                     <p>After ſome days a ſwimming or pain in the head comes on with ſick ſtomach and vomiting of inſipid phlegm, great weakneſs, moderate heat, inſenſibility to thirſt; frequent, weak, and ſometimes intermitting pulſe; a moiſt tongue, ſometimes red and at other times covered with a white or yellowiſh tough mucus; dry lips, oppreſſion about the breaſt and difficult breathing, pale watery or whey-like urine: a dull ſenſe of pains about the breaſt and head, dozing, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, redneſs and warmth of the face, whilſt the feet are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now nature being exhauſted by the diſorder, the tongue trembles, the extremities from a coldneſs become cold, the nails turn livid, ſight and hearing periſh, the delirium turns to a coma, the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lly and bladder are involuntarily evacuated, topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal convulſions come on, and death cloſes the ſcene, uſually before the fourteenth day. The ſymptoms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the evening.—The delirium is only a mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually; quite different from the delirium of the former fever: though in this there is generally a great inſenſibility, and towards the end a loſs of ſight and hearing, yet at times in the beginning there is a great and preternatural ſenſibility to light and noiſe: ſometimes an eruption like millet ſeed appears without any alteration for better or worſe. A continuance of this fever has brought on temporal idiotiſm, which vaniſhed with the debility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be confined to his bed in an airy darkened room, and kept a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>ably warm or cool, according to the ſeaſon. His room, bed and body clothes, face, hands and feet ſhould be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029891_0009_0FE2C3DFDA3F3D00"/>kept clean. His diet ſhould be light though nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and given frequently, rather than in large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities at once; it ſhould be mild: chicken water and broth, or beef tea may be given if the patient deſires it, and the effect proves it to be uſeful; but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtock of food ſhould conſiſt of the various prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mild, digeſtible, nouriſhing vegetables, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently well known to every houſe-keeper; thoſe ſhould be ſuited to the patient's appetite, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo as not to pall him with any one. Wine and water may be uſed from the beginning, though then it may only be given to allay the thirſt, and ſhould be made weak: five or ſix times a day a cup full may be given, even though the patient do not aſk for it; but as the ſtrength fails it ſhould be made ſtronger and ſtronger, and given in as large quantity as a perſon in health could take. When the wine has not the effect of increaſing the ſymptoms and rendering the pulſe too quick, it may be ſafely continued in.—Claret is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the beſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> A gentle vomit of 12 grains of ipecacuana in a little water may be given in the beginning, and may be repeated the next day. The bowels ſhould be opened with thirty grains of rhubarb, and coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs continually prevented by ſmall doſes of the ſame medicine. A bliſter ſhould be applied to the ſide early in the diſeaſe, and when it has drawn, the water let out, and the part dreſſed with a colewort leaf or a little Turner's cerate; after this another may be applied to the other ſide, or to the back of the neck, provided no bad ſymptoms follow the firſt, if they do, bliſters ſhould be laid aſide till a ſtate of inſenſibility comes on, when they ſhould be applied ſucceſſively, as long as they are attended with advantage. If the patient's ſkin be dry in the beginning, let him take three o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> four grains of James' powder, in thick ſyrup three or four times a day, waſhing it down with ſnake-root tea; yet not ſo as to ſweat the patient. If the James' powder is not to be had, one-eighth of a grain of tartar emetic may be uſed in its ſtead. When the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029891_0010_0FE2C3E554400560"/>increaſes, let the patient begin and take two table-ſpoonfuls of the decoction of bark No. 3. every hour or two, putting a little mint water with it, and when the patient has taken this ſome time, let him take the bark in ſubſtance with wine: one tea-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of bark in two table-ſpoonfuls of old claret every two or three hours: this or No. 4. ſhould be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in till the patient perfectly recovers.</p>
                     <p>When the patient has been much haraſſed for want of ſleep, have his feet bathed at evening in tepid water, and give him ten or fifteen drops of laudanum. This practice may be continued as long as it proves effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in procuring ſleep. In thoſe caſes that proceed from exceſſive evacuations there is little hope and ſcarce any thing ſhould be attempted, but the ſtrengthening plan.</p>
                     <p>The patient ſhould carefully ſhun all the cauſes, and uſe a generous diet with regular varied exerciſe of body and mind, and be ſparing of his ſtrength.</p>

The urine, on the increaſe of the diſorder, becomes blackiſh or red with a ſediment: The ſweats become foetid, the ſtools lived, black or bloody, and very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> this he ſhould drink more and more of, as he becomes more debilitated, ſo as to make it his drink and medicine: a quart a-day may be uſed; this he ſhould continue in for ſome time after he has recovered, though in ſmaller doſes: A freſh air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day, after recovery, will be highly uſeful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> An emetic of eight grains of ipecacuana and one of tartar emetic, or half a table-ſpoonful of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029891_0012_0FE2C3F173AF4320"/>wine, ſhould be given as quick as poſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, twenty-five or thirty grains of rhubarb, or two drachms of cream of tartar, ſhould be given in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle jelly, to open the bowels, after which the decoction of bark No. 3. ſhould be given: two table-ſpoonfuls with a little mint water, every hour; if the ſtomach bears this well, and the ſymptoms of putrefaction and debility increaſe, the bark in ſubſtance ſhould be uſed: a tea-ſpoonful in lemon juice and mint water every hour. But if the ſtomach does not bear the bark, or if the heat and fever be conſiderable, apply a bliſter to the breaſt, and give a doſe of the ſaline mixture or one of the following pills between the times of taking the bark, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>If the ſtomach ſtill refuſes the bark in the above ways, try it in triple quantities in clyſters, or try the vinous tincture, No. 4. The bark is the only chance, we are therefore to perſiſt in its uſe till a cure is made.

                     <p>Clyſters of ſalt, ſugar, and decoction of bitter herbs are to be uſed to keep the bowels regular, or ſome of the gentle purges mentioned above; but it will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beſt to uſe firſt one and then the other, according to circumſtances. In caſe this fever ſhould be of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent form, the remiſſions ſhould be greatly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and a double quantity of bark given if poſſible. Sometimes a lax with diſtenſion of the belly comes on after a while, in ſuch a caſe the belly ſhould be foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bitter herbs, boiled and applied warm, and one grain of ipecacuana, with five drops of laudanum, given every two hours.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes ſpots break out in this fever, then it has been termed the Spotted Fever; at other times there is a yellowneſs of the ſkin, then it is termed the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029891_0013_0FE2C3FA62C11070"/>yellow or Weſt India fever. In this laſt caſe the ſymptoms of putridity are in this country more lenient, and a conſiderable vomiting ſometimes hinders the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of medicine: in this caſe a bliſter to the breaſt and the efferveſcing ſaline mixture have been found effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to ſtop the vomiting; but in general the treatment is the ſame as recommended above.</p>
                     <p>In the end of theſe fevers, ſome phyſicians recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend bliſters to rouſe the patient: if they are applied, the ſkin ſhould not be pealed off as is ſometimes done, but only opened to diſcharge the water, and then dreſſed with Turner's cerate.

Thus there is no difference in the real cauſes of this fever and intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, except in the degree and mode of their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Alternating cold and heat, followed by a continued heat and a fever: Sometimes a delirium comes on at the firſt attack.</p>
                     <p>The patient is diſtreſſed with thirſt and vomiting, uſually of bile; pain of the head, back and joints; the region of the ſtomach ſwells, and becomes painful; the tongue is white and moiſt, and the patient is harraſſed with ſleepleſſneſs; the ſkin and eyes are of a yellow caſt; the pulſe is ſometimes a little hard, and ſeldom full; the bowels are ſometimes bound, ſometimes looſe: with theſe ſymptoms the fever uſually proceeds, for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 days, at one of which times, after a little ſweat it remits, and the patient becomes evidently better. After a few hours have elapſed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the evening, the acceſſion comes on, ſometimes with, at other times without a chill, and ſo goes on as
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029891_0014_0FE2C3FF03D6AE68"/>before: In this manner, that is, by acceſſions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, the fever goes on to its final period.</p>
                     <p>A copious ſweat or diſcharge of blood from the noſe, or an univerſal yellowneſs, commonly attend the concluſion of it.</p>
                     <p>After the fever has gone off, a great lightneſs of the head attends, ſo that the patient can ſcarce walk; rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic pains, and dropſical ſwellings ſometimes follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept cool and airy; he ſhould have plenty of acid drinks, as lemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade, jelly, tamarind water, and for food, he ſhould have toaſted bread moiſtened with a little tea, baked fruits, rice, ſago, barley, &amp;c. but theſe, though proper, will ſeldom have a place, as the patient can ſcarce ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on his ſtomach what his little appetite inclines him to take: but the toaſt has often been found to ſtay, when nothing elſe would.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> If the vomiting be conſiderable, a little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile tea may be given to promote it a moment or two, that a remiſſion may be procured to give the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line mixture No. 2. one table-ſpoonful every hour. When this ſits on the ſtomach pretty well, ten drops of antimonial wine and a little mint water may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to each doſe, and the medicine continued: but if the vomiting is only ſlight, the beſt way to procure a remiſſion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ymptoms will be to give an emetic, one tea-ſpoonful of antimonial wine, may be given eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ten minutes until it operates, or 12 grains of ipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacuana may be given at once, after which the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be given in the manner directed with antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial wine.</p>
                     <p>If the vomiting reſiſts every thing given, or if a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion does not take place in a few days, bliſters ſhould be uſed; on the breaſt in the firſt caſe, on the back of the neck in the laſt. Sometimes a bundle of mint ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in wine, and applied to the breaſt, has been found uſeful in checking the vomiting, therefore it may be tried before a bliſter.</p>
                     <p>Coſtiveneſs ſhould be regularly obviated by taking a tea-ſpoonful or more of cream of tartar, or by uſing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029891_0015_0FE2C405B13FC5D8"/>the common clyſters of ſalts, ſugar and milk occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally.</p>
                     <p>When the patient has ſuffered for want of ſleep, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giving a clyſter, and bathing the feet in lukewarm water for half an hour, ten or fifteen drops of lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num may be given in a doſe of the ſaline mixture No. 2. and this ſhould be done after noon before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the fever, for it uſually makes ſome increaſe towards night.</p>
                     <p>When the fever remits, the decoction of bark ſhould be given, two table-ſpoonfuls every hour, and if the acceſſion is poſtponed by it, the bark in ſubſtance ſhould be given, as long as the acceſſion is abſent: in ſome caſes it will put it off altogether; then, as well as when the fever ceaſes, the bark ſhould be given in large quantities, until the patient recovers his ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>When a lax attends, four grains of rhubarb and one of ipecacuana with two drops of laudanum, may be given every three or four hours inſtead of the ſaline mixture.</p>
                     <p>When great ſweats attend in the end, it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to add five drops of elixir of vitriol to each or every other doſe of bark: in caſe a headach follows, apply a ſmall bliſter behind the ear, and repeat it if neceſſary. The patient ſhould be very careful in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſes of this fever, or he will experience a relapſe.</p>

INTERMITTENT FEVER (COMMONLY) FEVER AND AGUE.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSE.</hi> The relaxing heat of ſummer, eſpecially when accompanied with moiſture and bad air of marſhy places, will ſo relax the ſurface and expoſe the extreme veſſels to the air, that nothing more than the uſual effect of common air is neceſſary to bring on the fever; at other times, when the prediſpoſition is not ſo great, a cool air will produce it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:029891_0016_0FE2C40B0DF4B930"/>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> A languor with yawning and ſtretching, coldneſs, ſick ſtomach, rigors and tremors, uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the commencement; the cold with ſhivering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in a very conſiderable degree, for one, two or three hours, when it begins to give way, firſt to fluſhes, and then to a continual burning heat and fever, with a full pulſe and thirſt. Pain of the head and frequently of the joints, attended ſometimes with delirium. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this has continued for ſome time, a ſweat breaks out, which becomes profuſe, and this is ſucceeded by an intermiſſion of a part, a whole, or two days, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the type. See page 5. In the intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the patient is affected with ſcarce any thing but debility. The fever returns again in the end of the time mentioned, with the ſame ſymptoms, and ſo goes on to its end, unleſs it changes its form. Quotidians come on in the morning, and uſually attack the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and irritable. Tertians come on about noon, and uſually attack the more robuſt and vigorous. Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans come on in the afternoon, and moſt commonly attack the aged and torpid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> Sometimes the ague ſo reduces the patient, that it will be neceſſary to keep him warm and give a little wine; but this is ſeldom the caſe. In common nothing is neceſſary but to lie down. In time of the fever, lemonade and other acid drinks, or warm teas may be uſed; the former will be moſt grateful.</p>
                     <p>In the intermiſſions, port wine and water, and a ſtrengthening eaſy digeſted diet will be proper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In the beginning of the cold ſtage, if the patient is able to puke, he ſhould take one; three grains of tartar emetic in a gill of water, may be taken in the courſe of forty minutes, if required to take all: or 15 grains of ipecacuana in a ſpoonful of water, or a tea-ſpoonful of antimonial wine every fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen minutes: either of theſe may be uſed; the tartar is the moſt active and effectual, but acts too rough with ſome. When this has been taken, and the fever
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029891_0017_0FE2C412ACC5A3B0"/>has come on, a ſweating ſhould be encouraged by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about three pints of warm drink in the courſe of two hours, to which one hundred drops of antimonial wine may be added, to make it more effectual. In caſe the patient cannot take a puke, let him take an Anderſon's pill to open his bowels before the time of the ague, and when the fever has come on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while, let him take fifteen drops of laudanum and fifteen of antimonial wine, in a cup of warm tea every half hour, for three times.</p>
                     <p>But when nothing forbids a puke but the perſon's inclination, he may take juſt before the fit, or after it is over ſome time, the following powder; twenty grains of rhubarb, and five of calomel in a little ſyrup, and when the fever comes on, take the warm drink as above.</p>
                     <p>Theſe medicines will prepare for the exhibition of bark, which ſhould be given immediately after the ſweat goes off. Any of the preparations may be given, but the powder is the beſt; it may be given in mint water, milk or wine; one tea-ſpoonful every hour, till the ague comes on again; then it ſhould be laid aſide till this is over, when it is to be given again; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhould not ceaſe under an ounce and an half, or two ounces. If, when this has been taken, the ague does not ceaſe, another puke ſhould be uſed as before In all caſes the bowels ſhould be kept open by Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's pills or rhubarb.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes twenty drops of laudanum given before the ague, will put it off, and ſometimes giving it juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the patient is expected to ſweat, will prepare for the bark; ſometimes a quantity of ſnake-root tea at the ſame time will prove effectual: and in many caſes bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of horehound, dogwood, rue, &amp;c. will do as well as bark.</p>
                     <p>The fever and ague, after it has continued for ſome time, is apt to aſſociate cuſtom with its cauſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence; and thus it will frequently continue through ſuch ſeaſons as it would not have begun in. In ſuch caſes as theſe almoſt any alteration in the ſyſtem will leſſen or remove it; thus keeping the patient under
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029891_0018_0FE2C417628AAE90"/>expectation; fear or joy have often removed it; and thus the impoſitions of old women have often been effectual, when the faith of her patient has rouſed his expectation and fixed his attention. Though ſuch things may at times be allowed, yet I would caution every prudent perſon to keep his ſkin to himſelf, and not let ignorant quacks fill up their lack of knowledge upon him, with the virulence of an arſenical plaſter, or a more dangerous bolus.</p>

HECTIC FEVER.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Violent racks of the conſtitution from any cauſe, abſorption of matter from ulcers, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive relaxation, and delicacy of any part that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to irritation, as the lungs, ſtomach and bowels; all theſe cauſes are attended with general debility, and particular relaxation of the parts that defend the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der extreme veſſels, from the irritations which act about them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> The fever uſually comes on in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, ſometimes with conſiderable chills or coldneſs, which laſt ſome time; this is ſucceeded by heat, a quick, ſmall and weak pulſe in general, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is ſome hardneſs in it, eſpecially in thoſe who are not much reduced, and early in the complaint; this ſometimes leſſens towards evening, and again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes at night; at other times it continues on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any very obvious change till towards morning, when it intermits or greatly remits with a profuſe ſwet which laſts a conſiderable time; the ſweats do not appear in the firſt ſtage, that is, in profuſion. A headach uſually attends the fever, as alſo a ſick ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, both of which grow better in the intermiſſion or remiſſion.</p>
                     <p>The tongue is uſually clean in this fever, the belly at firſt is often bound, but in the end a lax almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029891_0019_0FE2A1B09D978408"/>attends. The patient waſtes away gradually, his feet ſwell, particularly at night, his hair falls off, his nails become crooked and thick, his face ſharp, and a general failing takes place in every thing but his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of getting better, and his underſtanding, which uſually remain to the laſt.</p>
                     <p>This is the moſt uſual form, but there is ſome variety, owing to the variety of the parts affected, and the ſtate of the patient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould have the lighteſt and moſt nouriſhing food given him in ſmall quantities at a time, and at ſuch times chiefly as the fever is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or ſlight, thus his breakfaſt or dinner at ten o'clock, ſhould contain moſt of what he ſhould eat. Milk is very proper when the ſtomach will receive it: ſometimes it may be moſt agreeable when diluted with water and ſweetened, at other times it may ſit better when boiled. Cuſtards, light puddings, chicken wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and broth, beef tea, rye muſh, corn muſh, with the common vegetables of the grain kind, are moſtly proper. Weak wine and water in the abſence of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; barley water and ſage tea at other times, will be proper for drink. The patient ſhould be kept clean, and when his ſtrength admits, he ſhould be aired in a chair, and at all times have acceſs to pure air.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In many caſes it will be needleſs to attempt any thing but a removal of the cauſe, when the fever will quickly ceaſe: but in general both the one and the other are to be combated. For treating the cauſes I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the places where they are treated of (though ſome of them could not have a place in this book, as they belong to ſurgery) for the treatment of the fever alone, the debility ſhould be removed and the fever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted: for the firſt, when nothing forbids, bitters and bark are neceſſary; alſo elixir of vitriol, which may be given to ſixty drops a day. Theſe are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whilſt the fever is off, or when it has greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, juſt before the time when the return is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and again after it has commenced, one of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing powders may be given: ipecacuana two grains,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029891_0020_0FE2C424E5A90D60"/>magneſia one tea-ſpoonful, mix them and give it in a little camomile tea. When a lax comes on there is little hope, but the following may be given: colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo root one drachm, pour one gill of boiling water upon it, and in a quarter of an hour ſtrain it off; to this twenty drops of laudanum may be added; this may be uſed in the courſe of eight hours, and repeated.— Rice will now be the beſt food.</p>

INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Theſe act either externally or internally, though frequently both take place in producing the affection.</p>
                     <p>The externals are, violence, duſt, cold winds, changes from heat to cold, viewing minute objects or bright bodies; metallic fumes, great heat, eſpecially when accompanied with moiſture; night reading, &amp;c. The internal cauſes are, checked excretions, as the menſes, &amp;c. repulſion of ſome eruptive diſorders, long continued ulcers dried up, immoderate uſe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors and ſpices, fevers, meaſles, ſcrophula, venereal diſeaſe, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Redneſs, ſwelling, ſtiffneſs and pain of the ball of the eye or the lids; both from an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the veſſels that paſs over and through them, being filled with too much blood, or with red blood, inſtead of the fine white parts of it.</p>
                     <p>When the inflammation is conſiderable, a fever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; and in ſuch caſes there is danger of the effects, unleſs ſpeedily prevented by curing the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> In no caſe a cure can be hoped for unleſs the cauſes be removed, which in many caſes will be followed with an immediate cure. In any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be lodged in the eye, it is to be extracted, and if another diſeaſe be the cauſe, it muſt be cured by the means directed for ſuch diſeaſe. In every caſe the patient ſhould avoid exerciſing his eyes any more than
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029891_0021_0FE2C42BEB303A88"/>what there is neceſſity for:—He ſhould confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a dark room, or apply a fold of green ſilk over his eyes, and uſe an umbrella in the ſummer. His food ſhould be light and moſtly vegetable, in all caſes without pepper or muſtard. His drink ſhould be cooling and acid, without any mixture of ſpirit. His room ſhould be cooled with ſprinkling in the ſummer time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> If there be a fever, or if the inflammation be conſiderable, and the patient able to bear bleeding, he ſhould loſe half a pint of blood, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated if neceſſary; this ſhould be followed by a doſe of ſalts, or if the patient's caſe does not require bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or other circumſtances prevent it, the ſalts then ſhould be the firſt thing. All this is to be done after the cauſe is removed, and thus in many caſes where removing the cauſe will be the chief means of cure, they will have no place; as where the inflammation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the venereal diſeaſe, ſcrophula, &amp;c. One of the fever powders No. 1. when the fever continues, or the inflammation remains obſtinate, given every four hours, will be ſerviceable. The belly ſhould be kept regular by cream of tartar or ſmall doſes of ſalts, or of jalap and nitre: as jalap fifteen grains, nitre twenty-five, mix them.—For external applications, a bliſter behind the ears is moſt effectual, and to the eyes the following: ſugar of lead twelve grains to half a pint of water, or as much white vitriol to an equal quantity of water: to either of which, when the inflammation has continued, and the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies have been uſed, may be added a table-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of brandy.</p>
                     <p>Theſe external applications (the bliſter excepted) will be proper in every caſe and time. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that follows requires that the patient uſe either a general or topical cold bath, and avoid much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and expoſure.</p>

A doſe of ſalts ſhould be given after the firſt bleeding, and it may be neceſſary to repeat this the next day. Clyſters may be given daily, ſuch as No. 5. one of the fever powders No 1. may be given every three hours, beginning after the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt doſe of the ſalts.

QUINCY.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> The application of cold to the neck or throat, a ſtream of cool air applied with force to the very part; as in riding and running: theſe cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their effect more certainly when preceded by heat.</p>
                     <p>Exerciſing the parts that ſuffer, as in ſinging, and loud ſpeaking; acrids, mechanic bodies, ſuppreſſed evacuations, or artificial evacuations, that have been long uſed, neglected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> This complaint uſually appears with red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſwelling of the glands ſituated on each ſide of the palate; one is uſually moſt ſwelled in the beginning, and as this declines, the other increaſes; a pain that ſhoots towards the ear attends, with feveriſh ſymptoms, and a ſtrong, full, quick pulſe: The patient feels a diſagreeable clammineſs, and the tumour is uſually tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with whitiſh mucus.</p>
                     <p>In ſome caſes the external parts are much ſwelled; ſometimes ſcarce any tumour is to be perceived by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the mouth, and at the ſame time the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſwallowing and pain may be very conſiderable: In the worſt caſes the breathing becomes very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, the tumours cloſing up the paſſage almoſt entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then the patient ſits with his mouth open, his drink regurgitates through his noſtrils, and he is ready to ſtrangle every minute for want of a free reſpiration, which is totally impeded when the patient dies.</p>
                     <p>What is uſually termed a ſore throat, is a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this ſame affection, therefore the ſame reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be uſed, omitting the moſt general and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful one of bleeding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept neither hot nor cold: he ſhould have a light vegetable diet of a fluid preparation; his drink ſhould be of the acid kind, and not cold or warm, but juſt aired. His head ſhould be kept up in bed, or he may ſit up altogether;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029891_0025_0FE2C4454A8EF508"/>ſpeaking, and every exertion of the throat, ſhould be avoided, and the cauſes ſhould be removed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> The patient ſhould be bled pretty freely, and this may be repeated the next day if neceſſary: he ſhould take a doſe of ſalts as ſoon as poſſible, and then a bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be applied under the throat, of a ſlim form, ſo that it may reach from ear to ear: the bowels ſhould be regularly kept open: before the tumour has become very conſiderable, fifteen grains of ipecacuana will be of great ſervice. In ſuch patients as do not allow of bleeding, this may be the firſt medicine.</p>
                     <p>Warm water and vinegar ſhould be inſpired from a proper machine for the purpoſe, or from a funnel put over a wooden bowl of water and vinegar, the mouth ſhould be frequently gargled with aſtringent waſhes, as ſage tea and vinegar; or alum-vinegar and honey, or decoction of oak bark and ſalt petre. Scarifications with a lancet are neceſſary where there is danger of choaking; and likewiſe to let out the matter, when the tumours have ſuppurated.</p>
                     <p>If the patient is liable to frequent returns of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I would adviſe him to uſe the cold bath daily; at any rate to waſh his neck, and habituate himſelf to wear nothing but a very thin ſtock or ribband, inſtead of a large neckcloth.</p>

PUTRID SORE THROAT.</head>
                     <p>THIS diſorder has for its <hi>cauſe,</hi> ſpecific contagion, and therefore attacks all ages and conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It begins with chills, which are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an intenſe and burning heat, a ſwimming and pain of the head, a troubleſome ſenſation in the throat, ſickneſs and vomiting, looſeneſs, inflamed and watery eyes, tumid and fluſhed face, with a ſtiffneſs of the neck, a ſmall, frequent and irregular pulſe, foetid breath and a diſagreeable taſte. Very ſoon, white ſpots appear on the glands each ſide of the palate, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029891_0026_0FE2C449E709BE70"/>theſe with the palate appear red, ſwoln and gloſſy: theſe ſpots ſpread and unite, covering almoſt all of the mouth with thick ſloughs, which falling off, leave ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in their places: the redneſs and tumour are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extended to the internal parts of the noſe.</p>
                     <p>On the ſecond day, or later, effloreſcences appear on the ſkin, which are ſometimes in ſuch ſmall emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences as ſcarcely to be ſeen, but more uſually ſpread in red patches, ſo as to cover the whole ſkin; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt about the face and neck, and ſo extending to the extremities, which feel ſtiff and ſwelled; this uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally continues about four days, and then goes off with a peeling of the ſkin. The glands about the neck are ſometimes ſwelled to an alarming degree. As the complaint advances, diſcharges of blood from different parts are frequent, and ſometimes a gangrene takes place at the beginning of the windpipe or of the oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus, the channel which leads to the ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>The patient's voice is hoarſe and flat, though his ſwallowing is not uſually much impeded; with theſe ſymptoms it runs on from two to ſeven or more days, increaſing every evening.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> For food, drinks, and general manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſame may be uſed as directed for the putrid fever, only a leſs degree of cold will be requiſite in this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> Ten grains of ipecacuana ſhould be given early in the complaint; three grains of calomel in a little honey, may be given once or twice the evenings after the puke, and if the firſt doſe produces more than two ſtools, it ſhould be checked by giving ten drops of Laudanum. This medicine will often prove very efficacious, without producing any diſcharge. Some of the preparations of bark, or the powder, which is beſt, ſhould be given every two hours after the puke, and to the end of the complaint. The throat ſhould be frequently waſhed with the following: one hundred drops of elixir of vitriol or twenty drops of oil of vitriol to half a pint of water, and one ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of honey. Spring water coloured with indigo has been found uſeful as a gargle. Port wine ſhould be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029891_0027_0FE2C4503B7C7C30"/>given to a pint, or quart a day, with the bark. If the tumour in the inſide of the throat be conſiderable, a bliſter ſhould be laid on the outſide.</p>
                     <p>For the ſwelling of the legs which ſometimes follows, the patient may uſe eight drops of elixir of vitriol with each doſe of bark, four times a day.</p>

CROUP OR HIVES.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Foregoing diſorders, as the meaſles and the hooping cough: cold moiſt air from the water.</p>
                     <p>It moſt frequently happens to ſuch as live in ſeaport towns; and to children, from the time they are wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their twelfth year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It ſometimes comes on with the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a common cold only; but the peculiar ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are a hoarſeneſs, and ringing ſound of the voice; at the ſame time there is an uneaſineſs, or pain in the throat, and a whizzing noiſe in breathing, as if the paſſage was too much ſtraitened for the air; the patient has a cough that is either dry, or accompanied with the diſcharge of flakes of phlegm, like a membrane; the pulſe is quickened, and an uneaſy ſenſe of heat at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. By looking into the throat, a redneſs and flakes of phlegm like thoſe diſcharged, may ſometimes be perceived. It has happened that the patient has been taken off without ſcarce any complaining, in three, four, or five days.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould not be kept cold, nor diſagreeably warm, he ſhould have a ſpare thin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable diet, with light acid, or bitter drinks, as teas of various herbs. In time of coughing, he ſhould be raiſed and aſſiſted, to keep him from ſtrangling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> The patient ſhould take a puke as quick as poſſible. (If he is twelve years old, ten grains of ipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacuana, and half a grain of tartar emetic will not be too much, for there is a great degree of inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the ſtomach in this complaint; if he is only
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029891_0028_0FE2C456F5B9A598"/>four years old, let him have half as much, or one tea-ſpoonful of antimonial wine, to be repeated every quarter of an hour, till it operates.) After taking the puke, he ſhould take four grains (if twelve years) of calomel, and ten of jalap, the evening of the ſame day; after this for three or four days, he ſhould take one day the puke, and the next the purge; after the firſt puke and purge, a bliſter ſhould be laid on the back of the neck. Throughout the complaint, the ſteams of warm vinegar, or of water in which there is a large lump of lime ſlacking (which is ſuppoſed to be a ſolvent) may be drawn into the throat; warm teas, and ſoaking the feet, may be uſed to reſtore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration to the ſurface.</p>

THE MUMPS.</head>
                     <p>CONTAGION is the cauſe of this complaint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It makes its appearance with the uſual febrile ſymptoms, of chills ſucceeding heat, and quickened pulſe; this is ſhortly followed by a ſwelling, at the corner of the lower jaw, of a movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glandular nature; in a little time it diffuſes itſelf over the whole neck; ſometimes both ſides are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It continues increaſing till about the fourth day, and then declines with the fever. As the ſwelling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, ſome tumour is apt to take place in the teſtes of males, and in the breaſts of women. Sometimes when this has not taken place, or when it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by imprudent applications, the fever has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, or increaſed with delirium.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept upon a low vegetable diet, and not expoſe himſelf to cold. The above in general will be ſufficient, but when the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance mentioned takes place, it will be neceſſary to direct ſomething more than the above for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029891_0029_0FE2C45DAEAD43B8"/>fever and delirium be conſiderable, the patient ſhould be bled if he be able to bear bleeding; otherwiſe a puke ſhould be the only evacuant, viz. fifteen grains of ipecacuana, more or leſs, according to the patient's age. Beſides this or theſe, it may be neceſſary to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a bliſter to the back of the neck. In ſlighter caſes the puke and fomentations will be ſufficient. In all caſes, coſtiveneſs ſhould be prevented by clyſters, caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor oil, or ſalts.</p>

PLEURISY OR INFLAMMATION OF THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE BREAST.</head>
                     <p>THE end of winter, ſpring and beginning of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are the uſual times that this diſeaſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent; all ages and moſt conſtitutions are liable to it, but the phlethoric, and thoſe of a ruſtic conſtitution, who have ſeen twenty years, and not exceeded ſixty, are moſt liable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes.</hi> Cold and heat applied alternately, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally, ſtraining or injuring of the parts, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It uſually begins with chills, which are followed by heat, quick, ſtrong and full pulſe, head-ach, difficult breathing, dry cough at the beginning, though ſometimes it begins moiſt: towards the end, or after it has continued, it is always moiſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a very conſiderable quantity of yellow mucus is diſcharged: this is not unfrequently ſtreaked with blood. Moſt frequently, a pungent pain attacks the ſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> about the middle of the ſixth or ſeventh rib, but if the pain ſhould attack any other part of the cheſt, and ſhould not be ſo violent, yet accompanied with the other ſymptoms, particularly the full, ſtrong and quick pulſe, we are to conſider the complaint as the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> This ſhould be identically the ſame with what is directed in Chap. II. only with addition of mucilaginous and ſyrup drinks to allay the cough; as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029891_0030_0FE2C46256A881B0"/>of flaxſeed, and mallow tea with honey: a little lemon juice will make it very agreeable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> From half to two thirds of a pint, or more of blood, ſhould be taken away on the firſt appearance, and if the ſymptoms continue, it may be repeated in eight hours. After the firſt bleeding, a doſe of ſalts ſhould be given, and ſmall doſes of the ſame, or common clyſters may be given regularly to prevent coſtiveneſs. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the patient's firſt bleeding, a bliſter ſhould be applied as near as poſſible to the pained part, and one of the fever powders, No. 1. given every hour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning after the operation of the ſalts is over. If after the bliſter has drawn, the pulſe continues up, and the pain has not conſiderably abated, the ſecond bleeding ſhould be immediately made, and if in half an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the pain does not give way, a ſecond bliſter ſhould be applied on a freſh part, or on the oppoſite ſide. The powders ſhould be continued every two hours. But in general, one bleeding, a bliſter, the powders, and keeping an open belly, will be ſufficient. Nothing but a relaxation of the pain and fever, ſhould induce the patient to omit any of the above remedies, for life and death are pretty certainly fixed to the narrow compaſs of a few days. If the pulſe is ſtrong, and bleeding has been omitted as long as ſix or ſeven days, it would be then better done than let alone; but if the pulſe flags, and the patient has had a frequent ſhivering about the laſt days, it will then be better, if not the very ſafety, of the patient, to forbear. At ſuch a time a bliſter might be applied without any injury, but if a ſuppuration has taken place, it will be of no ſervice; however thoſe who are not proper judges, had better make the application, leſt there might have been an inſufficient inflammation for to ſuppurate in that time; and with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

BASTARD OR SPURIOUS PLEURISY.</head>
                     <p>THIS uſually attacks the aged, thoſe of a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic full habit, who have injured their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by exceſs of drinking, particularly, and are liable to the viciſſitudes of the weather, from being much expoſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The long application of cold, ſuddenly ſucceeded by heat, and heating drinks; this, with the prediſpoſition laid down above, is the chief, if not the only cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It makes its appearance with chills and fluſhes, which are followed by a ſlight fever, with a ſoft, not very frequent pulſe. The heat of the patient is not uſually much increaſed; a pain affects the ſide, or breaſt, which is not very pungent, but rather dull and extending; a violent pain in the head, ſick ſtomach and ſometimes vomiting, are more or leſs preſent. From the beginning, it is common for a cough, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened breathing, and ſpitting of tough mucus to attend. An eryſipelatous redneſs often appears on the cheeks, and a looſeneſs attends the advanced ſtage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. The patient is apt to be heavy and drowſy; thus though there be a pain in the ſide, and a fever, it is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from a true inflammatory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept tolerably warm, his diet ſhould be light and nouriſhing, and in the beginning, if the feveriſh ſymptoms are not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, he may have weak wine and water for his drink; in the end it will always be proper, for the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029891_0032_0FE2C46F7730DC48"/>patient frequently becomes fainty, and is not able to take any thing beſides. Lemonade may be uſed, when wine and water cannot be given for the fever; and when lemons cannot be got, vinegar and water, or cyder and water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> Bleeding though it may ſometimes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as when the patient is of a more robuſt habit, and better conſtitution than what is deſcribed above, and when he has been accuſtomed to bleeding, and withal the pulſe and pain are not low; yet, it ſhould be uſed ſparingly and cautiouſly, otherwiſe, in ninety caſes out of one hundred, it would be injurious. In the beginning it will be proper to give ten or twelve grains of ipecacuana; or a tea-ſpoonful of antimonial wine, every fifteen minutes until it operates; a bliſter may be put on at the ſame time, as near as poſſible to the pain; the puke may be repeated once or twice if neceſſary, and ſometimes it will be neceſſary to lay on another bliſter cloſe by the former; twenty grains of jalap, or thirty grains of rheubarb, or a table-ſpoonful of caſtor oil, or four or five grains of calomel, may be uſed to remove any coſtiveneſs that is preſent: this ſhould be attended to throughout.</p>
                     <p>For the cough, two drachms of gum ammoniac, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by trituration in a mortar, with half a pint of water, may be given; one table-ſpoonful every hour: or an ounce of ſyrup (commonly called oxymel) of ſquills, in as much water, may be given in the ſame way.</p>
                     <p>Seneca ſnake root or pleuriſy root tea may be uſed, if they cannot be procured; to either of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines at night a dozen drops of laudanum may be added, in order to allay the cough, that the patient may reſt; and if the cough is very frequent in the day, a few drops may be taken every now and then.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end when the patient grows weak, he ſhould uſe about ſixty drops of elixir or vitriol a-day, and uſe a decoction of bark or ſome good bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

SPASMODIC STITCH, OR INTERCOSTAL RHEUMATISM.</head>
                     <p>THIS complaint is prevalent when the changes of weather are frequent, as in the ſpring and fall. It uſually attacks the young, thoſe under forty years, thoſe who are of a delicate, effeminate conſtitution, rather than thoſe of a broken ſtate of health.</p>
                     <p>Expoſure to cold, more particularly after heat and damp cloudy weather are the cauſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It begins with a lancinating pain, moſt frequently about the ribs of one ſide; this remits a while, and then returns again, ſo as almoſt to make the patient ſcream out. After a while it becomes fixed, and does not abate, though it is apt to extend, and even to change its place, ſo that the muſcles of the breaſt are frequently attacked, and there are pains in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts that point out a rheumatic affection: with the above a fever, ſometimes pretty ſmart, at other times leſs, attends. In moſt caſes the pulſe is not ſtrong, but eaſily ſtopped by preſſing it, to what it is in true pleuriſy. Frequently a cough attends, which is apt to increaſe towards the end of the other ſymptoms, at which time it is accompanied with ſpitting of yellow, tough mucus; ſome degee of coſtiveneſs uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and moſt of the ſymptoms are worſe at night.</p>
                     <p>The breathing is not in general affected ſo much as in pleuriſy, little or no cough attends; the head is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally much affected with pain, and as the pain of the ſide declines, the knees or back are ſometimes attacked, if not before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept on a vegetable, moderate diet.</p>
                     <p>His drink may be warm herb teas.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Cure.</hi> If the patient be pretty full of blood, and his pulſe tolerably ſtrong, it will then be prudent and uſeful to take away half a pint or more of blood. A bliſter ſhould be laid over the part, a doſe of caſtor oil, or of fifteen grains of jalap and as much cream of tartar, ſhould be given to open his bowels: if the pain continues, ſome proper ſweating medicine ſhould be given, as four grains of camphor beat up with honey into a bolus, to which two grains of ipecacuana may be added, this much ſhould be taken every three or four hours, waſhing it down with ſeneca ſnake root tea, or warm baum tea: or in the place of theſe a tea-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of paregoric and twenty drops of antimonial wine, may be taken every three hours; uſing plenty of warm tea in the intervals. This laſt mixture will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the cough, taken in the ſame quantity and times.</p>

INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> External violence, high ſeaſoned food, acrid medicine or poiſons; hard bodies ſwallowed, as of glaſs or ſtone; cold drink, when the body is heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; diſtenſion; from an over quantity of food that is of difficult digeſtion; inflammations of the adjacent parts extending to the ſtomach: beſides theſe cauſes, a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of affection in other diſorders are cauſes; as in the gout, ſmall pox, meaſles, St. Anthony's fire; but theſe require a treatment connected with the primary affection, which cannot be treated of here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> A violent, pungent, and ſometimes throbbing pain at the pit of the ſtomach, with burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and painful vomiting; a hiccough, anxiety and difficult breathing; great weakneſs; after taking any thing into the ſtomach, the pain increaſes, and it is diſcharged by vomiting; the pulſe is commonly ſmall, hard and quick.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:029891_0035_0FE2C480484CB1E0"/>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept from ſwallowing any thing but mild drinks, as barley wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, milk and water, &amp;c. he ſhould keep himſelf as ſtill as poſſible in a dark room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> If any thing that is acrid, or that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the ſtomach mechanically, has been taken in, it ſhould be evacuated as quick as poſſible, by taking plenty of warm water, and applying a feather to the throat, to induce immediate vomiting; but if the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is already conſiderable, it ſhould not be ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after vomiting; if the cauſe be ſome acrid, it ſhould be diluted with mucilaginous drinks, as gum arabic diſſolved in water; or oils may be given, as ſweet oil or almonds oil; at the ſame time it ſhould be counter-acted by a proper medicine. Thus if it be vitriol, or ſpirit of ſalt or aqua fortis, let the patient take a table-ſpoonful of ſalt of tartar, or if he can get none of that, let him get a piece of chalk and eat it. If it be arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, two tea-ſpoonfuls of precipitate ſulphur may be ſwallowed. After this, or where theſe have not been required from the nature of the cauſe, the patient ſhould loſe a pint of blood, and in caſe the pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, and the pulſe does not ſink and intermit, half as much more may be taken away in eight hours following; a bliſter after the firſt bleeding ſhould be applied to the left ſide, and clyſters of oil, ſugar, milk, and a little ſalt petre ſhould be injected every three hours: four grains of ſugar of lead in a little water may be given every two hours the firſt day: nothing but the medicine mentioned ſhould be applied by the mouth.</p>

ACUTE RHEUMATISM.</head>
                     <p>THIS attacks at all ſeaſons, but rarely at any other time than the ſpring and fall, when the viciſſitudes of weather are great.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes.</hi> Cold applied to the body, when unuſually warm, or cold applied partially to the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> A pain affects ſome of the joints, and ſometimes the muſcles, ſo as to extend from one joint to another. Sometimes almoſt every joint in the body is affected, and then the complaint comes on with chills, and fever, with a ſtrong pulſe, for the moſt part full. In ſome caſes, the fever precedes the pains, at other times, it is the contrary; the joints affected become red and ſwelled: the fever and pains uſually increaſe at night. If the general affection continues long the patient's ſenſes become ſomewhat impaired for a while.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept cool, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when under the operation of ſweating medicine, then he ſhould lie between blankets; he ſhould be kept from all but light vegetable food, and cool acid or warm herb drinks, which may be given plentifully; and when the complaint has gone off, he ſhould wear flannels till warm weather returns, and then uſe bathing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> The patient ſhould be inſtantly bled, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as his habit and age will bear, and his complaint demands; this may be repeated in ſmaller quantities, for once or twice in the courſe of four days, if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. After the firſt bleeding, a doſe of ſalts ſhould be given, and when that has done operating, one of the powders, No. 1. ſhould be given, every two ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>. If this does not anſwer, let him have twelve grains of Dover's powders (which may be had at the apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029891_0040_0FE2C49F53FE3D88"/>ſhops) for two or three nights, lying then between blankets. If any pain ſtill continues, it may be looked upon as verging to chronic rheumatiſm, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing may be given: one hundred drops of vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile tincture of guaiacum, in a little water, three times a-day.</p>
                     <p>In general nothing can be done that will be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as an outward application; however, a little Caſtile ſoap, diſſolved in water, may be uſed to ſatisfy.</p>
                     <p>In ſlighter caſes the bleeding may be omitted, and the ſalts with a common ſweat of ſeneca tea uſed.</p>

CHRONIC RHEUMATISM.</head>
                     <p>THE former diſeaſe is apt to terminate in this; eſpecially when the patient is advanced in years: Cold is the common cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> A pain of ſome of the joints, or about the junction of the bones, with a ſtiffneſs of the part. No redneſs or ſwelling like that from inflammation affects the part, though after a long continuance, an enlargement of the joints is apt to take place. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no fever attends here, heat leſſens the pain, and cold increaſes it; quite contrary to what takes place in the preceding complaint. When the pains fix about the ſmall of the back, the affection is termed a Lumbago; when about the hip, in which caſe the patient becomes ſomewhat lame, a Sciatica.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The part affected, if poſſible, ſhould be conſtantly wrapt in flannel, the patient ſhould uſe wine with any food he may chuſe, which will agree with his ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> Ninety drops of volatile tincture of guaiacum, ſhould be taken in a little water, four times a-day; if this does not anſwer, the following pills may be uſed till they produce ſome effect; twelve grains of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and twelve grains of opium, to be made into one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029891_0041_0FE2C4A71116CD38"/>pills, one to be taken morning and evening, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down with a large quantity of Virginia ſnake root, lignum vitae, or ſaſſafraſs tea. Beſides theſe, there are other common remedies, which are leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as a decoction of prickly aſh, muſtard whey, balſams, &amp;c. In what is called the ſciatica, twelve drops of ſpirit of turpentine, in a little honey, taken night and morning, is particularly effectual.</p>
                     <p>The external remedies in rheumatiſm, are ſpirits of camphor, ſpirits of hartſhorn and oil; oil and ſpirits of turpentine, electricity applied by inſolation, and drawing ſparks; the fleſh bruſh, cold water daſhed on. However, this laſt is more effectual in caſes that are between the inflammatory and chronic, where one joint is chiefly affected.</p>

TOOTH ACH.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> A general cold, cold air applied to the cheeks in an unuſual and ſudden manner, acrids, ſweets, or acids applied to the teeth, the acrid matter of a rotten tooth, extraordinary violence, as in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard ſubſtances, blows, &amp;c. Beſides theſe there are certain diſpoſing cauſes, under which the uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure we are conſtantly liable to, is a ſufficient cauſe; as a nerve being laid bare, by rotting or extraction of a tooth, pregnancy, hyſteric diſpoſitions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Theſe are various in different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. In the tooth ach that proceeds from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cold, there are frequently ſymptoms of a rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic affection of the adjacent parts, the pain extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the tooth to the face, and along up to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>empl, with a throbbing of the arteries, and redneſs, ſometimes a little ſwelling of the face, and withal a feveriſhneſs. In moſt other caſes, a violent pain of the tooth, with a little inflammation of the gum, are the only ſymptoms, except that about the terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould carefully avoid every cauſe, and confine himſelf to his room. In the caſe of rheumatic ſymptoms, his food and drink ſhould be of the weakeſt and lighteſt kind, and a ſilk handkerchief ſhould be applied over his face. In the other caſes, the face ſhould be wrapped in flannel, and no change made in the food or drink. The tooth ſhould be ſtopped with lint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In the firſt caſe it will be the beſt way to aim at the removal of the cold, by giving a doſe of ſalts, and taking a ſweat of weak whey, with a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoonful of ſalt petre. After this a ſmall bliſter applied to the part will be moſt effectual; or, inſtead of this, ſweating the part with hot herbs, or a hot ſtone, wrapt in moiſt or dry rags, may be uſeful. In general, in ſuch a caſe it will be of little uſe to apply any thing to the tooth itſelf, till the above has been firſt done, then a little laudanum and ſpirits may be held in the mouth. In all the other caſes, topical applications are more effectual. The chief of theſe are opium, camphor, oil of cloves and other warm eſſential oils; with theſe electricity, burning the tooth, applying a hot iron to the ear, and many other means, have been at times ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. But it is often neceſſary with theſe to give ſmall doſes of laudanum, and apply a bliſter, and when theſe fail, extracting the tooth; which may be done at any time, by a careful truſty operator: but if this does not relieve, the pain paſſing to another tooth, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhould not inſiſt upon that being drawn, but commit all to patience. The beſt manner of applying topicals is to inſert the medicine into the hollow, and cover it with lint or wax.</p>

THE GOUT.</head>
                     <p>THE cauſes of the gout, for better comprehending them, may be placed under four heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. The prime cauſes; which are the uſe of exceſſive quantities of high ſeaſoned animal food, and the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe of wine and other ſpirituous liquors. Theſe are ſuppoſed to produce their effect, by cauſing an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the extreme veſſels (which are employed in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition) in degree and conſtancy, above what they were conſtructed to bear, ſo that as ſoon as the body ceaſes to yield, which is at the end of growth, the veſſels from being over excited, are overcome, and ſuffer an indirect debility, and relaxation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. The prediſpoſing cauſes; under which a leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the above brings on the complaint, becauſe they aim at the ſame point: they are, indolence, hereditary delicacy of the parts that ſuffer in the gout (from a general ſimilarity to the parent) and that tendency in the animal oeconomy which produces a robuſt and groſs habit. Theſe cauſes would, when they had proceeded to a certain extent, bring on the gout; but it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the caſe, that it is not helped on by what may be called.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. The exciting cauſes; as venery, debauchery, cold applied to the feet, indigeſtion, much application of mind, night watching, paſſions, exceſſive evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, changing of habits, debilitating diſeaſes, bruiſes or ſtrains of the parts that ſuffer in gout; the uſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and acid fruits, &amp;c. All theſe act by debilitating generally or topically, and this being always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a relaxation, expoſes the injured parts to the irritation of the air in an uncommon manner. The irritation of the air brings about</p>
                     <p n="4">4th. The proximate or immediate cauſe; which is a ſuperabundant afflux of the nervous, or vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the parts moſt debilitated or moſt expoſed (to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029891_0044_0FE2C4B933B5BF48"/>the common irritations); uſually the extremity of the joints, or ball of the great toe. This afflux of vital principle has two effects. 1ſt. As there is no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation without the preſence of this principle, ſo in the abundance of it, the ſenſation is exquiſite. 2dly. As there is no circulation without it, and the circulation is in proportion to it, ſo, in the abundance of it, the circulation is increaſed to inflammation, and the tender parts are forced, and filled faſter than they can propel the blood; hence congeſtion, redneſs and pain of the joint, and in ſuch parts as are not plentifully furniſhed with veſſels, the muſcular fibres are contracted to a ſpaſm.</p>

                        <p>A CEASING of the ſweat to which the feet have been accuſtomed, an unuſual coldneſs of the legs and feet, a frequent numbneſs, alternating with a prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſenſation all along the courſe of the extremities, frequent cramps of the legs, and a ſwelling of the veins. Whilſt theſe ſymptoms take place in the parts mentioned, the whole body is affected with a degree of torpor and languor: the functions of the ſtomach in particular are more or leſs diſturbed, the appetite is diminiſhed, and flatulency with other ſymptoms of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion felt. Theſe ſymptoms take place for ſome days before the fit of the gout comes on, but often on the day preceding the fit the appetite becomes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than uſual: The fit uſually begins about three o' clock in the morning, with pain affecting one foot, moſt commonly at the ball of the great toe, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in other parts of the foot; with the coming on of the pain there is uſually more or leſs of a cold ſhivering, which as the pain increaſes gradually gives way to beat and fever, which laſts as long as the pain does.

                        <p>But though the pain ceaſes at the end of twenty-four hours, it uſually returns every evening, with leſs and leſs violence and fever, and again abates in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: this recurring continues ſome days, and then goes off very entirely, till the third, ſecond, or next ſpring, following. This is the caſe in the firſt attack of the gout; but the returns become more frequent, till at length after ſome years the patient is never clear of it, except a month or ſo in the ſummer ſeaſon: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the gout has continued, the pain does not remain in one joint, but ſhifts about until it has attacked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every joint in the body.</p>

                        <p>IF it be early in the complaint, or the patient not debilitated, gentle continued bodily exerciſe and a diet of vegetables and milk ſhould be uſed; but if the patient is already much injured by it, neither of the above will be ſafe. His exerciſe ſhould then be geſtation, for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would injure the parts too much, and other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe would be fatiguing: His diet ſhould be of the moſt nouriſhing vegetables, milk and light meats, which laſt may be uſed more and in proportion to the debility, and if this be conſiderable, it will be neceſſary to uſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029891_0046_0FE2C4C5C7C14678"/>good Madeira, diluted, for drink; otherwiſe all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors ſhould be abſtained from. The cauſes mentioned ſhould as much as poſſible be avoided, and the patient ſhould keep his bowels regular with a little ſulphur, caſtor oil, lenitive electuary, or any mild opening medicine; which are to be uſed at all times to prevent or remove the coſtiveneſs.</p>
                        <p>In general, it will be found uſeful after a fit not to riſe ſoon, but to keep warm in bed moſt of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to go to bed early.</p>

                        <p>AT this time very little can be done to advantage. If the patient is vigorous, and the inflammation and pain conſiderable, blood-letting may be once perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though ſparingly.

                        <p>IN ſuch patients as have brought the gout on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, this peculiarity ſeldom happens till late in the diſorder, when the ſyſtem is generally debilitated, and there is little diſpoſition to inflammation. In ſuch a ſtate the ſtomach is uſually much debilitated, and lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be acted upon by a ſlighter cauſe than what would bring on an affection of a joint.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Loſs of appetite, indigeſtion, flatulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nauſea and vomiting, acid eructations, pains and cramps in different parts, which yield upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of wind; coſtiveneſs, though ſometimes looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, colic pains and hypochondriac ſymptoms (which conſiſts in a great attention to the ſlighteſt ſymptoms, and an apprehenſion of danger) an abſence of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory affections of the joints, and of fever.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Management.</hi> The patient's food ſhould be a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of animal and vegetable, of the moſt nutrient and digeſtible kind, taken rather at many times than in large quantities. Wine and water, or ſpirit and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be his drink: It will be of great advantage to keep cloſe to the bed, except when the patient is able, and the weather good, then he ſhould ride in a carriage daily.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Treatment.</hi> Fifteen grains of ruſt of ſteel, with as much pounded orange-peel, may be taken with mint water, or a little ſpirit of lavender, four or five times a-day.</p>
                        <p>A tea-ſpoonful of ſaline aromatic ſpirit will alſo be of ſervice to take a few times a-day.</p>
                        <p>If indigeſtion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <p>A third variety of the gout is, when the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has appeared firſt in its uſual place (the joints) but from improper treatment, bad management, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and other leſs obſervable cauſes, it leaves the joints, and fixes upon the ſtomach or ſome other part.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="49" facs="unknown:029891_0048_0FE2C4D25916DA00"/>This is called the RETROCEDENT GOUT. When the ſtomach receives the affection, a great anxiety, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vomiting attend; if the lungs, an aſthmatic affection is the product; if the heart, fainting; if the head, an apoplexy.</p>
                        <p>When the ſtomach or bowels are attacked, wine, with ſpices boiled in it, ſhould be given plentifully, or if this is not ſufficient, ſpirits with ſpices in large doſes. In ſlighter caſes, leſs doſes of ſpirits, in which garlic has been ſteeped, may be given; with this the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's feet may be ſteeped in a ſtrong hot mixture of ſpirits and water, and bliſters laid on the ankles; vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile aromatic ſpirits, and aſſafoetida, are alſo proper to be given, but they are leſs powerful than ſpirits and ſpices. When the vomiting is troubleſome, it may be encouraged with camomile tea, and afterwards reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by twenty or thirty drops of laudanum with a drachm, of ſpirits of nitre dulcified; vitriolic aether and muſk are ſometimes uſeful.</p>
                        <p>When any of the other parts are affected, a bliſter ſhould be immediately applied, and the bath of ſpirits and water applied to the feet. If the patient is able to bear bleeding, it ſhould be performed when the head or lungs are affected. In all caſes a gentle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to the ſurface ſhould be aimed at, by giving one tea-ſpoonful of ſaline aromatic ſpirits every two hours; or ſpirits of nitre dulcified and laudanum every two or three hours. The fourth and laſt variety of the gout is the MISPLACED. That is, when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, inſtead of a regular affection, is immediately (without any preceding affection of the joints) affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an inflammation of the lungs, the bladder, or the lower end of the laſt gut; in this laſt it brings on the piles: when it affects the bladder, it brings on ſtrangury or a difficult diſcharge of urine. Theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are to be treated as directed in the chapters for them; remembering the conſtitution and ſituation of the patient.</p>
                        <p>During every ſpecies, coſtiveneſs ſhould be removed by three or four grains of aloes, or twenty-five of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029891_0049_0FE2C4DC3AD79D28"/>rhubarb. And between every affection, the ſyſtem may be ſtrengthened by the following medicine; half a wine-glaſs full of which may be taken twice a day, at eleven and at four o'clock; port wine, one quart, ruſty iron or iron flakes, one handful, cinnamon one ounce: let them remain one week and then uſe them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obſervations.</hi> 1ſt, It appears, that a primary gout is the conſequence of a general injury done to the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; but that the ſtomach and extremities ſuffer chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the ſtomach is particularly injured by the prime cauſes, and the extremities are more expoſed (from their diſtance from the heart and other cauſes) to the irritation of the air, which far exceeds common notice and opinion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly, It is alſo plain, that thoſe who are much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to the gout by hereditary conſtitution of the parts, cannot poſſibly eſcape it; becauſe that quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of food which is neceſſary for nutrition, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an action, that the veſſels uſually injured in the gout cannot ſupport through life.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly, A fit of the gout is a change in the ſyſtem, which aims at a removal of the injury; only being unbounded and exceſſive, not produced by any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſcientious power, but by phyſical laws.</p>

THE SMALL POX.</head>
                     <p>THE ſmall pox is of two kinds; the diſtinct and the confluent: As they demand a very different treatment, I ſhall not confound them, but treat of them ſeparately.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>THE DISTINCT SMALL POX.</head>
                        <p>THE cauſe of this is a ſpecific contagion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Symptoms.</hi> About eight days after inoculation, and probably the ſame time after taking it the natural
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029891_0050_0FE2C4E0DCB49648"/>way, a fever appears of the continued inflammatory kind: after this has continued about three days, a diſtinct eruption of ſmall pimples, like flea-bites, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the face; theſe increaſe and extend, ſo that about the end of the fifth day, the eruption is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted and extended to the extremities: from the firſt eruption the fever uſually declines, and at the finiſhing of the eruption it ceaſes. During the fever, children are frequently affected with ſtarting, and if kept warm, with fits.</p>
                        <p>About the eighth day after the eruption, theſe pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have increaſed to ſpheroidal puſtules, filled with matter, with a red margin around each.</p>
                        <p>Before the puſtules are quite filled, a ſwelling of the face takes place, which ſubſides as ſoon as the puſtules are filled: a ſwelling of the wriſts and feet ſucceeds the above, juſt in the progreſſion of the eruption; during this period a ſore throat is common.</p>
                        <p>After the puſtules are fully ripe and yellow, they then either pour out the matter, from a ſmall rupture at their top, or the matter is abſorbed, leaving en emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty flat bag: the former is uſually the caſe with thoſe on the face; the latter with thoſe on the arms and thighs: in this way they decline till they are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dried up, which takes place, from eight to ſixteen days (from the time they begin to decline) according to ſize and number of the puſtules: pits are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently left behind.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Management</hi> The patient ſhould be kept cool, both by going into the air, and thinning his cloathing: However, the cuſtom of expoſing to bad weather; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cold, and pulling off from children the flannels which they have been long uſed to, has occaſioned the worſt conſequences: a medium therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029891_0051_0FE2C4E8A2C1E360"/>until the fever commences, when they ſhould uſe nothing but light ſpoon aliments, ſuch as barley, gruel, panada, cuſtard, jelly, &amp;c. Spirituous drinks ſhould be altogether avoided; at the time of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> ſuch drinks as the following may be taken more or leſs, in proportion to the height of the fever, viz. lemonade, cream of tartar diſſolved in water, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, jelly and water, apple-tea, made by pouring boiling water on undreſſed, red-ſtreaked apples, ſliced very thin; the drink to be ſweetened; theſe drinks, abſtinence, and vegetable food, with the directions for keeping the patient cool, may be obſerved until the number of pocks and favour of the diſeaſe be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, after which they may be gradually relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the expoſure firſt, and then the others, and the proper habits returned to.</p>
                        <p>The firſt week in May is probably the beſt time for inoculation, in the States of Pennſylvania, Delaware and Maryland; farther Southward, April; farther Northward, the latter end of May: but avaricious aims have been the cauſe of adopting an earlier ſeaſon. It is upon the whole, in large towns, ſafeſt to inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late before teething, but only becauſe of the danger of taking it the natural way; where that is not to be feared, then from the fifth to the twelfth year, is far preferable; if any thing be amiſs, we can then ſtand ſome chance of rectifying it, by ſuitable treatment, but with infants we can only deplore their ſtate, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint takes an unfavourable turn.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Treatment.</hi> To thoſe who are pretty hearty, or of a full habit, between the time of inoculation and fever, two doſes of Glauber ſalts, or cream of tartar, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to procure four or five ſtools and not more, may be given: but to thoſe who are lean or weakly, no purgatives ſhould be given, only coſtiveneſs ſhould be removed by a little cream of tartar, or the pills No. 6. If they have not a paſſage every day, this will be neceſſary; or if they have a paſſage every day, and the ſtools ſhould be hard and difficultly paſſed, the pills, or a clyſter of oil, ſugar, milk and a little
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029891_0052_0FE2C4ED477312F0"/>ſcraped Caſtile ſoap, which is probably the beſt, is to be given.</p>
                        <p>If at the commencement of the fever, the patient feels much oppreſſion at the ſtomach, uneaſineſs and giddineſs, it will be proper to adminiſter an emetic of two grains of tartar emetic, diſſolved in a cup of warm water, or of ten grains of ipecacuana; at the ſame time he ſhould have freſh air: when the fever has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, if it runs high, it will be proper to give a doſe of ſalts, which may be taken at two or three por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: If this does not leſſen the fever, take four grains of tartar emetic, and put them into a quart of apple or other tea; three table-ſpoonfuls of this to be given every hour, till the eruption appears, keeping him cool withal. If the eruption appears numerous, and the pulſe be uſually ſtrong, a doſe of ſalts will be of uſe, as it will bring many of the pimples to nothing; after this nothing more will be neceſſary, but to keep the bowels regular with ſmall doſes of any mild medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
                        <p>When the pocks have dried away, if any ſore or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulatory motion of the muſcles take place, a few pills of the following form may be given: calomel twelve grains, opium three grains, honey enough to form them into twelve pills, one of which may be taken night and morning.</p>
                        <p>If the arm inflames much, pour cold water on it daily, for ten minutes together.</p>

                        <p>The ſwelling of the face, that ſometimes attends the diſtinct, is here always preſent at an earlier period, and riſes to a greater height; the diſcharge of ſaliva is generally great about the ſame time; both ſubſide about the tenth or eleventh day, counting from the attack of the incipient fever.

From the fifth day <note n="*" place="bottom">The day is always reckoned from the attack of the incipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fever.</note> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029891_0054_0FE2C4FA2269D850"/>till the eruption be compleated, give twenty drops of laudanum, every morning and night, taking care to remove the coſtiveneſs it occaſions, by giving cream of tartar, or caſtor oil daily, if neceſſary. When the ſecondary fever comes on, the ſame treatment with tartar emetic and laudanum ſhould be uſed, until the ſymptoms of putrefaction and weak pulſe take place, then all ſhould be dropped, for bark and port wine, which may be given every hour, ſo that the patient may take a pint of wine and one ounce of bark, from morning till bed time.</p>
                        <p>From the eighth day to the eleventh, when the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is violent, bliſters ſhould be laid on ſucceſſively, without any reſpect to the pocks; the wriſts, thighs, back of the neck, and breaſt, are proper places; when the ſwelling in the throat threatens ſuffocation, a bliſter ſhould be applied over the throat, and the throat gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with a mixture of one drachm of elixir of vitriol, to half a pint of ſage tea and a little honey; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, with vinegar and water.</p>
                        <p>If the fits, that uſually attack children, happen but once or twice, nothing need be done but to keep them cool; but if they are frequent, they are likely to deſtroy the patient; then as large a doſe of laudanum as the child can take, ſhould be given.</p>
                        <p>The bark, with the vitriol and water ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a conſiderable time after the diſeaſe, to ſtrengthen the ſyſtem, though it ſhould be uſed in a leſs quantity.</p>

THE CHICKEN POX.</head>
                     <p>THIS diſorder appears to ariſe from a ſpecific con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion in the air: like the ſmall pox, it never returns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> The patient is generally, for one or two nights, or nights and days, affected with fever, which moſt always is ſlight: at no certain perſon, though perhaps always before the third day, the pocks appear
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029891_0055_0FE2C502E961E328"/>on the face, and over the body; they are never very numerous, though ſometimes pretty large. In the courſe of four days they are at their ſummit, when they are about the ſize of a large briſter ſhot, and much of the ſame form, filled with yellowiſh or white water. They ſometimes come out ſucceſſively inſtead of a great many at once.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept cool, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when in bed; light vegetable food, and cooling acid drinks, ſhould be uſed.</p>

                        <hi>Treatment.</hi> If the fever be worthy attention, the bowels ſhould be opened with a doſe of cream of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar or of ſalts, every day till it ceaſes, and the acid drinks given plentifully.</p>

THE MEASLES.</head>
                     <p>THIS diſorder ariſes from ſpecific contagion, and never has been known to attack the ſame perſon twice.</p>
                     <p>It uſually makes its appearance about January, and again ceaſes at midſummer. Nevertheleſs, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together adherent to any particular times, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues throughout the year, though leſs extenſively.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It comes on like a common fever, with a cold ſtage ſucceeded by a hot one; a nauſea, anxiety and vomiting, are pretty generally attendants. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the beginning, the fever is ſharp and violent, but before the eruption it is moſt generally ſo, which happens about the fourth day; with theſe a hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cough, difficult breathing, ſwelling of the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, acrid diſcharge from the eyes and noſe, with ſneezing take place: generally a drowſineſs attends the beginning. The eruption appears firſt on the face in ſmall points like flea-bites, which ſoon may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquamation takes place, but more commonly continues with the cough for ſome time after the diſorder has gone through the ſtages, and not unfrequently the cough and difficulty of breathing increaſe towards the end, ſo as to mark an inflammation of the lungs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſquamation, a lax or ſweating uſually takes place, and continues for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould avoid heat, but on the other hand, ſhould not expoſe himſelf ſo much to the cool air, as in the ſmall pox. He ſhould live on a low vegetable diet, and cool acid demulcent drinks, ſuch as flaxſeed tea, with lemon juice: barley water boiled with prunes, is alſo very good, eſpecially for the cough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Treatment.</hi> If the fever that precedes the eruption is conſiderable, it will, in adult patients, be proper to bleed, but in children, a purge or two of ſalts will be generally ſufficient. From the beginning, the drinks mentioned above and ſyrups may be given to allay the cough; but theſe are ſeldom ſufficient; it will therefore be neceſſary, from the time of the eruption, to give one tea-ſpoonful of paregoric, twice a-day, and two at night in common drink. This treatment and keeping the bowels open regularly, with gentle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as ſalts and manna, in ſmall doſes, cream of tartar, caſtor oil, &amp;c. ſhould be continued in. When the deſquamation or peeling of the ſkin takes place, if the difficulty of breathing mentioned in the deſorp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, comes on, with a ſtrong pulſe; then the patient ſhould be bled freely, and a bliſter laid afterwards on the ſide, as in a pleuriſy, and with theſe, one of the powders No. 1. may be given every two hours, or if it be a child, a ſufficient quantity of antimonial wine, to be taken at intervals of two hours: during ſuch a ſtate the paregoric ſhould be omitted. If the patient, is unable to bear bleeding, the caſe then cannot be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029891_0057_0FE2C5109FB5C858"/>violent; then purging and bliſtering with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may be uſed; gentle riding and bark are proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

THE SCARLET FEVER.</head>
                     <p>THIS complaint cannot poſſibly be ſeparated from the putrid ſore throat, as the affection of the throat, eruption of the ſkin, and low or putrid fever, which are the chief ſymptoms, are attendants on both: added to this, the ſame contagion will affect one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with what is judged to be the putrid ſore throat, and another with the ſcarlatina. It is therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the ſcarlatina is only an affection of leſs magnitude, ſometimes owing to the lenity of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral contagion, and then cauſing ſcarlatina univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at other times owing to the diverſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions attacked. Hence, for the cure, &amp;c. I refer to what I have ſaid of the putrid ſore throat, Chap. xi. But it frequently happens that the ſcarlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na is ſo ſlight as to ſhew no putrid ſymptoms but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inflammatory; then all that will be required will be a bliſter to the throat and keeping the bowels open with cream of tartar.</p>

                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> A hereditary diſpoſition thereto, or a peculiar delicacy of the membrane that ſuffers the inflammation; paſſions of the mind, a ſudden cooling of the body after being heated by the ſun, ſpirituous liquors taken freely, hot drinks or hot baths, checked evacuations, moiſt air, and perſpiration any how ſtop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, generally excite the diſeaſe in thoſe prediſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:029891_0058_0FE2C515539FD1A8"/>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It commonly comes on with ſhivering and ſucceeding heat with fever; the pulſe is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quick, ſometimes hard and full; a confuſion of the head and ſome degree of delirium frequently attend, but a drowſineſs almoſt always, which ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes to a comatoſe ſtate. After theſe ſymptoms have continued from one to three days, a redneſs moſt commonly on the face appears, which increaſes with a ſwelling, that turns white, upon preſſing it with the finger. This goes on to increaſe, though it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abates in one part a little, to increaſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in this manner it ſometimes extends all over the head, and ſwells the eye-lids, ſo as to produce tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary blindneſs.</p>
                     <p>It is not an uncommon caſe for bliſters to ariſe on the ſwelling, filled with yellow or whitiſh ſerum, which break after awhile, and leave the part underneath blackiſh, and very ready to turn gangrenous; the ſkin between theſe bliſters peels off; matter is ſometimes diſcharged from the eyelids: the inflammation and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſually continue about ten days, and then go off; when the fever goes on violently, and the inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extends, it is apt to produce an apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the ſymptoms of a perfect diſeaſe, but ſlighter affections are not unfrequent, even with little or no fever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept cool, in proportion to the greatneſs of the fever: acid drinks and vegetable diet ſhould be uſed throughout.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Treatment.</hi> When the caſe agrees with what is laid down above, half a pint or more of blood ſhould be taken away, which may be repeated, if the habit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the pulſe and inflammation require it: after bleeding, cooling purgatives ſhould be adminiſtered; one ounce of Glauber ſalts may be divided into four parts, one of which ſhould be given every two hours, mixing it with lemon juice, which covers the bad taſte.</p>
                     <p>This practice of adminiſtering ſalts may be followed for ſome days; they not only open the bowels, but
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029891_0059_0FE2C51BAE9F8430"/>temperate the heat and fever: in ſlighter caſes bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be laid aſide, and the medicines given as directed.</p>
                     <p>Whenever there are any ſymptoms of putrefaction, as a low, weak pulſe, dark colouring of the tongue and mouth, acrid and black ſpots underneath where the bliſters ſtood; then all evacuations (except keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bowels regular, with a little rhubarb) ſhould be laid aſide, and twelve grains of columbo root given every hour; when this can be kept on the ſtomach well, and does not have ſufficient effect, as much bark ſhould be given, and the doſe increaſed as neceſſity requires, or as it will fit on the patient: wine and water, and vitriol and water, made by putting two tea-ſpoonfuls of elixir of vitriol to a pint of water, may be drank alternately and freely.</p>
                     <p>The patient is moſt always wanting ſome topical application, for this phyſicians have thought that meal ſprinkled on the part, is the only proper application; this, when the inflammation is conſiderable, fits agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and has ſome effect in ſoftening the ſkin, and if ſprinkled on very ſlightly when the bliſters diſcharge, it dries up the humour: however patients are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it, therefore apply either of the following with a rag moiſtened in it: half a pint of ſtrong tea of camomile flowers, or wormwood tops, fifteen grains of white vitriol, and a tea-ſpoonful of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum or a ſtrong ſolution of allum.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes from neglect, the part ſuppurates; then it ſhould be poulticed with bread and milk till it is ripe, when it ſhould be opened and dreſſed with lint ſpread with wax and oil melted together; this need only be applied over the ſore.</p>
                     <p>Bark and vitriol, with freſh air, gentle exerciſe in a carriage in fair weather, will be proper to brace up the habit in the end.</p>

THE ESSERA, OR NETTLE RASH.</head>
                     <p>THIS generally attacks thoſe of a delicate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, eſpecially ſuch as have a fine ſkin, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive irritability of which appears to be a cauſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>From the above it would appear, that women and children are the chief ſubjects of it; which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to obſervation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It uſually comes on in the night, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing great reſtleſſneſs and itching. In the morning conſiderable red eminences are to be obſerved on ſome parts of the body, uſually about the upper arms, neck, and breaſt; their forms are irregular, ſome being like the ſtroke of a whip, others like the ſting of a moſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. It is not unfrequent for them to diſappear in the courſe of the day, and return again at night: the time of continuance is various, as they ſometimes continue for a week, and ſometimes for a year or more.</p>
                     <p>They have never been known to have any dangerous effect; the itching being all that is diſagreeable, which at times is ſo troubleſome as to prevent ſleep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould uſe exerciſe, bathing, and every proper means to remove ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> This has been too little attended to, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we ſhould ere this, have diſcovered ſome ſimple medicine that would remove it.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen mercury recommended, and in a few caſes which I have treated, it was always attended with ſucceſs.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029891_0061_0FE2C526773D6350"/>AEthiops mineral is alſo a proper medicine, twenty grains may be uſed every other night for twenty days.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps if common ſulphur was tried every night, it would have an equally good effect. To guard againſt the returns of it, bark may be uſed; and ſome weeks after uſing the medicines preſcribed, the cold bath.</p>

BLEEDING AT THE NOSE.</head>
                     <p>THOUGH this complaint attends at any age and may trouble any conſtitution, yet it does not make the diſorder I mean to treat of, except when it attacks young people, and eſpecially thoſe who are full of blood.</p>
                     <p>The animal oeconomy finds it proper not to increaſe the different parts equally from the time of conception, but increaſes certain parts ſucceſſively, this increaſe is brought about by a determination of blood to theſe parts: hence the different periods of life, that we ſee fluxes of blood making their appearance may be eaſily accounted for: and hence this complaint in the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the following complaint immediately after that period.</p>
                     <p>It requires attention, or it will ſoon be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very diſagreeable circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>The quantity of blood diſcharged is various.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> In the time the bleeding comes on the patient ſhould be placed in a ſtream of cool air,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029891_0062_0FE2C52C292CB9C8"/>and be ſupported erect; he ſhould avoid talking, or blowing his noſe.</p>
                     <p>In the intervals he ſhould avoid heat, ſtooping his head, or walking faſt, more eſpecially after eating: his exerciſe ſhould be gentle and conſtant, and this may be partly in riding and walking, and partly in the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of his buſineſs, if that be mechanical. The cold bath may be uſed daily, in which he may remain ſome time; this has, beſide a bracing property, a tendency to make the patient lean: a little care ſhould be uſed in the beginning; no cap ſhould be worn on the head to keep the water from that part. He ſhould live upon a vegetable diet chiefly, and uſe cold water for his conſtant drink.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In beginning to treat the patient, if he has not already loſt much blood, a few ounces may be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from him, a little before the time of the bleeding's coming on, and ever afterward a doſe of ſalts may be uſed at the ſame time; and it may be obſerved in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that it will be neceſſary to keep the bowels very regular. If after the ſalts have been taken, the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not removed, one of the fever powders, No. 1. may be uſed every two hours, for two days, and large quantities of lemon-juice taken between each doſe.</p>
                     <p>When the bleeding comes on, it may be ſuffered to continue till ſix ounces have been diſcharged, provided the patient be full of blood, but if otherwiſe, it ſhould be ſtopped immediately, by pouring cold water on his head, hands and teſticles, and by drinking cold water; at the ſame time, uſing doſſils of lint, dip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But in many caſes neither of the above will anſwer, then the patient's life is in danger, and the following ſimple method may be uſed by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, who has the leaſt degree of preſence of mind; take a needleful of ſilk, wax it and tie to one end of it a doſſil of well ſcraped lint, about as large as
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029891_0063_0FE2C533936BA248"/>a thumb, get a piece of cat-gut ſtring ſeveral inches long, greaſe it a little, puſh this cat-gut through the bleeding noſtril into the mouth, till you obſerve it come out near the throat, lay hold of it with a pair of narrow pincers or forceps, or in their ſtead, with a dull pair of ſciſſars, and draw it till you have both ends in your hands; tie a knot in the end that you have drawn through, and to this knot faſten your ſilk and draw back the cat-gut till you have drawn the doſſil of lint againſt the orifice of the paſſage that leads into the throat, then you need only ſtop up the noſtril with another doſſil of lint, which will ſhut up the paſſage altogether, and hinder any more blood from coming out. The hint ſhould be kept in for three or four days.</p>
                     <p>The cat-gut is only for the purpoſe of getting the ſilk through, which is too limber of itſelf: In puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cat-gut through, you are not to puſh it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as the noſtrils apparently lead, but directly backward, aiming at the upper part of the throat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

SPITTING OF BLOOD.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Beſides the prediſpoſition mentioned in the preceding chapter, we may conſider, as exciting cauſes, ſuppreſſed evacuations, ſudden changes of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029891_0064_0FE2C538FB39B288"/>air from heavy to lighter, violent efforts, compreſſion in different parts, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> After ſome general diſorder, as flatulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, chills, &amp;c. a fulneſs is often felt about the cheſt. From the blood being poured out, an irritation is made, to relieve which, the patient hawks or coughs, by which means he diſcharges a little frothy, reddiſh, and ſomewhat ſaltiſh ſpittle; this ſenſation often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again, and the ſpittle is thrown out of a deeper red. In this manner the patient uſually diſcharges the blood for ſome hours or days, when it ceaſes for that period. But it ſometimes happens, that the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more conſiderable, and the pure blood is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in ſuch quantities, as to excite vomiting; in ſuch a caſe the patient's life is in immediate danger. A cough uſually follows the bleeding, which returns ſometimes every week, and ſo on at every period be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and a year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> This ſhould be exactly as deſcribed for the preceding diſorder, only that the cold bath ſhould not be uſed, as we have not ſufficient experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to recommend it, and the cold ſhould be here very moderate, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> when it is ſevere, it determines the blood to the lungs, which is to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Treatment.</hi> If the patient be able to bear it, blood ſhould be taken away, though not in profuſion. As ſoon as the bleeding takes place, this ſhould be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a doſe of Glauber ſalts. And ever afterwards when we apprehend from the ſymptoms before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that the bleeding is about to return, we ſhould anticipate it by the repetition of the ſalts, which I have ſeen attended with the beſt ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>When the bleeding is copious, beſides the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of expoſing the patient to cool air, let him take a tea-ſpoonful of common ſalt, and repeat it when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. This has been often effectual, and may be carried in the perſon's pocket, when repeated ſmall bleedings plague him, or ten grains of allum every hour. In the intervals nitre ſhould be given to reduce and cool the ſyſtem, ten grains in flaxſeed tea, may
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029891_0065_0FE2C5420AEAFBA0"/>be given three or four times a day; after the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ceaſed, the country air ſhould be uſed. It is ſometimes neceſſary to take a tea-ſpoonful of pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goric elixir at night, in the morning, and at noon, to quell the cough.</p>

CONSUMPTION.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> A hereditary, natural or acquired debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the lungs, may be looked upon as cauſes of this fatal diſorder: under ſuch circumſtances, almoſt any irritation upon thoſe parts will eſtabliſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; and it is ſomewhat doubtful if any cauſe will do the ſame, without the prediſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Cough, pain about the breaſt, ſpitting of nauſeous matter at all times of the day, which is ſometimes ſtreaked with blood; a fever which comes in at noon, frequently with ſhivering, and moſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with coldneſs, which remits towards the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, to exacerbate or renew its violence at night, continuing with the other affections, and after awhile being followed in its ſecond fit towards morning with a copious ſweat.</p>
                     <p>The pulſe in this fever, which is a hectic, is quick and moſt generally weak, though in its firſt attack ſome degree of hardneſs is to be felt. The fever is always kindled by taking much food at a time. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the conſumption, a lax takes place which generally carries off the patient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould live upon a light digeſtible diet; milk, vegetables, ſpoon-meats, pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, pies, &amp;c. are proper; theſe ſhould be taken in ſmall quantities at a time, and uſed the oftener, on that account. The teas and drinks preſcribed for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are the proper drinks to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>Exerciſe in a carriage or ſailing, are almoſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary; the country air is ſo far preferable
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029891_0066_0FE2C546AAD14208"/>to the town, that the former will ſometimes alone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a cure, and the latter reſiſt every means. Cold ſhould be guarded againſt; and for this as well as other reaſons, a flannel ſhirt ſhould be worn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> If the patient is not low and thin, he ſhould be bled every week for three or four times, taking away about a quarter of a pint of blood each time, till all ſigns of increaſed action or hardneſs are gone from the pulſe; if they give way at the firſt bleeding no more is to be uſed. After this, or when this is not allowable, eight grains of ipecacuana ſhould be given every four days, for as many times as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be beneficial: when this has been done, the patient ſhould take twenty drops of elixir of vitriol, early in the morning, at ten o'clock, and again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the noon fever has abated and before the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one has come on. To allay the cough take two ounces of paregoric, two grains of tartar emetic, or when tartar does not agree, two ounces of the ſpirits of nitre dulcified: two ſmall tea-ſpoonfuls may be uſed at night, and half that quantity taken at any time in the day when it is troubleſome. When the pain in the breaſt is conſiderable, bliſters may be uſed; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſhould be put in the ſide in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The bowels ſhould be kept regular, with ſmall doſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of caſtor oil, ſulphur, magneſia, or cream of tartar.</p>
                     <p>The above preſcriptions, although the beſt and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt that can be recommended, frequently fail, and when the diſeaſe threatens to reſiſt them, a ſea voyage ſhould be recommended as the only refuge.</p>
                     <p>It is not unfrequent that the conſumption is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with other affections, then we muſt have regard to theſe affections, or no cure can be expected. But ſuch caſes are ſo complex, that they require the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an able phyſician.</p>

THE PILES.</head>
                     <p>A LAXITY of the gut affected, natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, diſpoſes to this complaint, ſo much that ſlight cauſes bring it about.</p>
                     <p>The following are found to be the uſual cauſes, viz. much walking or riding, coſtiveneſs, long continuance in an erect poſture, ſtrong purges, ſuppreſſed, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or artificial evacuations; falling down of the gut, drinking large quantities of watery liquors, grief, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the liver, pregnancy, high living, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> The ſymptoms of this diſeaſe being not always alike, have made ſome variety and diſtinction of it. Thus there is the blind piles, when the tumour is not viſible; the common piles, when tumours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear without bleeding; and the bleeding piles, when they diſcharge blood. However, there are general ſymptoms which are common to all; as, a pain and ſwimming in the head, ſtupor, ſick ſtomach with pains in the bowels and back, which frequently precede, and in ſome caſes a fever alſo: a ſenſe of fulneſs and itching are the local ſymptoms: theſe are ſoon reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bleeding piles, when that takes place, and frequently the eſtabliſhment of the tumour is attended with an alleviation of the ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes blood only comes away with the ſtools; but at other times a conſiderable, conſtant diſcharge alarms the patient. This affection is apt to return at ſtated intervals, and to increaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> All the cauſes as far as poſſible are to be avoided, and temperance is ſtrictly to be obſerved by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <hi>Cure.</hi> It is frequently the caſe, that this diſcharge is ſalutary, and therefore a doubt ariſes in the minds of ſome people, about adminiſtering medicines to check it. Hence, whenever the diſcharge is ſmall, and attended with benefit, nothing need be done to check it; but whenever it is profuſe, it then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens a greater injury than it is likely to relieve; then, as well as when it returns often, it ſhould be check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by applying cloths dipped in cold water or vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to the neck, hands, thighs, and the part itſelf: if this does not relieve it, dip a ſponge in allum and water, or in a decoction of galls, and apply it to the part, and if neceſſary, give twelve grains of ipeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuana in a little water immediately. When nothing but tumours are preſent, and they are painful or large, waſh them with the following waſh: to half a pint of lead-water add two tea-ſpoonfuls of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum.</p>
                     <p>This may be uſed three or four times a-day. Open the bowels in all caſes with ſulphur, or ſulphur and cream of tartar, mixed in equal quantities with honey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After a large diſcharge, a general debility enſues; the pulſe becomes weak, the ſtomach ſick, reſpiration difficult upon the leaſt motion; the feet cold and ſwoln, eſpecially towards evening, when a fever takes place of the hectic kind.

OBSTRUCTED MENSES.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Cold is one of the moſt common cauſes, either when applied to the body during menſtrua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or when it has at a preceding time brought on the complaint called a cold; diſeaſes of much pain or action in other parts, debility, exceſſive evacuations, low paſſions of the mind, are alſo cauſes.</p>
                     <p>As the diſorder is ſo well marked, I need not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſymptoms that enſue in thoſe who have once had the menſes, but ſhall confine myſelf to the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that take place in girls who have never had them although they have paſſed over the proper time. This is called properly a retention of the menſes.</p>
                     <p>The patient after the age of thirteen, but how long after is uncertain, is affected with a loſs of appetite, ſluggiſhneſs, laſſitude and debility; the countenance becomes pale or ſwarthy, and the body univerſally flaccid, the legs ſwell, eſpecially at night, and the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſometimes ſwells alſo, whilſt pains affect the head,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029891_0071_0FE2C56869428BB8"/>back, and other parts: reſpiration is generally labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> It is clear, that neither the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor the cure can be conducted on a ſingle plan: In the plethoric, and thoſe who have cold as a cauſe, low diet ſhould be preſcribed, with thin drinks, cool air, and reſt: but in thoſe emaciated, nouriſhing food, wine and exerciſe ſhould be ſtrenuouſly enforced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In thoſe of the former caſe, that is, thoſe who are full of blood, or have much remaining ſtrength, perhaps nothing will relieve ſooner than blood-letting; with this ſalts may be uſed, and if the menſes do not return at the uſual period, at that very juncture let the patient take four grains of calomel, and as many of aloes, in a little honey, and repeat the doſe next night if neceſſary. Thoſe who are emaciated, or have a retention, ſhould take ten grains of ſteel every ſix hours, and a couple of doſes of bark daily, till the period arrives; and then, if neceſſary, take the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſes as directed.

VOMITING OF BLOOD.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Obſtructed menſes, and other evacuations ſuppreſſed; enlargement of the ſpleen or liver, ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſtomach by poiſons, ſmall glaſs, &amp;c. and violent ſtraining to vomit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Some pain about the ſtomach, anxiety and vomiting of black grumous blood, without cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient who is ſubject to this ſhould live regularly and abſtemiouſly, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by every means to counteract ſuh cauſes as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of aſſiſtance, and uſe proper medicines for the ſame purpoſe. In time of a diſcharge, the patient ſhould retire from all cloſe places, into cool and freſh air.</p>

                        <hi>Cure.</hi> Whatever may be the cauſe, we are to uſe the ſame means to ſtop an exceſſive diſcharge. Beſides the treatment mentioned before, we may uſe gentle aſtringent medicines, as ten grains of alum diſſolved in water every half hour, till the vomiting has ceaſed ſome time; after which a decoction of oak bark may be uſed for ſome days, in the ſame quantity, and made in the ſame manner as the decoction No. 3.</p>
                     <p>When an enlargement of the ſpleen or liver is the cauſe, little hope remains of a cure; but the patient ſhould not neglect to try the Virginia ſulphur ſprings, which are very powerful deobſtruents. When ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed evacuations are the cauſe, the means directed for them ſhould be adminiſtered; when acrids have been taken into the ſtomach, they ſhould be changed if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, by their proper antidotes, or enveloped in ſome mild mucilage, as mucilage of gum arabic, or in oil, or ſyrups. When vomiting is the cauſe, a few drops of laudanum in mint water, will put a ſtop to it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> It frequently makes its appearance with a difficulty of breathing through the noſtrils, a ſenſe of fulneſs and ſtoppage there; this is followed with a pain in the forehead, ſtiffneſs and redneſs of the eyes and diſcharge from the noſe. When the affection is any worſe, the patient is ſubject to chills and feveriſhneſs, which is conſiderable towards evening, a hoarſeneſs, ſore throat, cough, flying or fixed pains of different parts, and not unfrequently ſome difficulty of reſpiring.</p>
                     <p>The cough in the beginning is uſually dry, but as the other Symytoms give way, it becomes moiſt, more eaſy, and attended with a diſcharge of whitiſh or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The latter is a good medicine to take every night to lull the cough, for this purpoſe, thirty drops of the wine, and ſixty of the elixir may be taken, when the patient is diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſt.</p>
                     <p>If pains remain in the head, a bliſter to the temples is the ſureſt relief; if in the limbs, a tea-ſpoonful of the volatile or ſimple tincture of guaiacum may be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en two or three times a-day, in a little water- Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

INFLUENZA.</head>
                     <p>THE cauſe of this is a ſpecific contagion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſome very general alteration in the air. There is no doubt of its being communicated from one perſon to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> The moſt common ſymptoms are thoſe of the common cold deſcribed above, attacking a whole town or neighbourhood at once. But that is not its conſtant form; for ſometimes it puts on the appearance of a pleuriſy, with a ſtrong pulſe, at other times a pain in the ſide with a weak pulſe, whilſt in a th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> This is in general to be directed as in the common cold; but when it has the form of a low fever, wine and water ſhould be the conſtant drink.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In ſome of the moſt violent caſes, eſpecially when the patient's habit has been full, it has been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and uſeful to bleed, and bliſter the pained part: this latter need never be neglected, where the pain is fixed. Vomits of ipecacuana, antimonial wine, or ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029891_0075_0FE2C583D16483C0"/>with whey, and a little antimonial wine is never to be neglected. This is to be uſed after vomiting, when that is intended.</p>
                     <p>The bowels ſhould be kept regular by ſmall doſes of caſter oil, Glauber ſalts, cream of tartar, or jalap. When the cough is troubleſome, ſyrup of ſquills may be uſed, one tea-ſpoonful every three hours; or what in ſome caſes anſwers better, the following mixture; paregoric elixir one tea-ſpoonful, antimonial wine twenty drops; this may be taken twice or three times, in the courſe of a day. Honey and vinegar boiled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſpermaceti and loaf ſugar, extract of liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, &amp;c. are frequently uſeful to take in the mouth every quarter of an hour.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of a low fever, wine and bark are to be given freely, after giving a gentle doſe of ipecacuana. If the ſtomach refuſes bark, elixir of vitriol is to be uſed in its ſtead, ten or fifteen drops every hour.</p>

FLUX.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SYMPTOMS.</hi> Sometimes a fever makes the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, at other times the bowels are primarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; firſt, with coſtiveneſs and flatulency, then with gripes and frequent painful efforts to ſtool, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a natural ſort is diſcharged, but ſlime of a whitiſh, bloody, or blackiſh colour, in conſiderable quantities.</p>
                     <p>In ſome few inſtances a lax has preceded. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is voided of the natural kind, is generally in ſmall hard balls.</p>
                     <p>The ſtomach in general is diſordered, and that from the beginning; but it goes off as the complaint proceeds downwards, which it generally does, till all is fixed in the lower end of the laſt gut, where it produces that
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029891_0076_0FE2C588AE797600"/>troubleſome effort of it called teneſmus. The feveriſh ſymptoms continue a conſiderable time, remitting and then acceding again.</p>
                     <p>Whenever the diſeaſe takes a putrid turn, which it is apt to do, it may be known by the foetor and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the diſcharges, a lowneſs of the pulſe and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral debility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> Great attention ſhould be paid to cleanlineſs, by removing the chamber furniture, and ſhifting the bed clothes often; the patient ſhould live upon digeſtible vegetables, as rice, barley, &amp;c. and milk preparations, as thickened milk, light puddings, chicken water, and light broths may alſo be uſed, if the patient is fond of them. And for drinks, teas, jelly and water, and apple water; which may be taken milk warm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> To procure regular natural ſtools, is half the cure; for which purpoſe, a table-ſpoonful of caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor oil is to be given every hour, till it produces that effect; this may be repeated every other day, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, as the patient may require; after this, if the patient is very ſick, eight grains of ipecacuana may be given; after which two grains of ipecacuana may be adminiſtered every two hours, ſo as not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with taking the oil, as long as the fever laſts. After the uſe of theſe medicines for ſome time, laudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num may be given to relieve the pain, fifteen drops morning and night, mixed up with two grains of ipecacuana.</p>
                     <p>If the above medicines are not handy, or if there is any objection to them, the following may be uſed, a doſe of ſalts and manna, once or twice in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, after which, put two grains of tartar emetic, or a table-ſpoonful of antimonial wine in a quart of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tea, and take it in ſmall quantities, every quarter of an hour, ſo as to conſume the whole in a day; after taking it till the fever is removed, then uſe the laudanum. When the complaint has a putrid turn, as well as to remove the debility after a common caſe, twelve grains of columbo root ſhould be taken every two or three hours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:029891_0077_0FE2C5906E0E0DE8"/>If the diſeaſe leaves a looſeneſs, a decoction of log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood or tormentil ſhould be uſed.</p>

APOPLEXY.</head>
                     <p>THIS diſorder moſt commonly attacks the aged, ſuch as have large heads, ſhort necks, corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent habits, and indolent diſpoſitions, who have fed high, and uſed much ſtrong drink. If, in addition to theſe, they have had a ſuppreſſion of any evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the piles, they can ſcarce expect to eſcape an apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Sometimes a head-ach and ſwimming of the eyes, with other affections of the head precede; at other times, it ſuddenly attacks the patient as he reclines his head, or makes ſome effort, with a loſs of internal and external ſenſe, an almoſt total deprivation of voluntary motion. The patient's face often becomes fluſhed and ſwoln, his eyes red, his pulſe full and ſlow, his breathing ſomewhat difficult, with ſnoring.</p>
                     <p>The time that this ſtate laſts, is uncertain; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the patient comes to his ſenſes in a few hours, with a vomiting and ſweat, at other times he lays days, and frequently never recovers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be laid on a bed with his head raiſed as high as it conveniently can; his neck cloth ſhould be ſtripped off, and he ſhould be placed in a cool room. If the fit continues long, a little water may be poured down his throat, if poſſible, twice or three times a-day; when he is on the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, his diet ſhould be as light as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome caſes which may be termed apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, which demand treatment only from the ſurgeon, as when it depends upon a fracture of the ſkull.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> The patient ſhould be bled as freely as his conſtitution will allow: this may be done at different
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029891_0078_0FE2C5950E3C12D0"/>times, rather than at once. After bleeding, a clyſter of Caſtile ſoap, diſſolved in water, ſhould be given, one drachm of ſoap to a pint of water, or inſtead of that, two table-ſpoonfuls of antimonial wine in as much water. Theſe may be uſed every ſix hours, for ſeveral times.</p>
                     <p>If theſe do not bring him to himſelf, a large bliſter ſhould be applied to the back of his neck, and ſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſms made of muſtard, vinegar, and crumbs of bread, applied to the ſoles of his feet. As ſoon as the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is able to ſwallow a pill, ſix grains of aloes, and as much ſoap made into a bolus or pills, ſhould be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him every day, ſo as to keep his bowels in regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion.</p>
                     <p>Gentle exerciſe ſhould ſoon be uſed, and increaſed till the patient is perfectly well: proper exerciſe and abſtinence are the only ſecurities againſt a return. When the diſorder ends in a palſy, which it ſometimes does, the cure directed for palſy is to be followed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lethargy and Coma,</hi> which are ſpecies of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are to be treated in the ſame way, having reſpect to the degree of the diſorder and the patient's habit, and directing the evacuations in proportion to them.</p>

PALSY.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Compreſſion of a nerve in its origin of courſe, certain narcotics taken internally, exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from lead and arſenic in their preparations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive venery, old age, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> A loſs of ſenſation or ability of motion in the part affected, which is ſometimes one half of the patient, as the right ſide, or from the hips down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; at other times, only a ſmall part is affected, as the hand, the arm, the leg.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> This is to be according to the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's habit: If he is full, a low diet is to be uſed;
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029891_0079_0FE2C59CA0B42970"/>if he is low, a ſtimulating diet and ſpirituous drinks ſhould be uſed. The cauſes are, if poſſible, to be removed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In full habits it is often neceſſary to purge with jalap, or aloes, and ſometimes even to let blood: when theſe have been uſed, and likewiſe when they have not been neceſſary, ſtimulating medicines are to be uſed. A table-ſpoonful of muſtard-ſeed may be the firſt, which will give the patient a gentle vomiting; after this, any of the following may be tried, as they may beſt ſuit: from one to two tea-ſpoonfuls of vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile tincture of guaiacum in water, three times a-day; or ten drops of tincture of cantharides, three times a-day in broth or mucilage; ten drops of ſpirit of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine in honey, three times a-day; infuſions of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſh and muſtard; electricity; frictions; external applications of ſpirit of ſal ammoniac and oil; appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of flies, made by putting a lump of bliſter-plaiſter to twice as much common wax and oil plaiſter; and laſtly, by drinking the water of Berkley ſprings, which is probably as effectual as any.</p>

                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> Exceſſive exertions, heat, large evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exceſſive paſſions, as fear, anger, joy, &amp;c. ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly depriving the body of any compreſſion, diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or pain, that it has been for ſome time accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, violent pain, affections of the ſtomach, diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſmells, ſights, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Sometimes a languor, an anxiety, a gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and dimneſs precede; at other times the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes on ſuddenly; the patient turns pale, ſinks away, and appears dead; the pulſe being either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, or very low; the breathing in the ſame ſtate.</p>
                     <p>A cold ſweat often breaks out, and ſtands in drops upon the patient's forehead, which is as cold as a
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029891_0080_0FE2C5A19B0B89C8"/>corpſe. After lying a few minutes in that ſtate, the patient begins to recover, and vomits, or is ſick at the ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be laid out on a hard bed, in a ſtream of cool air. If the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires attention, it is to be removed as quick as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> The patient ſhould have his face ſprinkled with cold water, and his hands, arms, and legs rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the direction of the circulation, that is, towards the heart. Hartſhorn ſhould be applied to the noſe and temples, and twenty or thirty drops given inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. As ſoon as the patient begins to recover, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good wine ſhould be given him, and if much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility remains afterwards, it ſhould be removed by bark.</p>

DYSPEPSY, OR CONFIRMED INDIGESTION.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAUSES.</hi> The large uſe of coffee, tea, or any warm watery drinks, of tobacco, ardent ſpirits, opium, bitters, ſpices, and acids; putreſcent food, over-eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, frequent unneceſſary vomiting or purging: ſome diſorders, as intermittent fevers, fluxes, &amp;c.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> The great variety of ſymptoms in this affection together with the cauſes, is the reaſon that no two perſons are identically alike affected; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the general or fundamental ſymptoms are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike; theſe I ſhall ſet down; a loſs of appetite, diſtenſions of the ſtomach with wind, eructations after eating eſpecially, heart-burn, ſometimes a vomiting, frequent pains about the ſtomach, and often a dejected mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> Avoid all the cauſes, uſe the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible meat in ſmall quantities at a time, avoid all
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029891_0081_0FE2C5A95AA4FFC8"/>flatulent vegetables, uſe wine and water, brandy and water, or porter, if it will fit well on the ſtomach; uſe gentle, conſtant, and varied exerciſe, taking care to avoid expoſure in cold or damp weather.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> This is either palliative or radical; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not to be expected in a ſhort time, nor at all, unleſs with great attention.</p>
                     <p>The palliative conſiſts in removing the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable feelings from time to time.</p>
                     <p>The moſt troubleſome ſymptoms are the wind and acid on the ſtomach, and the coſtiveneſs: for the wind and acid, a little magneſia, chalk or lime-water, with ſome eſſence of mint, ſhould be taken occaſionally.</p>
                     <p>For the coſtiveneſs, the patient ſhould be provided with a box of pills made with jalap or rhubarb; or with extract of white walnut bark, theſe may be taken occaſionally; riding over agreeble country ſeats, is one of the moſt effectual remedies againſt a dejected mind.</p>
                     <p>For the radical cure, we are to attempt the removal of the debility in the fibres of the ſtomach; for which purpoſe the waters of Berkley ſprings, or of any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeute ſprings, are the moſt promiſing: when theſe cannot be uſed, any of the following medicines may be uſed, as ſhall beſt ſuit. Half a wine glaſs full three times a day, of the tincture No. 7. or two tea-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of No. 8. in a little water, or in ſpirit and water, three times a day; or twelve grains of columbo root three or four times a-day; or a table-ſpoonful of the tincture of bark, No. 4. three times a-day.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Management,</hi> If any ſubſtance is lodged in the parts primarily affected, it ſhould be removed immediately: the patient ſhould be kept warm, and fed upon ſuch food as can be got down. In ſome caſes, it would be adviſable to draw a lower tooth, to make a paſſage for the food; wine and water is the moſt proper drink.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> It will be proper to remove a toe, or any ſmall part, if that be the place of the wound, and to dreſs this, or whatever part may be hurt, with a ſtrong ſuppurating ſalve, as baſilicon (which is compoſed of roſin and wax, with a ſufficiency of oil to ſoften it) hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt ſprinkled it with red precipitate: or if theſe things are not to be had, a little warm oil of turpentine.</p>
                     <p>The patient's bowels ſhould be opened with caſtor oil, or with jalap, and kept open; after this he ſhould have one drachm of ſtrong mercurial ointment rubbed into his thighs and arms, morning, noon and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, till he ſpits freely: after this it may be uſed every other day, ſo as juſt to keep up a ſpitting for a week or more, if the ſymptoms continue. A pill of one grain of opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>um may be given frequently to eaſe the pain. If the patient grows weak, he ſhould take the bark as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as he poſſibly can, and in as great quantities as his ſtomach will bear, without raiſing his pulſe too much. It will be proper to continue the medicines in ſmaller quantities, for ſome time after the affection has gone off.</p>
                     <p>IF the ſore is brought in the beginning to ſuppurate, the locked Jaw need not be feared.</p>

                        </gap>s of the ſkull; oſſification of the membranes of the brain; acrimony of the fluids from contagion, degeneracy, &amp;c. paſſions, as anger, fear; ſtrong imagination of diſagreeable objects, and the ſight of ſuch; congeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of blood in the brain, produced by a plethoric ſtate, by long continued ſun-heat on the head; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication, ſurfeit, &amp;c. irritations proceeding from worms: teething; ſplinters in the fleſh; fractured bones; ſtones in the kidney; the matter of ulcers; poiſons, &amp;c. and laſtly, large evacuations of blood.</p>
                     <p>It will readily appear, that many of the above cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es do not produce fits generally; and hence there muſt be a prediſpoſition in thoſe, in whom they will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion them. A prediſpoſition conſiſts either in a great mobility of the muſcular ſyſtem, or in a relaxed ſtate of the veſſels of the brain, which allows of their being eaſily forced beyond their power, and admitting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="7 letters">

                        </gap>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> Sometimes the patient feels indiſpoſed for ſome time before the attack, with head-ach, gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, fulneſs of the head, ſluggiſhneſs, &amp;c. at other times the fit attacks without warning; the perſon falls down, and is variouſly agitated, ſometimes one ſide more than the other; his tongue is often thruſt out of his mouth, and by that means is bit almoſt or quite through: after continuing ſome minutes in this ſtate, his convulſions ceaſe, and he lies ſome time in a ſleepy ſtate, and then returns to himſelf, not knowing what has paſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> It will be proper to hold the patient, ſo as to keep him from hurting himſelf, and to put a piece of thick leather between his teeth, to keep him from injuring his tongue. It is ſeldom or never neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to preſcribe any diet for the patient, except in
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029891_0084_0FE2C5BA9A00EFC8"/>the intervals, when it is to be ſuited to his ſtate. If fulneſs is the cauſe of the fits, or he is of a full habit, a low vegetable diet, with hard exerciſe, ſhould be uſed; but for a contrary ſtate, a nouriſhing diet and conſtant gentle exerciſe is to be uſed. The cauſes ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>poſſible be removed by operations or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſuited to the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> In full habits, a bleeding will be proper during the fit, or preceding it. However, if they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently return, it will not do to bleed every time, but give a doſe of ſalts in its ſtead, at the time the patient expects the return. Beſides this, very little can be done, except to adhere ſtrictly to the management directed, and to have an iſſue put in the back of the neck.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe of thin habits, when ſeveral fits return quickly after one and the other, that is in one day, it will be proper to give twenty drops of laudanum; to have him bathed in warm water, and a warm milk and water clyſter injected two or three times a-day. All this may be repeated if neceſſary, in ſix or eight hours after.</p>
                     <p>But the chief thing conſiſts in removing the mobility or irritability mentioned in the cauſe. For this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> irritations, the removal of the cauſe is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. But it is lamentable, that ſome of the cauſes cannot be removed; as that from bony protuberances into the brain, &amp;c. for ſuch there is no remedy. But it is very probable, that the number of fits will be greatly leſſened by temperance, and avoiding extremes on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand.</p>

It is apt to terminate in palſy. Children from eight to twelve are the ſubjects of it.</p>

If this does not have the deſired effect, a bliſter ſhould be laid on the breaſt, and a large bundle of mint, ſtewed in wine or ſpirit, laid over and about it. The patient ſhould be kept as warm as he can, ſo as not to be diſagreeable. Great care ſhould be taken to avoid the night air, and acid fruits, which rather promote the ſecretion of bile, than correct it when ſecreted.</p>
                     <p>This ſame diſorder, with very little variety, is very common to children in large towns. They ſhould be immediately carried out into the country air, without
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029891_0089_0FE2C5D869C04350"/>waiting for an alteration of the diſorder, and alſo dipt in water freſh from the well. For a medicine, they may have, if five years old, thirty drops of laudanum put into half of the mixture, No. 2. One tea-ſpoonful of this and one of weak mint water, may be taken eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry half hour, for three or four times: the mint as above may be immediately applied to the ſtomach: but the chief dependance is to be put in port wine, given every hour, and increaſing the doſe; one tea-ſpoonful is enough to begin with. After the diſorder has gone off, bark or columbo, ſhould be taken to ſtrengthen the ſtomach.</p>

In the intervals, the patient ſometimes lies in a ſleepy ſtate, at other times comes to herſelf and talks. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they continue for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould be kept from hurting herſelf during the fit; her food ſhould be of the lighteſt kinds. If ſhe is full, nothing but water drinks ſhould be uſed, but if otherwiſe, ſhe ſhould have wine and water: exerciſe is of material conſequence to prevent relapſes.</p>

Thoſe who are in this latter caſe, ſhould uſe bark, ſteel or bitters, with a nouriſhing diet, and gentle exerciſe, to prevent returns; whilſt thoſe who are in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſtate, ſhould live abſtemiouſly, heap their bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els upon, and uſe much exerciſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SYMPTOMS.</hi> The wound feſters, and after ſome time, ſeldom under a week or two, the patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes languid and dejected. He then begins to dread water, and cannot ſwallow it without great agonies and convulſions of the face; after ſome time he cannot bear the ſight of it. He dozes, and every now and then ſtarts from his ſlumber; and ſometimes raves ſo as to need confinement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> The wound ſhould be cut out, if it is on a part that admits of it; if not, let it be filled with gun powder, and this burned; after which it ſhould be kept open for a month, by ſprinkling it with red pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, and dreſſing it with a ſalve made with wax, oil and roſin. But if this has been neglected, there is no way left, but to ſalivate the patient, by rubbing one drachm of mercurial ointment on him every ſix hours till he ſpits freely; after which it may be applied every other night, ſo as to keep up a plentiful ſpitting for a week or ten days. This, if done in time, will often prevent the affection.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Symptoms.</hi> A ſuppreſſion of urine, drought, ſwelling of the belly, or the body in general, which uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the impreſſion of the finger; towards the end fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029891_0092_0FE2C5EA5DDD1888"/>come on with a looſeneſs, which puts a period to the patient's miſerable life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould live upon light di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible food, and obſerve the greateſt regularity: his drink ſhould be wine and water, if he is thin or debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: gentle exerciſe ſhould be conſtantly uſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> It will be very well in the beginning, if the patient's ſtate admits of it, to give two or three ſmall purges, compoſed of twenty grains of jalap, with a quarter of an ounce of cream of tartar: if this does not anſwer, we ſhould try medicines that promote the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſecretion; for which purpoſe two grains of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſquills may be given, twice a-day: or half an ounce of cream of tartar diſſolved in a quart of water, may be taken in the courſe of the morning. An infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of horſe-radiſh and garlic, in ſpirit, has been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of uſe; alſo ſtrong cider, iron flakes, and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard-ſeed put together.</p>
                     <p>From ten to twenty drops of an infuſion of tobacco, in a little mint-water, twice a-day, have been uſed with ſucceſs: alſo a tea-ſpoonful of ſalt-petre in a little gin, twice a day.</p>
                     <p>If none of the above medicines have the deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there is but little chance of a recovery. However, after every thing elſe has been tried to no purpoſe, rubbing the belly, when the dropſy affects that part, with warm oil for a long while, every day, before a fire, has proved effectual.</p>
                     <p>Bitters and ſteel are always uſeful, and ſhould be taken with the other medicines, only at another hour.</p>
                     <p>There is a kind of dropſy, which affects only the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the breaſt, which is known by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>SYMPTOMS.</hi> It makes its appearance generally between the ninth and twenty-fourth month, in the following manner; the child becomes ſedate, and grows lean, whilſt the head grows ſomewhat out of form; the teeth come out ſlowly, turn black, and fall out: in a little time the child becomes altogether miſhapen, ſome parts growing whilſt others pine away: the ſtools are liquid; and after a conſiderable time, a fever comes on, which continues till it puts an end to the pitiable object.</p>
                     <p>But when it is not ſo bad, the child recovers as he grows, till he recovers all but his ſhape.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The child ſhould not be kept longer than uſual at the breaſt, he ſhould have a portion of meat for his diet, much tea ſhould be avoided: he ſhould be carried out every day for exerciſe, when the weather permits, and great attention ſhould be paid to keeping him clean</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> If the weather is not very cold, let the child be dipped every morning in water immediately from the well: give him a tea-ſpoonful of the tincture No. 7. three or four times a-day, and let him take two or three grains of rhubarb, when coſtive.</p>
                     <p>Bark is alſo a good medicine, if the child can be prevailed on to take it.</p>
                     <p>If there is much acid on the ſtomach, give a little crabs eyes, or magneſia.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Management.</hi> The patient ſhould live moſtly on vegetables, except when very thin. Gentle exerciſe ſhould be conſtantly uſed; the drink ſhould be wine and water, when in the above ſtate, but if full, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but water ſhould be uſed. The patient ſhould carefully avoid cold and moiſture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> A gentle emetic ſhould be tried, and if it is of ſervice, or does not do harm, it ſhould be repeated; this is beſt ſuited where there are gall-ſtones: but if the liver be obſtructed, the patient ſhould take one grain of calomel, every night and morning, till his gums feel ſore. When much pain attends, twelve or fifteen drops of laudanum may be given twice a-day.</p>
                     <p>Bitters are often uſeful; alſo elixir of vitriol, to forty drops a-day. Soap has ſometimes been uſeful, taken in pills; but the chief dependence is to be put in diet and exerciſe.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHEN man came firſt out of the hands of the great Creator, clothed in body as well as in ſoul, with immortality and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, there was no place for phyſic, or the art of healing. As he knew no ſin, ſo he knew no pain, no ſickneſs, weakneſs, or bodily diſorder. The habitation wherein the angelic mind, the Divinae particula Aurae abode, though originally formed out of the duſt of the earth was liable to no decay. It had no ſeeds of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or diſſolution within itſelf. And there was nothing without to injure it: Heaven and earth and all the hoſts of them were mild, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign and friendly to human nature. The entire creation was at peace with man, ſo long as man was at peace with his Creator. So that well might
<q>the morning ſtars ſing together, and all the ſons of God ſhout for joy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſince man rebelled againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of heaven and earth, how entirely is the ſcene changed! The incorruptible frame hath put on corruption, the immortal has put on
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:029891_0102_0FE2C62DA2C3EAE8"/>mortality. The ſeeds of weakneſs and pain. of ſickneſs and death, are now lodged in our inmoſt ſubſtance; whence a thouſand diſorders continually ſpring, even without the aid of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal violence. And how is the number of theſe increaſed by every thing round about us! The heavens, the earth, and all things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, conſpire to puniſh the rebels againſt their Creator. The ſun and moon ſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome influences from above; the earth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hales poiſonous damps from beneath; the beaſts of the field, the birds of the air, the fiſhes of the ſea, are in a ſtate of hoſtility: the air itſelf that ſurrounds us on every ſide, is replete with the ſhafts of death: yea, the food we eat, daily ſaps the foundation of the life which cannot be ſuſtained without it. So has the Lord of all ſecured the execution of his decree,—
<q>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But can there nothing be found to leſſen thoſe inconveniencies, which cannot be wholly removed? To ſoften the evils of life, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in part the ſickneſs and pain to which we are continually expoſed? Without queſtion there may. One grand preventative of pain and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of various kinds, ſeems intimated by the great Author of nature in the very ſentence that intails death upon us:
<q>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, till thou return to the ground.</q>
The power of exerciſe, both to preſerve and reſtore health, is greater than can well be conceived; eſpecially in thoſe who add temperance thereto; who if they do not confine themſelves altogether to eat either "bread or the herb of the field" (which God does not require them to do) yet ſteadily obſerve both that kind
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:029891_0103_0FE2C6337066CAF8"/>and meaſure of food, which experience ſhews to be moſt friendly to ſtrength and health.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is probable, phyſic, as well as religion, was in the firſt ages chiefly traditional: every father delivering down to his ſons, what he had himſelf in like manner received, concerning the manner of healing both outward hurts, and the diſeaſes incident to each climate, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which were of the greateſt efficacy for the cure of each diſorder. It is certain, this is the method wherein the art of healing is preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Americans to this day. Their diſeaſes are exceeding few; nor do they often occur, by reaſon of their continual exerciſe, and (till of late) univerſal temperance. But if any are ſick, or bit by a ſerpent, or torn by a wild beaſt, the fathers immediately tell their children what remedy to apply. And it is rare that the patient ſuffers long; thoſe medicines being quick, as well as, generally, infallible.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence it was, perhaps, that the ancients, not only of Greece and Rome, but even of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations, uſually aſſigned phyſic a divine original. And indeed it was a natural thought, that HE who had taught it to the very beaſts and birds, the Cretan Stag, the Egyptian Ibis, could not be wanting to teach man,
<q>Sanctius his animal, mentiſque capacius altae:</q>
Yea, ſometimes even by thoſe meaner creatures: for it was eaſy to infer, "If this will heal that creature, whoſe fleſh is nearly of the ſame tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with mine, then in a parallel caſe it will heal me." The trial was made: the cure was wrought: and experience and phyſic grew up together.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:029891_0104_0FE2C638C6EA1C70"/>6. As to the manner of uſing the medicines here ſet down, I ſhould adviſe, As ſoon as you know your diſtemper (which is very eaſy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in a complication of diſorders, and then you would do well to apply to a phyſician that fears God) <hi>Firſt,</hi> Uſe the firſt of the remedies for that diſeaſe, which occurs in the enſuing collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (unleſs ſome other of them be eaſier to be had, and then it may do juſt as well). <hi>Secondly,</hi> After a competent time, if it takes no effect, uſe the ſecond, the third, and ſo on. I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſet down (in moſt caſes) ſeveral remedies for each diſorder; not only becauſe all are not equally eaſy to be procured at all times, and in all places: but likewiſe the medicine that cures one man, will not always cure another of the ſame diſtemper. Nor will it cure the ſme man at all times. Therefore it was neceſſary to have a variety. However I have ſubjoined the letter <hi>(I)</hi> to thoſe medicines which ſome think infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Obſerve all the time the greateſt exactneſs in your regimen or manner of living. Abſtain from all mixed, all high-ſeaſoned food. Uſe plain diet, eaſy of digeſtion; and this as ſparingly as you can, conſiſtent with eaſe and ſtrength. Drink only water, if it agrees with your ſtomach; if not, good, clear ſmall beer. Uſe as much exerciſe daily in the open air, as you can without wearineſs. Sup at ſix or ſeven on the lighteſt food; go to bed early, and riſe betimes. To perſevere with ſteadineſs in this courſe, is often more than half the cure. Above all, add to the reſt (for it is not labour loſt) that old unfaſhionable medicine, prayer. And have faith in God who
<q>
                        <hi>killeth and maketh alive, who bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:029891_0105_0FE2C61850ED0DB8"/>7. For the ſake of thoſe who deſire, through the bleſſing of God, to retain the health which they have recovered, I have added a few plain, eaſy rules, chiefly tranſcribed from Dr. Cheyne.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. 1. The air we breathe is of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to our health. Thoſe who have been long abroad in eaſterly or northerly winds, ſhould drink ſome thin and warm liquor going to bed, or a draught of toaſt and water.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tender people ſhould have thoſe who lie with them, or are much about them, ſound, ſweet, and healthy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Every one that would preſerve health, ſhould be as clean and ſweet as poſſible in their houſes, clothes, and furniture.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. 1. The great rule of eating and drinking, is, To ſuit the quality and quantity of the food to the ſtrength of our digeſtion; to take always ſuch a ſort and ſuch a meaſure of food, as fits light and eaſy on the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All pickled, or ſmoked, or ſalted food, and all high-ſeaſoned, are alone unfit for aliment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nothing conduces more to health, than abſtinence and plain food, with due labour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For ſtudious perſons, about eight ounces of animal food, and twelve of vegetable, in twenty four hours, are ſufficient.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Water, though the wholeſomeſt of all drinks, yet if uſed largely in time at digeſtion, is injurious.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Strong, and more eſpecially ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, are a certain, though ſlow, poiſon, unleſs well diluted, and cautiouſly uſed.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:029891_0106_0FE2C63CCEE504D0"/>7. Experience ſhews, there is very ſeldom any danger in leaving them off all at once; unleſs in time of particular diſeaſes, as of debility.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Strong liquors do not prevent the miſchiefs of a ſurfeit, nor carry it off ſo ſafely as water.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Malt liquors (except clear ſmall beer, or ſmall ale, of a due age) are exceeding hurtful to tender perſons.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Coffee and tea are extremely hurtful to perſons who have weak nerves.</p>
                  <p n="3">III 1. All perſons ſhould eat very light ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; and that two or three hours before going to bed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To go to bed about nine, and riſe at five, ſhould be a general practice.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. 1. A due degree of exerciſe is indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to health and long life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Walking is the beſt exerciſe for thoſe who are able to bear it; riding for thoſe who are not. The open air, when the weather is fair contributes much to the benefit of exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may ſtrengthen any weak part of the body by conſtant exerciſe. Thus the lungs may be ſtrengthened by moderate ſpeaking; the digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the nerves, by riding; the arms and hams, by ſtrongly rubbing them daily.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſtudious ought to have ſtated times for exerciſe, at leaſt two or three hours a-day: the one half of this before dinner, the other before going to bed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They ſhould frequently ſhave, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently waſh their feet in cold water.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:029891_0107_0FE2C64226EB6100"/>6. Thoſe who read or write much, ſhould learn to do it chiefly ſtanding; otherwiſe it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their health.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The fewer cloathes any one uſes, by day or night, the hardier he will be; but the habit muſt be begun in youth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Exerciſe, firſt, ſhould be always on an empty ſtomach; ſecondly, ſhould never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to wearineſs; thirdly, after it, we ſhould take care to cool by degrees: otherwiſe we ſhall catch cold.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The fleſh-bruſh is a moſt uſeful exerciſe, eſpecially to ſtrengthen any part that is weak.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Cold bathing is of great advantage to health: it prevents abundance of diſeaſes. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes perſpiration, helps the circulation of the blood, and prevents the danger of catching cold. Tender people ſhould pour water upon the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go in, and walk in ſwiftly. To jump in with the head foremoſt, is too great a ſhock to nature. It is beſt to uſe it immediately after riſing.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. 1. Coſtiveneſs cannot long conſiſt with health. Therefore care ſhould be taken to remove it at the beginning by a gentle medicine; and when it is removed, to prevent its return, by ſoft, cool, open diet; as of vegetables, acid or ſweet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſtructed perſpiration (vulgarly called catching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>old) is one great ſource of diſeaſes. Whenever there appears the leaſt ſign of this, let it be removed by gentle ſweats, or purges.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. 1. The paſſions have a greater influence on health, than moſt people are aware of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All violent and ſudden paſſions diſpoſe to, or actually throw people into, acute diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="x" facs="unknown:029891_0108_0FE2C64770FA1600"/>3. The ſlow and laſting paſſions, ſuch as grief and hopeleſs love, bring on chronic diſeaſes, and low fevers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Till the paſſion which cauſed the diſeaſe, is calmed, medicine is applied in vain.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The love of God, as it is the ſovereign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of all miſeries, ſo in particular it effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prevents all the bodily diſorders the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions introduce, by keeping the paſſions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within due bounds. And by the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, and perfect calm, ſerenity, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity it gives the mind, it becomes the moſt powerful of all the means of health and long life.</p>

                  <p>THE grand intereſts of your ſouls will ever lie near our hearts; but we cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of your bodies: In ſeveral parts of this extenſive country, the climate, and in others the food, is unwholeſome: and frequently, the phyſicians are few, ſome of them unſkilful, and all of them beyond the reach of your temporal abilities. A few ſmall publications excepted, little has been done by phyſical books, in order to remove theſe inconveniencies: and even thoſe have been written in Europe, and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore partake of the confined ideas of the writers, who could not poſſibly be fully acquainted with the peculiarities of the various diſeaſes incident to a people that inhabit a country ſo remote from theirs.</p>
                  <p>Simple remedies are in general the moſt ſafe for ſimple diſorders, and ſometimes do wonders under the bleſſing of God. In this view we preſent to you now the PRIMITIVE PHYSIC, publiſhed by our much honoured friend JOHN WESLEY. But the difference being in many

                  <p>In this ſtate we lay the publication before you, and earneſtly recommend it to you</p>
                  <p>As we apply all the profits of our books to charitable purpoſes, and the promoting the work of God, we think we have ſome right to intreat you (except in particular caſes) to buy only our books, which are recommended by the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſigned with our ſignatures: and as we intend to print our books in future WITHIN THE STATES, and on a much larger ſcale than we have hitherto done, we truſt we ſhall be able ſoon to ſupply you with as many of the choiceſt of our publications, as the time and temporal abilities of thoſe of you, who do not live a life of ſtudy, will require.</p>

                     <head>2. For an Ague.<note n="*" place="bottom">An ague is an intermitting fever, each fit of which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a cold ſhivering, and goes off in a ſweat.</note>
                     </head>
                     <p>Go into the cold bath juſt before the cold fit.</p>
                     <p>☞ <hi>Nothing tends more to prolong an ague, than indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lazy indolent diſpoſition. The patient ought therefore between the fits to take as much exerciſe as he can bear; and to uſe a light diet, and for common drink, Port wine and water is the moſt proper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>* When all other means fail, give blue vitriol, from one grain to two grains, in the abſence of the fit, and repeat it three or four times in twenty-four hours.</p>
                     <p>Or, boil yarrow in new milk, till it is tender enough to ſpread as a plaiſter. An hour before the cold fit, apply this to the wriſts, and let it be on till the hot fit is over. If another fit comes, uſe a freſh plaiſter. This often cures a quartan:</p>
                     <p>* Or, put a tea-ſpoonful of ſalt of tartar into a large glaſs of ſpring water, and drink it by little and little. Repeat the ſame doſe the next two days, before the time of the fit:</p>

                     <p>Or, eat a ſmall lemon, rind and all.</p>
                     <p>* In the hot fit, if violent, take eight or ten drops of laudanum: if coſtive, with an Anderſon's pill.</p>
                     <p>* Dr. Lind ſays, an ague is certainly cured by taking from ten to twenty drops of laudanum, with two drachms of ſyrup of poppies, in any warm liquid, half an hour after the heat begins.</p>
                     <p>* ☞ <hi>It is proper to take a gentle vomit, and ſometimes a purge, before you uſe any of theſe medicines. If a vomit is taken two hours before the fit is expected, it generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that fit, and ſometimes cures an ague: eſpecially in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.—It is alſo proper to repeat the medicine (whatever it be) about a week after, in order to prevent a relapſe. Do
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029891_0113_0FE2C660F90215F0"/>not take any purge ſoon after.—The daily uſe of the fleſh-bruſh, and frequent cold bathing, are of great uſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent relapſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>* Children have been cured by wearing a waiſt-coat, in which bark was quilted.</p>
                     <p>[Thoſe fevers which abate their violence at times, that there appears an abſence of the fever for a certain period between two fits, are called intermittents, ſays Galen. The length of the period determines the name, as quotidian, tertian, double tertian, quartan. The ſpring intermittents ſeldom need the grand ſpecific remedy, viz. The Peruvian bark, in this climate, as by adminiſtering a vomit of twenty grains of ipeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuana, or of eight grains of the former and one of tartar emetic mixed for a grown perſon, the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of the ſeaſon effects the cure, and often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out medicine. The fall intermittents ſeldom put on a regular form at firſt in adults, but are generally remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fevers; but even though they approach nearer to a continual fever, the patient ſeldom needs bleeding, and perhaps never in regular intermittents. In either caſe a vomit as before mentioned, the firſt opportunity in remitting, and two hours before the fit in an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever, with warm diluting drinks in the time of the fit, and when intermitting regularly, the bark may be applied after the operation of the vomit, and the fit is over. Children generally need only to be purged before the uſe of the bark, with jalap or rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb: the doſe of theſe may be thirty grains for a grown perſon, and half the quantity for one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <p>☞ The firſt twenty teeth generally laſt till the ſixth or ſeventh year. After that till the fourteenth or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth ear, they fall out one by one, and are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by others.</p>
                     <p>The ſheding of the teeth is wiſely intended, and brought about in a ſingular manner. Their hardneſs will not admit of diſtention like other parts of the body. Hence, after an enlargement of the jaw-bone, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal teeth are no longer able to fill up the cavities of it. They muſt ſtand unſupported by each other, and leave ſpaces between them. Under the firſt teeth therefore is placed a new ſet, which by conſtantly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon their roots, rob them of their nouriſhment, and finally puſh them out of their ſockets.</p>
