         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM extreamly ſurpriſed and ſorry (with many others) to ſee your printed Letter of Remarks, on the publick Teſtimony of the late Reverend Convention: More eſpecially for the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety (as I humbly conceive) of your appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Head of this Controverſy, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new Scene of Diſputation; and for the intemperate Spirit and Deſign you ſeem to diſcover in the whole Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt confeſs, I ſhould have ſooner expected ſuch a Letter of Remarks from almoſt any other Miniſter in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince than from your ſelf, not from the leaſt Apprehenſion of Inſufficiency for the Task, but conſidering the Spirit of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and Separation that hath unhappily come upon you with reſpect to your Reverend Brethren, which meeting with a Temper, not perhaps the moſt flexible, is not eaſily overcome and ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>I believe, it is evident to all ſober unprejudiced Readers, that you <hi>occupied the Room</hi> of a Remarker under a Spirit of too much Reſentment to ſerve the Cauſe you eſpouſe, or your own Credit that is engag'd in it. Some of your good Friends would doubtleſs have excuſed this Labour— (all Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) with <hi>a Maſter ſpare thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:005202_0003_1016E3042E98B218"/>
I'm ſenſible, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'tis no eaſy Taſk for Gentlemen, even of a <hi>cool Spirit,</hi> when dipt in Controverſy, to keep their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſweet and pleaſant, and <hi>know what Spirit they are of.</hi> And doubtleſs, with all your Attainments in Knowledge and Grace, you have been exerciſed herein to ſuppreſs the Workings of that <hi>Spirit that luſteth to Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, that when you come to reflect, in the cool of the Day, on your Performance, you will ſee Reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſome Things, which, if I miſtake not, are written in a haſty Spirit, and which tend not to the Uſe of edifying.</p>
            <p>Some of your Friends are very jealous leſt the <hi>Archers</hi> ſhould hit and ſorely wound you under your preſent feeble and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken State, but I would hope better Things, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Strife of Tongues;</hi> endeavouring to ſtir up my ſelf and my <hi>reverend Brethren</hi> by Way of Remembrance of that ſacred Admonition, <hi>A ſoft Anſwer turneth away Wrath; but griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Words ſtir up Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> my principal Deſign in this Eſſay (however unequal to it) is to point out ſome Inſtances of that intemperate Spirit and Zeal which ſeem to run thro' your Letter, and which I fear led you into ſome unhappy Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>I think it muſt be owing to ſuch a Spirit and Zeal, that you ſo haſtily catch'd at a Shadow of Reaſon for attaching Dr. CHAUNCY on <hi>the Title-Page</hi> of <hi>the Teſtimony,</hi> particularly for publiſhing it with SUCH A POMPOUS AND DELUSIVE TITLE. But the <hi>Dr's</hi> handſome Vindication of himſelf, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your Retractation, forbid all further Remarks upon this Head.</p>
            <p>You are careful to repreſent <q>the Danger that Strangers may be in, of being miſled into this falſe Judgment, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that our anniverſary Convention is to be conſidered as a formed Body of all the Paſtors of the Churches in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> acting in their eccleſiaſtical Character, whoſe Determinations are to be regarded as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſome ſpecial Power and Authority with them, like that of a <hi>provincial Synod.</hi>
               </q> And then add, <q>that our <hi>annual Convention is an Aſſembly of Paſtors meerly occaſional, &amp;c,</hi> Page 4, 5.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:005202_0004_1016E33D81E33B08"/>
Now <hi>Sir,</hi> Is it not your Deſign by thus induſtriouſly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Weakneſs of our <hi>anniverſary Convention</hi> to weaken the Influence of their late ſolemn Teſtimony againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Diſorders of theſe Times? And do you think to <hi>do GOD Service</hi> by thus enervating the <hi>Force of thoſe right Words,</hi> as coming from a conſiderable Number of the Senior, very judicious and pious <hi>Paſtors</hi> of theſe Churches?</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing it be really ſo (which I don't deny), How came you, reverend Brother, eight Years ago to ſeparate your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the <hi>Convention,</hi> not only <hi>viva voce,</hi> but by a <hi>drawn Inſtrument</hi> which you read before many Witneſſes?</p>
            <p>And I can't help remarking here that when you appeared, and offered to ſpeak at <hi>the late Convention,</hi> you was pleaſed to put the Convention upon proving this notorious Fact, which not a little ſurpriſed and moved many of your <hi>Fathers and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Wherefore ſuffer me to expoſtulate with you reverend Brother.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Whether the haſty Temper you diſcover in your Letter towards Dr. CHAUNCY be not owing, in ſome Meaſure, to his openly oppoſing your ſpeaking in the late <hi>Convention,</hi> 'till you were pleaſed to make ſome Retractation of your former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in ſeparating from it?</item>
               <item>2. Whether when it was propoſed by ſome <hi>reverend Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> there preſent, that if you would pleaſe to declare you then ſpake as a Member of this Convention, you ſhould have all Liberty of Speech, you did not haſtily refuſe in the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heat of Spirit?</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <q>Another falſe judgment upon Matters of Fact into which you think many Readers may be led, is this, namely, That none but ſuch as are Paſtors of the Churches of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> were admitted to Vote in the late Convention, whereas 'tis well known that others were admitted to Vote who are Paſtors of Churches beyond the Bounds of this Province, P. 6.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Repreſentation is evidently to ſhew the Inconſiſtency of the Stile of the <hi>Title-Page</hi> of <hi>this Teſtimony:</hi> But Sir, I challenge you upon this Point, viz.</p>
            <p>To produce above one Inſtance of a Paſtor of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Province, or Colony, that voted the Articles in the <hi>printed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005202_0005_1016E30834029B10"/>Teſtimony,</hi> particularly the laſt, upon which you inſiſt moſt. I don't indeed think there was ſo much as a ſingle Inſtance; to be ſure, I could not find one by diligent Search in the Time of it, and I heard ſeveral of the Paſtors in the Province of New-Hampſhire expreſly declare, the Evening after, that they did not vote; thoſe Gentlemen modeſtly excuſing and contenting themſelves with being Spectators only.</p>
            <p>What a ſlender Reaſon have you then for ſuppoſing as you do (Page 7.) <q>That the Majority in the laſt Vote (which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd ſuch Debates about the late Revival of Religion) was determined by them who are not Paſtors in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</q>? followed with another Suppoſition and Inſinuation, <q>that the Vote on the laſt Paragraph was the Execution of a Deſign among a Party.</q> Upon which I muſt expreſs my Grief for your Suggeſtion of the Prevalency of a Party-Spirit in ſuch an Aſſembly of Divines.</p>
            <p>Sir, having worn the <hi>Title-Page</hi> of <hi>this Inſtrument</hi> as you are pleas'd to call it, by ſpending near ſeven Pages of Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which the moſt of your Readers think you might as well have ſpared; You turn over a new Leaf, and attach the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> it ſelf, paſſing a ſevere Cenſure upon it as <q>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to have a good Effect for the Revival and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of real, vital and practical Religion:</q> Together with a plain Inſinuation that the Convention who formed it had not at Heart, nor were well acquainted with, the State of Religion in this Land for ſeveral Years paſt. And you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare it to be your Judgment, <q>that if we conſider it in <hi>the whole</hi> as a <hi>Teſtimony againſt Diſorders</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi> it pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully tends to <hi>unhappy Effects,</hi> both among them <hi>who live at a great Diſtance from us,</hi> and among <hi>our own Churches.</hi>
               </q> You add alſo, with great Freedom of Speech, <q>I know not, how any Thing could be better calculated and contrived to confirm the <hi>fallacious Accounts of the State of Religion in New-England,</hi> which have lately been ſent over to <hi>Scotland,</hi> by ſome virulent Oppoſers of the remarkable Work of GOD's Grace, which has been carrying on in various Parts of our Land, for ſome Years paſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Reverend Sir, I'm apt to think that the Charity that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Gentleman of your Character would diſpoſe you to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005202_0006_1016E343E2993168"/>put a better Conſtruction upon the Spirit and Conduct of the late <hi>Convention.</hi>—I'm very ſorty a Gentleman of your Station ſhould inſinuate, that the <hi>Convention</hi> inſtead of having the State of Religion at Heart in forming this <hi>Teſtimony, &amp;c.</hi> — were carrying on a Party Deſign to the Hurt and wounding of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion here, and confirming the <hi>fallacious Accounts of the State of Religion,</hi> that have been ſent abroad.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the <hi>florid Accounts,</hi> in Favour of this <hi>remarkable Work,</hi> that have been ſent into <hi>Scotland from hence,</hi> have not been perfectly free from the high Charge of Fallacy; at leaſt I Appeal to thoſe worthy Gentlemen themſelves that have been moſt early and pompous (not to ſay deluſive) in their Accounts of the flouriſhing State of Religion here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if they were to ſend over their Accounts under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Darkneſs and Diſorder attending the Work of GOD, they could in Conſcience make ſuch a perfect Work of it. It is evident beyond all Contradiction, that both the plauſible Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ſent from hence to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence to us, were drawn up too ſuddenly to give the World a juſt and ſober Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the State of Religion for ſome Years paſt, as if the worthy Authors were ſtriving for the Maſtery, who ſhould be firſt in this good Cauſe. It is obſervable that the Teſtimonies concerning the State of Religion in foreign Parts do as widely differ, as the Teſtimonies that are given of it from among our ſelves; and it is no eaſy Matter to ſift out the Truth: Nor do I at all wonder, that ſome ſerious and inquiſitive Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in <hi>Scotland</hi> are very deſirous of being informed of the true Sentiments of the Body of the Clergy of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince concerning it, which ſome may perhaps fear may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, both from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Appleton</hi>'s Convention <hi>Sermon,</hi> printed at the almoſt <hi>univerſal</hi> Deſire of the late <hi>Convention of Paſtors,</hi> and alſo from their <hi>printed Teſtimony againſt the Errors and Diſorders in the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are pleaſed Sir (Page 8.) to mention ſeveral Authors of theſe <hi>fallacious Accounts,</hi> whoſe Vindication it is not my Buſineſs to attempt, neither do I ſuppoſe they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it of me conſidering their own Abilities to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Only, you muſt excuſe me if I ſay you appear to do it with a Sneer, as if the Characters of ſome of them were ſo
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005202_0007_1016E2D580651300"/>exceptionable as to render their Accounts ſuſpected; but Truth is great, and may be ſpoken by an Oppoſer.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſuffer me to remark here what, as far as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, is univerſally noticed, <hi>viz.</hi> That you would have done yourſelf much more Honour, if you had ſpared the Rev. Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> and your Marginal Note upon him. Don't you now really think ſo yourſelf, conſidering old Things that are paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away? Don't there ſeem to be one Ounce of the old Leaven in your Sowerneſs towards your late Rev. Colleague? If it be ſo, as a Man of GOD, you will diligently ſearch and purge it out.</p>
            <p>YOU, and others, in the ſame Way of thinking, may repreſent theſe Accounts in as dim a Light as you pleaſe, yet nothing is more notorious, than that within theſe two or three Years paſt, Antinomian and Familiſtical Errors, Enthuſiaſm, groſs Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſcandalous Diſorders of various Kinds, have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably prevailing in our Churches to the great Darkening and Hindrance of the Work of GOD. And true it is, that this printed Teſtimony of the late Convention tends to put this Matter beyond all Diſpute, and if it ſo happens that this Teſtimony contradicts ſome haſty Accounts of the late Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Religion in <hi>New-England</hi> that have been ſent abroad, why ſhould the Convention be blamed when they are called to make a faithful Declaration againſt the manifeſt Diſorders that have attended it.</p>
            <p>I can't imagine, Sir, how ſuch a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Diſorders</hi> ſhould tend to increaſe them, and obſtruct the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of GOD's Work, as you inſinuate and ſay, Page 10. I am more apt to think, it hath a direct Tendency to prevent the Growth of Errors; and ſo to promote the Work of GOD's Grace in the Land. And I'm confident, that if the Paſtors of theſe Churches had acted more cloſely up to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Tennent's Maxim, Principiis obſta, to cruſh the Cockatrice in the Egg,</hi> (and I wiſh he himſelf had begun ſooner to practiſe upon it) it would have been an excellent Preſervative againſt the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſorders of theſe Times; and ſo would have ſhortned, if not ſuperſeded <hi>the printed Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, I'm much confirmed in this Opinion, becauſe it is evident that in the Inſtance of Viſions and Trances, which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005202_0008_1016E3456BBF9D90"/>Miniſters in general were zealous to oppoſe at firſt, are I think univerſally ceaſed in the Land. Whereas, if they had been countenanced by a Number of the Leaders of this People, we had been furniſhed long ago with ſufficient to have made a <hi>Romiſh Legend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This makes me think, that the Silence of Miniſters in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a faithful and ſeaſonable Teſtimony againſt Diſorders is the blameable Cauſe of their Increaſe and Continuance among us. Many Paſtors of this Convention apprehended that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity was laid upon them now, at leaſt, to teſtify publickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe growing Diſorders: Neither have I any Reaſon to ſurmiſe, but that they form'd their Teſtimony from a ſerious and hearty Concern for the flouriſhing State of Religion in the Land.</p>
            <p>I would charitably hope with you, Reverend Sir, that many <q>among our ſelves have lately experienced a ſaving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to GOD; but muſt diſſent from you in <hi>ſuppoſing that they will be tempted to entertain Prejudices againſt their own Paſtors, as well as other Miniſters</hi>
               </q> becauſe they gave not a fuller Atteſtation to a remarkable Revival of Religion in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parts of the Land. I rather think ſuch as are true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts will judge their Paſtors faithful in making ſuch a Stand againſt prevailing Diſorders, which threaten to deſtroy the Work of GOD.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I've Reaſon to think that Multitudes in thoſe Places that have been rent with them, as well as others, had great Expectation of receiving ſuch a faithful Teſtimony from the late Convention of Paſtors; and I'm ſorely grieved that you raiſe and ſanctify Prejudices in the Minds of People upon this Head that may be in Danger of <hi>leavening the whole Lump.</hi> For 'tis very evident that the Minds of many are unhappily leavened with Prejudice already againſt their faithful Paſtors, and we need not help forward their Afflictions.</p>
            <p>You then proceed, <hi>Sir,</hi> (in <hi>Page</hi> 10) by Way of Preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Correction of the ſuppoſed bad Effects of this <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> both at Home and abroad to publiſhd to the World as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> (I) That ſcarce one third Part of the "Paſtors of the Churches of this Province were preſent at the "late Convention. True: And what then? Are they not
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005202_0009_1016E3514FC5D398"/>for all that properly ſtiled the Convention of Paſtors of this Province? Were there not as many preſent at this Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as has been known at any Time? I know very well that the Paucity of the Number has not been admitted as any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt their acting in ſome important Affairs, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in diſtributing the charitable Collection from Year to Year. Though if there be any Defect in the Diſtribution of it, I hope it will be remedied by preaching the Convention-Sermon for the future, at nine o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>You affirm alſo (2) <q>That of thoſe Paſtors who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it was but a ſmall Majority that voted the laſt Article or Paragraph, which cauſed ſuch Debates about an Atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Work of GOD's Grace, appearing of late Years in a remarkable Revival of Religion among theſe Churches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You then appeal, Sir, to the Rev. Moderator that <q>upon counting the Votes, when there were at leaſt <hi>ſeventy Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> preſent, he declared that <hi>Thirty Eight</hi> was the Number who voted in the Affirmative.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You offer ſeveral concurring Circumſtances to ſupport this Fact, and expreſs your Surpriſe to have heard this Point, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted and denied more than once by ſome, and at length you ſay, <q>You are perſwaded the Moderator will be ready at any Time to atteſt this Fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon, apprehending I had a juſt Right to be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of it, I ſent a Letter to the Rev. Moderator <hi>July</hi> 1. hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requeſting him to certify me of two Facts, very confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted in your Letter, about which I was of doubtful Mind; viz. The foremention'd Fact, and that mention'd in Page 3. of your <hi>printed Letter, whether he plainly told that Aſſembly, he could not ſubſcribe the Teſtimony for himſelf perſonally: Upon which there was a Vote for his ſigning it as Moderator.</hi> But that good Gentleman refuſed to give me any Satisfaction in either of theſe Points, in his Anſwer to me.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I am at a loſs how to account for the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Conduct, upon Suppoſition that he refuſed to <hi>ſubſcribe it for himſelf perſonally,</hi> who has been moſt famous of any in theſe Parts for a ſteady Oppoſer of the very Diſorders and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors mentioned in the Teſtimony; I obſerve this very much to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005202_0010_1016E348310FB528"/>his Honour, for by differencing between the Good and Evil, he, together with many others, have approved themſelves true Friends to the Work of GOD.</p>
            <p>But from all I can find after diligent Enquiry into this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is far otherwiſe; the Moderator, as his conſtant Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice has all along been, only expreſſed his Deſire, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that voted the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> ſhould ſubſcribe it with him, but it was voted that the Moderator ſhould ſign it alone; this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is the Truth of the Caſe.</p>
            <p>As to the other Fact about polling upon the laſt Paragraph of the Teſtimony, I will freely declare alſo what appears to me to be the whole Truth, viz, I believe the Moderator did count the Votes as you aſſert. But it was done ſometime after the Vote upon the laſt Article was paſſed, and after diverſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were gone off, ſuppoſing the Votes to have been now finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is what ſeveral Members of that Convention who vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Teſtimony, have told me for their Parts, and which I'm told, was the Caſe of ſeveral others who moved from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
            <p>Beſides, diverſe Gentlemen who never voted at all, in paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of thoſe Articles (ſome out of Principle, others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending they had no Right to vote) were counted on the Negative without any Diſtinction.</p>
            <p>I'll diſmiſs this Point with one Remark more, viz. That every one of the Articles in the <hi>printed Teſtimony</hi> relating to <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Diſorders</hi> were voted in the Affirmative by a very great Majority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rev. Sir,</hi> you would not have it thought <q>that the <hi>Committee,</hi> choſen to draw up a Report on this Occaſion, were all of them ſhutting out an Atteſtation to the late Work of God's holy Spirit among us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this I ſhall only remark two Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) That the Character of every one of that <hi>Rev. Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee</hi> is ſo well eſtabliſhed, as not to admit of the leaſt Doubt that they are Friends to the Work of GOD's Grace, and are always ready to ſet to their Seal to the Truth: Neither can I begin to think in my Heart, that we were <hi>in Perils by falſe Brethren</hi> at that Time, or that there is any Reaſon to cry out a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> a <hi>Confederacy</hi> againſt the Work of GOD.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005202_0011_1016E3541CC858E0"/>
(2) If any of that <hi>Rev. Committee</hi> were diſſatisfied at the Report, it would have been but fair and friendly in them to have made their Remonſtrance in Preſence of the <hi>Committee,</hi> before it was brought into public; which I've been informed was not the Caſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Rev. Sir,</hi> you then complain of it as <hi>undeniable Fact, (P. 3)</hi> 
               <q>That when Paſtors of an eſtabliſhed Character as Friends to the Cauſe of Truth and Holineſs, would have teſtified what they tho't concerning the late Revival of Religion in various Parts of the Land, they were interrupted in a rude Manner and treated with open Contempt.</q> 
               <hi>You go on to ſay</hi> 
               <q>is it not true in Fact, that many earneſt Pleas for their being heard were ſtifled in Clamour and Oppoſition?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rev. Brother,</hi> If ſuch an Aſſembly had indeed treated one another with ſo much Rudeneſs, Contempt and Clamour, would it not have been much more becoming your Character, inſtead of expoſing their Nakedneſs, to have ſilently covered it with a Mantle of Charity? That <hi>Charity which covereth a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But really Sir, I am not ſenſible that the Charge is juſt: I know there was too much intemperate Heat and Paſſion expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Gentlemen on both Sides of the Queſtion; and to the beſt of my Obſervation, full as much on one Side as t'other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was evident, that we are all <hi>Men of like Paſſions!</hi> Nay, you are the only Perſon, I ever heard ſpeak of the Behaviour of that Rev Gentleman you refer to (in the Margin) in the ſoft Language of a <hi>juſt Warmth of Reſentment,</hi> teſtifying againſt <q>the bad Spirit that appear'd to prevail in the Aſſembly, and the ill Treatment given to Paſtors, who only deſir'd a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient hearing, while they ſpake in Favour of the late Work of GOD's Grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, Paſtors had Liberty of Speech there in the Cauſe of GOD; and to the beſt of my Remembrance were generally treated with Reſpect and Decency.</p>
            <p>Its true, you was oppoſed ſpeaking in tat Convention, 'till you would be brought to ſay at leaſt, that you ſpake as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, which you refuſing to do, your Atteſtation was not received, and its generally thought, that Juſtice was done you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005202_0012_1016E349C2A71B90"/>
I muſt remark here, that ſeveral worthy Gentlemen on your Side of the Queſtion did not ſeem at that Time to be in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that <hi>Wiſdom, which is eaſy to be entreated.</hi> For after ſeveral Conceſſions were made on ſome Articles in the Report at their Deſire, it was publickly obſerved, that they did not vote one ſingle Article in the printed Teſtimony: For which extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Conduct you profeſs to give a Reaſon (in P. 12, 13) which poſſibly may be found wanting.</p>
            <p>You are not ignorant, Sir, that it was ſaid in the Debate, that the Time would not allow of every Members giving a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Account of the extraordinary Work in his own Place, which was one Reaſon of their not being heard more fully upon that Head, and did not proceed from a <hi>united</hi> Endeavour in the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to ſhut out an Atteſtatiion to the Work of GOD's holy Spirit among us.</hi> And to be plain, there was alſo a Jealouſy in the Minds of Gentlemen, who appear'd zealous for the Teſtimony, that the Rev. <hi>Proteſters</hi> ſpared no Pains to prevent the paſſing and Publication of it.</p>
            <p>Rev. Brother, as to your declaring publickly with great Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <q>that you are one of thoſe Miniſters in <hi>Boſton</hi> who, in Concurrence with a Number of Miniſters in the Country, have deſired and propoſed to have an Interview at <hi>Boſton the Day after the approaching Commencement;</hi>
               </q> That is in plain Engliſh, to have a <hi>ſeparate Convention,</hi> in order to give <hi>an open conjunct Teſtimony to the late happy Revival of Religion in many Parts of this Land.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe you heartily concur in this extraordinary Motion, and the rather, becauſe it is carrying on the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign you ſeem'd to project ever ſince you ſeparated in ſuch an extraordinary Manner from the Convention above ſeven Years ago, viz. <hi>The holding a ſeparate Convention:</hi> To prevent which, I am one of thoſe Paſtors which told you, dear Brother, at that Time, we would upon our Knees entreat your Continuance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, but we were unhappily diſappointed.</p>
            <p>The Projection, if I miſtake not, was to begin with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating the <hi>united Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Botſton,</hi> which happily fail'd by the kind Mediation of ſome of your Reverend Fathers and Brethren; and perhaps, I my ſelf was inſtrumental to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005202_0013_1016E355B9BDC8B8"/>reconcile them, though in a moſt ſecret, yet not leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and effectual Manner.</p>
            <p>But, Reverend Brother, Why do the Reverend Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men concerned in this Affair, appear ſo ſhy of ſubſcribing this Propoſal <hi>(for to do you Juſtice, you are the only Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has not acted behind the Curtain, by refuſing a Subſcription to this Account)</hi> and appointing <hi>the Place of Meeting</hi> for the deſigned Interview of Paſtors—both in the common News Letters and your own printed Letter—but oblige your Fathers and Brethren to <hi>call at the Place of your Abode for Information:</hi> Would it not have been much more fair, open and generous, to have given the moſt publick Notice of the Place of convening, that all your Reverend Fathers and Brethren might come to the Help of the common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have finiſhed my Remarks upon your Letter, in which I have ſincerely aim'd at declaring the whole Truth; and if I am miſtaken in any material Point, or have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Rules of Decency and Charity, I heartily deſire to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>And now, dear Brother, ſuffer me to expoſtulate with you on this <hi>melancholy Occaſion.</hi> Why do you ſtrive in this Manner to promote a <hi>ſeparate Convention?</hi> Will the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation be really promoted by it? Won't the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it be ſad and fatal to the true Intereſt of Piety? Won't the common Adverſary to Truth and Peace be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by ſuch Altercations between the Miniſters of our holy Religion?</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, let us take Heed of <hi>falling out by the Way. Let there be no Strife between the Miniſters of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>for we are Brethren: Let us love as Brethren, be pitiful and courteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, I am fully perſwaded that the moſt effectual Method, under GOD, to reduce GOD's People to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Temper of Mind, and the Order of the Goſpel, is for the Clergy to ſhew a reconciling and charitable Spirit, and firſt be reconciled among themſelves: then may they with a better Grace and Force addreſs the People to conſider
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005202_0014_1016E34B597B7FA0"/>and reform their Ways. And it is high Time for us all to attempt this; and may the GOD of Peace and Order in all the Churches of his Saints add his Bleſſing to our united Prayers and Endeavous to forward and accompliſh ſuch a glorious Deſign.</p>
            <p>Dear Brother, wiſhing you Health and all the Bleſſings and Comforts of a ſucceſsful Miniſtry, and deſiring your Prayers for me, that I may be in Health, and my Soul proſper; and that I may be prepared to give up a good Account of my Stewardſhip.</p>
