            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2d of Samuel, 3d Chap. and part of the 38th Verſe.</bibl>
               <q>"KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A GREAT MAN FALLEN?"</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN theſe words David refers to Abner, a diſtinguiſhed officer of his day, who fell an unſuſpecting victim to the well known traitorous ſcheme, and by the bloody hand of Joab, whoſe brother Aſahel, to ſave his own life, Abner had reluctantly ſlain in a battle at Gibeon. To awaken a correſpondent ſenſe of their great loſs in the afflicted Tribes, David addreſſed to them the pathetic inquiry adopted on this melancholy occaſion, as applying with the moſt forcible propriety to the late Lieutenant General GEORGE WASHINGTON. Know ye not that in him a great man, a much greater than Abner, is fallen? The ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently viſible effects of this penetrating conviction, render a compariſon of theſe great men unneceſſary, would the dignity of my ſubject, and the ſolemnity which reigns over this unexampled and overflowing concourſe admit it. Their coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in point of greatneſs, eſtabliſhed by the higheſt authorities, whatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity as to the degrees of it, may exiſt, is all that is requiſite to my purpoſe. In reliance therefore, on the plenitude of candor to which I am already greatly in arrears, however inadequate to the important ſervice which has unexpectedly devolved on me, and with all the unaffected diffidence which overwhelms me, I ſhall make immediate advances towards the awful ground on which our greateſt orators link unnerved, and giants in literature ſtand and tremble! And though I am not about to deliver an oration, nor to pronounce an eulogium; but to preach a ſermon, and briefly <hi>touch</hi> on one of the greateſt <hi>merely</hi> human characters, I am fully appriſed of the delicacy of my ſituation, and too ſenſibly feel the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of difficulties.</p>
            <p>My feeble ſoul take courage! a <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or a <hi>Cicero</hi> might fail here without diſhonor; and though the famed Caeſars, Alexanders, Pompies and Marlboroughs, muſt reſign their inferior laurels to the more famous <hi>American General,</hi> he was but a man; all his greatneſs was derived from his and thy CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR, and thou wilt be aſſiſted in the execution of thy arduous deſign by the prayers, candid allowances and liberal conſtructions of thine audience, who will deem it very pardonable on thy theme to be defective. The firſt doctrinal obſervation which our text, and the occaſion of our aſſembling, unitedly ſuggeſt, is ſeriouſly important: Great as ABNER was, he fell; and WASHINGTON is fallen; it, therefore, undeniably follows <hi>that great men, as well as others, muſt fall.</hi> Though it would be abſurd to attempt a formal proof of this doctrine,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037634_0005_100EF04972856150"/>
and have the appearance of an inſult on dying man, there is nothing that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more frequent, or more ſerious conſideration; and a few explanatory remarks on it are ſo far from being amiſs, that they are indiſpenſible. The Heathens and Deiſts, of all deſcriptions, believing the immortality of the human ſoul, conſider their bodies as falling by death into corruption and duſt, never to riſe; and their notions of the ſtate, exerciſes, and enjoyments of the ſoul after death are ſo vague, indiſtinct, and unimpreſſive, that they have little or no viſible effect on their practice. Atheiſts, and ſuch Deiſts as believe the ſoul of man to be mortal, conſider all who are fallen, and our immortal WASHINGTON among the reſt, as plunged into undiſtinguiſhed and irretrievable ruin! as conſigned to their original nonentity!! Happily for our various intereſts, few, if any, of theſe gloomy monſters diſgrace, or infeſt the United States: They are chiefly, if not altogether, confined to the ſmoke and flame in which they have involved miſerable Europe. Let Americans never ſuffer their nature and its <hi>author</hi> to be inſulted and degraded by the influence, or exiſtence of ſuch deteſtable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents;
<q>Scorned be the man who thinks himſelf a brute;</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Affronts</hi> his <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and his GOD <hi>blaſphemes.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But gladly I turn your attention from the cold, lifeleſs principles, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uncertainty of the better ſort of Heathens and the Deiſts, and eſpecially from the inſupportable horrors of <hi>annihilation,</hi> to what we are to underſtand by the <hi>fall</hi> of men in death; and, in a word, it is their fall from this world; from its honors, pleaſures, profits; and from the exerciſe of their mortal powers. By a figure of ſpeech, which puts a part for the whole, or the contrary, and common with inſpired, and other writers, in ſaying that a great man in fallen, David means no more than that his mortal part is dead; but he was better informed than to ſuppoſe that even <hi>this</hi> was dead or fallen, to revive, to riſe no more. We not only know from divine revelation, but from an important and well atteſted fact, gloriouſly demonſtrated at this time by its numerous and happy conſequences, that our bodies are not only capable of a reſurrection, but ſhall actually riſe! Were the horrible reverſe of theſe exhilirating repreſentations true, inconſiderable <hi>indeed</hi> would be our cauſe of triumph in exiſtence, or reaſon to boaſt of human excellence! <hi>"Verily every man, at his beſt ſtate,"</hi> conſidered merely in his relation to this tranſitory ſcene, <hi>"is altogether vanity."</hi> And the inevitable fall of the greateſt, as well as all other men, when viewed in a <hi>true</hi> light, and conſidered in its eternal conſequences, muſt ſill the enlightened conſiderate mind with the moſt ſerious reflections. It is ſaid,

            </p>
            <p>But judging from paſt events, what enormous devaſtations among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth muſt be ſpread in leſs than half that time! "Your Fathers,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037634_0006_100EF04B398528A0"/>
where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever?" Where are all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding generations, and the great men who illuminated and adorned them? Alas! the mighty ruins of mortality! With a few illuſtrious exemptions, recorded in the oracles of God, the ſilent, and almoſt imperceptibly ſlow, but ſteady and irreſiſtibly ſtrong current of time, has borne them into the boundleſs ocean of eternity! And yet Philip of Macedon was far from being alone, in needing daily to be told that he was a mortal man.</p>
            <p>That all men muſt fall, is univerſally acknowledged; but too few apply this ſerious truth to their own caſes; Doctor Young had reaſons for his bold aſſertion,</p>
            <p>"All men think all men mortal but themſelves." And great men, from a variety of circumſtances, are more than others, addicted to this waking dream, this ſometimes fatal deluſion; and ſtrange as fatal! <hi>"Know ye not that there is a great man fallen?"</hi> and that conſequently <hi>great men muſt fall!</hi> Riches, power, titles, univerſal applauſe, to which may be added even virtue and piety, avail nothing in this warfare, "Death enters, and there's no defence." Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this all do, they muſt, however inconſiderate and profane, for who can deny it? <hi>But O, that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end!"</hi> How natural, reaſonable, and intereſting is this? and one would think it might be added, how difficult to avoid it!</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>" As man perhaps the moment of his breath,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Receives the lurking principle of death;</hi>

                  <hi>The young diſeaſe that muſt ſubdue at length,</hi>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>And when theſe latent ſeeds of diſſolution produce their ultimate effect, our text directs us in what regards our duty to the memories of the juſt. By fair and obvious implication, it ſays, <hi>the fall of a great man merits reſpectful and public attention.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>"Know ye not that there is a great man fallen?"</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This queſtion was not aſked for information, and it not only forcibly affirms the fall of a great man: but evidently excites to mourning on account of it, and proper expreſſions of reſpect for his memory. <hi>Know ye not,</hi> that is, are ye not appriſed, or diſpoſed to conſider, as ye ſhould be, and to practically declare, <hi>that</hi> in your judgment, <hi>there is a great man,</hi> a man of worth, and entitled to high and public regard, <hi>fallen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly we find that David ſaid to the people to whom he addreſſed the words of our text, "Rent your clothes, and gird you with ſackcloth, and mourn before Abner." The ſacred hiſtorian adds, "And king David him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf followed the bier. And they buried Abner in Hebron: And the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."</p>
            <p>The ſolemnity concludes with an oration by the king, which produced the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037634_0007_100EF04D62EF0228"/>
higheſt effects of oratory, and cloſes with an acknowledgment, that he was rendered weak though anointed king, by the loſs of that great man. Parellel paſſages, in great variety, might be recited in confirmation of this doctrine. Inſtances are numerous in the patriarchal age, of burying perſons of eminent piety and worth, with every mark of reſpect and ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>The venerable founders of the Jewiſh church and nation, had the tribute of high encomiums, and genuine mourning for many days, paid to their memories and their merits. A beautiful ſpecimen of ancient eulogy, is David's lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation over Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and Jonathan. With an ardor and elevation peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he exclaims, "The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain in thy high places; how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkelon, leſt the daughters of the Philiſtines rejoice, leſt the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the ſhield of the mighty is vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt away, the ſhield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the ſlain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the ſword of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than were lovely and pleaſant in their lives, and in their deaths they were not divided. They were ſwifter than Eagles, they were ſtronger than Lions. Ye daughters of Iſrael weep over Saul, who clothed you in ſcarlet, with other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midſt of the battle!"</p>
            <p>This natural and laudable, as well as ancient and univerſal cuſtom of honoring the pious and eminent dead, may be further juſtified by quotations from the new teſtament. At the grave of Lazarous, "JESUS wept;" devout men buried Stephen, who had the honor to be the firſt martyr in the chriſtian cauſe, with great lamention; and Paul mentions a number of the illuſtrious characters of antiquity, with the higheſt reſpect, and warmly recommends their noble and heroic conduct to the imitation of poſterity. After beſtowing on many the encomiums proper to their reſpective merits, he adds, "And what ſhall I more ſay? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barack, and of Sampſon, and of Jepthae, of David alſo, and of Samuel, and of the prophets; who through faith ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valient in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the Aliens." So warm a panegyriſt of theſe great men was the Apoſtle, that he avers, <hi>"Of them the world was not worthy."</hi> And though many of theſe failed of obtaining the attention due to their merits in, and immediately after their reſpective generations, by having their names and worthy deeds enrolled in the volume of inſpiration, GOD has plainly ſhewn us
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037634_0008_100EF0500D2F32C8"/>
that the fall a of great good man ſhould excite reſpectful and public attention. Encouraged, therefore, and in ſome degree aſſiſted by ſuch precedents, I will proceed to what is <hi>finally</hi> incumbent on me; and that is, <hi>to evince the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any text to the illuſtrious deceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged that the ſcriptural and conſequently rational and becoming cuſtom of praiſing departed perſons, has been ſhamefully abuſed. The great among the Heathens have, in many inſtances, been exalted to celeſtial honors, and idolized to diſtant generations. And by perſons of better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, funeral panegyric has been ſo indiſcriminately beſtowed, that it has blended all diſtinctions of character and become proverbially falſe. But it is not on theſe or any other accounts, to be refuſed on proper occaſions, this would be falling into the oppoſite extreme. And perhaps a more proper occaſion than the <hi>preſent</hi> for commendation and applauſe never occurred, or one on which higher might be beſtowed, conſiſtently with truth and moderation. Never I believe could it be ſaid of any with more propriety than of General WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, that what his acquaintances would condemn as below his merit, ſtrangers would conſider as the moſt fulſome adulation, or exaggerated applauſe. But to proceed: Moſt obviouſly does my text apply to this great man, conſidered as enriched with <hi>merely natural endowments.</hi> His features, actions, and whole deportment, before he was refined by learning, clothed with power, or known to fame, attracted every eye, fixed attention, and commanded reſpect, As the immediate effect of divine bounty he poſſeſſed the ſeeds whoſe bloſſoms and fruits ultimately rendered him the boaſt of his country, and the glory of the age. The rich furniture of his mind could receive no aſſiſtance from the common rules of art, becauſe by innate ſtrength it roſe nobly ſuperior to them, <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending</hi> the true principles, and proper ſtandard of criticiſm.<note n="*" place="bottom">True criticiſm is the application of taſte and of good ſenſe to the ſeveral fine arts. Blair.</note> His perceptions were prompt, intuitive, clear; and were diſplayed from earlieſt youth in the facility and rapidity with which he acquired knowledge, and in the exact order, method and propriety conſpicuous in the management of all his affairs. And to the fatal day which put a period to the moſt valuable of mortal lives, his conduct and achievements, proclaimed his genius entirely original, ſuperlatively bright, the offspring of the FATHER OF LIGHTS. In his vaſt mind centered that ſhining aggregate of excellencies which beamed with ſuch effulgence in his dignified and manly countenance, and were ſo eminently ornamental, I will not ſay of his country, nor of this generation, but of human nature. When we conſider that all effects muſt have, an adequate cauſe, we are led to trace the wonders which have appeared in WASHINGTON'S life, to, at leaſt, an equally wonderful ſource: This we find in a ſoul calm and ſerene as the moſt delightful ſummer-evening, more expanſive than the ocean, more reſplendent than yonder ſun, and ſteady as the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037634_0009_100EF0524A9D3578"/>
poles! Theſe intellectual, and conſequently immortal treaſures rendered him uncommonly great as the child of nature; and our text applies to him very forcibly as enlarged and enobled by mental <hi>acquiſitions,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divine Providence gave him opportunities and diſpoſitions to add great <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> to the greateſt <hi>natural</hi> abilities. If his education were not claſſical, it was profound: If he had not the comparatively ſuperficial knowledge of all <hi>names,</hi> he poſſeſſed an univerſal knowledge of <hi>things:</hi> And tho' no great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his precious time was ſpent in the ſtudy of dead languages, it was becauſe the beautious objects of all kinds of uſeful and ornamental knowledge invited his attention and perſuit, in all the copious elegance of Engliſh attire.</p>
            <p>His great mind was occupied with correſpondent objects. He had well arranged and diſtinct ideas of all aſſentially intereſting, and truly important facts, domeſtic and foreign, antient and modern, temporal and ſpiritual. Among the ſubjects which WASHINGTON inveſtigated, and the objects which he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an aſſiduity and ſeriouſneſs becoming their importance, were ſcience, morality and religion; civil and religious liberty; agriculture commerce and navigation; tactics, and the different forms of civil government; the riſe revolutions, and falls of empires, in connection with their cauſes and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qnences; and the religions, laws, cuſtoms, characters and origin of nations.</p>
            <p>With a ſingular felicity of perception, he comprehended the ſubjects of his knowledge in all their extenſions and relations; and we well know, that in his converſation, public ſpeeches, and admirable writings, eaſe and ſtrength were united with all the beauty and ſimplicity of preciſion. But as it would require talents brilliant as his own to do juſtice to a ſubject of ſuch extent and ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I ſhall conclude theſe imperfect remarks on his great literary merit, by obſerving that the honor of conferring on him the degree of L. L. D. was reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Rhode-Iſland College<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"Sept. 1ſt, 1790, the degree of Doctor of Laws, was conferred on GEORGE WASHINGTON, Preſident of the United States of America." Soon <hi>afterwards,</hi> it appears from the Baptiſt annual regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for 1791, of which Doctor RIPPON of London is the editor, that "In a converſation between ſeveral friendly gentlemen, which turned chiefly on the confinement of LEW IS the <hi>little,</hi> who, like an abſolute ſovereign, had ſaid to five and twenty million of people, I <hi>will be obeyed;</hi> contraſted with the popularity of WASHINGTON the GREAT—it was mentioned, that the Baptiſt College, in Rhode-Iſland, had conferred the degree of Doctor of Laws, on the Preſident of the United States; while it ſeemed to be the general mind that this diſtinguiſhed character in the hiſtory of man, would prefer the laurels of a college to a crown of deſpotiſm, one of the company, it is ſaid, quite impromptu, gave rent to the feelings of his heart, in the following effuſion:

variety and profuſion, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf of Heaven's bounties, we are led to conclude that ſuch mental ſtrength and excellence as WASHINGTON poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, muſt have been properly depoſited, furniſhed with ſuitable organs, and intended for appropriate and important purpoſes: And our expectations are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered when we view him as entitled to the application of our text, <hi>by the diſpoſals of an all ſuperintending Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Born and raiſed under a free government, he early imbibed, and always che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and retained the ſacred principles of liberty, his <hi>birth right,</hi> inviolable. Though of reſpectable deſcent, anceſtry need not be mentioned, where perſonal and intrinſic worth is ſo eminent and conſpicuous. Nor does he derive any of his greatneſs from the large poſſeſſions with which his many and diſtinguiſhed virtues, and ſervices, were to as great a degree as <hi>he would permit,</hi> but by no means <hi>adequately</hi> rewarded: he conferred honor on affluence. The complicated <hi>organ</hi> of his vaſt and noble mind, a glorious ſpecimen of divine ingenuity, was moderately large, elegantly proportioned, and amply endowed with agility and ſtrength, gracefulneſs and dignity. In early youth his ſuperior parts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties attracted public attention; and by traverſing a trackleſs deſert, obtaining the intelligence ſo intereſting to his beloved country, and ſaving <hi>Bradock's</hi> army on the Monongahela, from the jaws of a cruel death by mercileſs ſavages, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf capable of the moſt difficult, arduous and perilous ſervices. The ſagacity and proweſs, promptitude and deciſion, which he diſplayed, about this time, on ſeveral trying occaſions, were ſtrongly indicative of his future elevation. And from the univerſal rectitude of his conduct in private and public, civil and religious life, as well as from the proofs he had furniſhed of his great military capacity, <hi>Preſident Davis,</hi> long before there exiſted a thought of the late revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary war, ſaid from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> "I may point out to the public that heroic youth, <hi>Col. Waſhington,</hi> whom I cannot but hope, providence has hitherto preſerved for ſome important ſervice to his country." And this has ſince aſſumed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a divine prediction: For <hi>we feel,</hi> and the <hi>world knows</hi> what an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervice he has rendered his country.</hi> When the unhappy controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and her thirteen American Provinces, roſe ſo high, and produced ſuch effects, that the dreadful appeal to the ſword was no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible, WASHINGTON, whoſe name can receive no additional luſtre from epithets, was unanimoſly appointed by the repreſentatives of the American people, to head their undiſciplined troops, almoſt without money or arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Britiſh,</hi> well armed and well diſciplined veterans. The bloody conflicts which enſued, the prodigies of addreſs, valor and preſerverance of the commander in chief, and the glorious reſult are well known and need not now be repeated. His ſuperiority to difficulties, to all other men embarraſſing and inſuperable, unconquerable fortitude, well-timed, and well-planned attacks on a ſuperior
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037634_0011_100EF05673343EF0"/>
foe, and ſplendid victories, are clothed in all the elegance and pomp of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by hiſtorians and poets of the firſt eminence. Uninfluenced by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he had conducted us <hi>ſeven long years,</hi> through fields of blood and carnage, to ſovereignty, independance and peace, like another <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> he returned to his agricultural employments, and ſought repoſe in the ſhades of retirement. Through his influence, an army angry and diſtreſſed from painful, important, and yet <hi>uncompenſated</hi> ſervices, ſheathed their ſwords, and followed the example of their illuſtrious chief!</p>
            <p>But his well-tried, and ſterling merit, united to the ſplendor of his talents, and the unbounded confidence of his fellow-citizens, ſoon rendered it neceſſary, from the inefficacy of our Governmental arrangements, that he ſhould again embark on the ſtormy ſea of politics. Summoned by his country, to whom he could deny <hi>nothing,</hi> to aſſiſt in forming, and adopting our preſent energetic, yet free and happy conſtitution, he readily obeyed; and after the accompliſhment of theſe important objects, he was called by the unanimous voice, of, at leaſt, three millions of people to preſide over theſe Sovereign and Independent States. To the preſidential chair he continued a noble ornament, by the united wiſh of his grateful country, who delighted to honor him, <hi>eight years,</hi> and diſcharged the important duties of this high ſtation with his uſual wiſdom and firmneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and rectitude. And after retiring the ſecond time, in full poſſeſſion of the affections and confidence of the people, to the ſolitude which he was as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enjoying, as of adorning public life, he was prevailed on, tho' hoary with years, and covered with glory, to accept the command of our armies, when the political hemiſphere wore a moſt menacing and wrathful aſpect. Behold the greateſt General in the world, tho' on the borders of three ſcore and ten, in obedience to his much indebted country, ready, again, to take the field againſt her inſulting foes!</p>
            <p>And ſo obvious was the policy of this appointment, that it was anticipated, as well as ardently wiſhed by every intelligent citizen. His martial and auguſt appearance, the ſound of his <hi>name</hi> and <hi>voice,</hi> the glance of his experienced eye, and the lightning of his ſword at the head of our armies, rendered them gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enthuſiaſtic, and abſolutely invincible! But great as he was by nature, a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral education, and the diſplay and perfection of his ſuperior powers, natural and acquired, in ſpheres of action the moſt conſpicuous, elevated and important, he was ſtill <hi>greater</hi> by the invaluable <hi>gifts of the</hi> GOD <hi>of grace.</hi> Conſidered as ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandized by <hi>theſe,</hi> our text applies to him with the <hi>utmoſt</hi> propriety and force!</p>

            <p>He would have been equalled by ſeveral if he had not ſhone in the mild ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of morals and religion. This luſtre, when other things are equal, gives a decided ſuperiority. <hi>Before,</hi> and an eſſential part <hi>of</hi> his honor was
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037634_0012_100EF059232D14C8"/>
humility. He had as little of that tumid pride, which in its plenitude goes before deſtruction, as any man on earth. He always felt his dependance as a man; and truſting in the living GOD, whom he ſerved, his boldneſs and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, could be equalled by nothing but his modeſty and humility. By theſe radical advantages, he diſplayed an equanimity through he moſt trying extremes of fortune, which does the higheſt honor to the human character. He was the ſame whether ſtruggling to keep the fragments of a naked army together in the diſmal depths of winter, againſt a greatly ſuperior foe, or prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the laurel wreath over four millions of free men!</p>
            <p>He was too great to be depreſſed or elated by any thing that ceaſes with this life.</p>

            <p>WASHINGTON'S as all true wiſdom ever did, and always muſt, began with the fear, which was the only fear he ever knew, the <hi>fear of the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> And this was truly filial, for its tranſcendently glorious object, was equally the object of his ſupreme affection.</p>
            <p>Theſe divine and immortal principles preſerved his tongue from every ſpecies of profanity, and not only his actions but his heart from pollution. <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered the world; but far from ruling his ſpirit, or being in any reſpect his own maſter, he fell an early and loathſome ſacrifice to intemperance. Far greater than Alexander the great, was WASHINGTON: He ruled his appetites and paſſions in ſcenes of the greateſt trial and temptation; and will remain forever a bright example, to all men, of temperance and moderation in all things, as well as a ſtriking contraſt to all, <hi>"The rational foul kennels of exceſs."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His piety, though like his other ſhining excellencies unauſtentatious, was genuine and exalted. Through the veil of all his modeſt reſerve, it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable in the whole tenor of his conduct, and eſpecially in his admirable and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate anſwers to the numerous addreſſes of his almoſt adoring fellow-citizens, where he uniformly, and with glowing gratitude aſcribes all the glory of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled ſucceſſes to GOD.</p>
            <p>How high <hi>chriſtanity</hi> ſtood in his eſtimation, and how near its intereſts lay to his heart, every one may ſee, who has read his excellent anſwers to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatory addreſſes of various religious bodies, on his firſt election to the chief magiſtracy of theſe United States. And his opinion of religion in a <hi>political</hi> view, I will do myſelf the honor to give you in his own words; ſo that though alas! he is dead, he ſtill to his weeping country thus ſpeaketh: "Of all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality, are indiſpenſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm, who ſhould labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs,

theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation in courts of juſtice? And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar ſtructure, reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religious principles. 'Tis ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or leſs force to every ſpecies of free government. Who that is a ſincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to ſhake the foundation of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick! Promote then, as an object of primary importance, inſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowledge; in proportion as the ſtructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is eſſential that public opinion ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened."</p>
            <p>Ye winds, waft theſe ſentiments on your ſwift pinions; and ye ſun-beams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord them in more than golden characters, throughout the political world!</p>
            <p>American, Engliſh, French, and all other politicians, hear him who was as famous in the cabinet, as formidable in the tented field! In proportion as he is regarded, will be prevented the effuſion of blood; hoſtilities will ceaſe, and order and confidence between rulers and the ruled, individuals and nations, will enſue.</p>
            <p>The eſſential advantages of religion, in a political light, were diſcovered clearly, and felt impreſſively by the American ſage, whoſe eagle eye diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed plainly betwixt vain <hi>pretenders</hi> to religion, and its <hi>real poſſeſſors;</hi> and whoſe cool deliberative ſagacity, diſcerned the difference between genuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as delineated in the holy ſcriptures, and the empty forms, groſs adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and ſhameful abuſes of it. And it is difficult to determine, whether he were moſt correct and eminent in religious theory or practice. But one thing, and that of vaſt importance, is evident: Bright as this ſun of human glory ſhone, with the ſweetly blended rays of morality and religion, through every ſtage, and in every condition of life, like the cloudleſs ſtar of day, gently and with increaſing majeſty, ſinking beneath the weſtern horizon, his mild effulgence was greateſt in death!</p>

            <p>A victory, which enraged Britain's <hi>cannon, ſword</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi> though <hi>well tried,</hi> could never effect, is thine!

A while venerable ſhade! we muſt leave thy <hi>precious remains</hi> enſhrined by trembling hands, with ſolemn pomp, and thy <hi>deathleſs part</hi> under the ſublime character, of the ſpirit of a juſt man made perfect, in <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>well-founded</hi> hope of <hi>their re-union,</hi> and of the conſummation of <hi>thy glory and felicity!</hi> And is a great man fallen? Is WASHINGTON no more? Alas is he gone! gone forever! The conqueror of royal armies and their migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty generals, the late Preſident of the United States, and later Commander in chief of the American armies, is fallen! The father, friend, benefactor and bulwark of his country, is fallen! WASHINGTON is fallen! A ſcene of action the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant; a life with virtuous and heroic deeds, the moſt luminous, is now the ſubject of eulogy! All the reſpectful, affectionate, and aggrandizing epithets, contained in our language, are employed <hi>in vain,</hi> to ſet his exalted merit in an adequately conſpicuous point of light: And we anticipate the elaborate productions of rival pens of the firſt diſtinction, now moving with celerity and ardor, to give an admiring world the life of WASHINGTON: But to draw his true portrait is more than mortal hands can do; <hi>"It merits a divine."</hi> "When he went out to the gate, through the city, when he prepared his ſeat in the ſtreet, the young men ſaw him and hid themſelves; and the aged aroſe and ſtood up; the princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth; the nobles held their peace and their tongues cleaved to the roof of their mouth. When the ear heard him, then it bleſſed him; and when the eye ſaw him, it gave witneſs to him; becauſe he delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him. The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh, came upon him; and he cauſed the widow's heart to ſing for joy. He put on righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and it clothed him; his judgment was a robe and a diadem. He was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame; he was a father to the poor, and the cauſe that he knew not he ſearched out. And he brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the ſpoil out of his teeth." To this inimitable ſketch by the pencil of inſpiration, let us add, in ſilent grief for our irreparable loſs, badges of deep mourning, melting eyes and bleeding hearts, which will more emphatically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his worth than the ſublimeſt imagery, and the moſt glowing encomiums in the hands of Erudition and Art.</p>
            <p>And permit me to obſerve, that the greateſt honor of all that we can do to his memory, and the beſt improvement that we can make of his life and death,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037634_0015_100EF05FA600CA50"/>

All truly enlightened creatures, from the weakeſt of frail men, to the moſt illuſtrious in moral ſtrength and excellence, worſhip thee as the unoriginated and eſſential ſource of being, perfection, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city! Eternity is thy time! commenſurate with immenſity is thy preſence! and the united powers of the whole creation are incapable of rendering thee adequate praiſe!

Supreme intelligence infinitely wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and boundleſs benevolence, are gloriouſly diſplayed in all thy works, and in all thy ways!

When we behold thee arrayed in theſe ſublimely awful perfections, as the uncontrolable arbiter of life and death, we are conſtrained to acquieſce in thy righteous diſpenſations. Reaſon and experience render it probable, and thy word, which is truth, aſſures us, that all things, however diſtreſſing in themſelves, are intereſting in their iſſues to all who love and ſerve thee. This is our conſolation under the bereavement and great loſs ſuffered by our nation, in the removal of thy ſervant, the commander in chief of her armies, from time to eternity. It is the Lord of Hoſts, and judge of the whole earth, who hath done it. Though we mourn, we do not murmur; nor is our ſorrow like theirs who have no hope.
