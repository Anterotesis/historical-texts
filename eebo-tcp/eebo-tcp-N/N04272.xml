            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EATH is elegantly deſcribed in Scripture, as <hi>the King of terrors:</hi> And to an eye of ſenſe is a moſt formidable evil. It tears down theſe tabernacles of clay, which are the habitations of our immortal ſpirits: It turns theſe beautiful and active bodies, into heaps of deformity and corruption: It ſeparates us from this world and its agreable enjoyments, and fixes the ſoul in an <hi>unalterable</hi> ſtate of happineſs or miſery.</p>
            <p>SO great is the fondneſs of mankind for this preſent life; — ſo ſtrong their averſion to a diſſolution; that we need the higheſt cordials to ſupport us againſt the approaches of Death, and to enable us with a becoming fortitude to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter this grand enemy of human nature.</p>
            <p>AND, Bleſſed be God, the Goſpel has laid a ſufficient foundation for our ſupport and comfort in this melancholly hour. — Our great
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005268_0004_1016F2C638A4EA60"/>
REDEEMER hath ſcattered the darkneſs of the grave, <hi>and brought life and immortality to light. Thro'</hi> the vertue of his own meritorious <hi>death; he hath deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and delivered them who thro' fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> II. 14, 15.</note> In his name, and by the victorious power of his grace, every true believer may meet this univerſal terror of mankind with an holy triumph, and lay down his head in the duſt with ſerenity and joy.</p>
            <p>THE Goſpel repreſents death to the true Chriſtian, not as an enemy but as a friend: Not as the object of their terror and averſion, but rather of their complacency and deſire. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes our departure out of this world, as a deliverance from this vale of tears, and an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to a ſtate of conſummate bleſſedneſs: A tranſlation from the fading enjoyments of time, to all the ineffable glories of eternity.</p>
            <p>UPON theſe principles many of the Diſciples of JESUS have welcom'd the approach of death as the meſſenger of their heavenly Father, and breath'd out their ſouls into the hands of God with extacy and triumph. A proſpect of obtaining complete deliverance from ſin their greateſt burden, and dwelling with Chriſt their ſupreme delight, has wonderfully reconciled their tho'ts
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005268_0005_1016F2C7C2C76148"/>
to a dying hour, and changed the dark valley of the ſhadow of death, into a ſcene of light and glory.</p>
            <p>THUS the Apoſtle in my text, with an holy impatience, looks forward to the time of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and waits for the happy period, as the weary traveller for the grateful ſhades of the evening.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Having a deſire to depart,</hi> AND TO BE WITH CHRIST, WHICH IS FAR BETTER.</q>
            <p>In ſpeaking to which words I ſhall (by divine aſſiſtance) proceed in the following method:</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew that every true believer, when he departs out of this world goes to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THIS is infinitely better than to abide in the fleſh.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>FIRST PART.</head>
               <p>EVERY true believer, when he departs out of this world, goes to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>THIS was not peculiar to this favourite Apoſtle, but is the common privilege of every true Chriſtian: When we <hi>are abſent from the body, then we are preſent with the Lord.</hi> The Doctrine of Purgatory is an idle fiction of the Prieſts of mammon, contrived and propagated to eſtabliſh
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005268_0006_1016F2C94B29ECE8"/>
the tyranny of the BISHOP OF <hi>ROME,</hi> and ſupport the grandeur of the PAPAL EMPIRE. The Opinion of the Sleep of the Soul, till the morning of the general reſurrection, is a ſenſeleſs dream, deſtructive of the very nature and eſſence of an immaterial ſpirit, and contrary to many plain and expreſs paſſages in the inſpired Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. — Why ſhould the Apoſtle expect with pleaſure the time of his ſeparation from the body, if death were to caſt him into an inſenſible ſlumber, and deprive him of all thoſe bleſſed commmunications of divine LIFE and LOVE which he enjoy'd upon earth? — Why ſhould he deſire to be diſſolv'd and be with Chriſt, if all his perceptive powers were to be chain'd up in a profound ſleep, and he was to remain for ſo long a ſeaſon without any delightful views of the divine glory, or any participation of the joys of his immediate preſence? — Upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it would be evidently more eligible to abide in the fleſh, amidſt the labours and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, than to ſink into an inſenſible ſtate, and ſpend ſo many years in darkneſs and oblivion. But not to enlarge, —</p>
               <p>NOTHING is more plain than that the ſcripture gives no countenance to this abſurd and unreaſonable imagination: But on the contrary aſſures us, that <hi>when this earthly houſe of our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005268_0007_1016F2CB0C2A1ED8"/>
tabernacle is diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 1.</note> Hence our Lord declares unto the penitent thief, when in the agonies of death, <hi>THIS DAY ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW to be with Chriſt, implies that the believer upon his departure out of this world, ſhall be immediately introduced into his divine preſence, and be favoured with an intuitive viſion of his glory. No ſooner are they delivered from the burden of the fleſh, but immediately they mount up upon the wings of love, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd by a bright guard of miniſtring ſpirits into the imperial palace of heaven, — the preſence chamber of their exalted Redeemer; where they ſee him, not in the humble form of a ſervant, but in the majeſtic ſtate of an incarnate GOD: — Not in the inferior circumſtances of poverty and diſgrace, but incircled with all the dazzling ſplendors of heaven: — Not crown'd with thorns, but diadems of celeſtial glory: — Not hanging upon an infamous croſs, but ſeated on the right-hand of the Majeſty on high: — Not ſurrounded with inſulting crouds of inſolent ſinners, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with myriads of ſpotleſs ſaints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005268_0008_1016F2CF19EF6B68"/>THIS muſt needs be to every true believer a ſcene of the pureſt joy, the ſublimeſt pleaſure. — If St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo tranſported with a tranſient glimpſe of his glory, when transfigured on the mount, that he forgot this lower world, and cried out, <hi>Lord it is good to be here;</hi> how will the ſaints exult and triumph when they have not only a vaniſhing glance, but a full view of his beautiful countenance: Not on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> in company with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> but ſtanding upon the Holy Hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> attended by the whole hierarchy of heaven. — If the Diſciples were glad, when they ſaw their Lord break aſunder the bars of the grave, and riſe from the dead; how great will be their joy, when they ſee him ſeated upon a radiant throne, and ſwaying the ſceptre of the inviſible world.</p>
               <p>WHAT can be more delightful to theſe holy ſouls, than to enjoy the bleſſed ſociety of their deareſt friend, and moſt generous benefactor; — to dwell continually with him, on whoſe name they have believed, in whoſe merits they have confided, and from whoſe hands they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a crown of eternal Life? How will it revive and rejoice their hearts, to behold him who was ſo unrighteouſly deſpiſed, ſo inhumanly tortured, ſo ignominiouſly crucified for their ſakes; advanced to the higheſt pitch of ſplendor and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005268_0009_1016F2D306515EE0"/>
dignity, honoured and adored by all the happy inhabitants above; who with one conſent caſt their crowns at his feet, and celebrate the praiſes of his redeeming grace? With what rapturous pleaſure ſhall they hear from his own bleſſed lips, the amazing hiſtory of his Love, the mighty triumphs of his Grace, and the diſtreſſing ſorrows he paſt thro' for the redemption of an apoſtate world.</p>
               <p>ESPECIALLY, Since they not only behold his glory, but dwell under the perpetual effuſions of his love: They not only ſee his face, but partake of his goodneſs; they not only view the amiable excellencies of his nature, but find by happy experience all thoſe divine attributes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to promote their perfection and happineſs. In the preſent ſtate he advances them to the dignity of his children, adorns them with the graces of his ſpirit, and affords them the reviving foretaſtes of his love; but in heaven he unfolds all the treaſures of his goodneſs, and ſhowers down the boundleſs riches of his glory, into their purified and enlarged boſoms. The Bleſſed Redeemer looks down upon them with infinite pleaſure, as the ſacred purchaſe of his blood, and the conqueſts of his almighty grace; and is highly delighted with the reflection of his own
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005268_0010_1016F2D4C77AC3B0"/>

               </p>
               <p>AND now, what higher conception of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs can we frame, than to dwell for ever with the beſt and moſt amiable of BEINGS; to love him with the moſt ardent affection; to receive the continual viſits of <hi>his favour, which is life, and his loving kindneſs which is better than life itſelf.</hi> HAPPY SOULS! who are incircled in the arms of everlaſting mercy, and lie imparadiſed in the boſom of GOD. They now, more than ever, rejoice in God their Saviour, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually triumph in their union to and communion with him: They break forth in the language of the ſpouſe. — <hi>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons: I ſit under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit is pleaſant unto my taſte: he has brought me into his banquetting-houſe, and ſpread his banner of love over me.</hi>

defiled with ſin, and encompaſs'd with darkneſs. The glory of the ſaints is at preſent unſeen; and we can form no adequate conceptions of it, till the vail of mortality is drawn aſide, and we admitted into the ſanctuary above: But ſo much is diſcovered as fully juſtifies my text, and ſhows that to be with Chriſt, is infinitely better than to abide in the fleſh.

               <p>THE body indeed is ſubject to a melancholly change; — thoſe <hi>eyes</hi> are cloſed in darkneſs, that once beheld the light of the ſun, and the beauties of this lower creation; — thoſe <hi>hands</hi> are rendered uſeleſs, that were active inſtruments in the various offices of life; — thoſe <hi>feet</hi> are fettered with the bands of death, that went about doing good: — our <hi>viſible frame</hi> is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, and blended with its original duſt; but the Soul is delivered from the priſon in which it was long confined, and in all reſpects makes a bleſſed exchange: — For,</p>
               <p n="1">I. THEY change a ſtate of toil and labour, for that of eaſe and refreſhment: While upon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005268_0012_1016F2DA46AA5838"/>
earth, the ſervants of God are neceſſarily engaged in the buſineſs of the world, and are often called to a great deal of trouble and fatigue. While encumbered with theſe tabernacles of clay, and ſurrounded with an enſnaring world, they are obliged to be upon their perpetual guard, to <hi>watch and pray, leſt they enter into temptation.</hi> But the ſaints above are delivered from all theſe toilſome labours: — <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, who die in the Lord; for they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi> 
                  <note n="**" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> XIV. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>They have fought the good fight, they have finiſhed their courſe, henceforth there is laid up for them a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 7, 8.</note> They are no longer condemn'd to earn their bread with the ſweat of their brows, but are fed with the heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> the <hi>food of Angels!</hi> They no more ſpend their weariſome days in the purſuit of their general or particular callings; but receive the approbation of their Lord, and the reward of faithful ſervants. It is now no ſmall part of a Chriſtian's exerciſe, to bear up with a becoming fortitude and courage againſt the darkneſs, and difficulties, the temptations, and ſufferings of this preſent life; but when their ſpirit's are lodged in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom, they have no more ſufferings to go through, no more luſts to mortify, no more enemies to conquer: <hi>Patience

has had its perfect work;</hi> their day of battle is over, and their warfare is finally accompliſh'd.</p>
               <p>NOT that the righteous will lead an idle and unactive life: This would be contrary to the oeconomy of heaven, and an abatement of their particular happineſs. — In what employments they will be engaged, we know not; — upon this head the ſcripture is ſilent; and it becomes us not to be wiſe above what is written. But this we know, — that they are perpetually engaged in the ſervice of God; ſtand before him in the character of miniſtring ſpirits, inviolably keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge of his commandments: They join the bliſsful choir above in the joyful celebration of the divine praiſes, and reſt not day and night, ſaying, — <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY!</hi> And doubtleſs they look back with a grateful mixture of pleaſure and ſurprize, upon the various ſcenes of providence toward them, while they dwelt upon earth; and adore the ſtupendous methods of divine grace, by which they were kept in the midſt of number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs dangers, and ſafely guided and preſerved in the ways of ſalvation. Doubtleſs with the higheſt affection and gratitude, they raiſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and delightful ſongs to the honour of the beloved JESUS; who ſaved them from the ignominious bondage of ſin, by his almighty
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005268_0014_1016F2DFCE50FA60"/>
power; who juſtified them by his perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and has finally made them the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting monuments of his ſovereign mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THEY paſs out of a valley of tears, into a world of light and joy. The evils that attend human life, are as numerous, and often as violent as the tempeſtuous waves of the ſea. Various and ſucceſſive afflictions, like <hi>Job</hi>'s meſſengers, tread cloſe upon the heels of each other. — Our Bodies are the ſeat of innumerable diſeaſes; they frequently totter and ſhake, and are ſwiftly tending to the grave, <hi>the houſe appointed for the living.</hi> — Our Characters are expoſed to the malignant breath of envy and malice. — Our Eſtates to rapine and violence. — And our deareſt Friends are oftentimes ſnatched from our affectionate embraces. Upon theſe accounts, it is juſtly ſaid, that <hi>men is born to trouble as the ſparks fly upward.</hi> But all theſe evils are confined to this tranſitory ſcene. The ſaints at death are tranſlated to a world of perfect light, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled joy: They are admitted to that place which infinite wiſdom has contrived, almighty power hath framed, and everlaſting love hath appointed for the reception of his choſen friends, his diſtinguiſhed favourites. — <hi>There</hi> he ſheds abroad his brighteſt glory, and ſhowers down his abundant grace, to the unutterable tranſport of its happy inhabitants. — <hi>There</hi> ſhines a bright
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005268_0015_1016F2E2A2011400"/>
and eternal day, without any intervening clouds or darkneſs. — <hi>There</hi> all is calm and ſerene, without confuſion or diſorder; <hi>all tears are wiped from their eyes;</hi> all ſorrow baniſhed from their breaſts. — <hi>There</hi> is no more pain, no more death, <hi>for the former Things are paſſed away:</hi> In theſe peaceful regions, <hi>the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the weary are at reſt:</hi> Their joys are without mixture or alloy; their pleaſures divine and perpetual; and the remembrance of their paſt afflictions, ſerves only to encreaſe their preſent ſatisfaction, and inflame their gratitude to their almighty Deliverer.</p>
               <p n="3">III. THEY are tranſlated from a world of ſin and temptation, to a ſtate of purity and perfection. The true Chriſtian, even in this imperfect ſtate, is abſolved from the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the fiery law, and the condemning ſentence of divine juſtice. He is alſo ſaved from the tyrannical reign of luſt, and no longer lives in a voluntary ſubjection to its unreaſonable demands. The dominion of ſin was deſtroyed in the day of his firſt converſion; and its intereſts are gradually decaying thro' the ſucceſſive periods of the chriſtian life.</p>
               <p>BUT our univerſal nature is ſo deeply infected with this ſpreading <hi>leproſy,</hi> that it will never be perfectly purged out, while the earthly houſe of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005268_0016_1016F2E555892B18"/>
this tabernacle remains undiſſolved. Our moſt exact obedience to the divine law, is attended with innumerable defects, and our higheſt acts of faith weakened with the remains of unbelief. Our pureſt gold has an alloy of droſs, and our beſt duties are polluted with ſinful mixtures.</p>
               <p>THIS is the conſtant burthen of the ſaints upon earth; and above all things embitters the preſent life, with its enjoyments. The relicks of indwelling corruption, caſt a gloom upon their brighteſt days, and often obliges them to breathe out that melancholly complaint, in the paſſionate language of the Apoſtle, — <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> VII. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>BUT no ſooner is the vital tie diſſolved between the ſoul and body, but they are entirely purified from all remains of ſin, and made perfect in holineſs forever. Every corrupt affection and inclination is buried in the duſt of death; and their ſanctified ſpirits ſtand before the throne of GOD, without ſpot or blemiſh, without deformity or diſorder. — O happy DAY! O joyful DELIVERANCE! when the ſervants of Chriſt ſhall no longer complain of any ſinful darkneſs in their underſtanding, any remaining rebellion in their wills, or any defiling diſorder in their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005268_0017_1016B924B3594380"/>
affections. — O thrice HAPPY SOULS! who are not only delivered from ſin, but from all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to it; — who have no more difficulties to conquer; — no more dangers to encounter; — no more ſpiritual enemies to vanquiſh; but have overcome <hi>thro' the blood of the Lamb,</hi> and are entered into a ſtate of perfect victory and eternal triumph.</p>
               <p>SURELY, to be with Chriſt is beſt of all! for ſuch are aſcended above the territories of the prince of darkneſs, and are out of the reach of all his fiery aſſaults: They dwell where there is no <hi>roaring lion</hi> to devour; no <hi>ſubtle ſerpent</hi> to allure; no malignant influences to deſtroy their purity, or diſturb their happineſs. That promiſe is completely fulfilled, — <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his throne.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. THEY change the company of imperfect ſaints and ungodly ſinners, for the ſociety of ſpotleſs angels and <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> In this world, ſaints and ſinners dwell together in the ſame habitations: The ſons of GOD converſe with the children of <hi>Satan;</hi> and how often are the righteous vexed with the <hi>filthy
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005268_0018_1016F2EBE44B59F0"/>
converſation</hi> of the wicked, and forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in the bitterneſs of their ſouls, — <hi>O that I had the wings of a dove, that I might flee away, and be at reſt.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> LV. 6.</note> Yea, the converſation of the godly, is too often interrupted by the remains of ſin, and ſadly embittered by difference of opinion and practice. They that are children of the ſame heavenly FATHER; united under the banners of the ſame COMMON LORD, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the ſame <hi>undefiled inheritance;</hi> oftentimes unhappily fall out by the way; treat each other with a rigid and uncharitable diſtance, if not with unchriſtian and cenſorious language:</p>
               <p>BUT death puts a final period to all theſe afflicting trials. In the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> there is <hi>nothing that defileth.</hi> The bleſſed inhabitants above no more complain that they <hi>ſojourn in Meſheck, and dwell in the tents of Kedar.</hi> They leave the ſociety of imperfect ſaints upon earth, to join with <hi>the general aſſembly of the church of the firſt-born,</hi> — where perfect friendſhip, peace and amity reign forever, — where all the children of GOD, that were ſcattered abroad in this divided world, are gathered together in one vaſt and univerſal convention, — are perfectly united in judgment, affection, and practice, — with one heart, and one voice, join in ſinging the ſong of MOSES
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005268_0019_1016F2EF045665B8"/>
and the LAMB. O BLESSED CHANGE! to paſs from a peeviſh, ill-natur'd, and contentious world, to thoſe calm and peaceable manſions of light and love.</p>
               <p n="5">V. THEY are removed from this mutable ſcene, to a place of unchangeable felicity. How valuable forever the enjoyments of the world may be in the eyes of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet this exceedingly depreciates their worth, that they are of ſhort and uncertain continuance. — The riches of the earth <hi>take to themſelves wings, and flee away as an eagle towards heaven:</hi> — The pleaſures of ſenſe, are as the <hi>crackling of thorns under a pot;</hi> a ſudden blaze that ſoon expires: — The applauſe of the world, depends upon the breath of the giddy multitude; and is therefore inconſtant as the wind: — This earthly theatre, which is the ſeat of theſe inferior joys, is a vaniſhing ſcene; the ſtage itſelf will ſhortly be taken down, and all its actors retire into ſilence and oblivion. We plainly ſee that nothing here is ſubſtantial and durable; but <hi>bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord:</hi> — They are heirs of a <hi>kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, a city that has foundations, whoſe builder and maker is GOD.</hi> When the ſun itſelf ſhall fade, and all the lamps of heaven ſhall be extinguiſhed, the righteous ſhall ſhine as <hi>the brightneſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005268_0020_1016F2F08C079700"/>
and ever.</hi> When the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, and the pillars of heaven tremble; they ſhall ſtand ſecure amidſt the ruins of diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nature, and ſpend eternal ages in undimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and unfading pleaſures. And now who among us is not ready to ſay, Happy, O Lord, are theſe thy ſervants that ſtand in thy preſence, <hi>behold thy face, and are ſatisfied with thy likeneſs!</hi> Muſt we not all join in the ſentiments of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſay, <hi>to be with Chriſt is far better?</hi> — better than to live in this ſinful and polluted world, — this vale of affliction and tears</p>

               <head>The IMPROVEMENT of my diſcourſe remains.</head>
               <p n="1">I. IF this is the happineſs of the ſervants of Chriſt; this the bleſſed exchange they make at death; how great is the madneſs of thoſe who continue in the diſgraceful ſervice of ſin and <hi>ſatan!</hi> GOD, in infinite compaſſion to apoſtate men, hath ſent his SON, to call them off from the inferior enjoyments of time and ſenſe, to the nobler entertainments of the heavenly world. By the goſpel he invites them to accept the offers of his grace, and part with every thing that ſtands in competition with their eternal intereſt. But, alas! how careleſs are the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this important affair! how careful of the concerns of a dying body! how negligent of their immortal ſouls! — They prefer temporal to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005268_0021_1016F2F338047FF8"/>
eternal bleſſings; the fading ſatisfactions of ſenſe, to thoſe ineffable <hi>pleaſures that flow at the right hand of God forever.</hi> What madneſs is in the hearts of men, thus greedily to purſue empty trifles, — deceitful vanities; — and ſordidly neglect <hi>the one thing needful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MAKE a pauſe, my Brethren, and conſider, — Are you not formed of the ſame brittle clay with the reſt of your fellow-creatures? — Are you not every moment liable to the ſtroke of death? — Can you expect to be numbered with the children of the MOST HIGH, who now live in rebellion againſt his authority, in open defiance of his laws? — How can you hope to be with CHRIST in a future ſtate; whoſe grace you reſiſt, whoſe invaluable merits you trample under feet, and whoſe gracious yoke you obſtinately and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently refuſe? Deceive not your ſelves with <hi>vain words;</hi> if ever you deſire to ſee the face of God in peace, and dwell with Chriſt in glory; you muſt now be united to him, by a true and living faith; you muſt be juſtified by his grace; ſanctified by his ſpirit, and be made conformable to his precepts and example. Would you <hi>die the death of the righteous;</hi> and do you wiſh your <hi>latter end may be like his?</hi> — Let it then be your firſt care to accept of Chriſt as your SAVIOUR; and in the exerciſe of an humble faith, to commit your ſouls into his almighty and compaſſionate
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005268_0022_1016F2F4C3AF2938"/>
hands. — With inceſſant importunity, ſeek after the regenerating influences of his ſpirit, that that life may be begun in you, which abideth forever. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in THIS firſt RESURRECTION; over ſuch the ſecond death hath no power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. THIS affords abundant ground of comfort, when the ſervants of Chriſt are taken from us by death. Their piety gives no exemption from the common accidents of life: They fall by the ſame diſeaſes with the reſt of mankind; and their bodies are buried in the common duſt. — In this reſpect, there is <hi>one event to the righteous, and the wicked;</hi> — the ſervants of God and the ſubjects of Satan. But at the moment of their diſſolution, how vaſt the difference between them! — <hi>One</hi> is carried by Angels to the delights of <hi>Abraham's boſom;</hi> — The <hi>Other</hi> deſcends in all his guilt and deformity, to the melancholly regions of eternal miſery. — To <hi>the One,</hi> death is the meſſenger of divine grace, to introduce them to the endleſs felicities of paradiſe: — To <hi>the Other,</hi> the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of divine juſtice, that delivers them over to the bitter pains of eternal death.</p>
               <p>LET then the wicked tremble at the approach of the <hi>king of terrors;</hi> but let us congratulate the righteous upon their deliverance out of this world, the abode of guilt and ſorrow. — They have left
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005268_0023_1016F2F6ABE190F8"/>
our ſociety, for the <hi>innumerable company of angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> — They have laid aſide their polluted garments, for the ſpotleſs robes of purity and righteouſneſs. — Their eyes ſhall no longer flow down with tears, nor their tongues utter the language of complaint, — all their difficulties are removed, — all their clouds ſcattered, — all their doubts reſolved. They have obtained the <hi>end of their faith,</hi> the perfection of their graces, and the complete <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſouls.</hi> Surely then, it becomes us <hi>not to weep for them, but for ourſelves.</hi> — Our <hi>loſs</hi> is their unſpeakable <hi>gain;</hi> — they are gone from us, but are <hi>with Christ, which is far better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND, Bleſſed be GOD, we have juſt ground to believe, that theſe are the happy circumſtances of our DEPARTED BROTHER, whoſe death has occaſioned the preſent diſcourſe. — I am not fond of funeral encomiums; nor averſe to pay a juſt tribute of honour to thoſe GOD his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by his grace, and made uncommonly uſeful in the world; — <hi>The memory of the just is bleſſed, and the righteous ſhould be had in everlaſting remembrance.</hi> To give flattering titles, I am ſure is contrary to my principles, and, I think, as diſtant from my temper. It is in vain to flatter the dead, and I am under no temptation to complement the living. — I ſhall therefore only mention ſome things in the character of our
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005268_0024_1016F2FCDED3A1D0"/>
deceaſed <hi>Friend,</hi> which were <hi>lovely and of good report;</hi> and recommend them to the imitation of the ſurvivors.</p>
               <p>HE was born and brought up in the boſom of the CHURCH OF SCOTLAND; and ever retained the higheſt reverence for its DOCTRINE, CONSTITUTION and DISCIPLINE. He was educated in the <hi>Univerſity of EDINBURGH,</hi> and advanced by that illuſtrious Body, to the higheſt honours that belong to his profeſſion. — But piety is the brighteſt ornament of human nature; and of this he was a ſhining example. He was favoured with a religious education, which made an early impreſſion upon his mind, and thro' grace diſpoſed him to a thoughtful concern for his eternal welfare. In the younger years of life, — in thoſe days which in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Solomon,</hi> are emphatically ſtiled <hi>the days of vanity;</hi> he gave up himſelf to GOD, and joyfully entered under the bonds of the covenant of grace; and in the courſe of a long and uſeful life, maintained the honour of his profeſſion, and adorned it by a converſation becoming the Goſpel. He dedicated his morning hours to the ſacred exerciſes of devotion; and roſe early, that he might have time to converſe with GOD and divine things, without noiſe or interruption. He was very punctual and exemplary in the devotions of his family; and took care, not only of the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005268_0025_1016F2FE63FFDDB8"/>
bodies, but ſouls, of thoſe committed to his charge; inſtructing them in the principles of religion, and exhorting them to the ſervice of his and their common LORD.</p>
               <p>THESE WALLS will be a laſting monument of his zeal for the houſe and public worſhip of GOD; in the erecting of which he ſpent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of his eſtate; and undertook a hazardous voyage to <hi>EUROPE,</hi> for the eſtabliſhment and ſecurity of this infant ſociety. Upon theſe, and other accounts too numerous to be mentioned, — while a PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH ſubſiſts in the <hi>City of NEW-YORK,</hi> the name of D<hi rend="sup">R</hi>. NICOLL, will ever be remembered with honour, as one of its principal <hi>Founders,</hi> and greateſt <hi>Benefactor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE were few projects ſet on foot, for the propagation of undefiled religion, in which his affectionate deſires were not engaged for their proſperity, and his charitable contributions for their ſupport.</p>
               <p>IN the buſineſs of his calling, he was faithful and ſucceſsful. He <hi>went about doing good,</hi> with unwearied diligence; not barely from a worldly motive, — that he might increaſe his buſineſs, and recommend himſelf to his patients; but from a ſenſe of duty to GOD, and an affectionate regard to the lives and health of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:005268_0026_1016F300401E74E0"/>FROM this principle it was, that he not only viſited the poor in their ſickneſs, and adminiſtred to them, without any proſpect of gain; — but alſo with a large and bountiful hand diſpenſed his charity among them. He was never deaf to the complaints of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor blind to the objects of pity and compaſſion: His eye affected his heart, and his hand was continually ſtretched forth for their relief and ſupport. His charities were not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with noiſe and oſtentation, nor proclaimed with the ſound of a trumpet; but carefully concealed from the eyes of the world; and like the gentle ſhowers of heaven, deſcended in a ſecret and ſilent plenty. There are few men to whom thoſe words of <hi>Job</hi> may be more juſtly applied, — <hi>he delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs that had none to help him: the bleſſing of her that was ready to periſh came upon him, and he cauſed the widow's heart to ſing for joy.</hi> In the character of a friend, he was kind and beneficient, chearfully embracing all opportunities of doing good, within the circle of his acquaintance.</p>
               <p>IF I ſhould go on, and conſider him in the ſtation of a <hi>Huſband, Father,</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> — he deſerves the character of one of the FIRST THREE; and upon a juſt compariſon, will be found to have left but few equals. — But the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005268_0027_1016F3041EED82D0"/>
moſt amiable qualifications of nature, and richeſt endowments of grace, afford no exemption from the common law of mortality. Our dear Friend, — THE BELOVED PHYSICIAN, — is dead!</p>
               <p>HIS diſtemper was ſudden, and ſnatch'd him out of the world, almoſt without any warning. But during his ſhort ſickneſs, he was favoured with the free uſe of his underſtanding, and the comfortable exerciſe of his faith. He declared his only hope of eternal happineſs, was built upon the merits and RIGHTEOUSNESS OF JESUS CHRIST, and expreſs'd a firm and unſhaken truſt in that <hi>Bleſſed Redeemer,</hi> to whom he had committed his Soul in the days of his health and ſtrength. He met death without terror, and with calmneſs and compoſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his immortal ſpirit into the hands of GOD that gave it.</p>
               <p>HIS children have loſt an affectionate parent; — his ſervants an indulgent maſter; — the common-wealth a valuable member; — the church of Chriſt a ſtedfaſt friend; — the ſick a ſkilful phyſician, — and the poor a generous benefactor: His removal has occaſioned a general grief; but has made the wideſt breach in this congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005268_0028_1016F306D47A37D0"/>BUT, tho' our earthly friends die; yet the LORD LIVES; and bleſſed be the GOD OF OUR SALVATION! Let us therefore <hi>not mourn,</hi> as <hi>thoſe that are without hope;</hi> but pour out our prayers to the GOD of all grace, that he would raiſe up, animate, and ſtrengthen others, to ſtand in the room of thoſe, who have <hi>ſerved their generation by the will of God,</hi> and are gone off the ſtage with comfort and applauſe. Let us all <hi>work the works of him that ſent us, while it is day,</hi> and live in a diligent preparation for the <hi>coming of our LORD;</hi> — that when we have <hi>finiſhed our courſe;</hi> we alſo may ſleep in JESUS; and finally have a happy meeting with all thoſe, <hi>who thro' faith and patience inherit the promiſes.</hi> Which GOD of his infinite mercy grant, thro' the merits and mediation of JESUS CHRIST;</p>

               <l>WHILE you, DU BOIS, command the tears to flow,</l>
               <l>And every boſom beats with ſilent woe;</l>
               <l>An infant Muſe awakes her dying fire,</l>
               <l>And in a FUNERAL-SONG reſumes the lyre.</l>
               <l>Permit me then in penſive ſtrains to mourn,</l>
               <l>Join in thy grief, and echo groan to groan,</l>
               <l>And drop a tear on NICOLL'S ſacred urn:</l>
               <l>In mingled torrents let our grief flow down;</l>
               <l>I weep the <hi>Friend,</hi> while you the <hi>Parent</hi> moan.</l>

               <l>FORGIVE, <hi>immortal Shade!</hi> if aught can riſe</l>
               <l>Warbled from duſt to the ſuperior ſkies,</l>
               <l>A feeble <hi>mortal,</hi> who wou'd fain rehearſe</l>
               <l>Thy deathleſs vertues in unfading verſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>OH! ſpeak, DU BOIS, (thoſe joyleſs glooms diſpel)</l>
               <l>You, whom he lov'd, his vertues beſt can tell;</l>
               <l>Say when, for oft in converſe you were join'd,</l>
               <l>What were the dictates of his holy mind?</l>
               <l>What heavenly ſounds flow'd from his breaſt refin'd?</l>
               <l>Oft' have I ſeen thee, when he ſpoke, rejoice</l>
               <l>To hear the accents of a <hi>Father</hi>'s voice;</l>
               <l>To hear him ſoar above this dull abode,</l>
               <l>And talk of Heaven, of Vertue, of his GOD:</l>
               <l>What ſacred flames his glowing breaſt inſpir'd,</l>
               <l>When from the world in ſilence he retir'd!</l>
               <l>But now no more his raptur'd boſom glows;</l>
               <l>No more the <hi>Church</hi> his heavenly tranſport knows;</l>
               <l>Death, the grim TYRANT of the human-race,</l>
               <l>Breathleſs enfolds him in her cold embrace.</l>

               <l>Whoſe boundleſs thoughts celeſtial joys purſue;</l>
               <l>For, lo! the man for piety rever'd,</l>
               <l>Who ſcarcely but thro' human frailty err'd;</l>
               <l>Tho' grave religion ſhone around his head,</l>
               <l>Promiſcuous lies among the vulgar dead!</l>

               <l>Who never unreliev'd forſook his door:</l>
               <l>His alms deſcended like the flowing light,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Poverty</hi> look'd chearful in his ſight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>STRANGER to civil and religious ſtrife,</l>
               <l>He paſs'd the ſtages of a peaceful life:</l>
               <l>In <hi>youth</hi> he flouriſh'd o'er the <hi>youthful</hi> throng;</l>
               <l>Thro' temperance ſevere his <hi>age</hi> was ſtrong;</l>
               <l>No ſlow diſeaſes wore his frame away;</l>
               <l>He fled at once, — impatient of delay.</l>
               <l>So ſome tall OAK, the monarch of the woods,</l>
               <l>Exalts his tow'ring ſummit to the clouds;</l>
               <l>The ſpreading boughs extended o'er the plain,</l>
               <l>From heat defend, and ſhelter from the rain;</l>
               <l>Till by ſome furious ſtorm's deſtructive rage,</l>
               <l>He falls, — the honour of a lengthen'd age.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A MAN ſo excellent who but muſt grieve</l>
               <l>To loſe; yet <hi>Heaven</hi> rejoices to receive:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>There</hi> he is gone ſublimeſt joys to prove</l>
               <l>In the gay bow'rs that crown the ſeats above;</l>
               <l>Loud ſongs among the bliſsful choir to raiſe,</l>
               <l>And ſpend a glad eternity in praiſe.</l>
               <l>To diſtant ſhores his ever-living name</l>
               <l>Shall fly unſullied on the wings of fame.</l>

               <l>CEASE then, DU BOIS, thy tears, — no more complain,</l>
               <l>Nor weep an <hi>Angel,</hi> whom you lov'd a <hi>Man:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In youth immortal, ſee thy FATHER dreſt!</l>
               <l>In robes celeſtial, ſee him ſtand confeſt!</l>
               <l>All pain forever baniſh'd from his breaſt;</l>
               <l>Among the SONS OF LIGHT, his glad compeers,</l>
               <l>He ſees unnumber'd worlds, and treads the ſpheres.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>WHEN nature into ruin ſhall be hurl'd,</l>
               <l>And the laſt trump ſurprize th' aſtoniſh'd world;</l>
               <l>When clad in glory, GOD's eternal SON</l>
               <l>Shall ſit majeſtic on a radiant throne;</l>
               <l>GOD-LIKE, thy NICOLL'S ſacred duſt ſhall riſe,</l>
               <l>And his embodied ſpirit mount th' imperial ſkies.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>BUT can his lov'd <hi>Idea</hi> from thee go,</l>
               <l>Long as the vital ſtreams of nature flow?</l>
               <l>Tho' friendſhip ceaſe, and love no more inſpire</l>
               <l>The breaſts of lovers with a glowing fire;</l>
               <l>Yet THINE ſhall ſacred laſt, THINE undecay'd,</l>
               <l>Burn on thro' death, and animate thy Shade.</l>
