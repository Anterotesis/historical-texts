            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I AM honored, my dear ſir, by the correſpondence with which you favor me; and gratified, by the friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which you write to one, who can lay no other claim to your friendſhip, than that which ariſes from your benevolence. While your obſervations, on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſociety and government, entertain, they improve the mind. There is a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, in finding the ſentiments of others accord with our own; and mutual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may ariſe, by an interchange of ideas, while glowing friendſhip becomes more ardent and more pure: there is a luxury in friendly intercourſe, unknown to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar minds; nor can the vicious ever taſte its pureſt delights.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:022570_0013_0FB99AD8D557FD40"/>THE ſincerity of your friendſhip, I have never doubted; but am not ſo ready to enſure you againſt an imputation, on the ſoundneſs of your judgment, in the preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requeſt you make, for my "ſentiments on a mode of domeſtic education, ſuited to the preſent ſtate of ſociety, government and manners in this country." The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is important; it involves all the beſt intereſts of ſociety, of families, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals: but it has been the ſubject of ſo much diſquiſition; ſo many treatiſes have been written, and ſo many plans laid before the world which promiſed ſucceſs; that it may be deemed exhauſted, and drained of all materials for fabricating a new ſyſtem, or even for adding to, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improving upon, the old. Education, however, like an inexhauſtible fountain, may be drawn upon perpetually, without being drained: ſecret ſprings will remain in this extenſive and complicated ſcience; and ſucceeding generations will explore their hidden channels, and greatly accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the improvement of the human mind,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022570_0014_0FB99ADA30680F30"/>
the progreſs of virtue, and happineſs of the world: it is an art, a ſcience, on which our being, virtue and happineſs ſo much depend, that it muſt ever be an object of anxious attention, with thoughtful and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate parents.</p>
                     <p>HITHERTO, education has been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted as to contract the powers of the mind, by directing the current of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in a narrow channel: the object of it has been to teach WHAT TO THINK, rather than HOW TO THINK. The end of education, is, to unfold the latent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the human mind, direct them to ſuitable objects, and ſtrengthen them by exerciſe: it is the art of preparing child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren for the duties of life. The difficulty in giving a ſyſtem of education would be comparatively ſmall, if there was a general ſimilarity in the circumſtances of men: but theſe being various, their ſituations and views vary with them, and occaſion many exceptions to general principles, or rules.</p>
                     <p>IN order to conduct the buſineſs prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022570_0015_0FB99ADF302D7348"/>
the exceptions ariſing from particular caſes; and, which lead us to depart from general principles. Here aſſiſtance is moſt needed; and here it is moſt likely to fail: for the caſes are ſo numerous and complicated, that they fall not within the compaſs of imagination to conceive, nor of human ſkill to arrange.</p>
                     <p>THERE are, indeed, general exceptions and variations, which may be diſtinguiſhed with greater preciſion, and leſs difficulty: thoſe which ariſe from difference in climate, mode of government, and general circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſociety. The ſyſtems of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion written in Europe, are too local to be transferred to America: they are generally deſigned for a ſtyle of life, different from that, which it is neceſſary for the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the United States to adopt: they do not reach our circumſtances, and are not ſuited to the genius of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We have already ſuffered much by too great an avidity for Britiſh cuſtoms and manners: it is now time to become independent in our maxims, principles of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022570_0016_0FB99AE23AF6A290"/>
education, dreſs, and manners, as we are in our laws and government. To promote this kind of independence, for which the late revolution opens a glorious theatre, ſhall be my humble attempt, in the ſequel.</p>
                     <p>YOU will be ſo good, as to make my reſpectful compliments to Mrs. —, who, you inform me, is about to place her daughter at the female academy: the deſign, I think, is laudable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Much has been ſaid on female edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and much remains to be ſaid on that ſubject, and on the dignity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the female character. I hope, in the courſe of theſe memoirs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething towards reſcuing this gem from the ſtate in which the pride or inattention of man has too long kept it; and without which all attempts to improve the mode of education will be vain.</p>
                     <p>IN my next, I will offer you ſome thoughts preparatory to the object in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022570_0017_0FB99AE332392D80"/>
view; and, in the mean time, muſt ſolicit your candor: for it will not be in my power to obſerve rigid order, in the courſe of epiſtolary writing, on a ſubject which involves ſo great a variety of tranſactions.</p>

example will not fail of an happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on public opinions, cuſtoms and manners.</p>
                     <p>ENCOURAGED by theſe auſpicious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I ſhall proceed to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations preparatory to my deſign, with this unpleaſant aſſurance, after all that can be ſaid, that the ſubject will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by ſome, and will be unattend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by many: careleſſneſs and ignorance will be the fault of many parents, and the ruin of many children. To addreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the infant mind, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that period of education, which may be called the ſeaſon of impreſſions, ſo as to favor the main deſign of it, requires much prudence and application.</p>
                     <p>IN America, children are generally reared up in a domeſtic ſtate, and by their parents: few are put to nurſe; fewer ſtill committed to the care of private tutors. In general they are to be brought forward by the foſtering hand of education, in thoſe little diſtinct ſocieties which uſually conſiſt of parents, children and ſervants;

all of whom have a reciprocal influence upon each other: here the firſt dawn of mental, as well as animal life commences. In this mixed ſociety, the mind is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its firſt tints; the models from which it takes firſt impreſſions, ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Here the ſparks of genius are fanned or extinguiſhed; the diſpoſition, like the flowing current, takes its courſe; and hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its are formed, which are carried into life.</p>
                     <p>NOT only the order and tranquillity of the domeſtic ſtate; but of ſociety, depend on what paſſes here.</p>
                     <p>THOSE who are accuſtomed, in their youth, to the reſtraints of domeſtic diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, will invariably make peaceable and worthy members of ſociety: their habits are ſuited to the government of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to whoſe laws they will cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully yield obedience: and that parent who leaves a family of children, early

It is neceſſary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to conſider the principles, on which this miniature of ſociety and government is founded; and to become acquainted with the rights and duties of the ſeveral departments of it. A more full illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this will take place in the progreſs of the buſineſs before us.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the great Parent of the Univerſe brought Eve to the father of mankind, he doubtleſs had the happineſs of both parties equally in view; and to perfect their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as ſocial beings, united them in the neareſt compact for life. Why, then, are not the married more generally happy? Becauſe their hearts do not beat in uniſon; they have ſeparate pleaſures, oppoſite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and from trifling differences, which prudence ſhould lead them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate, proceed coldneſs and reſerve: feuds and animoſities ſucceed; domeſtic enjoyment is forever baniſhed; and, the once peaceful dwelling, is turned into a ſcene of perpetual hoſtilities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:022570_0023_0FB99AF6B292E640"/>IT is, therefore, indiſpenſably neceſſary for perſons, who are about to unite in theſe ſacred bonds, to conſider in what reſpect they are qualified to render mutual eſteem laſting, and the married ſtate happy. Riches and beauty may, for a while, ſtrengthen the tie; and good ſenſe render it more permanent: but mutual felicity cannot be ſecure, without a ſimilarity of temper and diſpoſition, a reciprocity of affection and ſentiment; a "thought meeting thought," a "will preventing will." Parental affection can only have a genuine and permanent exiſtence, where there is a union of hearts. "The paſſions of thoſe who may be differently united, are, it is true, owing to the principles of nature; but miſdirected, or violently forced into unfortunate circumſtances. They are, like ſparks of heavenly fire, deſigned to animate and bleſs; but falling on improper materials, they waſte or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the property of mankind." Parental affection, in minds united by low intereſts, by ambition or intrigue, but not congenial,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022570_0024_0FB99AF912865EE0"/>
may be tender ſometimes, but not uniform in its operations.</p>
                     <p>THIS affection, virtuouſly founded, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the complicated charm and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that undefinable union which blends excellent minds, is among the moſt glowing in all nature; and leads parents to regard a child's intereſt in preference to their own. On this affection, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that parental authority, which, in its nature, is abſolute: but great prudence is requiſite in the exerciſe of it: the ſeat of this empire, ſhould be in the affections, and not over the perſon.</p>
                     <p>TO the mother, nature has committed a moſt important truſt; the education of girls wholly, and of boys, until they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proper ſubjects for the regular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the father; on whom the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the conſent of all ages, have devolved the protection and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this little community. He is formed by nature for the arduous buſineſs of providing for his houſehold; and he is worſe than an infidel who neglects it.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022570_0025_0FB99AFC8950B460"/>
His ſocial connexion, conjugal ties, and parental affection, combine to diſpoſe and excite him to ſeek and promote the good of the whole.</p>
                     <p>THE calls of depraved appetite, have ſometimes precipitated worthleſs men into gratifications inconſiſtent with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and led them to neglect their families. The moſt fatal conſequences have followed from ſuch conduct: the minds of children left uncultivated, with examples of vice continually before them, have grown up, like thoſe evil weeds that infeſt the neglected ſoil, and become the peſt of ſociety. Some, indeed, under all theſe diſadvantages, have, by the ſtrength of genius, and the goodneſs of their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, gained their proper rank in the world; but many have fallen among the ſplendid ruins of human nature, and been forever loſt to the world.</p>
                     <p>BUT no man of reflection, or of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, will thus abandon thoſe he has choſen for his inmates, or whom nature has committed to his care. He will uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022570_0026_0FB99AFF1B0753A8"/>
exemplify before them, whatever he would have them practice; and ſtudy to promote the eaſe and convenience of all his houſehold. He will never appear as an arbitrary ruler over them; but as an affectionate and benevolent patron. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the gentle ſpirit of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, he will baniſh from his breaſt all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeneſs and peeviſhneſs which would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter his own life, and render his family unhappy. Inſpired with a ſoft and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper, the mildneſs and equity of his government will meet every expreſſion of filial affection, and reſpect in return.</p>
                     <p>HOW pleaſing the ſcene!—a good man aſſiſting with ſoft language of conjugal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the cares of his dear partner; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental fondneſs ſwimming in his eyes; gentle and kind to his ſervants; doing a thouſand offices of tenderneſs, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear him to his little flock; and ſmiling on all around.

Indeed, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to do juſtice to its owners, or fully to deſcribe the felicity of this domeſtic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. I ſhall only aim at ſome leading traits of their domeſtic hiſtory. If, by doing this in a plain, ſimple narration of facts, with ſuch incidental remarks and

                     <p>PERMIT me, ſir, to conduct you into this enchanting manſion, where dwell the happy pair, whoſe hearts are inſeparably joined in conjugal affection. To attempt a deſcription of their ſituation and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by alluſions to magnificent build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſplendid equipage, and a numerous train of ſervile attendants, would be to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their merit, and degrade their eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind. To give a romantic pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beauty and pleaſantneſs of this healthful ſituation, would be doing injuſtice to that which is real.</p>
                     <p>NATURE had done every thing that could be wiſhed, to make it ſuſceptible of the improvement of art, the embelliſhments of taſte, and the culturing hand of induſtry— qualities which remarkably united in the poſſeſſors of this delectable ſpot. Under

the auſpices of ſuch advantages, what will not the imagination figure to itſelf, of beauty, elegance, and taſte? How is the eye allured away through opening proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, where it meets a variety of pleaſing objects! Now ſurveying the ſlow, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic movement of the river, which flows down in lengthening ſweep and loſes itſelf behind yonder hills; affording a variety of landſcapes, which arreſt the attention and excite the philoſophic ſpeculation!

                     <p>NOT far diſtant, weſtward, ſtands an inland town of reſpectable ſize. In the region of this ſettlement, lived the worthy parents of Mr. and Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove: the one a magiſtrate of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and activity in the diſcharge of his office. He was literally "a terror to evil doers and a praiſe to thoſe who did well." The other, though a gentleman of public education, was a FARMER of great induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, economy, and virtue; equally famed for generoſity and beneficence. Both were patrons of the poor; promoters of knowledge and uſeful arts among all claſſes of people. They were, eſpecially, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the eſtabliſhment of ſchools for the benefit of the children of the poor as well as the rich; and by theſe means, learning was generally diffuſed; the youth were not only preſerved from the deſtructive effects of idleneſs and ignorance, but trained to knowledge, induſtry, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous habits.</p>

                     <p>IT, fortunately, happened that the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt child of one of thoſe families was a daughter; that of the other a ſon: their education was ſimilar, as it reſpected the principles of virtue, or the economy of life. They were ſent abroad to complete their education, and give a poliſh to their manners; but were not kept abroad ſo long as to loſe their knowledge, or reliſh for domeſtic concerns; or to acquire a falſe taſte, or romantic ideas. An early cultivation of the moral qualities of the heart, and a taſte for acquiring uſeful knowledge, ſeaſonably infuſed, afforded them a balance againſt the ſeductions of vice and the illuſions of fancy.— I am agreeably interrupted by the arrival of your friend —, whoſe tarry in this town will be ſo ſhort, that he will ſcarcely

                     <p>THE ſimilarity in their age and ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation, formed a congeniality of temper and ſentiment, on which reſt mutual eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and confidence: their hearts beat in uniſon, and accorded to every thing benevolent and good. They inherited the good qualities of their parents, and improved on their virtues. Their habits being fixed on the ſame principles and by ſimilar cauſes, they conceived an early at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to each other; which, being founded on mutual eſteem, grew by degrees into an ardent affection, and was followed by their marriage on the evening of the 27th of October, in the year —. Now

had the rolling ſeaſons crowned the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the huſbandman, and amply rewarded all his toil: prolific nature had poured a profuſion of her delicious fruits into the lap of induſtry, gladdening every heart with a portion of her goods. Such was the flattering ſeaſon of their nuptials— joy ſparkled in every eye, at beholding the union of the happy pair; in whom they anticipated the virtues of their excellent anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>THEY were not diſappointed in their expectations: like the opening flower, that gradually unfolds to the ſun, their virtues expanded on every occaſion, and came forth to view. The incidents of life, fell in train, ſo as to ſtrike out the latent qualities of the heart, and produce great and worthy actions. Education too often contracts the affections to the narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of kindred and family connexions: but this is a degree of ſelfiſhneſs unknown to generous minds. But, theirs had been conducted on ſo liberal a plan, that, while they were attached to their connexions, their genial influence extended to all around them.</p>

                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:022570_0037_0FB99B20DD17A990"/>EDUCATION, properly managed, has reference to every relation in life: it teaches to think and act on a large ſcale; and to diſcharge the duties of every rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſtance in life with fidelity. The tranſition, of a well educated perſon, from filial piety to conjugal affection and parental tenderneſs; to kind maſter, or miſtreſs; to good neighbour, faithful friend, obedient ſubject, and good mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety; is natural and eaſy. Into all theſe ſhapes, will that philanthrophy, which ſuch an education inſpires, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form itſelf, as occaſion requires. Indeed, love, like the law of attraction, operates more forcibly upon thoſe who are nearly allied to us by the ties of nature, than thoſe at a diſtance, or thoſe with whom we have no connexion. This is a very happy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in the conſtitution of things; otherwiſe our ſocial affections would be loſt amidſt the multiplicity of objects, without being able to fix on any.

                     <p>MR.

But, as long as a man's houſe affords him a ſanctuary from the diſappointments and vexations of the world, he will retire to it, as to a caſtle of defence and ſecurity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inroads of all his foes. Of all the animoſities to which the human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions expoſe us, thoſe of a domeſtic nature are moſt to be dreaded, becauſe they wound the tendereſt feelings of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It has been juſtly obſerved, "there are two things that affect the heart of every ingenuous man moſt deeply, viz. good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and generous offices from thoſe, to whom we have been injurious; and an ill natured, unkind treatment from thoſe to whom we have been kind and affectionate. As to the former, we can bear their hatred, becauſe we have deſerved it; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear their love, it quite confounds and overcomes us: and as to the latter, it is
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022570_0042_0FB99B335022DC00"/>
certain we can endure the utmoſt rancor and malice of others, better than the leaſt coldneſs and indifference from thoſe, whom we have made it our conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>WHATEVER comes from our neareſt friends, as an expreſſion of love, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as a ſubſtantial obligation; and feel the moſt delicate touches of pleaſure from the ſmiles of friendſhip: but neglect and unkindneſs, from neareſt friends, blaſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery joy, and give the moſt ſenſible pain. To be always ſure of that frank and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reception at home, of which Mr. Bloomſgrove never failed; to be united with thoſe, to whom we may diſcharge the fulneſs of the ſoul, unburden our cares, and ſhare our joys, muſt be an unfailing ſource of domeſtic peace and pleaſure: for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, like a ſtream, grows weaker by being divided; and joy, like light, increaſes and brightens by being communicated.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove, ever ſtudious of the happineſs of his family, was careful to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more of thoſe attentions and civilities
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022570_0043_0FB99B346FCFCEA0"/>
into his own houſe, which he obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, than is uſual. There would be little occaſion for domeſtic ſtrife, if men were as ſolicitous to pleaſe at home as they are, when abroad. Whatever our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic character may be, we chooſe to appear in the moſt favorable light before the public: On the public theatre, we appear in the moſt advantageous attitude; we wiſh the eſteem of others, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to gain their reſpect by our dreſs, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and addreſs. Behind the ſcene, we are in a diſhabille: here our true charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appears: our domeſtic behavior is the proper teſt of our virtue and good nature; for our good or ill breeding is chiefly ſeen abroad; our good or ill nature at home.</p>
                     <p>IN a family, there are continual oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for thoſe little acts of civility and good humor, which, though trifling in themſelves, are great in their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. As a little ſpark kindles a great fire, ſo virtues of the firſt magnitude ſpring from theſe ſmall beginnings. Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence is ſeldom called into exerciſe
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022570_0044_0FB99B36AD051DB0"/>
by any great event, which gives us op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make a brilliant diſplay of it: but in a domeſtic ſtate, occaſions are often occurring; and, it is in a daily and uninterrupted diſcharge of the common offices of life, by ſaying many obliging things, and, if poſſible, doing more, that the habits of it become fixed and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. On the other hand, by indulging an occaſional fit of ill humor, we prepare the way for another; and ſo for an habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſourneſs of temper: and by harbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpirit of contradiction, we cheriſh a temper that degrades the character of man; diſturbs the common peace, and deſtroys domeſtic enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>IT ſhould be conſidered, that many weakneſſes and imperfections attend us: that the faireſt characters are not ſpotleſs. Subjected alike to infirmities, we ſhould exerciſe mutual lenity and forbearance; and conſtrue all doubtful actions in the moſt favorable point of light. It is a truth, I believe, verified by common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; that thoſe who have the moſt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022570_0045_0FB99B3D3032FD40"/>
foibles and faults of their own, are moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient with thoſe of others: they are ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt provoked and hardeſt to be reclaimed. But he, who deſires the candor of others toward himſelf, muſt learn to exerciſe the ſame gentle ſpirit towards them.</p>
                     <p>IF you recollect that domeſtic educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is carried on by example as well as inſtruction, you will at once ſee that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between the heads of the family is neceſſary; and, therefore, that theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are not out of place.</p>

                     <p>IN a family, where the heads acted in concert, as if informed by one ſoul; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopting each other's cares, uniting their friendly beams, and jointly promoting the common happineſs; the education of children was comparatively light and eaſy. Such was the advantage enjoyed in the Bloomſgrove family. No ſooner was the important truſt of children committed to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022570_0046_0FB99B3FBA9A6D18"/>
them, than they conſulted upon the beſt method of educating their charge. They found it was in vain to read the ſyſtems of education then extant: little elſe could be collected from them, than general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for preſerving health, and teaching them letters, and figures. They were ſuited to a diſtant meridian; and had ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence, either to the management of the children of nobility, or to the public edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of young gentlemen deſtined to one or other of the learned profeſſions. None of them extended to the culture of the heart,<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Kaimes is the firſt, among the numerous writers on education, who conſiders the culture of the heart as the chief branch of it.</note> and that domeſtic education which lays the foundation of virtue, and is moſt uſeful in training children to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>KNOWLEDGE may be acquired at ſchools and under preceptors; but virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles are of incomparably more worth than mere ſcience. The culture of the heart, and exerciſing children to virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022570_0047_0FB99B412647C248"/>
habits, falls chiefly to parents, and eſpecially, to mothers. Avoiding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the track marked out in any ſyſtem, they had recourſe to the intimations of nature; to the ſtate of ſociety, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and manners in their own country. They conſidered education as an appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip for the employments of life; and that to be qualified for thoſe employments, was an object of the higheſt importance: that, to prepare them to diſcharge the offices of good huſbands and wives; good parents; dutiful children; affectionate relations and friends; uſeful members of communities; and benevolent citizens of the world; was the province, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty of parents. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of theſe duties are ſimilar in all men; and the meaſures to be taken with all children, to render them moral agents, are ſimilar. Thoſe which were adopted in the Bloomſgrove family, were proved to be moſt judicious by the ſucceſs which accompanied them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="unknown:022570_0048_0FB99B444058D630"/>THEY conſidered, that the qualifications neceſſary to render domeſtic connexions happy, were, a heart ſuſceptible of deep impreſſions; a mind poſſeſſed of a lively diſcernment of merit; a ſenſe of honor, and delicacy of moral taſte, which would prevent their ſacrificing to appetite, what ſhould be yielded only to affectionate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and friendſhip; an attachment to truth and fidelity; with a fortitude ſo ſtrong and firm, as would carry them through every toil and danger, rather than violate deliberate engagements. They were convinced that an education which had theſe important objects in view, could not be conducted ſo much by precept, as by exerciſes alluding to thoſe ſituations.</p>
                     <p>"THE uſe and abuſe of power; the union of real tenderneſs and judgment; the difference of genuine prudence or a deſire of happineſs, and the paſſions of av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arice or ambition; the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs requiſite in conducting a family to be a bleſſing, and not a nuiſance or a curſe: theſe cannot come by chance; the mind

is apt to revolt, if enjoined with ſeverity to adopt them; and the likely method to obtain our purpoſe, is by numerous and judicious experiments, blended with the incidents of our family, and calculated to produce conviction and habit.</p>
                     <p>"THE duties and obligations of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; of brothers and ſiſters; of friends; of magiſtrates and ſubjects; and of men to each other in all variations of ſituation, climate, and government:—theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on all men, and the buſineſs of education ſhould be, not merely to furniſh the memory with arbitrary maxims, but to qualify us for them, by occurrences and incidents." Thus reaſoned Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove. And this is the method pointed out by reaſon, philoſophy, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage, in particular caſes: youth, for inſtance, when qualifying for any partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular occupation or employment, are not taught the art by dry leſſon or precepts; but are, for a long time, exerciſed in the practical branches of the employment to which they are deſtined.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:022570_0050_0FB99B4CA8807050"/>AS the moral character grows out of the intellectual, ſo it is neceſſary that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of knowledge be directed and ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; and that curioſity be guided to proper objects of inquiry, but never checked by ſeverity, or perverted by indiſcretion: in the former caſe, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant faculty will be diſappointed in its exertions; in the latter, habits of creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſuperſtition may become fixed, which cannot be removed; and in both caſes, infantile improvements will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                     <p>IT has been ingeniouſly obſerved that, "the great and general qualities, which conſtitute all the virtues we can practiſe, are few, ſimple, and to be taught in the early years of infancy. Theſe are, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the names, properties, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things; and a deſire thoroughly to underſtand them: the uſe of knowledge in providing for our wants, conferring benefits, and doing ſervices: and the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary effects of reciprocal benefits, in producing attachments or affections; the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022570_0051_0FB99B4DCF5CF008"/>
the general ingredients of all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues."</p>
                     <p>IN this reſpect the parents of Oſander and Rozella (for ſo we ſhall call them) followed Rouſſeau's maxim, but not his method; they were conſtantly pouring inſtruction into their minds. His Emile is not to be taught any thing until twelve years of age, and yet he ſpends his whole time in giving him uſeful leſſons; aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the growing genius, and communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the materials which his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had collected. Though he is to learn nothing from books or ſchools, yet he is to have the benefit of all the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge with which a whole life, of ſtudy and obſervation, had furniſhed a learned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor.—He muſt be a blockhead indeed who does not improve in ſuch a ſchool!</p>
                     <p>BUT every man, to whom the care of children is committed, is not a Rouſſeau, nor is every child an Emilius or a Sophia: neither are we aerial beings, that we ſhould ſubſiſt on ſentimental diet: application to labor, or ſome kind of employment, is
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022570_0052_0FB99B565692DEA0"/>
NECESSARY for moſt people, and PROPER for all. It is humiliating, I confeſs, that we are obliged to ſpend ſo great a part of time in procuring the means of ſupplying the perpetual wants of a body we muſt ſoon throw away: but, degrading as it may ſeem, it is unavoidable; and it is the more neceſſary, as the organs of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible maſs, are the only vehicles of the intelligence within. To keep thoſe organs in repair is one part of education. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to this, and to the diſcharge of the ſocial offices, will be an effectual bar againſt parents having their children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their ſight: and it is impoſſible to ſay what impreſſions they may receive from the object then before them.</p>
                     <p>WE muſt take children as they are, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a variety of humors, diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and propenſities; and endeavor to make them what we wiſh them to be; conſider the circumſtances which actually ſurround them, and not figure to ourſelves an imaginary ſituation, in which we might ſuppoſe education could be carried on to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022570_0053_0FB99B58D4CC43B8"/>
advantage. Fine ſpun theories may amuſe the vivid imagination; but, it is practice only that makes perfect; and vain are all the hopes of theory, when unſupported by experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whoever will be at the pains to caſt his eye on the world, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE ſucceſs of education depends on the ſteps which are taken in the early ſtage of life, before any bad impreſſions are made. Numerous are the avenues to the human heart. Eaſy of acceſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled by diſguiſe, it admits the images which firſt offer themſelves; and theſe images are not eaſily effaced. Too early an attention, therefore, cannot be paid to the caſe of thoſe helpleſs creatures who are committed to the mercy of parents, unconſcious of their own condition, and of the effect the impreſſions then made will have upon their future character and

                     <p>AGREEABLY to your requeſt, my dear ſir, I will now give you an epit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome of their method of proceeding with the two promiſing children: and then follow them ſtep by ſtep through the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſtages of education from birth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture age.</p>
                     <p>AS parents are to be the models, upon which children are to form their temper and manners, ſo they ſhould underſtand what they would have their children ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; and be themſelves what they wiſh their children to be. In their parents, Oſander and Rozella ſaw the fair form of virtue in its moſt pleaſing atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: their example acted in concert with their counſel, and ſeldom failed of its proper effect. They were careful to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022570_0055_0FB99B61A1AE3140"/>
an entire authority over their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which they continued to exerciſe without ſeverity, or having recourſe to any violence. The propriety of this ſtep will appear, if we conſider that reaſon, in children, is feeble even after i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>egins to exert itſelf, and that parental authority is the ſubſtitute which nature has provided for the period of impreſſions:—"and, as no work of God is left imperfect, children are directed by inſtinct to obey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and if they be not unkindly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their obedience is not only voluntary, but affectionate. This is not a picture of imagination: every one who has given attention to the infant ſtate, will bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that a child clings to its mother, and is fonder of her than of all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. By this admirable plan, children who have but little reaſon, are commonly better governed, than adult perſons who poſſeſs a conſiderable ſhare of it; the former are entirely obſequious to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of another; the latter, not always to their own." From the mild and gentle,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022570_0056_0FB99B64DB132AE8"/>
but firm and ſteady exerciſe of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, many other advantages flow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that inſtruction which may be more eaſily conveyed to the mind. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preparative for ſocial life; and for that ſelf command, which we have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion frequently to exerciſe through every part of life.</p>
                     <p>THERE is a falſe tenderneſs, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents many parents from exerciſing that authority over their children which their humors require, leſt it ſhould give them pain: but they conſider not that they are ſacrificing the happineſs of their offspring, in the future part of life, to ſave themſelves a few moments preſent pain. But ſuch parents do not obtain the end they aim at: for the humors and caprices of children increaſe by indulgence: and, being tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated in children, they become their own tormentors, and deprive their parents of that quiet and peace which they did not chooſe to have diſturbed by ſeaſonably correcting their childiſh error.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:022570_0057_0FB99B65B9213E80"/>IT was the happy lot of theſe children to be under the direction of wiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous parents, who corrected their errors by removing their cauſes: and by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adjuſting their little deviations in ſeaſon, put it into their power to enjoy a much greater degree of happineſs than others; "while the eſſential principles of future excellence were taking root in their minds." Senſible of all theſe advantages, they failed not to allure their children to obedience, by all thoſe endearing methods which render it as agreeable as it is uſeful.</p>
                     <p>THIS foundation being well laid, no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was wanting to erect the ſuperſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They were careful to remove all bad examples from their ſight: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, were cautious whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their family. The aſſiduity of parents, to educate their children, will be loſt without an attention to this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: the advice and example of a ſubtle and vicious ſervant will do more towards deluding children to devious courſes, than all the counſel and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022570_0058_0FB99B71383BCC38"/>
of parents can do to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>THESE obſtructions to domeſtic educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being out of the way; and the parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al authority eſtabliſhed, they taught their children a right deportment to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; to each other; and to all other members of the family; and exerciſed them in the practical branches of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they taught. They were habituated, from infancy, to obſerve the ſabbath as a day devoted to God, and ſerious purpoſes; and to attend public worſhip, as the beſt ſchool of good manners, as well as the nurſery of religious principles. They were not only taught the principles of benevolence and charity to men; of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and compaſſion to inſects and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imals, but trained to practiſe upon thoſe principles. Their curioſity was directed to proper objects, and generally gratified. As they advanced in years, their parents endeavored to lead their minds up to God; to view him as a being who had no beginning, and will have no end; poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022570_0059_0FB99B7337133670"/>
of all power; perfectly wiſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good: as a being who is every where preſent, and never changes his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or diſpoſition; who governs all things, and is peculiarly pleaſed with the pious and good.</p>
                     <p>AS ſoon as they were capable of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between virtue and vice, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was preſented to the mind in all its odious colors; the former, in the moſt pleaſing light. Truth and integrity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſſential to every good character, and the foundation of every other virtue, they were careful to repreſent fraud, falſehood, and deceit in all their deformities: and they had the pleaſure of noticing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of frankneſs in Oſander, at the age of twelve, which did him honor; while it afforded his parents the moſt heartfelt ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction. At a neighbor's, on a viſit with his mamma and ſiſter, he happened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the houſe while the company were walking in the garden: being alone, he began to play with a tennis ball which he had in his pocket: it accidentally fell
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022570_0060_0FB99B7577623518"/>
upon a pile of china cups, and, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting them, broke a number: but, as he was alone in the room, and had not been miſſed by the company, he was not in danger of being ſuſpected; but his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous ſoul diſdained to have others ſuffer for his faults: he frankly informed his mamma of the accident, and deſired her to inform Mrs. —, the lady of the houſe, leſt ſome perſon ſhould be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accuſed. Senſible that a mind ſo open and candid would be expoſed to the ſeductions of the vicious, unleſs guarded by the principles, and exerciſed in the habits of virtue, they carried a watchful eye over his increaſing years.</p>
                     <p>IN the progreſs of theſe memoirs, we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of frankneſs and generoſity in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zella: at preſent I ſhall only obſerve, that ſhe had great ſenſibility; was poſſeſſed of a mild temper, and, for a child, had a good underſtanding: a little pertneſs, however, appeared ſometimes. This gave her mamma great uneaſineſs, eſpecially as
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022570_0061_0FB99B7BE2FB9CB8"/>
it had diſcovered itſelf in a few inſtances, by a degree of imperiouſneſs towards ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for Mrs. Bloomſgrove entertained a moſt delicate ſenſe of the rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; and the greateſt tenderneſs towards ſervants, and all perſons of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior circumſtances. To check every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this temper, which, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with children, is extremely diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in adult people, ſhe employed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant efforts: and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> order to render them ſucceſsful, ſhe kept her little daughter much under her own eye; and, by ſteady management, in time, cured her of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>A CHILD poſſeſſed of this temper to a high degree, will make itſelf amends for a temporary reſtraint and ſubmiſſion, in the preſence of the parent, by being perverſe to ſervants and impertinent to playmates, when out of ſight. The more ſubmiſſive it is when only occaſionally with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the more untractable it will be with others: and then, inſtead of being cured of one vice, it becomes guilty of another.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022570_0062_0FB99B7DC4809680"/>
The mildneſs which the child ſhews in the parent's preſence, is only the effect of ſubmiſſion, or temporary reſtraint, and in time will become hypocriſy and deceit. It is neceſſary, therefore, the parental eye be over it until reaſon, time, and habit, ſhall have wrought the cure, by giving a new current to the diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove early gave a check to the paſſion for dreſs which appears in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, by repreſenting to her the folly of a gaudy dreſs, and the greater neatneſs of a plain modeſt apparel. The female mind is often rendered vain by a profuſion of external ornaments in childhood. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inſtance of the prudent management of Mr. and Mrs. Bloomſgrove, was, their patiently waiting the progreſs of nature, to mature their children for the ſtage of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Parents who have been ambitious of puſhing their children forward ſooner than nature had prepared the way, have had reaſon to regret their folly: children, brought forward to public view before the judgment has had opportunity to form,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022570_0063_0FB99B7F5FE74838"/>
frequently mortify their parents by indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, from which thoſe are ſaved who wait the progreſs, and follow the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature.</p>
                     <p>AS every part of the human character is formed by habit, and habit by practical exerciſes, they wiſely determined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom their children to diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; with ſuch intervals of amuſement, as were neceſſary for health, cheerfulneſs, and vigor. Their amuſements, too, were ſo contrived, as to ſix habits of induſtry and promote the knowledge of buſineſs, ſuited to their reſpective ſex: our young maſter is furniſhed with a little ſpade and other tools ſuited to his age, that he may cultivate a ſpot in the garden for himſelf; in dreſſing this he vies with the gardener. While he is thus amuſing himſelf, he is acquiring habits of induſtry and ſome knowledge of agriculture.</p>
                     <p>ROZELLA, beſides making and dreſſing her doll, and other female amuſements, was furniſhed with a little bed in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; this ſhe dreſſed with her own hand,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022570_0064_0FB99B82B5106D48"/>
which vied with the lily in whiteneſs: ſhe often viſited her flowery; and watched, with increaſing delight, the opening tulip, the expanding roſe, the bluſhing violet, the unfading amaranth, and the various flowers which adorned her knot. This amuſement combined exerciſe and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, while it contributed to health, which bloomed in her prominent cheeks.</p>
                     <p>ALL amuſements, kept within proper bounds, contribute to promote the deſign of education; for ſuch is the connexion between bodily organs and intellectual operations, that the vigor of the latter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the tone of the former. But when they can be ſo contrived, as to effect theſe purpoſes, and exerciſe children in uſeful habits alſo, it muſt be a combination worthy of the attention of parents and preceptors.</p>

                     <p>ALREADY has it been obſerved, and ſure I am you will not conteſt the truth of it, that firſt impreſſions are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt durable; and that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of human life, depends much on the manner of our entering on the great theatre of the world. It is equally true, that the proſperity of the domeſtic ſtate is determined by the manner of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement: a full conviction of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire dependence on the providence of God; a determination to diſcharge all the relative duties of life, as a dictate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a duty of moral obligation, are qualities requiſite to the ſecurity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>THOSE who have neither tried this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, nor attended to the connexion between the natural and moral world; nor to the influence of piety on outward proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and eſpecially on our domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, may laugh at the idea. But do not thoſe very perſons wiſh to ſeek their
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022570_0066_0FB99B887657E550"/>
ſafety under the banner of religion, as the only ſanctuary in times of trouble; as the only ſource of comfort under the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of life? Impious men can look up to no protector in the time of trouble, while good men commit themſelves, with truſt and hope, to the care of heaven. "The human mind, naturally feeble, is made to feel all its own weakneſs by the meaſure of adverſity. Dejected with evils which overpower its ſtrength, it relies no longer on itſelf. It caſts every where around a wiſhing, exploring eye, for ſome ſhelter to ſcreen, ſome power to uphold it; and if, when abandoned by the world, it can find nothing to which it can fly in the room of the world, its ſtate is truly forlorn. Now whither ſhould the vicious, in this ſituation, turn for aid? After having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſtreams of adverſe fortune till their ſpirits are exhauſted, gladly would they retreat at laſt to the ſanctuary of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion."</p>
                     <p>THIS provides a ſource of comfort for the mind in the gloomy ſhades of ſolitude,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022570_0067_0FB99B9009C4F618"/>
or the painful hour of adverſity; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of ſickneſs, or the infirmities of age. In thoſe periods and conditions, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and horror oppreſs and affright the vicious, the man of piety enjoys compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mind: he has within himſelf a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, which, though it may be interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can never fail him; and, indeed, it is often the caſe, that as the world lowers and darkens before him, the light that is within him grows brighter; his hopes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their ſtrength; his deſires riſe to nobler objects; his religion tranſports him into regions new and boundleſs, where the moſt enchanting proſpects open to view; and the ſurrounding objects are ſuited to alleviate the burdens of life, to ſcatter its gloom, and inſpire the heart with joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable.</p>
                     <p>THE early habits of piety had produced the happieſt effects upon the temper and diſpoſition of Mr. Bloomſgrove, and his amiable conſort, and qualified them in the beſt manner for the part they had to act in domeſtic life. Theſe habits reſtrain
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022570_0068_0FB99B91352B2138"/>
thoſe paſſions which are the principal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſcord, and meliorate the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, while they elevate the mind above low attachment and ſordid gratifications. Piety unites in one point of view, the ſmiling aſpect, both of the powers above and the objects below. It reflects a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine from heaven upon the proſperity of the world. Where the heads of families are thus holden together by the ties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the gentle influence of it will be felt through every branch of the family. The voice of peace, the ſimple ſong of cheerfulneſs and content, will be heard in that dwelling.</p>
                     <p>OF ſo much conſequence it is, that we lay the foundation of domeſtic proſperity and happineſs, deep and firm. I have therefore dwelt the longer upon this, which was a diſtinguiſhing part of the character of thoſe whoſe domeſtic me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs I am giving.</p>

                     <p>THE following ſtory of an amiable youth, who, on embarking upon the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of life, committed himſelf to the care, guidance, and protection of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I think worthy a place in theſe memoirs.</p>
                     <p>THE fact (for it is not a fiction) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded on the faithful pages of ancient authentic hiſtory. He was encouraged by a dream, which ſeemed to portend great future proſperity to himſelf, and the family he was about to form. It had ſuch an effect on his mind, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſolved never to forſake that being who had appeared, at ſo early a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, to favor his domeſticating views;— for you will obſerve, he was going in queſt of a wiſe;—but, that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him in all his ways.

                     <p>I AM no viſionary; nor do I believe in that myſtical divinity which finds a ſpiritual meaning for every remarkable incident. Yet I ſee no difficulty in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, that an all pervading ſpirit can
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022570_0071_0FB99B9C73D9C9D8"/>
communicate his mind to men, by means, of which we can have no conception. I cannot conceive any difficulty in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our ſpirits having acceſs to our mind in ſuch a manner, as, by a viſion or dream, to ſtamp upon it things neceſſary for our information or encouragement; and that too by ſuch images, as cannot fail to expreſs their meaning. Of this kind is the juſtly celebrated dream to which I alluded, and which makes a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed figure in the moſt ancient writings.</p>
                     <p>I RELATE it with the more pleaſure in this place, becauſe thoſe writings were the delightful ſtudy of Mr. Bloomſgrove; and he ſeems to have copied his maxims from the ſentiments which the dream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.</p>
                     <p>IN the ages of ſimplicity, when rural occupations, and domeſtic cares and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, divided the time and attention of mankind; a pious youth, as ancient ſtory tells, undertook, in obedience to a parent's command, a long journey to ſeek a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022570_0072_0FB99B9DF66BDE98"/>
worthy his eſpouſal. The cuſtom of his father's houſe required, that all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage alliances ſhould be formed with ſome collateral branch of his family. The venerable father, fearing leſt ſo promiſing a youth ſhould be tempted to form a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable alliance with the tawny daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the land, where they then dwelt; haſtens his ſon away to ſeek a wife among the daughters of his kindred. The piety of the rather interpoſes its influence, to prevent him from a marriage, where it might have a dangerous tendency on his morals.</p>
                     <p>THE journey is long and tedious, through a dreary wilderneſs, where are no accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations to refreſh the weary traveller, except thoſe which provident nature fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes. But a young man, purſuing the dictates of duty, is always the object of divine patronage; he is never alone. The ever preſent ſpirit of wiſdom and love is with him, in the hurry of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; in the ſilence and ſlumbers of the night; in the noiſe of the town, or the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:022570_0073_0FB99B9F7082B768"/>
ſolitude of the deſert. This ever preſent and indulgent ſpirit accompanied our young adventurer, in his long and lonely journey. It fell out on a day as he trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled, that he reached a little village, where he determined to lodge, it being about ſunſet. Whether there was no public inn for the accommodation of travellers, or whether from prudential motives, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſimplicity of the age, he choſe it, does not appear: but, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, it ſeems he lodged in the field; where he took a ſtone for his pillow and laid himſelf down to ſleep. But his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination is awake. While ſoft ſlumbers ſooth all his cares, and hovering angels guard his bed, his active mind is impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the figure of a ladder, of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing length, that while one end reſted on the earth, the other reached the very heavens and loſt itſelf among the clouds.</p>
                     <p>ON this viſionary ladder, thoſe benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agents who are ſuppoſed to be always attendant on good men, ſeemed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aſcending and deſcending: this
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:022570_0074_0FB99BA79A9442A0"/>
indicated that a conſtant intercourſe was preſerved between heaven and earth; and ſhewed him the favorable influence of piety, in procuring the bleſſing of heaven upon him, in his individual and domeſtic ſtate; for he particularly obſerved that the Lord ſtood above it. From this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſtation, the great Parent of all is rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented as addreſſing the amiable youth, in language of paternal affection, aſſuring him of his favor and protection; that his preſent enterpriſe ſhould be ſucceſsful; and proſperity crown his future days.</p>
                     <p>SO clear was the viſion, ſo audible the voice, that he awoke from ſleep in a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſhment. And, pouring out the grateful and pious effuſions of his ſoul, he made a ſolemn vow of fidelity to him, who had appeared to patronize him in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; that he would ſet up his BETHEL, daily pour incenſe on his domeſtic altar; and never ceaſe to call on the name of the Lord:—nor were theſe tranſactions the illuſions of fancy. In the future part of life, the whole was realized, and he lived
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:022570_0075_0FB99BA8799A5298"/>
to beſtow his benedictions on his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren's children. So much does the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of life depend on the manner in which we firſt ſet out; the connexions we form, and the habits we contract. If we aſſociate ourſelves with the virtuous, and eſpecially in the great article of marriage; if we acquire habits of ſobriety and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we may hope that gentle gales of proſperity will waft us over life's vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurface, and ſafely land us on its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt verge: or ſhould not our days be crowned with outward proſperity, we have ſtill the means of domeſtic tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a reſource within ourſelves which never fails.</p>

                     <p>FROM the ſhort account already given of Mrs. Bloomſgrove, you will eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily believe, that in every part of life, ſhe was able to diſcharge the duties of it with propriety. It would detract from the ſuperior beauties of her mind, to ſay any
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022570_0076_0FB99BAEEBAA0E08"/>
thing of the elegance of her perſon. She is now a wife, with all the charms of the conjugal relation; a mother, with all the tenderneſs of maternal affection. The dignity of her deportment inſpired all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her with reſpect: the mildneſs of her temper ſecured her the moſt cordial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all her acquaintance. In Mrs. Bloomſgrove, modeſty happily united with underſtanding; dignity, with humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and cheerfulneſs, with religion.</p>
                     <p>SHE was well qualified to carry into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the deſign ſhe early formed, of giving ſuſtenance, as well as inſtruction, to her tender offspring. This was a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution propitious to the education of her children; for the foundation of it is laid at the breaſt: there, the future temper and diſpoſition commences: and this, by reaction, has its influence in producing health, beauty, and cheerfulneſs; and greatly facilitates the cultivation of moral qualities.</p>
                     <p>OF all the animals, of which we have any knowledge, man enters into life in the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:022570_0077_0FB99BB21494B128"/>
moſt helpleſs condition; and is, for a longer term than any, dependent on the care of others. But the God of nature, who always provides means for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the moſt helpleſs creatures, has, by an admirable contrivance, implanted, in the breaſt of parents, an inſtinctive prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which prompts them to the care and preſervation of their feeble offspring. This principle is connatural to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. It is not the effect of reaſoning; nor can it eaſily be eradicated from the human heart.</p>
                     <p>SOFT and gentle, it operates, in the mother, in a manner perfectly ſuited to that kind of duty which the firſt ſtage of life requires. In the father, it prevails in a way ſuited to the ſucceeding ſtages of childhood and youth. It puſhes him to great exertions in providing for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his children, and in training them up for uſefulneſs in life. By this inſtinct, providence has founded in nature, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient balance againſt the fatigues and anxieties of nurturing their young.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022570_0078_0FB99BBA6F9B12A0"/>
The ſoft and tender paſſions of the moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; the ſtrong and robuſt affections of the father, wonderfully prepare them for the important taſk which nature has devolved upon them.</p>
                     <p>THAT education commences with our being, and that the nurſe is our firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptreſs, were maxims upon which Mrs. Bloomſgrove uniformly practiſed: and they are as indubitably true, as they are important. What prudent mother then will truſt the commencement of the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her child in the hands of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary nurſe; and ſuffer one, who knows little more than how to yield nouriſhment to an infant, to be the firſt preceptreſs of her ſon? If we trace education up to its ſource, we ſhall find that the quality of food fixes the ſtate of the conſtitution; that the temper is affected by the ſame cauſe, and by the ſituation in which the infant is firſt placed; that the objects with which the eyes of an infant are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, have their influence alſo on the body and mind. Theſe will have a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:022570_0079_0FB99BC1093F4B58"/>
effect on the muſcles of the face; and therefore, go into the determination of its beauty; on the cheerfulneſs of the mind, and goodneſs of the diſpoſition; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, have their ſhare in fixing the after propenſities to virtue and vice.</p>
                     <p>THE ſame reaſon which Lord Kaimes aſſigns, that a female ſhould baniſh all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal thoughts, and preſerve herſelf as calm and cheerful as poſſible, during her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive ſtate, holds equally good in the nurſing period, viz. Agreeable impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions may be made on an infant mind: and, if agreeable, by conſequence, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ones may be made alſo. It is then by no means a matter of indifference, what kind of objects, or countenances, are preſented to children; or what manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they receive; for the impreſſions, the habit will be laſting.</p>
                     <p>I WAS a firm believer in the doctrine of ſympathies, and antipathies, till Doctor Moore wrote ſo learnedly againſt it: nor am I an infidel yet. He has convinced me that ingenious reaſonings may be employed
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022570_0080_0FB99BC2B8F3B258"/>
againſt it, but not of its falſity. Facts are ſtubborn things. I knew a child, maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exactly in imitation of a ſervant, who was frequently before the eyes of its mother, during the time of her advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; even his bones were diſtorted and out of place. This, and numberleſs other inſtances of a like nature, I think, prove the truth of the doctrine, be the cauſe of theſe phenomena what they may. The little Oſander and Rozella, enjoyed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever advantages aroſe from an agreeable aſſemblage of objects; and came forward into life, with the bleſſings of health, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and good temper: circumſtances, which contributed not a little to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment and uſefulneſs in the world.</p>
                     <p>IN America there are comparatively few mothers ſo unnatural, as, of choice, to put their children out to nurſe. Some, indeed, there are, who do this from a love of eaſe, or a fancied ſuperiority to the drudgery of giving ſuſtenance to their helpleſs offspring, to whom they have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en exiſtence. It ſhould be conſidered,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022570_0081_0FB99BC432CC8058"/>
that the obligations between parent and child, are reciprocal; and if neglected by the former, it can hardly be expected that they will be fulfilled by the latter. It was well obſerved by Rouſſeau, that the child ſhould love its mother before it is ſenſible of it as a duty. If the voice of nature is not ſtrengthened by habit and cultivation, it will be ſilenced in its infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the heart will periſh, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, before it is born.</p>

                     <p>THE ſentiments, contained in my laſt, were familiar to Mrs. Bloomſgrove. She had too much goodneſs of heart, to omit any circumſtance of duty. Impell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by motives of duty and maternal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe ſacrificed every perſonal conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration to the care of her helpleſs charge. Retired from the gay world, and all the pleaſures it offers, ſhe ſtudied her own health with more attention than common, that ſhe might communicate to it the beſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:022570_0082_0FB99BC94DB402C8"/>
means of ſupport and health. In the midſt of her family and friends, ſhe is ſeen with her playful infant, ſmiling in her arms. Beautiful and intereſting was the ſight, to behold her thus fulfilling the firſt duties of nature. For what ſhe now does for her child, who does not ſo much as know her, proves what ſhe will be capable of doing one day for him, when ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the happineſs of being beloved by him, and when ſhe has aſſured to herſelf more right to his tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt ſeven years of life are a period, of much greater importance, in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of education, than is generally imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined. Within this period are laid, the foundation of health; the temperament of the body, on which depend the paſſions and affections of the heart. On this foundation is to riſe the fabric of virtue and excellence. So great a part of the management of children, through this ſtage of it, falls to the lot of mothers, that, during its continuance, I ſhall have but little occaſion to ſpeak of Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove.

Happy in the entire confidence of her huſband, and enjoying all his aid and influence, ſhe took charge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant days of the children; and being a lady of great judgment, ſhe adopted a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of her own, and purſued it with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering ſteadineſs.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER was born the twenty fourth day of September following their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and Rozella, about two years after him. The difference in their ages was ſo little, that the ſame manner of treatment, allowing for difference of ſex, ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered for both.</p>
                     <p>IN my next I will give you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her method with them.</p>
                     <p>N. B. THE want of method in training up children, may be aſſigned as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſon of the well meant endeavors of ſo many proving abortive. Parents are often governed more by their feelings than their judgment. The exerciſe of ſuch capricious government ſoon falls into contempt: inſtruction is thrown away, becauſe counteracted by example; and

all the good ends of domeſtic education, loſt, thro indiſcretion. After all our beſt ſyſtems, we are imperfect creatures: this, however, proves the neceſſity of them; that in our worſt humor, we may have the aſſiſtance of that model which was the effect of cooler judgment.</p>

                     <p>TRUE, ſir—"Life and organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never can reſult from a blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of atoms; nor will the chymiſt, with all his art in compounds, ever find ſenſation and thought at the bottom of his crucible." But, by a ſeaſonable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to thoſe curiouſly organized bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, which the Creator hath given us, we find, both thought and ſenſation, may be rendered more quick and active, than they otherwiſe would be. We are mechanical beings; and, after all our boaſt of reaſon, we are influenced, thro life, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical powers. In the firſt ſtages of life, we are governed by no other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

Reaſon has little or no ſhare in the direction of our actions, till we have paſſed ſeveral years under the government of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</p>
                     <p>THIS was the term, in which Mrs. Bloomſgrove attended to the formation of her children's conſtitution, and to give a right direction to all the inſtinctive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and principles of nature. Mrs. G—, you know, was forever humoring and fondling her children; by which means their conſtitutions are ruined. Pale and wan, they appear but half animated; and are doomed to drag out a life of weakneſs and diſeaſe, without genius, vivacity, or powers of ſelf enjoyment. But Mrs. Bloomſgrove, ſenſible that "a ſound mind, in a ſound body," was a bleſſing in the firſt rank of life; and that theſe are connected together, firſt turned her attention to their health. Cleanlineſs, air, and exerciſe, ſhe conſidered as the ſtamina of health, and therefore let them play in the open air. She was leſs fearful of cold than heat, and had them temperately clad both
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:022570_0086_0FB99BD8780BBF70"/>
ſummer and winter: by varying their dreſs but little, with the ſeaſons, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a regular temperament of the body. This idea ſhe probably received from Mr. Locke, who tells of perſons in England, who wear the ſame clothes ſummer and winter, without any inconvenience, or more ſenſe of cold than others. I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe in America who prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the ſame; and never put on a looſe coat but in foul weather, who appear to ſuffer leſs from the cold, than thoſe who are loaded with garments.</p>
                     <p>THIS depends on uſe: our faces are naturally as ſuſceptible of cold, or heat, as any part of the body; it is only by habit, that they harden, and become capable of enduring either.</p>
                     <p>THE Scythian philoſopher gave a proper account of this matter, in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Athenian, who inquired how he could go naked in froſt and ſnow? How, ſaid the Scythian, can you endure your face expoſed to the ſharp air? "My face is uſed to it," ſaid the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:022570_0087_0FB99BD9F0D63280"/>
"Think me all face," replied the Scythian.</p>
                     <p>MR. Locke recommends that children ſhould lie without a cap at night, as ſoon they are able to run about without one by day; and aſſigns this reaſon for it. "Nothing more expoſes to headachs, colds, catarrhs, coughs, and ſeveral other diſeaſes, than keeping the head warm." For the ſame reaſon, I ſhould ſuppoſe the child ought never to have a cap on its head. By expoſing it to the air, it gathers ſtrength; the ſolids become more tenſe, and act more vigorouſly, in propelling the circulating fluids. All the parts being more active, they repel many dangers to which they would otherwiſe be expoſed; the buſineſs of thinking, reflecting, and reaſoning, will be carried on with greater activity and vigor.</p>
                     <p>CERTAIN it is, that health prevails more in cottages than in palaces; and, no doubt, the organs of the body are in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order for mental operations. To what cauſe can we aſcribe this, but to its being
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022570_0088_0FB99BE5A87D3430"/>
fed and clothed in a more plain and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner; and more expoſed to air and exerciſe? Oſander and Rozella, have a bloom of health, and a ſprightlineſs of mind, which diſtinguiſh them from moſt other children, of their age and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove, obſerving that the children of a poor neighbor were ſeldom troubled with colds and coughs, which often attended thoſe of a wealthy family in the ſame neighborhood; reaſoned thus with herſelf: "thoſe poor children acquire a hardineſs from the neceſſity of having their feet frequently wet, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways badly ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>od; while the others never fail to take cold when, by accident, they wet theirs. To ſuch accidents all child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, male and female, are ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. And, beſides, when the feet are not inured to a little hardineſs, they ſuffer much from the tenderneſs, they acquire, by too much warmth."</p>
                     <p>THUS reaſoned this excellent mother; and as ſhe determined not to be governed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:022570_0089_0FB99BE712025DE8"/>
by falſe tenderneſs, or the indiſcreet prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of others, in the education of her children; ſhe was induced, from her own obſervation on its advantages to other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to inure her's to feel alternately wet and dry, both ſummer and winter. Even the little Rozella, is ſuffered to wet her feet, while at play on the green in the back yard; where runs a murmuring rill, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from a diſtant fountain. The roſe and the lily bloom on their cheeks, while they ſlide on the ice, which this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle current affords in the winter; till their feet become wet with the ſnow which melts upon them. The tender mother is pained at the ſight. She has almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the period of ſuch amuſements, and ſhivers with the cold which ſhe thinks they endure. A ſtruggle between mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tenderneſs, and more ſolid judgment, enſues. She is about to call them in; but they play on the ſnow and ice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appearing to have the ſenſation of cold. "Their own feelings, ſaid Mrs. Bloomſgrove, are the beſt ſtandard for
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:022570_0090_0FB99BE831BCA698"/>
them; why ſhould I call them in on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the cold, ſince they ſeem not to perceive it?" Her judgment prevails: they divert themſelves until fatigued, or it is time to call them in to dinner:— They are not ſuffered to go to the fire, but are kept in motion, until the balance is well reſtored, and they are in a proper temperament to be at reſt.</p>

                     <p>ON a day, when the declining ſun had tinged the mountain tops with its milder rays, and reddening ſkies invited the tuneful choir to ſerenade the groves, with the faint lays of their evening ſong; theſe happy parents were invited, by the ſerenity that followed the ſhower, to the gravel walk. At the inſtant of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, a little affair happened in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant back yard, which, were it not for its conſequences, would not be worth relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but on account of thoſe, deſerves
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:022570_0091_0FB99BF083967500"/>
our notice. To this place the little brother and ſiſter had been allured, by the ſame cauſes which induced their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to walk; the ſhower had ſwollen the rivulet beyond its uſual ſize; they wiſh to ſee it overflow its banks. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they ſet about ſtopping its courſe with ſuch materials as they can collect. They ply with vigor, and ſeem juſt ready to accompliſh their deſign, when, lo! an unforeſeen accident damps the riſing joy; ſo precarious are all our proſpects, all our enjoyments!</p>
                     <p>THE little Rozella, now about three or four years old, is deep laden with materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and, in attempting to depoſit them to the beſt advantage—O! dire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late—ſhe plunges headlong into the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing current. The parents, who had juſt returned, and were viewing the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene, ran to her relief, not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, indeed, from the depth of water. On this occaſion Mrs. Bloomſgrove ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great degree of ſelf command; a nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary attainment for thoſe who have the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:022570_0092_0FB99BF3D1B72418"/>
care of children! ſhe caught her little daughter in her arms, and pleaſantly ſaid, "The ducks paddle in the water, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rozella is a little duck." Rozella took hold of her frock, and held it out, crying—Her mamma looked at it, and, ſmiling, ſaid, "What, my dear, did you like to have wet your new frock? come, let us go and dry it." The ſurpriſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: the child ceaſes crying, and ſoon begins to ſmile. A frown, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would have broken her little heart, without the leaſt poſſible advantage. Mrs. Bloomſgrove availed herſelf of the opportunity to waſh them both, in the ſame water in which they had been at play; and found it ſalutary, in abating an eruptive complaint which attended them. By repeating the ſame, ſhe ſoon found the complaint entirely removed. Convinced of the utility of the practice, ſhe continued it, at ſhort intervals; but frequently waſhed their heads and feet in cold water, through all the ſeaſons. She was often heard to ſay, after her children
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:022570_0093_0FB99BF6F585F338"/>
were grown up, ſhe believed ſcarce any thing had contributed ſo much to remove little complaints; to prevent great ones; and to conſolidate their conſtitution, as this practice.</p>
                     <p>THE open air, where it can be enjoyed, undoubtedly, is far preferable to any houſe for children to divert themſelves in; for, by degrees, they habituate themſelves to thoſe viciſſitudes of weather, to which they will be expoſed all their days. Their bodies will be of little uſe to them, in this variable climate, if they cannot endure thoſe changes; nor can they enjoy life, unleſs prepared for them by early habits. The only objection Mrs. Bloomſgrove has to open air, is the danger of tarniſhing her daughter's fair complexion. Againſt this ſhe guards as effectually as ſhe can; and the green plot ſerves, in a great meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, as a preventive: and ſhe conſidered that health, and ſprightlineſs, which are no leſs ornamental to the ſex, than a fair complexion, and which are promoted by thoſe means, as a full compenſation for the riſk ſhe ran.</p>

THE pamphlet on female educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came ſafe to hand; it contains many excellent obſervations on that ſubject: and though ſome parts of it may be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the gay, and inconſiderate; yet I will venture to ſay, the maxims it offers are more ſuited to the ſtate of ſociety, and government in this country, than the practice of thoſe who explode them.</p>

                     <p>PLAINNESS and ſimplicity, in food and drink, were the maxims which governed Mrs. Bloomſgrove in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of her children. Milk, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inaceous food, are moſt ſuitable for them. Cuſtom has a great effect; and the palate may be formed to almoſt any thing; but, it by no means follows, that the ſtomach can ſafely receive every thing to which the palate may be reconciled. It was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the great Mr. Locke, that moſt of the diſeaſes in England were to be imputed
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:022570_0095_0FB99BF970E205D8"/>
to eating too much meat, and too little bread. He therefore adviſes to avoid giving children any meat till they are two, or three years old. He ſuppoſes "they would breed their teeth with much leſs danger, be freer from diſeaſe, while they are little, and lay the foundation of an healthy and ſtrong conſtitution much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if they were not crammed ſo much as they are, by fond mothers and fooliſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and were kept wholly from fleſh the firſt three or four years of their lives!"</p>
                     <p>AS the palate may be formed to any thing, ſo it was prudent in Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove, who received the entire approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her huſband therein, to confine her children to a ſimple, unoffending diet. Butter, oily ſubſtances, groſs meats, or any heavy bodies, ſuch as high ſeaſonings conſiſt of, oppreſs the ſtomach, heat and vitiate the blood, and bring on unnatural drought, langor, and drowſineſs; and therefore, are improper for children. This unnatural drought will only be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by drinking; for it is certain that
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:022570_0096_0FB99C00971EBF38"/>
frequent drinking creates drought. This has led writers, on education, to caution parents againſt ſuffering children to have recourſe, too frequently, to any kind of liquor. Drink is often given children to ſilence their crying; and whenever they ſee others drink, it excites an inclination to the ſame in themſelves; and, if grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, will induce a dangerous habit. The abovementioned writer ſays, that he once lived in a houſe where, to appeaſe a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard child, drink was given to it, as often as it cried; ſo that it was conſtantly drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and though the child could not ſpeak, it drank more in twenty four hours than he did. A perſon may be guilty of intemperance in the uſe of cold water as well as of ardent ſpirits.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022570_0097_0FB99C01F30E28F0"/>
ſhould not be diſtant, or formal, with children, whoſe conſtitutions digeſt rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Food ſhould be given, merely to ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfy hunger."</p>
                     <p>IN imitation of Auguſtus, who, when he was the greateſt monarch on earth, tells us he took a bit of dry bread in his chariot, Oſander ate little elſe than bread, milk, roots and vegetables, until near five years old. He was not confined to ſet meals, but ate when he was hungry, and drank when he was dry; unleſs thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites appeared to be the effect of caprice, or were excited by ſeeing others eat; for children are imitative beings. In that caſe, he is tried with a piece of dry bread or fair water; if the appetite be not ſtrong enough for theſe, it is a falſe one. By this ſimple, temperate manner of living, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all the ſtrength, ſprightlineſs, and agility, of the young Romans, who were fed in the ſame way, and were remarkable for ſtrength and activity.</p>
                     <p>NATURE is the beſt directreſs in thoſe caſes; and it is ſafeſt following her dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:022570_0098_0FB99C051DF8D230"/>
The habit of eating at a particular hour, when we riſe into a family ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes convenient: buſineſs, company, and the order of ſociety, render it unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but it cannot be neceſſary that child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſhould be compelled to eat then, or to ſuſpend eating at other times. When the habit is contracted, the child will feel the cravings of appetite at the ſtated periods; and will indulge merely from habit, or to gratify an imaginary want. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences will be, a depreſſion of ſpirits, ill humor, and fretfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>ALTHO Oſander is permitted to ſit at table at the age of five, yet he is not often helped to any meat, and ſeldom wiſhes for any; much leſs does he ever aſk for this or that, as fancy may dictate; as is the manner of ſome children, who are made perfect epicures at ten years old. And as to Rozella, tho, like the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan miſſes, ſhe is bred up to ſome degree of hardineſs, yet ſhe can ſcarce be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to taſte meat till ſhe is ſix or ſeven years old; but ſhe is as plump as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, and freſh as a roſe.</p>

In a ſituation like theirs, it would be impoſſible to lay a reſtraint with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out creating a temptation to violate orders, and giving encouragement to rapacity. The ſame obſervation holds good of all market towns, where children's coppers will procure fruit without the parents' knowledge.</p>
                     <p>TO prohibit their uſe of it, or even to attempt to reſtrain it, would only make them ravenous after that for which they would never hanker, if laid open to them at will. And, beſides, the rotation of ſummer fruit is admirably ſuited, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the blood and juices, and afford a balance againſt the exceſſive heat of that ſeaſon. The vegetable acid ſerves as a powerful antiſcorbutic, while the rich pulp nouriſhes animal nature; and if children at any time overdo a little, they will find by experience the neceſſity of more caution for the future.</p>

Large and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, it contains every kind of delicious fruit, together with roots and vegetables for the uſe of the family; I may add, of many a poor family alſo in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing village, who ſhare the bounty of its owner. This is a lively emblem of Mr. Bloomſgrove! who always blends the uſeful and agreeable in a happy manner. In the midſt of this garden, is a ſpacious walk: trees and flowers, on either ſide, afford an aſſemblage of agreeable objects as we paſs. At the yonder end, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor which has an air of elegant ſimplicity, and affords a cool retreat from the heat of the ſun. The woodbine, interſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong its ſaſhes, makes a beautiful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and dazzles the eye with an infinity of reflections, which glitter among the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:022570_0101_0FB99730EF662F90"/>
leaves. The ſeats are ſo entwined with ſavin, as to have the appearance of a green ſofa. On either ſide is a fiſh pond, with a bathing font at the end, conſtantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with freſh water from beneath a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant rock. As the principal walk runs in a vermicular direction, and all the others in a ſimilar manner, they do not interſect each other at right angles; but in every direction are cut into ſegments of circles. This is imitating nature: for ſhe no where, in any of her works, exhibits a right angle; and it affords a romantic ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. By this contrivance the foliage has much more benefit from the air, than if they were in direct lines. As you enter the gate, your eye follows the ſlow wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſe, and ſurveys, partly thro the trees, the bowery at the other end, which has a fine effect upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <p>THE period, of which we now ſpeak, is not a ſeaſon for the acquiſition of much underſtanding. But I will venture to ſay, in the firſt ſeven years of our life, we gain more knowledge, than in the ſame term, during any other part of life. Children are ſo inquiſitive concerning the names, properties and relations of things, that there are but few objects, with which we generally become acquainted, but fall within the limits of a child's knowledge. We afterwards view them in a different manner, becauſe we have more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their properties; we become more able to inveſtigate the cauſes, and trace the effects of natural objects; for children acquire their knowledge, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception only; but men gain underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by reaſoning, compariſon, and deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After all our mighty boaſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, it is but a poor pittance compared with the knowledge we get by perception: and mankind, in general, are

                     <p>THAT children ſhould be taught to ſubmit to neceſſity, that is, to bear any unavoidable pain, with patience, is not only right, but the moſt uſeful leſſon in life. It will be to little purpoſe, however, to tell a child, in a fit of the colic, that it is unavoidable; painful neceſſity already convinces him of that. It is the little aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities of life, the croſs events, the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments we meet with, and our inabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to gratify our wiſhes, that irritate the paſſions, and call for the exerciſe of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration and patience. Happy would it be for children, if parents were more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally poſſeſſed of this quality. Precept would then have its influence, and more

This is the moſt difficult, and, at the ſame time, the moſt important part of education: for on the regulation of our paſſions, depend our own comfort and the happineſs of thoſe about us; our progreſs in virtue, and the diſcharge of all thoſe duties we owe to God, our fellow creatures, and ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>TO the honor of Mrs. Bloomſgrove, it muſt be ſaid, that ſhe managed this crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical part of education with wiſdom and prudence. Though ſoft and gentle in her manners, and mild in her government,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022570_0106_0FB9973FB8ACAAC0"/>
yet ſhe has irritable qualities, and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſuſceptible of emotion. This is often put to the teſt among children; but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the pole ſtar which guides her. She well knew the importance of ſhewing her children that ſhe could command her own paſſions, and ſubmit to unavoidable evils; in order to train them to ſo uſeful an exerciſe as that of ſelf command. This is a taſk which requires great exertion. Parents muſt often do violence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and frequently ſtifle their real feelings.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER and Rozella, like other child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, are born with the various paſſions and propenſities of human nature. They ſee ſome of the ſervants fearful, when it thunders, and run to their mamma, in a fright, for ſhelter: ſhe appears cheerful, and pleaſantly ſays, "The ſun will ſhine clearly, and the birds will ſing prettily, after this." Whatever might be her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, on the occaſion, it was very prudent to appear cheerful, and improve the cauſe of their alarm to ſo agreeable an end.

The leaſt appearance of timidity, in her, would have confirmed their fears, and deeply impreſſed their minds; for they think "papa and mamma know every thing." Afterwards, when a thunder guſt is riſing, ſhe calls them to her own room, which is in the ſoutheaſt corner of the houſe, and looking thro a lattice formed of honeyſuckle, commands a moſt beautifully variegated proſpect; and

Mrs. Bloomſgrove, with the aid of her huſband, if he is at home, amuſes the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren with the various beauties that offer themſelves to view, and with ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſtories as ariſe in her mind. The habit of doing this rendered them quite fearleſs of thunder, and the reaſons ſhe uſed to aſſign to them, in order to excite their fortitude, had a happy effect in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming her own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:022570_0108_0FB997481041E938"/>WHATEVER objects affright them, unleſs they are ſuch as ſhould warn them of real danger, ſhe reconciles them to, by rendering them familiar: this is done by degrees, with a great deal of management, and with an air of pleaſantry. No ſtories of ghoſts and hobgoblins have ever yet reached their ears, nor ever will, if the vigilance of their parents can prevent the evil. Mrs. Bloomſgrove once caught a young woman, who had lately come into the houſe, telling ſome wonderful ſtory to the children: ſhe concluded, by their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that it partook of the marvellous; and immediately called her to her own room, as if to do ſomething, where ſhe lectured her upon the folly and danger of alarming the apprehenſions of children with bugbear ſtories; and aſſured her, that if ſhe ever did the like again, ſhe muſt immediately quit the houſe. Great care is requiſite to guard children againſt the follies of ſervants: they are generally fond of marvellous things, and children are pleaſed with the ſame, becauſe they have
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:022570_0109_0FB9974B49B8C8E8"/>
not reaſon to balance thoſe paſſions which are excited by them. Many people ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, thro life, with the fear which the imprudence of nurſes and ſervants early impreſſed on them, by rehearſing ſtories of ghoſts, witches, apparitions, and the like.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER and Rozella have no more fear from thoſe chimerical inhabitants of darkneſs, than we have from thoſe of the planet Herſchel: their ignorance is their protection againſt all ſuch fairy beings. Having no knowledge of them, they go to bed in the dark, with leſs fear than moſt oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do with a candle; they ſay their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; repeat their evening hymns, and fall aſleep, with as little apprehenſion of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as if in their mother's arms.</p>
                     <p>NOTHING could have been more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in point—A friend, who, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has called on me, informs me of the death of an unfortunate youth about eighteen years of age. A more promiſing child perhaps never bleſt a mother's arms, until twelve years old; when a ſervant,

who had made him extremely timid, by relating ſtories of ghoſts and apparitions, came ſuddenly upon him in the duſk of an evening, in an attitude, in which he had repreſented their appearance. Seeing by the help of the dim light, from a pale glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering candle, at a diſtance, as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, one of thoſe infernal agents whoſe image had ſo often been preſented to his mind, the ſhock was too great for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſuſtain—He fainted inſtantly—He fell—Every effort was uſed to recover him.

                     <p>CHILDREN brought up together, in the affectionate manner they were, have few differences; but the moſt perfect educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not wholly prevent theſe. The
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022570_0113_0FB997570E588BE0"/>
idea of property, and ſenſe of perſonal rights, take place very early in the mind. Interferences of intereſt, or of paſſions, will produce contentions; and theſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: but ſo prudent a mother will rarely indulge children, in coming to her with complaints one againſt the other. To allow of this, on every trifling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would be to encourage a complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition. To receive, and decide on, their controverſies, unleſs ſome real injury is done, would have a tendency to excite enmity between them. She makes light of their complaints againſt each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, telling them that ſuch trifles are not worth minding; but privately admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the aggreſſor. If Rozella catches up her brother's top and runs away with it, and complaint is made, or her mamma ſees the playful trick, ſhe is told to reſtore it and never to take any thing that does not belong to her—"How would you like to have Oſander get the pieces of china out of your baby houſe, or the flowers from your knot in the garden? and beſides, a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022570_0114_0FB9975F23BCBA38"/>
top is not a pretty thing for girls to play with." If he, at any time, invades her property, the ſame uſeful leſſon is taught him. By theſe means they are learning to feel the force of that ſocial rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, "DO AS YE WOULD BE DONE UNTO," before they underſtand any thing of its origin or extent.</p>
                     <p>EVERY action, that had the appearance of revenge, was treated with ſuch marks of diſapprobation, as to convince the child both of the impropriety and inconvenience of it. They were taught the moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind of revenge, doing good to the injurious, &amp;c. by little ſtories ſuited to their capacities, and which illuſtrated the ſubject in the beſt manner. A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray happened between the children one day, which, for the many uſeful leſſons it produced, deſerves to be related. But on account of the length of the ſtory, I will reſerve it till my next.</p>

and, leſt it ſhould eſcape me, I will give it you here; for it ſhews that parents ſhould never be off their guard in talking before their children. "A lady ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of her little girls who ſeemed not to hear, that Mrs. —, a neighbor of theirs, was an agreeable woman, when ſhe had not a drop in her eye. Soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this ſame lady was on a viſit to the little girl's mamma: the child look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her with uncommon attention: the lady obſerving it, ſays—"Why do you look ſo earneſtly at me, my dear?" The little innocent replied—"I am looking to ſee if there is any drop in your eye."</p>

                  <div n="23" type="letter">
                     <head>LETTER XXIII.</head>
                     <p>IT happened one day, as Rozella was running in one of the croſs walks in the garden, ſhe ſtumbled over the handle of Oſander's hoe, which he had heedleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left in the way. She fell upon his bed,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022570_0116_0FB99764B1B017C0"/>
and broke down a favorite vine, which he had nouriſhed with more than ordinary care. He came into the garden juſt as ſhe had ariſen, and ſtood looking at the vine ſhe had unfortunately broken. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander ſeeing what ſhe had done, and not knowing by what means, in the firſt ſally of paſſion, ran to her knot and pulled up by the roots the moſt beautiful tulip ſhe had in all her flowery. Grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints from both ſides go up to their mamma; for ſhe is the arbitreſs in all their childiſh diſputes. Both are plaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iffs, both defendants. She hears them patiently, ſpeaks kindly to both; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes them for the preſent, telling them to go waſh their faces, for they had been crying, and to aſk Caſpina, the maid, for a piece of bread.</p>
                     <p>TAKING them ſeparately, ſhe inquired into the affair: as Rozella was the firſt, in the ſeeming tranſgreſſion, ſhe was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned firſt. It appeared, on examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be an accident in which ſhe came very near loſing one of her eyes. She
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:022570_0117_0FB9976627E7A708"/>
ſobs, and was very much troubled, to think ſhe had hurt her brother's vine, and offers to replace it with ſome of her ſweet brier. She is dimiſſed with a caution to be more careful in future, and a charge always to love her little brother. Sweet innocence ſat on her little brow, and with a low courteſy ſaid, "thank you, mamma," and went out.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER was then called: he appears guilty. Such is the different effect of actions voluntary, and thoſe which are unavoidable. Waſhing in cold water had ſtilled the tumult of his paſſions; eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his ſiſter had opened all the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the heart: he felt the force of conviction, and owned the fault. He ſaid he would never hurt his ſiſter's things any more; that he intended only to pull off the tulip, and the whole came up by the roots: but he would replace it with his double pink holyoke, and that when her couſin Fanny came, they ſhould both pick as many of his ſtrawberries as they pleaſed; and that the next time
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:022570_0118_0FB99769E24383D0"/>
his ſiſter fell down, he would run and help her up, inſtead of hurting her flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bed.</p>
                     <p>SELF CONVICTION is the beſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for amendment. The action was revengeful, and deſerved pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; and the prudent mother put him into a way to inflict it on himſelf. She gravely ſaid, "My dear, I am glad you ſee your error. I only wiſh you had ſeen it before you committed it; becauſe revenge is the worſt thing in the world: for the future, you muſt think what you are going to do, before you do it; and never do wrong to others if they have done ſo to you. But your ſiſter did not deſign you an injury; and beſides, ſhe had like to have loſt one of her eyes in the fall." The mention of this quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him. He burſt into a flood of tears, ſaying, "what would my poor little ſiſter have done, if ſhe had loſt one of her eyes?" Every circumſtance helped to prepare the way for uſeful leſſons, and generous actions. Rozella, being called
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:022570_0119_0FB9976C34FCB668"/>
in, her brother catches her round the neck, and, kiſſing her, calls her his dear little ſiſter; is ſorry he ſpoiled her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful tulip; laments the danger, ſhe had been in, of loſing one of her eyes; offers her any thing, every thing in his garden; and, above all, promiſes to be kind to her always. The little generous creature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined all his offers except the laſt; and ſays, "that is worth more than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tulips, and ſhe does not deſire any thing elſe."</p>
                     <p>EVERY thing being now calm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, and the children more affectionate than ever; the happy mother ſees new beauties in them, and is delighted with their prattle and playful tricks.

<pb n="122" facs="unknown:022570_0121_0FB99771F8078D38"/>
the act of eating together had in produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harmony of affection. He dwelt largely on the vaſt advantage of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care and wiſe management of a mother to young children; and beſtowed many encomiums upon her, and declared himſelf extremely happy in having a wife ſo competent to the buſineſs of educating the objects of their mutual affections. Ye affectionate huſbands, who are bleſt with wives who nurſe the infancy, and guard the childhood of your offspring, conſider their painful taſk, the variety and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty attending it; and never ceaſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate their condition by tenderneſs, and reward their goodneſs by applauſe! Mrs. Bloomſgrove has a mind ſuperior to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and could enjoy no pleaſure from applauſe, unleſs conſcious of having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to diſcharge her duty. The cool approbation of Mr. Bloomſgrove, however, could not fail of affording her ſenſible pleaſure: this ſhe expreſſed by a modeſt reply, becoming the delicacy of her ſex, and the affection of a wife to the beſt of huſbands.</p>

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander was now about eight, and began to exhibit ſome marks of brilliant genius. Rozella had juſt entered her ſeventh year, with a form and diſpoſition flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the views of an affectionate mother. They were now ſo far advanced, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the joint aid of a father to raiſe the ſuperſtructure, the foundation of which their mother's care had laid.

                     <p>IMITATION is a very powerful ſpring of action in human nature, eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially in children. In females, it operates more ſtrongly than in our ſex: they are quick to diſcern the peculiarities of female conduct, and directly catch the manners of their own ſex. This proneneſs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, ſtrengthens in proportion as the manners and amuſements of others come within our reach: ſmall children will, therefore, be more likely to imitate thoſe older than themſelves, than grown peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Altho older children will deſcend to partake in the amuſements of younger, rather than be left alone, yet this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature: ſhe always directs us to imitate thoſe above us. On this account, great advantage may be made of this imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:022570_0124_0FB9977CA77F7B10"/>
propenſity, in the progreſs of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT go on to relate the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, relative to the new comer into the family, before I mention ſome of the dangerous tendencies of this imitative propenſity, and ſome of its uſes. Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren often catch a broken dialect from thoſe older than themſelves, of which it requires great pains to break them. It is obſerved, that thoſe children who are brought up in the Weſt Indies, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Negroes, have a kind of mongrel, Anglo-Africano dialect. The ſame ill effect is produced, by ſpeaking to them in a broken inarticulate language, or, what is called babytalk. This ought never to be permitted; but the moſt plain, full, and diſtinct ſounds ſhould be employed in ſpeaking to children. Another bad effect which may ariſe from this propenſity, is, that boys and girls, being conſtantly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a family, will ſlide into an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of each others manners; tho na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dictates different manners and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:022570_0125_0FB9977E122AE4E8"/>
to them. "A boy educated with girls of his own age, will imitate their manners and become effeminate; but it is more common to ſee a girl imitate the manners of the boys with whom ſhe is ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucated." The conſequences are more injurious in the latter caſe than in the former; for the manners will react upon the mind, and have their influence in moulding that: but the effect of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſtamp, from this quarter, will be much more eaſily effaced from boys than girls; they are more abroad, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with a greater variety of objects, which have a tendency to efface any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>IT was on account of this imitative proneneſs, and the advantages to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from it, that Mrs. Bloomſgrove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a with to procure a female compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion for her little daughter, whoſe educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been ſuch as would afford a good model for imitation; and of ſuch an age, as not to have loſt all reliſh for amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuited to that of Rozella. This
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022570_0126_0FB997806BDCFD18"/>
would be ſecuring to her all the pleaſures of company and amuſement at home, and afford a conſtant ſtimulus to improvement, without the diſadvantage of bad examples among other children. Nothing has a better tendency to elevate the mind, than to place thoſe images before it, which, tho above our reach at preſent, yet appear not too far diſtant to encourage our hope of ſoon attaining the ſame excellence. This wiſh ſhe communicated to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was ſoon going to —, where lived a diſtant relation of Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove, who had four daughters and two ſons. She was the widow of a merchant of great integrity, who lived in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, where the widening river min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles its waters with thoſe of the Atlantic ocean. His children had, therefore, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed every advantage for the refinements of education; nor had they been neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is too often the caſe, in the more ſubſtantial qualities. His circumſtances had been much reduced by loſſes at ſea: and about this time the misfortunes of the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:022570_0127_0FB9978ACA03F700"/>
family were completed. The dwelling houſe in which he lived, took fire, and communicated the flame to an adjoining ſtore: it being dry, and a high wind at ſoutheaſt, the fire raged to ſuch a degree, as to baffle every effort to check its prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs. In the ſpace of an hour, he ſaw his buildings, with moſt of his effects, conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſhes. A circumſtance much more diſtreſsful to his family was, he overheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by violent exertions to reſcue his property from the devouring flames, which threw him into a fever, of which he died in about ten days, amidſt the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible grief and lamentations of a moſt affectionate wife, and ſix children; the youngeſt of whom, FANNY, was about thirteen. Circumſtanced as they now were, the propoſals from Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove were very agreeable. Fanny, was to be prepared for her departure as ſoon as poſſible, and to be conveyed under the protection of her youngeſt brother, a youth of about twenty, who was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his kindneſs and attention to his ſiſters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="unknown:022570_0128_0FB9978C37CD1860"/>FANNY unites that delicacy, ſenſibility, and generoſity of mind, to a fair form and graceful manners, which never fail to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the notice and ſecure the eſteem of all her acquaintance. Being the youngeſt of four ſenſible and amiable ſiſters, ſhe had derived great advantage from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they had acquired, and from the dignity of their manners. This luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, ſhe is now invited to reflect down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the little Rozella, as a kind of precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive companion. She was expected about this time, which had excited the ſolicitude of Oſander and Rozella, to have their little gardens in the beſt order, at her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; and this, probably, was the cauſe or their great agitation, occaſioned by the adventure in the garden. This palliates Oſander's criminality a little, for he had not diſcovered any marks of a revengeful temper before, having never been taught it, in childhood, by having the floor beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, becauſe "IT HURT BABY." Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be more ill judged, than this method of teaching children to retaliate
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022570_0129_0FB9978DB31D3C50"/>
injuries, before they underſtand the meaning of the word.</p>
                     <p>IT was not long after they had retired to reſt, when Fanny arrived, with her brother. The ſervant, who went to the door, at the loud rap, I mentioned before, ran, in an ecſtacy of joy, to tell his miſtreſs of Miſs Fanny's arrival; and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately have gone, and awoke Rozella, that ſhe might partake of the joy, but ſhe prevented him. There can ſcarcely be a ſurer evidence of a good maſter and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, than the pleaſure which a ſervant expreſſes at thoſe domeſtic occurrences, in which he can have no other intereſt, than the pleaſure which they receive.</p>
                     <p>FANNY met a moſt cordial reception from her new patrons. They deſired her to conſider herſelf perfectly at home, and to look upon them as her papa and mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; as ſuch they aſſured her they would act. The uſual inquiries being made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the health of the family, and having taken ſome refreſhment, ſhe was ſhewn to her apartment, being much fatigued with
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:022570_0130_0FB99798F48C6C50"/>
her journey. In the morning, Caſpina went, much earlier than uſual, to awake Rozella, and communicate the joyful tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her couſin's arrival. She was in raptures with the account; and having never yet ſeen her couſin, could hardly wait till ſhe roſe, without flying into her arms. But, being early accuſtomed to a reſtraint on her paſſions, and ſubmiſſion to government, ſhe was compoſed, without difficulty, to wait her couſin's hour, tho a late one.</p>
                     <p>THEIR firſt meeting was ſuch, as might naturally be expected from children cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as they were; nor was Oſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an unconcerned ſpectator of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſcene; but entered deeply into the ſpirit of it. He felt the more ſenſible pleaſure on the occaſion, as he ſhould ſoon have an opportunity to ſhew her his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and to lead her and his ſiſter to his ſtrawberry bank. Fanny is ſoon made acquainted with the articles of furniture in Rozella's play houſe, and the ſeveral kinds of flowers which adorn her garden.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:022570_0131_0FB9979CC3BD7948"/>
As ſoon as breakfaſt was over, Oſander invited them into the garden; ſhewed his couſin all the curioſities; and led them to the bank where the ſtrawberries hung in cluſters, and in all their perfection. He very prettily invited them both to come there and eat ſtrawberries, whenever it ſhould be agreeable to them. The hour having arrived, he bade them good bye, ſaying, "I muſt go to ſchool."</p>

                     <p>TO avoid confuſion of objects and ideas, I propoſed dividing the ſeaſon of education into three periods, and aſſigning to each, thoſe exerciſes ſuited to develop the native powers of the mind, and draw forth, under proper cultivation, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and affections of the heart. The firſt period, thro which we have ſeen theſe
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:022570_0132_0FB9979D83DB7128"/>
children conducted, is naturally and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the ſeaſon of impreſſions; but not wholly excluſive of ſentiments, opinions, or principles. The faculty of comparing thoſe impreſſions, and the deſires they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, are of early birth: tho not ſtrictly coeval with impreſſions and ſenſibility, yet they cloſely attend their ſteps.</p>
                     <p>IT will, therefore, be impoſſible to avoid recurring to the firſt period for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the culture of many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the practice of which more properly belongs to the ſubſequent periods. If we take a review of what has paſſed in the firſt ſtage, we ſhall ſee the effect, which the impreſſions of it are likely to have upon the future periods of education. From facts, children paſs to general max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims; their impreſſions are aſſorted into claſſes; and from comparing the effects of outward objects on their ſenſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, they acquire principles, or the art of reaſoning. "Children are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in their mother's arms: they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire diſpoſitions, principles, or charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:022570_0133_0FB9979FC4714C70"/>
very difficult to remove, as early as the art of walking. The diſpoſition, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and temper, which have been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed early, under injudicious or bad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, are called, emphatically, by the ſcriptures, "the law of ſin" in the habit, or conſtitution."</p>
                     <p>THE inference has been juſtly drawn from the experience of an ingenious writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that it is a truth, ſuſceptible of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that the preſent method of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould be inverted; and children be led from facts to ſentiments, maxims, or principles; not from principles or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to facts. He affirms that he had greater difficulties, even in the firſt period of education, with the rudiments of bad principles and paſſions, or the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bad habits, than he ſhould have had with the whole education of children, delivered to him with the uſual innocence, or ignorance, of infancy; and he goes on to obſerve—</p>
                     <p>"THE capacity, as well as character of a man, depends greatly on the paſſions of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:022570_0134_0FB997A84ED71A50"/>
infancy; particularly on early aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or early habits. This truth eſcapes common obſervers; becauſe it depends on a number of minute circumſtances, which appear ſeparately inſignificant. When theſe circumſtances are combined in their effects, they become important in morals; but continuing unconnected in the imaginations of parents, opportunities of regulating or correcting them are loſt. They are ſo numerous, that they affect the conſtitution and mind of a child in methods ſo various, that perſons not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the art of inveſtigation or reaſoning, ſuſpend all judgment and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, until minute diſpoſitions have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted themſelves into principles and hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, or have impreſſed an indelible char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter on the mind. This effect takes place, in ſome children early; in others, late. I have known the character com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely fixed in nine or ten years.</p>
                     <p>ERROR and negligence, reſpecting the ingredients of paſſions or habits, in the firſt period of education, are conſtant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loys
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:022570_0135_0FB997AC09CC3978"/>
to the excellence afterwards acquired. Injudicious indulgence, careleſſneſs, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, fixes in our conſtitution ill health and bad temper, which mark the body or countenance with deformity, and render the mind incapable of great acquiſitions, either of ſcience or happineſs. The knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge we poſſeſs, is often like liquor poured into diſtempered veſſels. Hence the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing inequalities of modern characters. Minds and figures caſt in heavenly moulds, actuated by the paſſions of fiends; great acquiſitions in ſcience, diſhonored by mean habits; or the beſt principles of morality, aſſociated with the worſt vices. Theſe contradictions are ſo familiar, that we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom expect in our acquaintance, general uniformity or conſiſtency of character. We ſay, with candid compaſſion, of one, that he has great wiſdom or learning; but is licentious or immoral in his private conduct: of another, that he is conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the principles and forms of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but he is unhappy in his temper, deceitful in his profeſſions, or oppreſſive
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:022570_0136_0FB997AD3B4D88A8"/>
in his tranſactions. Such is the influence of habits; and ſuch the importance of early management of the paſſions.</p>

                     <p>THE children have now arrived at that age, which is generally conſidered as the ſecond ſtage in their education. I have dwelt the longer on that period, which, to many, appears of little uſe in the buſineſs of education, and for that reaſon: it is the moſt favorable ſeaſon for moral culture, and may be improved in ſuch a manner, as greatly to facilitate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in letters, and progreſs in arts. If the foundation be not well laid, the ſuperſtructure will totter and fall to the ground. Children are, at firſt, in a ſtate of entire dependence; they are helpleſs, and paſſive in every thing: but it does not follow, that they ſhould remain ſo forever, or be kept in that condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the natural period, by the habits of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:022570_0137_0FB997AEDA1F0EB8"/>
education. Nature prompts them to pant for independence, and to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſoon as they have power; but education, eſpecially among the wealthy, often checks theſe efforts of nature, and keeps them dependent, and helpleſs all their days. Unaccuſtomed to exert their power, at an early period, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways waited upon, they find themſelves in the condition of the indolent and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nobleman, who, having never been taught to dreſs himſelf, was obliged to lie in bed, flat upon his back, "like a turtle on an alderman's kitchen table, until a ſervant came to dreſs him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
                     <p>INDOLENCE, incapacity for vigorous exertion, and dulneſs of apprehenſion, are the effects of furniſhing children with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing they want, without any thought, or action of their own. Our health, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and uſefulneſs in the world, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the powers of exertion being braced up, by early habits of action. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is as requiſite to produce ſtrength and agility of body, as application to
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:022570_0138_0FB997B7B57E1780"/>
ſtudy, is to enlarge and invigorate the powers of the mind. The following pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque account of the indolence of young people in England, born heirs to great eſtates, I think, reflects great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor upon parents, however wealthy they may be.</p>
                     <p>"IF there is any characteriſtic peculiar to the young people of faſhion, of the preſent age, it is their lazineſs, or extreme unwillingneſs to attend to any thing that can give them the leaſt diſquietude; without any degree of which they would fain enjoy all the luxuries of life, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the diſpoſitions of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the nature of things. They would have great eſtates without manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, great expenſes without accounts, and great families without diſcipline, or economy; in ſhort they are fit only to be inhabitants of Lubberland, where, as the child's geography informs us, men lie upon their backs with their mouths open, and it rains fat pigs ready roaſted."</p>

While the rich keep poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their eſtates, they are as liable to accidents as other men, which require vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilance to foreſee, exertion to guard againſt, or invention to extricate themſelves from. "The ſons of Princes, ſaid Carneades the philoſopher, learn nothing to purpoſe, but to ride the great horſe; in other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes every one bends to them; but a great horſe will throw the ſon of a King with no more remorſe than the ſon of a cobler."</p>

girls indelicate. I have heard of their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they never ſo much as help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the water with which they waſhed their face and hands: if a ſervant was not at liberty to get it for them, they would either wait till he was, or go unwaſhed for the day: indolence and inertneſs grew up with them. Too lazy to attend to any buſineſs, and wholly deſtitute of economy, they ſoon ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away their ample patrimony; and were reduced to extreme poverty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge, or powers of exertion, neceſſary to remedy their circumſtances. In this helpleſs and diſtreſsful ſituation, their only boaſt was, that they never had done any work in their lives: and in them was literally verified the old adage, "He that will not work ſhall not eat." Having dragged out a life of inactivity, not of enjoyment; and reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty, they ſunk under the weight of infirmity, contracted by indolence, and mingled with the common maſs of inert matter.</p>

                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove was a man of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient property to have kept a ſervant to attend each of his children: but, appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the dangerous effects of ſuch a meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and convinced that induſtry is the ſureſt guard againſt vice, and the beſt means of ſecuring health and the powers of enjoyment; he early habituated them to it. It ſometimes happens that mothers cannot bear to ſee their children making efforts to do any thing which can be done, or procured for them. But, happy for Oſander and Rozella, their mamma al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways encouraged them in exerciſing their
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:022570_0143_0FB997CA87515E08"/>
invention to make their own play things. No toys were purchaſed for them, as is common among moſt wealthy parents. The purchaſe of theſe has a diſagreeable effect on the mind. They are of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence any longer than they have the appearance of novelty; familiarity ſoon deſtroys the pleaſure, or breeds diſguſt: others muſt be procured, or the mind will not reſt at eaſe: if procured, the deſire of novelty is increaſed, and the power of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment diminiſhed; for enjoyment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much on our own exertions. That which we acquire at the expenſe of ſome labor, we value; and we enjoy, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reliſh, the fruits of our own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and induſtry.</p>
                     <p>GREAT advantages aroſe to thoſe child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren from their being left to invent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for themſelves, and make their own toys. By this happy contrivance, their invention was put upon the ſtretch to form ſchemes for amuſement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct machines for play: this inured them to think and recollect for themſelves;
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:022570_0144_0FB997CDFA3DB2D0"/>
and it brought into exerciſe, all thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are of conſtant uſe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affairs of life. While invention was employed in deviſing, action was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to carry into effect whatever they had planned; this induced the habits of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and induſtry.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE before obſerved, that they were furniſhed with ſuch opportunities and means of amuſement, as had a tendency to encourage and promote theſe habits, by a privilege in the garden. Oſander cannot, indeed, make his tools; but at the age of nine, he can dig up his ground in the garden and dreſs it; for on theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he holds it. He can make his own bow and arrows. His marbles are of his own conſtruction. His ball, top, ſled, and whatever ſerves for amuſement, are the effect of his own handicraft, with very little aſſiſtance. Theſe he continued to enjoy without being cloyed, or wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any others; becauſe he was firſt employed in making, and then in uſing them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="unknown:022570_0145_0FB997D354E482C0"/>ROZELLA cannot dig her garden, this would be too maſculine an employment for a little girl; but ſhe can pull out the weeds and keep the bed clean. She can dreſs and undreſs her doll; and carry it thro all the ceremonies of giving and receiving viſits. She nurſes, inſtructs, and corrects it; and is never tired of the buſineſs, becauſe it gives her exerciſe; and ſhe enjoys the fruit of her own labor. Children are naturally active; and if this ſtimulus is kept alive by proper induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to induſtry, they will never languiſh for want of occupation, nor will their amuſements become inſipid by familiarity. Conſequences moſt fatal to their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and future uſefulneſs, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, when they can find neither em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment nor amuſement.</p>
                     <p>AS idleneſs is the inlet to almoſt every vice, with young people, ſo a habit of ſauntering, when children, has been the ruin of many a hopeful genius. Idleneſs too has an ill effect on the temper: for want of exerciſe and employment to fix
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:022570_0146_0FB997D44AF38338"/>
and engage the attention, children, as well as adult perſons, grow out of humor, and become peeviſh.</p>
                     <p>OUR little maſter and his ſiſter are in no danger of being ſoured on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; or of becoming ruſty for want of action: between the employments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and their own induſtry in inventing and making things for amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they find no idle hours. Children love employment; but cannot bear long confinement: their greateſt pleaſures would ſoon become irkſome, if impoſed as a taſk. Application and relaxation ſhould, therefore, ſo divide their time, as to make both a pleaſure. Nothing ſhould be aſſigned children under the idea of a taſk, becauſe the very idea is diſguſting.</p>
                     <p>THEY ſhould be fired with a ſpirit of emulation to equal, or excel others; and their induſtry, ſhould be made to carry its own reward with it; or, at leaſt, held ſo near to view, as never to loſe its influence.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER never thinks much of what he has to get by heart, or to tranſlate;
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:022570_0147_0FB997D5ED958670"/>
becauſe it is cheerfully propoſed to him as ſomething which will be beneficial to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and will make him find out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he did not know before: he has not ſo much given him to get, but he may eaſily attain it within the time; and that time is not ſo long, as to make him reſtleſs by confinement. Rozella is ſo accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to order and regularity, as to go, with equal facility, to her book, her work, or her play.</p>
                     <p>SUCH are the effects of induſtry, that while the induſtrious grow rich, the rich, without it, grow poor. The following anecdote is a ſtriking proof of this truth. "A gentleman having an eſtate in land, of two hundred pounds yearly, kept the whole in his hands. Finding that this did not anſwer, he was forced to ſell half to pay his debts, and let the remainder to a tenant for one and twenty years. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the leaſe, the tenant aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the landlord, if he would part with his land—"Prithee, tell me," ſays the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, "how it could be, that I could not
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:022570_0148_0FB997DE01D1AAF0"/>
live upon twice as much, being my own, and yet that you, having but half, and paying rent for it, have been able in twenty one years to buy it?" "Sir," ſaid the farmer, "when any thing was to be done, you ſaid, go and do it; but I always ſaid, come let <hi>us</hi> go and do it; and ſo not only ſaw my buſineſs done, but aſſiſted." The expedience of fixing habits of induſtry in youth, will be evident, if we conſider, that it is by dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence, the family of the poor is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the mechanic contributes to the convenience of others, or finds his own ſubſiſtence. In trade and commerce, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are acquired, or enjoyments diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified, by diligence. It is by diligence, the patriot obtains diſtinction; the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent acquires knowledge; and man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the honorable character of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found wiſdom, or extenſive benevolence. The vulgar apprehenſion of genius is like the vulgar doctrine of predeſtination: the elect, in both caſes, are generally worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; they imagine themſelves entitled by
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:022570_0149_0FB997E04C99B158"/>
favor, to advantages, which others muſt obtain by induſtry." But the truth is, induſtry is not only a handmaid of virtue, but the high road to every kind of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</p>
                     <p>IN order to make the activity of youth become a habit of induſtry, it is neceſſary to direct it to permanent objects: if the young mind is diſtracted by a variety of trifles, children will proceed at random; and will be determined to become uſeful, or otherwiſe, as circumſtances, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with whom they aſſociate, happen to point the way.</p>
                     <p>FAMILIAR ſtories, ſuited to explain and encourage the particular virtues he would recommend to his children, were thought by Mr. Bloomſgrove to have a great effect upon their minds: with theſe he uſed often to amuſe them, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with intereſting remarks ſuitable to their age.</p>

                     <head>LETTER XXVIII.</head>
                     <p>THE following ſtory, which ſerved profitably to amuſe a vacant hour, ſhews the folly of great eagerneſs after wealth, and, at the ſame time, holds up to view the beſt reaſons for induſtry. "At a time, when a ſpirit raged among many people, for going to South America in queſt of golden ore; Roderico had a mind to go among the reſt, to ſeek his fortune. This inclination he communicated to Don Juan, an older brother, to whom he prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed an equal ſhare of his riches, if he would go with him. This brother being of a more cool and moderate ſpirit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to diſſuade Roderico from an enterpriſe, in which he would be expoſed to great danger, with greater uncertainty of ſucceſs. Finding him fully bent on going, Don Juan agreed to accompany him; declining, at the ſame time, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any part of the riches he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Roderico ſold all he had; and bought a veſſel ſuitable for the buſineſs,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:022570_0151_0FB997E57AE17898"/>
with neceſſary utenſils for the deſign, and embarked with his friends and fellow ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, Rizzio, Alphonſo, and others, who were inſpired with the like ardor for becoming rich without labor. Don Juan took on board only ſome tools for huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; a few camels, with harneſs for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor; ſome ſheep, corn, and ſeeds of various kinds of vegetables.</p>
                     <p>"THIS appeared a ſtrange kind of cargo to the ſeekers of gold.—'Papa,' ſaid Oſander, 'is it not better to have gold, than ploughs and ſheep, and ſo have to work hard?'—'Stay a little, my dear,' ſaid Mr. Bloomſgrove, 'and hear the ſtory out.' They arrived at South A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, after ſome difficulty from contrary winds, and a leaky veſſel. No ſooner had they landed, than Roderico, with his companions, prepared to go in ſearch of gold. Don Juan told his brother he would tarry near the ſhore until his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. They quite ridiculed his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſtaying to till the land in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where gold abounded. Roderico
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:022570_0152_0FB997EBA8EA1F00"/>
harangued his men upon the occaſion, and reproached his brother's weakneſs in diverting himſelf with ſuch trifling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. They all applauded Roderico's ſpirit, except one old Spaniard, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſome doubts whether Don Juan would appear ſo unwiſe, in the end, as they now thought him to be. Taking their leave of him, they travelled day after day, thro foreſts, over mountains, thro vales, and over ſwift rivers. They were not to be diſcouraged however by any difficulties. They tried ſeveral places without ſucceſs. At laſt, after having travelled many days, ſometimes ſcorched with the intenſe heat of the ſun, and at others drenched with violent ſhowers of rain, they found a quantity of ore. Here they labored inceſſantly until their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions were exhauſted. But the ore was ſo plenty, that they could not think of quitting the ground. They fed on the roots and berries, which they could find. —'Oh, papa,' exclaimed Rozella, 'I wiſh I had ſome of thoſe good berries:
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:022570_0153_0FB997EDD175B230"/>
but could not thoſe poor folks get any thing elſe to eat? I wiſh they had ſome of our good dinner' 'Yes, my dear,' continued he—they caught a few birds and ſome ſquirrels; but after they began to melt and refine the ore, they could not find any more of theſe; and they continued ſo long, that roots and berries became very ſcarce. Their labor was ſo hard and the famine ſo ſevere, that ſeveral of the company died, and the reſt with difficulty returned to the place where they had left Don Juan, and carried with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>em the gold, which they had acquired, at the expenſe of ſo much pain, and with the loſs of ſeveral lives.</p>
                     <p>"DON Juan had employed all this time in cultivating a fine ſpot of interval, which he had pitched upon for that purpoſe; and which, by the aſſiſtance of the labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he carried with him, had now produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an ample crop of potatoes and other things ſuitable to the climate, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſupport life. His ſheep had brought lambs, and all were in excellent
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:022570_0154_0FB997F14B83B548"/>
order. He had caught and dried a great quantity of fiſh; ſo that he had a plenty of proviſion. He received his brother very kindly; and inquired how he had ſucceeded. Roderico informed him, that they had ſucceeded well in getting gold; but that they were almoſt ſtarved, and that ſeveral of their companions had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed from want and hardſhip. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted his brother, to furniſh them with ſome proviſion immediately, as they had ſubſiſted ſeveral days only on the bark and roots of trees. Don Juan very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately reminded him of their firſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to interfere with each other's gains. But added, if he had a mind to buy the fruits of his induſtry, he could ſupply ſome preſent relief, but not oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe.</p>
                     <p>"THIS ſeemed unkind in a brother. But they muſt either ſtarve with their gold in hand, or part with it to procure proviſions at a moſt exorbitant price. So that their gold was ſoon gone in procuring the bare neceſſaries of life. When Roderico and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:022570_0155_0FB997F28D2C5C38"/>
his company had been obliged to give his brother all the gold they had acquired, thro ſo many miſeries, Don Juan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed returning to their native country, from which they had been abſent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time. But Roderico was ſo highly offended with his brother, for his conduct, which appeared ſo cruel, that he declared he would never more go home with a brother who could uſe him ſo ill. Upon this Don Juan embraced him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately and ſaid—'And do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuppoſe, my dear brother, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deprive you of the fruits of your arduous and dangerous undertaking?— No: ſooner may I ceaſe to reap the fruits of my own induſtry; and the earth refuſe me my daily bread, than I ſhould be guilty of ſuch a piece of conduct. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhed to correct your impetuous thirſt for riches, and to ſhew you that induſtry was the ſure road to acquire the means of ſupplying the calls of nature; and that he who had exhauſted all his ſtrength in accumulating gold might pine with want.
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:022570_0156_0FB997F3BAADAEC8"/>
You ſee that all your gold would not have ſaved you from periſhing, had it not been for my foreſight and induſtry. Here, my brother, take your gold; and go with me to viſit our native land, and dear friends; and let them ſee that you have acquired wiſdom as well as gold.' The aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Roderico acknowledged the ſuperior wiſdom, generoſity, and goodneſs of his brother, and declared 'that he now found, from his own experience, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry was better than gold; and that he would endeavor to ſhew his friends, on his return, that the wiſdom he had learnt from his brother, was of more real value to him, than all the gold he had acquired.'</p>
                     <p>"EMBRACING his brother in a moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial manner, he begged him to accept half of his riches; but he poſitively refuſed, ſaying—'He that can raiſe food enough to maintain himſelf, can never be in want of gold.' Then bidding adieu to ſeveral of the people, who choſe to tarry longer, they ſet ſail for their native country, where, after a favorable voyage, they ſafely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:022570_0157_0FB997FC166C2878"/>
to the great joy of their numerous friends, and to their mutual ſatisfaction."</p>

                     <p>THE habits of induſtry not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a ſecure guard againſt vice, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for the practice of every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Of all the virtues which dignify human nature, and diſtinguiſh the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of men, benevolence may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the capital. This amiable qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity does not ſtand in oppoſition to ſelf love, but is an expanſion of it. Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is oppoſite to benevolence. This is the root of moſt of thoſe evils and miſeries which ſocieties experience. It regards ourſelves to the excluſion of others; and is a deſire of poſſeſſing, or having domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion over more, than we have need of, without any regard to others. This is an evil weed that ſhould be rooted out, or rather prevented by the careful hand of education; and the oppoſite virtue, a
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:022570_0158_0FB997FD829D8E40"/>
readineſs to impart to others, ſhould be nouriſhed with equal care. Among other little anecdotes, by which Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove endeavored to cheriſh a benevolent diſpoſition in the children when young, was the following.</p>
                     <p>"A mouſe, by accident, coming under the paw of a lion, begged hard for life, urging that clemency was the faireſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of power. The lion generouſly ſet it at liberty. The mouſe afterwards obſerving the lion entangled in the toils of the hunter, flew to his aſſiſtance, gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the net to pieces, and ſet him free. Hence an uſeful leſſon: neglect no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing good; for even the loweſt may happen to be uſeful to the higheſt."</p>
                     <p>IF we had been intended to be wholly ſelfiſh, human life would have been much ſhorter than it is; for all corporeal pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, even the moſt delightful, preſently loſe their reliſh; are followed with ſatiety, and diſguſt; and can only be preſerved by a change of objects; and, even theſe,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:022570_0159_0FB998061D940580"/>
ſoon loſe their charms, and novelty itſelf loſes the power of pleaſing. It is quite otherwiſe with benevolence. This, like the well nerved arm, gathers ſtrength by exerciſe. The oftener we repeat gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous actions, the more ſhall we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do them; and our pleaſure in doing good will increaſe in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. The ſatisfaction it affords is not allayed, even by age, which allays ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery other enjoyment. The body may decay, but the pleaſure of doing good, when habitual, continues the ſame even to the laſt moment of life.</p>
                     <p>A QUALITY, productive of ſo many hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable and laſting effects, cannot be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, in the young mind, with too much care and attention. Children, early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the benevolent affections, will be ſuperior to the prevalence of ſelfiſh gratifications. They will be reſpectful to ſuperiors; kind to their companions; civil and complaiſant to inferiors; charitable to the poor; compaſſionate to the diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ready to aſſiſt all in their power;
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:022570_0160_0FB9980D8FF27948"/>
even where there is no proſpect of reward, but the ſatisfaction of doing good.</p>
                     <p>THIS is very beautifully illuſtrated, and recommended to univerſal practice by an ancient parable, which Mrs. Bloomſgrove uſed to repeat to the children with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar pleaſure, as it inculcated that diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted undiſcriminating benevolence which regarded not, either nation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious diſtinctions in its exertions to do good, and was congenial to her heart. "A traveller, bound from Jeruſalem to Jericho, fell into the hands of a band of robbers; who wounded him in a moſt barbarous manner, leaving him half dead. Two perſons of note, from whom might be expected every expreſſion of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, travelling the ſame road, ſaw him. 'Mamma,' cries the tender hearted Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zella, 'did they not take care of the poor man?'—'No, my dear,' continued ſhe; 'they paſſed by on the other ſide of the way, and did not ſhew him the leaſt pity.' 'If I had been there,' interrupted Oſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (for ſhe allowed them to interrupt her
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:022570_0161_0FB9980EEF1B1118"/>
by queſtions, or obſervations of their own; when rehearſing to them) 'I would have given him all my money.'—'Very well, my dear, you ſhould always be ready to do good with what you have, and pity thoſe you cannot relieve.' The poor man lay ſometime bleeding and weltering in his own gore, without any one to hear his groans, and pity his wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At laſt there came along a man, of a different nation and religion from the wounded man: he was not a man of great reputation in the world, and never had an opportunity to ſhew the full extent of his benevolence. But ſuch an opportunity now offered, and he emb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ced it with pleaſure. No ſooner did he behold the tragical ſcene, but his indignation roſe againſt the perpetrators of it, and, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with commiſeration, he flew to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the unfortunate ſtranger; and, without inquiring who, or what he was, whether he belonged to Jeruſalem or Jericho, he inſtantly adminiſtered neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary relief, pouring the oil and wine into
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:022570_0162_0FB9981041C76220"/>
his wound, which he had provided for his own uſe, on the way; ſet him on his own beaſt, and carried him'to an inn, where he might be better accommodated; paid the hoſt a ſum of money for the preſent, which, tho ſmall, was all he could poſſibly ſpare from his own neceſſary uſes; and became reſponſible for whatever charges might ariſe in the courſe of his entire recovery.</p>
                     <p>"THIS was genuine benevolence! Here was the friend that loveth at all times, and the brother born for adverſity! Go and do likewiſe, was the injunction, with which the prince of love and good will to men concluded the recital of the above tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action—That is, imitate the example of this worthy man, in doing good as you have opportunity and ability; and never inquire whether a man is of your kindred, country, or nation, If he ſtands in need of aſſiſtance."</p>
                     <p>TEACH your children, my dear ſir, to practiſe upon this divinely benevolent ſcheme; and they will be the delight of
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:022570_0163_0FB99811B50F3C98"/>
their parents, bleſſings to their friends, and the objects of univerſal eſteem.</p>

                     <p>IF ever the heart of parents had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expand with joy, at beholding the good influence of inſtruction and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon their children; Mr. and Mrs. Bloomſgrove had the utmoſt reaſon to rejoice in the growth of the benevolent affections in theirs. The principles of benevolence had been early inculcated, by a variety of maxims and actions ſuited to their age. The little plant had been nouriſhed with great care, was conſtantly cheriſhed by exerciſe, and ſupported by their own example. Nothing could have given them more pleaſure, than to ſee their youthful hearts dilating with this generous quality. Inſtead of laying out their money for toys or ſweetmeats, as moſt other children did, they kept it to give to poor people, who frequented this
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:022570_0164_0FB9981B32C3F8C0"/>
hoſpitable dwelling; or to aſſiſt indigent families, in the neighborhood: theſe they were permitted to viſit, accompanied by Fanny; in whom Mrs. Bloomſgrove placed ſo much confidence, that Rozella was committed to her care in thoſe excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>THOSE families were very fond of their young viſitants; for they uſed to carry ſomething for their relief, or to gratify their children. Oſander, who would ſometimes play unlucky tricks, threw ſtones at a pigeon, which the children of one of thoſe families had tamed, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, while Fanny and Rozella were in the houſe, diſtributing the things they had brought for their comfort. As ſoon as the children knew that their pigeon was killed, there was great lamentation about it. Their mother endeavored to pacify them, telling them, "if it was Oſander who had committed the crime (for he had abſconded) he did not do it intentionally, and ſhe did not doubt but he would give them another, for ſhe never knew him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:022570_0165_0FB9981F3A31F300"/>
the poor, or any body elſe indeed." The mother's harangue prevailed; the children were quieted. Fanny and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zella, who expreſſed much ſorrow for what had happened, and ſhed many tears with the poor children, took leave, ſaying, they would acquaint his papa; and they did not doubt he would make him give them another. When they reached home, they found Oſander very penſive, for he had not yet ventured to tell what he had done, tho it had been his practice frankly to confeſs, when he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any miſchief; and his mamma did not chooſe to queſtion him, leſt he ſhould be tempted to utter a falſehood. The whole affair was diſcloſed on their return. His mamma remonſtrated againſt ſuch conduct, and eſpecially, in not confeſſing it to her, when he firſt came home. She directed him to take two of his beſt pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and go immediately, and make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the damage he had done. He cheerfully embraced the terms of peace with them, and by that means found peace
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:022570_0166_0FB99823C3AD19E0"/>
in his own mind. He begged his mamma to give him ſome biſcuit and cheeſe to carry for the children. Being thus equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the neceſſary means of a treaty of peace and friendſhip, he ſoon reached the ſpot, and ſettled every thing to mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>THE pleaſure of doing good, is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt reward which generous minds can receive from beneficent actions: this is a reward, which time cannot change, ruſt corrupt, nor thieves break thro and ſteal. With this ſenſe then, ſhould the young mind be inſpired; and, by this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſhould be exerciſed in acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence. I cannot but think that Mr. Locke's plan, for making children charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, has a greater tendency to make them ſelfiſh and covetous, than to inſpire true benevolence and generoſity. Speaking of liberality, in the uſe of what they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, and of rooting out the oppoſite prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, covetouſneſs, he ſays—</p>
                     <p>"THIS ſhould be encouraged by great commendation and credit, and conſtantly
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:022570_0167_0FB9982ADC38BB40"/>
taking care, that the child loſes nothing by his liberality. Let all the inſtances he gives of ſuch freeneſs, be always repaid with intereſt; and let him ſenſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the kindneſs, he ſhews to others, is no ill huſbandry for himſelf; but that it brings a return of kindneſs, both from thoſe who receive it and thoſe who look on."—Sect. 110. But if all men acted upon this principle, what muſt have been the fate of the unfortunate man who lay wounded, helpleſs, and alone in the dreary paſs between Jeruſalem and Jericho? Habitual good actions, prompted only by the proſpect of gain, will, like untimely fruit, drop off when no longer nouriſhed by ſuch hopes; and the ſecret alms will ceaſe to riſe as a memorial of heartfelt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence before God.</p>
                     <p>THE following method has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by Lord Kaimes, to habituate children to a humane and generous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. "Give to each of your child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, a ſmall ſum for charity. Let them account to you for the diſpoſal; and to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:022570_0168_0FB9982D6529E2B0"/>
the child, who has made the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſtribution, give double the ſum, to be laid out in the ſame way," Certain it is, that ſuch actions deſerve great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; and it is as certain, that a benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent diſpoſition may be increaſed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating them. Compaſſion and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be ſo cheriſhed in children, as that they will part without reluctance with their own property, even that of which they were very fond, to relieve the diſtreſſed. "The Earl of Elgin permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his two ſons, in their hours of play, to aſſociate with the boys in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which he thought better, than to have them expoſed to be corrupted at home by his ſervants, filling them with notions of their rank and quality. One day, the two boys being called to dinner, a young lad, their companion, ſaid, 'I'll wait till you return, as there is no dinner at home for me.' Have you no money to buy it? 'No.' 'Papa, ſays the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, what was the price of the ſilver buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles you gave me?' 'Five ſhillings.'
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:022570_0169_0FB998326EF8DF30"/>
'Let me have the money, and I'll give you the buckles.' It was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. The Earl, inquiring privately, found that the money had been given to the lad. The buckles were returned, and the boy was highly commended for being ſo kind to his companions."</p>
                     <p>THE following inſtance of generoſity, no leſs deſerves notice: One day, as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander was going with Fanny and his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſiſter, on one of their charitable excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſee a poor family; paſſing thro an extenſive vale, they came to an hazel copſe, where they found one of the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren picking ſome raſpberries. As they approached him, he began to cry: they aſked what he cried for; he told them that his mamma, his brother, and one of his ſiſters, were very ſick and had nothing to eat. They accompanied him to the houſe, or rather the hut; and, to their great ſurpriſe, they found the two child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſick in a little open place, with very little to refreſh, or cover them; and their mother ſcarce able to do any thing for
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:022570_0170_0FB99833AAA56F48"/>
them, or for herſelf; and her huſband gone abroad to hard labor, in order to get ſomething for them, but could not be at home till night. Struck with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of poverty and diſtreſs in this dreary abode, the viſitants could afford them but little aid, at this time, except their ſympathetic tears, of which they were very liberal. They haſten home, that they may relate the melancholy tale; and procure ſome effectual means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. They all ſpeak as one; and each is eager to be foremoſt in telling what they had ſeen, and in offering ſome of their own things for the relief of this poor family. Fanny, Oſander, and Rozella, all declare that they are willing to part with any of their things, if they may go and carry them.</p>
                     <p>LIBERALITY appeared ſo blended with ſympathy in this triplicate of almoners, whoſe only ſtrife was to excel each other in acts of generoſity, that it drew tears of joy from Mrs. Bloomſgrove's eyes, while her heart glowed with compaſſion for the
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:022570_0171_0FB9983C97A6B7D0"/>
poor and diſtreſſed. That the ardor of their benevolent feelings might not be damped, and that they might experience the pleaſure of their own actions, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to carry ſome of their own clothing and bed furniture, aſſuring them that they did well, but that they muſt not expect her to replace them again: they all declare, with one voice, that they did not wiſh it. A ſervant was diſpatched, to be the carrier of the goods, with ſome jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, pottage, and ſuch other things as Mrs. Bloomſgrove thought moſt ſuitable for them. Never was charity beſtowed more opportunely, or with a better grace; nor received with more apparent gratitude. The offering was made with as much avid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity as it could be received; and it would have been difficult from appearances, to ſay, who were moſt bleſt, the giver or the receivers.</p>
                     <p>AMONG the many pictures of diſtreſs preſented to their minds, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite compaſſion, and keep alive the benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent affections, the following deſerves notice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

As it was the midſt of winter, and the floods were out, it was abſolutely neceſſary to wade, thro the lower room, to a ladder, which ſerved inſtead of ſtairs. The chamber (and it was the only one) was ſo low, that he could not ſtand upright in it; there was one window which admitted the air as freely as the light, for the rags which had been ſtuffed into the broken panes were now taken out to contribute to the covering of a newborn infant. In a dark corner of the room ſtood a ſmall bedſtead without furniture, and on it lay the dead mother, who had juſt expired in labor for want of proper aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>"THE father was ſitting on a little ſtool by the fire place, tho there was no fire, and endeavoring to keep the infant warm in his boſom; five of the ſeven children, half naked, were aſking their father for a piece of bread, while a fine boy, of about three years old, was ſtanding by his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:022570_0173_0FB9984237CD4740"/>
at the bedſide, crying, as he was wont to do, 'Take me, take me, mammy.' 'Mammy is aſleep,' ſaid one of his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with cheeks bedewed with tears; 'Mammy is aſleep, Johnny; go play with the baby on daddy's knee.'</p>
                     <p>"THE father took him upon his knee, and his grief which had hitherto kept him dumb, and in a ſtate of temporary inſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibility, burſt out in a torrent of tears, and relieved his heart which ſeemed ready to break. 'Don't cry, pray don't cry,' ſaid the eldeſt boy, 'the nurſe is coming up ſtairs with a two penny loaf in her hand, and mammy will wake preſently, and I will carry her the largeſt piece.' Upon this, an old woman crooked with age, and clothed in tatters, came hobbling on her little ſtick into the room, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heaving a groan, calmly ſat down and dreſſed the child in its rags; then divided the loaf as far as it would go. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was ſoon ſent by thoſe to whom the old woman had applied. And afterwards a little contribution was raiſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition

                     <p>GRATITUDE is a virtue nearly allied to benevolence; they grow in the ſame ſoil; and both indicate generoſity and docility of mind. Gratitude is a ſentiment natural to man. But, like all other native qualities, muſt be cheriſhed and brought on to perfection, or it will decay; and, by miſmanagement, may be deſtroyed. Nothing is more natural than to love thoſe who do us ſervice; and a child, when it begins to perceive the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit of your care, will ſoon be ſenſible of the obligation; and you can by this means acquire an authority over his heart which cannot be ſhaken. "Ingratitude, ſays Rouſſeau, would be more rare, if benefits upon uſury were leſs common. The heart of man is ſelf intereſted, but never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful;
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:022570_0175_0FB998463A20AD20"/>
and the obliged are leſs to be charged with ingratitude, than their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors with ſelf intereſt. If you ſell me your favors, let us ſettle the price; but if you pretend to give, and afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to make terms with me, you are guilty of fraud; it is their being given gratis which render them ineſtimable." A benefit which has the good of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver in view, and does not appear to be deſigned for the emolument of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, ſeldom fails to inſpire gratitude.</p>
                     <p>IT is difficult to explain this virtue and the obligations of it to children. But the period of life, in which our young maſter and his ſiſter are at this time, does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much reaſoning; but familiarity to illuſtrate by ſome happy alluſions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherein they can ſee the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the virtue that is recommended. The habits of a grateful temper may be laid in childhood, by always watching over the actions of children, and making them careful to return the favors they receive from one another, at leaſt by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

Mr. Bloomſgrove, being a very domeſtic man, ſpent many of his leiſure hours in the little circle of his family; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accommodating his converſation to their capacity; and relating the inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive anecdotes which he met with, for their amuſement and inſtruction. On the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after they had relieved the poor fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily mentioned in my laſt, he returned from —, where he had been to decide a cauſe of great magnitude: they informed him of the whole affair; and begged him to let Sancho, a man ſervant, go down in the morning and carry them ſome more things; "for, ſay they, the poor woman was very thankful for what we carried her." "So ſhe ought to be, ſaid he; and you, my dear, ſhould be thankful that it was in your power to relieve her; and it may be in her's one day or other to do as great a kindneſs to you, and if her gratitude is ſincere, ſhe will gladly embrace the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity." They were ſurpriſed that he ſhould think it poſſible that ſo great a change could ever take place. "I have in

                     <p>"A VENETIAN ſhip having tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a number of the Turks priſoners, ſold them, according to their barbarous cuſtom, to different perſons in the ciry. One of thoſe ſlaves, named Ibraim, lived near the houſe of a Venetian merchant who was very rich, and had but one ſon, a lad of about twelve. As he had occaſion fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to paſs Ibraim, he would ſtop and look very earneſtly at him. Ibraim obſerving in the lad an appearance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and tenderneſs, was greatly pleaſed with him, and ſought to have his company more frequently. The lad took
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:022570_0178_0FB99854782565D8"/>
ſuch a fancy to the ſlave, that he renewed his viſits much oftener than he had done, and brought him preſents for his relief and comfort. But tho Ibraim appeared always to be pleaſed with the innocent careſſes of his young friend, yet he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Ibraim was very ſorrowful ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and even ſhed tears. Afflicted by the repeated appearance of grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart, he at length requeſted his father to make Ibraim happy if it was in his power.</p>
                     <p>"THE father, pleaſed with this inſtance of generoſity in his ſon, determined to ſee the Turk himſelf, and inquire into the cauſe of his ſadneſs. The next day he went to ſee him, and looking at him for ſome time, was ſtruck with the mildneſs and honeſty of his countenance. He at length ſaid to him, 'Art thou Ibraim, of whoſe courteſy and gentleneſs my little ſon has ſpoken to me?' 'I am the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Ibraim, who have been now three years a captive: during that ſpace of time this youth is the only human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:022570_0179_0FB99856244B3E98"/>
that ſeems to have felt any compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for my ſufferings; I muſt confeſs therefore he is the only object to which I am attached in this barbarous country; and night and morning I pray that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who is equally the God of the Turks and Chriſtians, to grant him every bleſſing he deſerves, and to preſerve him from all the miſeries I ſuffer.' 'Indeed, Ibraim,' ſaid the merchant, 'he is much obliged to you, altho from his preſent circumſtances, he does not appear much expoſed to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Tell me in what I can aſſiſt you? for my ſon informs me that he often finds you in ſorrow and tears.' 'And is it ſtrange,' ſaid the Turk, 'that I ſhould pine in ſilence and be the prey of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual regret and ſorrow, who am bereft of my liberty, the nobleſt gift of heaven?' 'And yet how many thouſands of our nation,' ſaid the Venetian, 'do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in chains?' 'I have never been guilty of the inhuman practice of enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my fellow creatures,' replied the Turk; 'I have never increaſed my prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:022570_0180_0FB9985907338180"/>
by deſpoiling the Venetian merchants of theirs; for the cruelty of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men I am not accountable, more than you are for the barbarity of yours.'—A ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tear ſtarted from his eye, and bedew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his manly cheek.—Recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediately, and ſmiting gently on his breaſt, he bowed with reverence, and ſaid, 'God is good, and man muſt ſubmit to his decrees.' Affected with this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of manly fortitude, the merchant ſaid, 'Ibraim, I pity your ſufferings, and perhaps I may be able to relieve you. What would you do to regain your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?' 'I would,' ſaid he, 'meet every pain and danger that can appal the heart of man.' 'The means of your deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,' ſaid the merchant, 'are certain, without ſo great a trial. I have in this city an inveterate enemy who has offered me every inſult and injury that malice could invent; but he is as brave as he is haughty, and I have never dared reſent them as they have deſerved. Here, Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, is the inſtrument of your deliverance;
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:022570_0181_0FB9985FF1A580D0"/>
take this dagger; and when night has drawn her ſable curtain over the city, go with me, avenge me of mine adverſary, and you ſhall be free.'</p>
                     <p>"INDIGNANT at the idea of being an aſſaſſin, he rejected the propoſal with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; and raiſing his fettered arm as high as his chain would admit of, he ſwore by the mighty prophet, Mahomet, 'that he would not ſtoop to ſo vile a deed, to purchaſe the freedom of all his race.' The Venetian left him, adding, quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, 'You will think better of this perhaps by the next time I viſit you.'</p>
                     <p>"RETURNING the next day with his ſon, he accoſted Ibraim mildly, telling him, that tho he rejected his propoſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he doubted not but he might now be convinced. 'Inſult not the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,' interrupted Ibraim warmly, 'with propoſals more ſhocking than the chains I wear. Know, Chriſtian, that if thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion permits ſuch deeds, every true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan views them with indignation. From this moment therefore let us break
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:022570_0182_0FB9986137B692C0"/>
off all intercourſe, and be forever ſtrangers to each other.'—'No,' anſwered the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, embracing Ibraim, 'let us be more ſtrongly united than ever!—Pardon me this unneceſſary trial of thy virtue. Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino has a ſoul as averſe to deeds of treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and blood as Ibraim himſelf. From this moment, generous man, thou art free: thy ranſom is already paid, with no other obligation than that of remembering the affection of this thy young and faithful friend; and perhaps, hereafter, when thou ſeeſt an unhappy Chriſtian groaning in Turkiſh fetters, thy generoſity may make thee think of Venice.'</p>
                     <p>"LANGUAGE cannot paint the ecſtacy of joy and gratitude, which Ibraim felt at intelligence ſo agreeable, but unexpected. It is unneceſſary to repeat the many and warm expreſſions of gratitude, which he uttered as ſoon as the firſt tide of joy had ſo abated as to give him utterance. He was ſet free that very day, and Mazzarino put him on board a veſſel bound to one of the Grecian Iſlands, bade him an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:022570_0183_0FB998677541BA60"/>
adieu, putting a purſe of gold into his hands to bear his expenſes, and wiſhing him every bleſſing. Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and benedictions were mutual; for Ibraim regretted the ſeparation from ſuch a friend, whoſe diſintereſted goodneſs had ſet him at liberty, and with tears and prayers bade him a long farewel.</p>
                     <p>"ABOUT ſix months after this an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent took place, which had well nigh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the Venetian merchant of all his hopes. Early in the morning of one of their Saint's days, while the family were locked in profound ſleep, the houſe had taken fire, which had made a gradual progreſs, and nearly involved the whole in flame, before it was diſcovered. Scarce had the merchant been apprized of his danger in time to eſcape the awful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration; and no ſooner had he eſcaped with the ſervants who awoke him, than he inquired for his ſon. What a tumult of agony and deſpair rent his breaſt, when informed that, in the general conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had been forgotten, and was now
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:022570_0184_0FB998698D23C500"/>
alone in an upper room? He would have ruſhed headlong into the flames in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſearch for his ſon, had not his ſervants reſtrained him. He offered half his eſtate to the intrepid man who would undertake the dangerous attempt of ſaving his ſon. Tempted by the greatneſs of the reward, ladders were immediately raiſed and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral daring ſpirits made the attempt, but were forced back by the violence of the flames. Upon the battlements of the houſe, the unhappy youth now appeared, with extended arms, imploring aid, and ſeemed devoted to inevitable deſtruction. The father, beholding the imploring ſon, and the certain fate that awaited him, ſunk under the weight of the dreadful proſpect, and became totally inſenſible. In this moment of dreadful ſuſpenſe, a man ruſhing thro the croud, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance indicating the moſt determined reſolution, aſcended a ladder, and was ſoon enveloped in a cloud of ſmoke. Loſt to all appearance, the gazing multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude below ſuppoſed he muſt periſh in
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:022570_0185_0FB9986CBB093090"/>
the flames. What then muſt have been their aſtoniſhment, when they beheld him iſſuing forth with the lad in his arms, and deſcend the ladder, to revive the heart of an almoſt expiring parent? Or what muſt have been his feelings, when he recovered his ſenſes, at beholding in his own arms the darling of his heart, whom he had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up for loſt?—Tenderly embracing his ſon, he earneſtly inquired for the man who dared riſk his own life to ſave his ſon. They ſhewed him a man of noble ſtature, but meanly clad, covered with ſmoke and ſcorched with heat, and all as one declared he was the intrepid adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer who had ſaved his ſon.</p>
                     <p>"MAZZARINO, preſenting him a purſe of gold, requeſted his acceptance of that till he could make good his promiſe, which ſhould be done the next day. 'No,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the ſtranger, 'I do not ſell my blood. The pleaſure of ſaving your ſon is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward greater than all your riches could give.' 'Generous man!' cried the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, 'thy voice, ſure, is not ſtrange to

me!—It is'—'Yes,' exclaimed the ſon, throwing himſelf into the arms of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer—'it is my Ibraim!' Nothing could exceed the aſtoniſhment and grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude of Mazzarino, to behold the deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erer of his ſon in the perſon of Ibraim. Taking his benefactor with him to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er houſe of his, in a different part of the city, he inquired how he came into ſlavery a ſecond time, and why he had not made him acquainted with his condition. 'That captivity which has given me an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhewing that I was not altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er undeſerving thy kindneſs, and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that dear youth, I ſhall ever reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt the happieſt events of my life,' replied the generous Turk. 'But,' continued he, 'I will relate you the whole affair.</p>
                     <p>'I BELIEVE you never were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the circumſtance of my aged father being a ſharer with me in my captivity.

<pb n="188" facs="unknown:022570_0187_0FB99875A7AA76F8"/>
the notice of your generous little ſon, were ſhed on account of the hard fate of my aged ſire; and no ſooner was I ſet free by your unexampled bounty, than I went in ſearch of the Chriſtian who had made him a ſlave. Having found him, I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf in his ſtead, that he might go back and let his declining ſun ſet calm and ſerene in his own country and amidſt the tender care of ſurrounding friends. At length I prevailed on the Chriſtian, by adding the purſe of gold your bounty had ſupplied me with, to permit my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go back in the veſſel which was intended for me, without acquainting him with the means of his freedom. Since that time I have continued here, a willing ſlave, to pay the debt of nature and of gratitude.'</p>
                     <p>"IBRAIM ceaſed—The Venetian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed great aſtoniſhment at ſuch eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind; and preſſed him to accept the offer of half his eſtate, and to ſpend the remainder of his days in Venice. Ibraim aſſured his friend, that what he
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:022570_0188_0FB9987873193128"/>
had done was nothing more than the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of gratitude and friendſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and therefore he muſt decline accepting any further recompenſe than that of reflecting that he was not ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The merchant, ſolicitous to make ſome returns worthy of ſo much greatneſs of ſoul, once more purchaſed his freedom, and freighted a ſhip on purpoſe to ſend him back to his own country. Moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately did he and his ſon embrace their deliverer, and accompanying him to the ſhip, they once more bade a laſt adieu, remaining on the ſhore until the ſhip loſt itſelf under the horizon, and ſending for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their ardent prayers for a ſafe and proſperous voyage.</p>
                     <p>"MANY years having now elapſed, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time no intelligence had been received of Ibraim, the young Mazzarino had grown up, and become the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, amiable youth of his age and rank. Having ſome buſineſs in a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time town at ſome diſtance, which required diſpatch in getting thither, he embarked,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:022570_0189_0FB9987F34E18D48"/>
with his father, on board a Venetian veſſel going to that place. The winds favored their views; they had gained more than half their voyage, with a fine proſpect of ſecuring their whole paſſage, when a Turkiſh corſair was ſuddenly diſcovered bearing down upon them; from which they ſoon found it would be impoſſible to eſcape. Fear and conſternation ſeized the greater part of the crew, and they ſoon gave all over for loſt. But the young Mazzarino, drawing his ſword, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for their cowardice; and, by his manly courage and ſpeeches, rouſed them to defend their liberties by one great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The corſair approached in awful ſilence, till within reach of the Venetian ſhip, when on a ſudden the very heavens were rent by the noiſe of the artillery, and the whole atmoſphere wrapt in ſmoke. Thrice did the Turks eſſay, with horrid ſhouts, to board the Venetian ſhip: as often were they repelled by the well timed firmneſs of young Mazzarino and the crew inſpired by his courage. Having loſt
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:022570_0190_0FB99880B4C7A478"/>
many of their men, and ſeeing no proſpect of carrying their point, they, the Turks, began to draw off; and would have left the Venetians to purſue their voyage, had not two other ſhips of their own nation, that inſtant, made their appearance, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down towards them with great ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Upon their near approach, the Venetians, ſeeing no poſſibility of eſcape, and that reſiſtance would be madneſs, gave the ſign for ſurrendering the ſhip, and ſoon ſaw themſelves deprived of liberty, and loaded with irons. In this ſituation were they carried to Tunis, where they were brought forth and expoſed in the public market to be ſold for ſlaves. One after another of their companions were picked out, according to their ſtrength and vigor, and ſold to different maſters. A Turk of uncommon dignity in his figure and manners, at length came towards the captives, and ſurveying them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and tenderneſs, applied to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for young Mazzarino, and inquired the price of this captive. The captain
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:022570_0191_0FB99888F3DC90C8"/>
ſet a much higher price upon him, than he had done upon any of the others. The gentleman, a little ſurpriſed at the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant ſum, aſked the reaſon of this great diſtinction. The captain replied that he had animated the Chriſtians to the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſiſtance they had made; and had been the occaſion of moſt of the damage they had ſuſtained; and he was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make him repay ſome of it, or he would gratify his revenge by ſeeing him drudge for life in his victorious gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. All this time had the young Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarino fixed his eyes in a dumb ſilence on the ground; and now lifting them up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, in the perſon who was talking with the captain, the manly and open countenance of Ibraim. Mazzarino cried out, 'Oh! my friend Ibraim.' No leſs aſtoniſhed was the Turk, to find in the perſon of the captive his former companion and friend. He embraced him with the tranſports of a parent who unexpectedly recovers a long loſt child. But when Ibraim found that his Venetian benefactor and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:022570_0192_0FB9988BF49188E8"/>
was among the captives, he could no longer reſtrain the violence of his feelings: he burſt into a flood of ſorrow for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of his friend: but recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, exclaimed, with uplifted hands, 'bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be that providence which has made me the inſtrument of ſafety to my ancient benefactor.' Being informed where he ſhould find him, he inſtantly repaired to the part of the market where Mazzarino ſtood waiting his fate in manly, but ſilent deſpair. They were immediately known to each other. Their firſt interview was obſtructed by the fulneſs of their joy. As ſoon as he was able, the Turk hailed him, friend, benefactor, and by every endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing name which friendſhip and gratitude could inſpire; ordered his chains inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be taken off, and conducted them both to his own magnificent houſe in the city.</p>
                     <p>"AFTER ſome preliminary converſation upon their mutual fortunes, by which they were again brought to ſee each other in their preſent condition, Ibraim inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:022570_0193_0FB9988CD31DD450"/>
them, that ſoon after their goodneſs had reſtored him to his own country, he accepted a command in the Turkiſh arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies; and that having the good fortune to diſtinguiſh himſelf upon ſeveral occaſions, he had gradually been promoted, thro va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offices, to the dignity of Baſhaw of Tunis. 'Since I have enjoyed this poſt,' added he, 'there is nothing which I find in it ſo agreeable, as the power it gives me of alleviating the misfortunes of thoſe unhappy Chriſtians who are taken priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners by our corſairs. Whenever a ſhip arrives, which brings with it any of thoſe ſufferers, I conſtantly viſit the markets, and redeem a certain number of captives, whom I reſtore to liberty: and gracious Allah has ſhewn that he approves of theſe faint endeavors to diſcharge the ſacred duties of gratitude for my own redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by putting it in my power to ſerve the beſt and deareſt of men.'</p>
                     <p>"AFTER having paſſed about ten days in the houſe of Ibraim in a moſt agreeable manner, Mazzarino and his ſon were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:022570_0194_0FB9988E5B0C83C8"/>
on board of a ſhip bound to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice. Ibraim diſmiſſed them with great reluctance, but with many embraces; and ordered a choſen party of his own guards to conduct them on board their veſſel. Their joy was greatly increaſed, when, on their arrival at the ſhip, they found that the generoſity of Ibraim had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to themſelves, but that the ſhip which had been taken, with all the crew, were redeemed, and reſtored to freedom. Mazzarino and his ſon embarked, and, after a proſperous voyage, arrived ſafely in their own country, where they lived many years reſpected and eſteemed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually mindful of the viciſſitudes of life, and attentive to diſcharge their duties to their fellow creatures."</p>

                     <p>CAN you, my friend, after being feaſted with ſuch great and excellent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, reliſh the language of childhood, and
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:022570_0195_0FB99897A2AD3E38"/>
be pleaſed with the relations of infantile tranſactions? If not, I fear you will not give the following letter a cordial recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But you ſhould recollect, that childhood is the period in which the foundation of the greateſt virtues is laid. It is, then, as neceſſary to cultivate the firſt principles of them in the young mind, as to cheriſh the ſeed that is depoſited in the earth in order to enſure a future har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: and, like the ſeed which contains all the ſhades that expand in the flower, child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are poſſeſſed of all the qualities of men and women in miniature: to expand theſe is the buſineſs of education.</p>
                     <p>A CIRCUMSTANCE in the management of their domeſtic concerns, in the Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove family, which I think worthy of notice in this place, is the confidence they repoſed in the children. The voice of undoubted friendſhip has a great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the human heart. When pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have, by their prudent management with their children, convinced them that their good has been the object of all their
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:022570_0196_0FB99899FB0C41B8"/>
care, even of the puniſhments they have inflicted, ſo as to cheriſh the natural ſpark of gratitude, they may venture to make them their confidents, both of ſecrets and of their intereſt. A greater inducement to fidelity, either in children or ſervants, can hardly be conceived of, than to be thought truſt worthy. It lays hold of the beſt affections of human nature, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and grateful feelings; and gains an aſcendency over the mind which an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of authority could not effect; and will afford an effectual ſecurity againſt betraying the truſt repoſed.</p>
                     <p>IT is neceſſary, however, always to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the magnitude of the truſt to the age and fortitude of the child; otherwiſe it will corrupt the little heart, which it was deſigned to fortify. Things commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to children in confidence, which are in their nature a ſtrong temptation, will only teach them artful evaſions; for they will comply with the temptation, and then rack their invention to prevent the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, or to apologize for the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:022570_0197_0FB9989E97E9F6A8"/>
A child muſt be trained to fidelity by ſlow and gentle ſteps; and by a habit of being faithful in trifling concerns when young, it will be able to keep a ſecret; or be faithful to any truſt, at ſeven or eight years old, which one of fourteen would betray, who had never been accuſtomed to confidence. Let the firſt commiſſion to a child be ſmall, and of ſuch a nature as may eaſily be kept: approve the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and encourage it by ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: increaſe by degrees, the truſt; and let the accompliſhment of it always be commended, and rewarded with ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er confidence.</p>
                     <p>AT a breach of truſt, in either of the children, Mrs. Bloomſgrove expreſſes much ſurpriſe and indignation: ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines truſting the faithleſs child again, until, by a due courſe of diſcipline, it is ſufficiently humbled; but takes care not to mortify it too long. She lets the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent ſee that ſhe ſtill confides in its reſolution and integrity. She appears to forget the former failure; but keeps it
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:022570_0198_0FB998A0847F7958"/>
alive in the child's mind, by more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently calling it to account, without any apparent concern about its fidelity. When, by repeated trial, the habit of fidelity is well fixed, and a good degree of ſelf command acquired, you may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture almoſt any thing in ſuch hands. It is proper to approve and appear highly pleaſed with the good conduct of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, eſpecially their fidelity; but not to praiſe them too highly, becauſe it is an act of indiſpenſable obligation; and if too much praiſed, the child may become more eager after applauſe, than deſirous of meriting eſteem and approbation; to the pleaſures of which they ſhould be early accuſtomed.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER, at the age of five, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to go into the garden, and pick up the cherries which had fallen, provided he meddled not with the white currants; and ſometimes he was ſent to gather a few of both, but charged not to eat any of either, until the gentleman who had called to ſee his papa was refreſhed. Being one day
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:022570_0199_0FB99445B5C7B728"/>
detected in tranſgreſſing the conditions, he was not ſuffered to go into the garden all that day, nor to eat any fruit from it. At eight years old, he was intruſted with a ſmall ſum of money, which he was told to keep, until a perſon to whom it was due, ſhould call for it, and it was enjoined upon him to remember, that this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was placed in him, becauſe he had been honeſt in other caſes, and it was not doubted but he would be ſo in the preſent. The money was accordingly delivered up, at call, in about five days: greater ſums were afterwards committed to his care, and continued a longer time; until he might be intruſted with any ſum. When he goes abroad, the hour is given him for returning; if he abuſes the liberty he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, it is taken from him for a time.</p>
                     <p>ROZELLA was permitted to go to her mamma's cloſet as ſoon as ſhe was big enough to turn a key. She is told to take a piece of ruſk for herſelf, and to bring the cheeſecakes for the company; ſhe is faithful; but ſhe has been accuſtomed to
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:022570_0200_0FB994473575F578"/>
this reſtraint by being tried in ſmaller things. At eight years old ſhe never thought of touching any forbidden fruit. Indeed, ſhe appears to prefer her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's approbation to every other pleaſure. Girls are holden much more ſtrongly by thoſe ties than boys, if we may judge by compariſon between theſe two; for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander more frequently betrays the truſt repoſed in him, than his ſiſter, tho it is a rare thing in either of them. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple being early implanted, and the habits of fidelity being cheriſhed with great care, they were never ſhaken afterwards. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny improved by her care of Rozella, who was committed to her as a valuable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit. The care of Rozella's clothes was given to her; ſometimes ſhe was directed to inſtruct her in reading and work; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to aſſiſt in dreſſing and undreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The vulgar obſervation, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not able to keep a ſecret, has no foundation in nature; but muſt be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribed to their not being inured to it when young. They are naturally volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:022570_0201_0FB9944D235AE740"/>
have a ſprightly imagination, and an eaſy flow of words: for the ſake of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing ſuch agreeable talents, which they find command attention, they may inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently divulge a ſecret. But if early accuſtomed to reſtraint, and to the habit of making their mind the ſecure depoſit of a ſecret, there can be no doubt that it might be as perfectly ſafe with them, as with our ſex.</p>

                     <p>CURIOSITY is that propenſity to acquire knowledge, which leads children to inquire the names, properties, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of things; to refer appearances to cauſes; to ſort ideas, and diſtinguiſh truth. This deſire of knowledge operates power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in children, and is a moſt uſeful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of improvement. To ſtimulate and direct this affection, "which ſeems to be created by the affinity of external objects
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:022570_0202_0FB9944F790C6E60"/>
and the ſenſes affected by them," is an early and neceſſary branch of education. It was, therefore, a maxim with theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to indulge their children in aſking queſtions for information; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the exertion of this faculty by proper anſwers. To check theſe inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies by ſeverity, or pervert them by falſe, or evaſive anſwers, would be to ſtint a natural plant, which requires culture in order to bring it to perfection. Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſhould be anſwered according to their capacity; nor ſhould their ardor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with things be damped, by laughing at their ſimple queſtions. This would diſcourage them from aſking again, leſt their queſtion ſhould be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper one. By kindly attending to their queſtions, and giving them plain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible anſwers, their minds will be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarging; the anſwer to one queſtion will ſuggeſt to them another, and help their invention; at the ſame time it will add to their ſtock of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="unknown:022570_0203_0FB994541E5F92E0"/>BY neglecting this means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will be encouraged in negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and inattention. By receiving evaſive or deceitful anſwers, to get rid of the trouble of giving them the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſeek, art, diſſimulation, and falſehood will be cheriſhed. The great curioſity of children appears in their fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſtories; and the uſe which may be made of this appetite, appears from the deep impreſſions which idle and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtories of ghoſts and apparitions, make on the mind. Impreſſions favorable to virtue may be made with equal eaſe, by familiar ſtories founded on fact, and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote any of the virtues. Thoſe pictures of real characters; of virtues to be imitated, and vices to be avoided, are to be viewed as the beſt ſources of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and entertainment to children.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove uſed to ſelect a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the moſt ſtriking pictures of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice from the ſacred hiſtory, which ſhe dreſſed up in language ſuited to the capacities of the children: theſe,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:022570_0204_0FB9945584DF0A30"/>
they committed to memory and repeated to her, both for leſſons of virtue, and for the ſake of improvement in the art of ſpeaking. In this ſhe imitated Cornelia, the mother of the Roman Gracchi, who owed to her inſtruction that elocution by which the greateſt effects were produced.</p>
                     <p>AT the age of twelve, Oſander could not conceive of a greater pleaſure, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, than to hear his mamma re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the hiſtory of Joſeph with its various circumſtances. While the little boſom of Rozella heaves with grief for his fate, and the falling tear bedews her roſy cheek; Oſander's heart ſwells with indignation at the cruelty of his brothers, and melts at the generous treatment he afterwards ſhewed them when in diſtreſs; and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's gentle ſpirit cannot withhold the tear of ſympathy on the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>BY this ſingle ſtory, the love of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, juſtice, and fraternal kindneſs; and indignation againſt their oppoſites, are awakened in every breaſt. A deſire to imitate the one and avoid the other,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:022570_0205_0FB9945C9DDBC4B0"/>
glows in their hearts, while the relation goes on. Accuſtomed to have thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions excited by ſuch pictures preſented to the mind, they became fixed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent qualities. I know many mothers who take great pains to inſtruct their children in the knowledge of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to impreſs their minds with a reverence for them, by ſimilar methods. By theſe means they are preſented with the beſt models of virtue; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a pleaſing mode of inſtruction, and excites at the ſame time a love of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and as long as the curioſity is grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified, inſtruction will go on with rapidity, and the heart will be beguiled to virtue, and the affections directed to their proper objects.</p>

                     <p>"IN the nature of ſome individuals, ſays Lord Kaimes, there is a diſpoſition to cruelty. Strong ſymptoms of it appear
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:022570_0206_0FB9945E5FB55710"/>
in childhood, during which period there is nothing hid. It is not uncommon in a child, after careſſing its favorite puppy, to kick and beat it; or after ſtroking a ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to pull off its head. I have ſeen a little girl, after ſpending hours in dreſſing her doll, throw it out of the window in a ſudden fit. This diſeaſe is not eaſily cured, becauſe, like the king's evil, it is kept ſecret: I know of no cure ſo effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, as to inure a child of this temper, to objects of pity and concern. Such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects frequently preſented, and at proper times, may give a turn to the diſtemper, and make it yield to humanity. Such fits of cruelty, however, are far from being general. There are many children, who having no malice in their compoſition, are invariably kind to their favorites, and charitable to perſons in want."</p>
                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this appearance of cruelty in ſome children, and a ſmall degree of it in moſt, yet ſympathy is a native affection, which, for its ſtrength, may be ranked with the firſt claſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:022570_0207_0FB9945F3669BFA0"/>
propenſities. It is not only a ſtrong but a pleaſing affection, and requires to be cheriſhed with particular attention; for without this care it may be deſtroyed. There is in children a curioſity to ſee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imals ſlain, and a pleaſure in triumphing over their agonies, which has a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency upon the fine feelings of human nature. The ſpaſms which are brought on the expiring animal, by the approach of death, afford them ſport, not becauſe it feels pain, but becauſe of the novelty of the ſcene. They have no idea of thoſe emotions having any connexion with pain. They ſee the relentleſs exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner put his knife to the throat of an innocent lamb with as little concern, as a lady does her needle into a piece of gauze; and have, when quite young, no more idea of pain in one caſe than in the other. Horrid leſſon of cruelty to the young and tender mind! How eaſy and natural for children to transfer this into their own practice by tormenting the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle animals and inſects, which fall into

their hands? This, by a habit of hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becomes cruelty to their mates.</p>
                     <p>THE cruel diſpoſition, or deteſtable character, of Domitian, had been formed by his favorite amuſement of killing flies.</p>
                     <p>SOME have ſuppoſed that cruelty is the effect of the uſe of fleſh. This ſentiment is founded on a ſuppoſed difference, in this reſpect, between thoſe nations who uſe it, and thoſe who do not.</p>
                     <p>THE uſe of this ſubſtantial diet may probably be aſſigned as the phyſical cauſe of ſtrength and robuſtneſs of conſtitution; but this is not incompatible with tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:022570_0209_0FB99466E6CA6F68"/>
diſpoſition created by improper manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, derived from example, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by habit.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER, when a child, was kept from thoſe ſights which have a tendency to brutalize the mind. He was not ſuffered to read the hiſtory of battles, where the agreeableneſs of the narrative would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſlaughter a pleaſing ſcene; and, as hiſtory is principally occupied with ſuch relations, he read very little of it, until his judgment was conſiderably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. By ſometimes ſeeing objects of human diſtreſs, and frequently making the little excurſions already mentioned among the poor of the neighborhood, his ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy was kept alive and rendered more ſenſible. Rozella, who was all ſympathy, at about ſeven years of age, was riding with her mamma, and unfortunately they paſſed a farmer's yard, juſt as he was in the act of killing a lamb. Affrighted at the ſight, ſhe ſaid, "Mamma, what is that man doing with that poor little lamb?" "He is going, my dear, to kill it, to eat, I
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:022570_0210_0FB99468F3DBE4E8"/>
ſuppoſe." The reply was rather inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertent; for till now Rozella had never connected the idea of eating meat with the deſtruction of the animal. It was the ſubject of converſation all the way home, and it was a long time before the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſo effaced, as that ſhe would taſte it again.</p>
                     <p>SHE was permitted to have a bird, or a ſquirrel; and her brother to have a dog; only on condition that they would take care of them, and not let them ſuffer for want, or by abuſe. When they failed in a proper care and tenderneſs for them, they were reproved for being ſo unkind, and the animal taken away. They were never ſuffered to kill inſects for ſport. They did not, however, carry humanity to the ridiculous extreme, which is relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Bellarmine, a Romiſh ſaint, who is ſaid patiently to have ſuffered fleas and other vermin to prey upon him; ſaying, "We ſhall have a heaven to reward us for our ſufferings; but theſe poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have only the enjoyment of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

life." Inſects which uſually ſuffer death, for their preſumption in invading the houſes of mortals, their mamma taught them to ſweep out at the door, ſaying, "It is an innocent creature, my dear, do not hurt it; is not the world wide enough for you both?"</p>
                     <p>BY theſe leſſons, joined to he own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhe taught them tenderneſs towards every thing that has life. That tender feeling towards other's ſufferings, which, in its ſeveral degrees, extends itſelf to other animals of creation, from our fellow creature to the loweſt reptile, is a quality infinitely ſuperior to all the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt refined education. The knowledge and practice of this is a moſt uſeful part of domeſtic inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>IT has been remarked, I believe with great propriety, that young people, early corrupted, and addicted to debauchery, are inhuman and cruel. The heat of their conſtitution renders them impatient, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive, and impetuous: their imagination, engroſſed by one particular object, rejects
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:022570_0212_0FB9946E848F9E28"/>
every other: they have neither tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor pity, and would ſacrifice father, mother, and all the world, to the moſt trifling gratification. On the contrary, a youth, educated in ſimplicity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, is inclined to the tender paſſions by the firſt impulſe of nature. His ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic heart feels the ſufferings of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures: it leaps with joy at the unexpected ſight of a beloved companion. He is ſenſible of ſhame, for giving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; of regret, for having offended. Compaſſion, clemency, and generoſity, mark the ſenſibility of his heart, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the happieſt effects in ſociety.</p>

                     <head>LETTER XXXVI.</head>
                     <p>IT was a maxim with theſe worthy parents, that in every ſtage of domeſtic education, children ſhould be diſciplined to reſtrain their appetites and deſires. They thought, therefore, that they could not begin too early to check the deſire which children have for gewgaws and toys, and to accuſtom them to reſtraint and ſelf command. In order to do this effectually, it is neceſſary to preſerve that lively ſenſibility, and thoſe ſympathetic affections, of which I ſpake, in my laſt. The heart in which this delicate ſenſe is kept alive, will not be unyielding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and ſelf denial.</p>
                     <p>IN a world like this, and with paſſions like ours, what can be more uſeful and neceſſary, than the power of reſtraining our appetites? The objects of ſenſe which ſurround us on every ſide, are ſuited to awaken deſire, and deſire puſhes us on to gratification; but this cannot always be
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:022570_0214_0FB9947210335AA8"/>
attained. The preſervation of health and of tranquillity often forbid it, when in our power. And this is our ſituation through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life. Not a day paſſes, but we find occaſion to abridge our deſires, to deny ourſelves ſome gratification, and ſubmit to ſome inconvenience. To acquire an early habit of reſtraint muſt, therefore, be uſeful to us, as long as we are converſant with thoſe objects.</p>
                     <p>THIS command over ourſelves will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eaſy by cuſtom; and it will not be difficult to graft it on children, where proper authority has been ſupported. Parents are the natural guardians of their children, and their reaſon ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to control, reſtrain, and direct the appetites of childhood. Impelled by theſe, while reaſon, like the body, is feeble, they would gratify them to their injury, and by a habit of indulgence, would grow up with impetuous and dangerous propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Reſtraint ſhould never be laid merely to diſplay authority, but from the neceſſity of the caſe, and to habituate the child to ſubmiſſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="216" facs="unknown:022570_0215_0FB99475A5CE5458"/>TO croſs children, in things perfectly indifferent, has the appearance of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciouſneſs, and tend to chaſe and ſour their minds. Reſtraints, where they are indiſpenſable, ſhould be ſo laid, as rather to call off the mind from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than to prohibit the enjoyment. To maintain that entire control over the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of children, which is the parent's prerogative, ſo as not to induce diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the one hand, nor diſaffection on the other, is a critical point. When the parent, or the preceptor, becomes a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the child a ſlave, there is an end of all education.</p>
                     <p>IN laying reſtraints, therefore, ſome regard muſt be had to the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of children. Thoſe of a feeble, or ſlender make, require more indulgence, in their food, exerciſe, and in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are found neceſſary, than thoſe of a firm, robuſt habit of body. To pamper theſe with delicacies, merely to gratify appetite; to excuſe them from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, leſt it ſhould fatigue them; or, to
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:022570_0216_0FB99478E02FC2E8"/>
ſcreen them from juſt and neceſſary pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, thro ſoftneſs and lenity, is the direct way to ruin both health and morals. In both theſe reſpects, many a fine child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has been ruined by imprudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Inſtances are not wanting to ſhew, that the ſame effect may be produced from an oppoſite cauſe. Roughneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity with thoſe, whoſe languid ſpirits and feeble habit required that they ſhould be foſtered in the arms of pity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, have ſo depreſſed them, that they could not gain their proper rank in ſociety, nor hold up their heads in the face of the world.</p>
                     <p>THESE are extremes equally dangerous, and which require great caution; for that which would be lenity to the former, may be ſeverity with the latter. Parents, ſometimes, ſhew great partiality, among their children, on account of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form. While the beauty of the one procures a fond indulgence, the deformity, or even the plainneſs, of another, expoſes to ſlights and neglect. This is a ſpecies of
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:022570_0217_0FB9947AF6635700"/>
conduct no leſs cruel in the parent, than deſtructive to the children. In one it cheriſhes the ſeeds of vanity and inſolence; in the other, of melancholy and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement. An oppoſite treatment ought to be adopted, by ſhewing peculiar ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to the unfortunate.</p>
                     <p>IF children have natural defects, no pains ſhould be taken to ſecrete them. Such attempts would be teaching them diſſimulation, and would often expoſe them to the painful jokes of their mates, and the ſneerings of others. "Philope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the greateſt General of his age, was a man of mean appearance. He went, by invitation, to a dinner, in his camp dreſs, without a ſingle attendant. Being taken for one of the General's ſervants, he was ordered to the kitchen to cut logs for the fire. His friend, the landlord, ſeeing him in his waiſtcoat at that work, ſays, "Bleſs me, General, what are you doing here?" "I am paying for my bad looks," replied the General."</p>

                     <p>AND on the other hand, peculiar care ſhould be taken to guard againſt the ill effects, which too early an idea of their ſuperior external accompliſhments, is apt to produce in young people.

                     <p>I WILL now return to the reſtraints and ſelf command, to which children ſhould be early accuſtomed, and to the gentle manner in which Oſander and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zella were taught this leſſon. All reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſires were gratified with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; unreaſonable or improper requeſts were denied without any apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Children, when very young, will perceive the parent's uneaſineſs, if refuſed with doubt and heſitation; and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive encouragement from that ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, to renew their requeſt. Children have great ſagacity in this reſpect. They watch the parent's eyes, and obſerve the tone of voice; and fail not to make the beſt advantage of any irreſolution which they diſcover. If the requeſt is of ſuch a nature, that it cannot be granted, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it with a pleaſant, but firm tone. They ſay, in a ſedate manner, without any apparent concern, "You aſk, my dear, for that which is not proper: you
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:022570_0220_0FB99481B7976E18"/>
cannot have it." The child is no longer reſtleſs, when convinced of the impoſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of obtaining the object of its wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>I WAS preſent, ſeveral years ago, at the following ſcene—An elderly lady had the charge of a boy about twelve years old. He was a very active, enterpriſing lad, and glowed with ambition. A number of youth, older than himſelf, were going to have a riding match: they invited him to be of their party. He applied for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and was refuſed. He urged the requeſt with a variety of arguments, and they were all obviated by ſtronger reaſons. He ſtill purſued the ſuit, with increaſing vehemence. The danger of it was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him: he was told that a young lad had been thrown from a horſe, and had broken his arm. It all availed nothing, but to make him the more earneſt. He was then poſitively prohibited ſaying another word about it. The interdict was ſo peremptory, that it left no hopes of ſucceſs, and he went away as apparently ſatisfied as if his requeſt had been granted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="222" facs="unknown:022570_0221_0FB99486B081B980"/>TO clip the wings of fancy, and teach the romantic deſires to ſubmit to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of others in childhood, is a diſcipline moſt uſeful thro every ſtage of life. It prepares the child to be put under the conduct of its own reaſon, to bear croſſes and diſappointments, and to ſubmit to the authority of conſcience and of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. A young perſon, accuſtomed from infancy to reſtraint, will find no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in ſubmitting to the dictates of his own conſcience; and, by a habit of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſires, will be able to evade the force of any temptation. But if, as Mr. Locke obſerves, "the child muſt have grapes, or ſugar plumbs, when he has a mind to them; when grown up, muſt he not have his deſires ſatisfied too, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vices they may lead him? He who is not uſed to ſubmit his will to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of others, while he is young, will ſcarce hearken, or ſubmit to his own reaſon, when he is of an age to make uſe of it."</p>
                     <p>IT is a miſtake, fatal to education, which many have made, that children are
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:022570_0222_0FB99487B442F3B8"/>
happy in proportion as their wiſhes are gratified. I believe the reverſe to be true. We find, that, in manhood, an unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gratification of appetites is ſo far from ſatisfying, that they increaſe and gather ſtrength by indulgence. "If, ſaid Seneca, you ſeek to make one rich, ſtudy not to increaſe his ſtores, but to diminiſh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires." To Alexander, the fruit of all his conqueſts was tears; and whoever goes about to gratify intemperate wiſhes, will labor to as little purpoſe, as he who ſhould attempt to fill a ſieve with water. If you would ſatisfy the appetites of children, regulate them by your reaſon, and direct them by your prudence, allowing for their age. They acquire a habit of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after trifles, by falſe indulgence. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſtates have been ſquandered away on appetites, which were created by early indulgence; and become headſtrong, by repeated gratification. To indulge irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular fancies, in creatures deſtitute of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, muſt be deſtructive to ſelf command; without which there can be no virtue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="unknown:022570_0223_0FB9948A19D08D10"/>I ONCE was acquainted with a lady, whoſe parents had never laid any reſtraint on her paſſions or appetites in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but yielded to every idle fancy, until, on a bright evening, ſhe took it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her head to cry for the moon. The only reaſon that it was not granted, was the want of power in the parents. This fact they acknowledged after ſhe grew up; and they had reaſon to regret their folly on account of the peeviſh, reſtleſs diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it had created; and ſhe found this world a very inhoſpitable region for one, who could not ſubmit to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of living in it; for meeting perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually with objects to excite the fancy, and create deſires, without the power of grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifying them all, or of bearing the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of any, you will eaſily believe ſhe could not be very happy.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove was an affectionate mother, but not leſs faithful than affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate. She ſhewed the moſt expreſſive tenderneſs to her children when ſick; and ever indulged their deſires in health, as far
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:022570_0224_0FB9948C344D9660"/>
as, in her judgment, was proper. They were allowed to come to their parents with a reſpectful freedom, to make known their wants; but not to expreſs their idle or extravagant wiſhes. Oſander does not, like maſter Dickie, "cry to ride up to table on the ſirloin of roaſt beef." Nor does Rozella cry for the moon; but they aſk for any thing they need without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Before they could ſpeak, they were taught, by ſigns expreſſive of diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ceaſe crying, or craving any thing which they might not have: they were diſciplined to reſtraint when large enough to ſit at table, and to ſee a thing without wanting it. They were never hungry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw others eat, as is common with children of ungoverned appetites. At a plentiful table, like Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove's, their palates might eaſily have been made reſtleſs and inſatiable; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, as they were, to reſtraint, they never wanted ſomething elſe in preference to what was given them. They generally dined on one diſh, and appeared perfectly
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:022570_0225_0FB9948DB45E1508"/>
ſatisfied at relinquiſhing all the reſt. If they ſaw, at any time, children furniſhed with toys and gewgaws, and expreſſed any deſire for the like, their parents would ſpeak to them with great indifference of thoſe things, as of no kind of value. Theſe fine things, ſaid Mrs. Bloomſgrove, to her little daughter, may do for children who have no better qualities; but what a figure does a girl of twelve or thirteen years old make with fine feathers on a head that is deſtitute of knowledge? If you acquire the latter, you have leſs need of the former; and beſides, if children do not behave well, their finery only makes them appear the worſe; and thoſe who are good will not need gay things to recommend them: every body will eſteem and love them without thoſe ornaments.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT cloſe this, without obſerving to you the vaſt advantage to be derived from this habitual reſtraint, in point of government. Accuſtomed to govern themſelves, correction becomes a ſtrange work; each yields to order without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

the exerciſe of any authority, and ſeems perfectly free in an unconditional paſſive obedience. Hence ſpring peace and harmony as from their native ſoil.</p>

                     <p>IT is with families, as with ſtates; they have been too buſy with laws, and too remiſs in education. They contrive methods to puniſh, not to prevent crimes. But the Bloomſgrove family affords an exception from this general obſervation. The neceſſity of puniſhment was almoſt precluded by their mode of domeſtic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement. We cannot, therefore, draw many examples from it on this head.</p>
                     <p>I AM convinced, from the ſucceſs of their domeſtic diſcipline, that the uſual mode of government ſhould be inverted; and the paſſion, fear, which is commonly the firſt, become the laſt paſſion addreſſed by parental authority. Like the ULTIMA

RATIO REGUM, this ſhould be the laſt reaſoning of parents.</p>
                     <p>ON this ſubject my friend — writes me, that, from his own experience, he has found it as neceſſary to reward his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren for good, as to puniſh them for bad actions; that rewards are of immenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in ſtimulating them to induſtry, virtue, and good manners, "I was led," ſays he, "to adopt this practice, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the principles of action, in men, by which God governs his rational creatures." He goes on to explode cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral corrections, and to recommend ſolitude, with darkneſs, as the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual puniſhment that can be contrived for them. This he has uſed ſucceſsfully in his own family for many years. The duration of the confinement, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable circumſtances that are connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, are proportioned to the faults which are committed.</p>
                     <p>TOO much, he adds, cannot be ſaid in favor of ſolitude, as the means of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhould be the only end of all

puniſhment. Men are wicked only from inattention, or want of thinking. Inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, therefore, calls on them to "CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIDER THEIR WAYS."</p>
                     <p>THE moſt ſevere puniſhments, which human laws inflict, are light, compared with that of letting a man's conſcience looſe upon himſelf, in ſolitude. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, converſation, and even buſineſs, are the opiates of the ſpirit of God in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart. For this reaſon, a bad man ſhould be left in confinement for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, without any thing to employ his hands about.

                     <p>"THERE is, ſays Lord Kaimes, no branch of diſcipline that ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with more caution, than the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of rewards and puniſhments. If money, a fine coat, or what pleaſes the palate, be the reward promiſed; is it not the ready way to foment avarice, vanity, or luxury? Praiſe is an efficacious reward, or which even children are fond; and

Lying, I think, may be corrected, or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by proper management: my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it is, that it is not inherent in our nature, but forced upon a child by harſh treatment. Any fault, except obſtinacy, that a child can be guilty of, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by ſhame and diſgrace, which ſink deep into the heart of children, as well as of men and women. To keep children in awe, by the fear of corporal puniſhment, will put them upon hiding their faults, inſtead of correcting them."</p>
                     <p>IT was a maxim with Solomon, that "he who ſpares the rod ruins his child." Government muſt at all hazards be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; for no conſequences are to be feared, even from the ſevereſt exerciſe of
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:022570_0230_0FB9949CB7B03DA8"/>
government, equal to thoſe which may be apprehended from the neglect of it. But in a family conſiſting of ſeveral children, there is almoſt as great a variety of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, all of which it is neceſſary to meet with rewards or puniſhments ſuited to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence them. This will probably make as great a variety in the modes of application.</p>

                     <p>I BELIEVE it is a maxim with phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that preventives are the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients. If you can, by any means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom your children to acknowledge their faults, it will leſſen their number, and it will preclude the neceſſity of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment. This is the only caſe in which I think auricular confeſſion meritorious. This, tho a difficult part of education, is an important one, and may be effected by beginning early with them, and letting them find that a candid acknowledgement always procures abſolution. The fineſt
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:022570_0231_0FB994A0977A6428"/>
ſenſibility ſhould be cheriſhed in the young heart, with regard to right and wrong. This can be effected only by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing hurt and grieved, not angry, at their faults. If you are angry with a child for its faults and rave at it, you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the ſame paſſion in the child; and the ſame paſſion in oppoſite bodies, like the repellent power in matter, drives them from each other. But ſoften the heart by grief, and you will attract the child to you; and its faults will become ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, that it cannot retain them. Rozel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la broke a china ſaucer of her mamma's beſt ſet: the accident was known only to herſelf; ſhe hid the pieces to prevent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but felt very unhappy, and could find no relief but in a frank confeſſion. Her mamma ſays, "Your fault, my dear, lay in attempting to conceal what you had done; but your confeſſing it of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, deſerves more praiſe, than either the breaking, or concealing it deſerves blame." A frown, on this occaſion, would have been death to thoſe tender and generous
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:022570_0232_0FB994A322282400"/>
feelings, and have driven her to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling on a like occaſion in future.</p>
                     <p>WHAT, but harſhneſs and ſeverity, can obſtruct the confidence which affection to parents naturally leads children to place in them? Will children confeſs their faults, unleſs they can feel aſſured that an hone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> confeſſion will ſave them from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Will they not rather diſſemble, and do any thing to avoid a diſcovery, which involves in it the conſequences of a crime?</p>
                     <p>AMONG the various ways of training the children to confeſs their faults, the following appeared to Mrs. Bloomſgrove to be the moſt ſucceſsful. Returning home, after a viſit of a week or two, ſhe put each of her children to ſay, what good had been done by the other; and what ill itſelf had done. The former endeared them to one another, the latter reſtrained them from committing faults. Theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſhe made the ſubject of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and endeavored to ripen their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by ſhewing them what was right and what was wrong in their conduct.
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:022570_0233_0FB994A43B537830"/>
But ſhe was careful to provide a truſty perſon, to inform her of any fault that had been concealed. In that caſe ſhe would ſay to the child, "Surely, my dear, you have a bad memory, did you not do ſo and ſo?" The child thinks it in vain to attempt hiding of it; for, "Mamma knows every thing." Stern authority is ſuitable only for the obſtinate and petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant; but advice and remonſtrance will be a better corrector of other faults. Children may often be put into a way of correcting their own faults, or of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily confeſſing them. "A young girl, aged eleven, having accidentally hurt her finger, ſhewed ſome degree of impatience. The governeſs, having in vain endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhame her out of it, left the room with a reproachful look, ſaying, that ſhe could not bear to ſee ſuch concern for a trifle. In leſs than an hour, ſhe received a billet from her pupil, acknowledging her miſbehavior, and intreating to be forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. The young lady owes much of this pliancy of temper to an affectionate moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:022570_0234_0FB994A5C1F795F8"/>
whoſe high ſtation has not made her relax from attending to the education of her children, with a degree of prudence and ſagacity, that would give luſtre to a perſon much inferior in rank."</p>
                     <p>STUBBORNNESS will be ſcarcely known, where a proper authority has been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the beginning; but will ſoon appear in ſome children, where that is not exerciſed. "Mr. Locke mentions a lady whoſe daughter was nurſed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. She found the child ſo ſtubborn, as to be forced to whip it eight times, before it was ſubdued. This was the firſt and laſt time of laying a hand upon it. Ever after, it was all compliance and obedience. This ought to be a leſſon to parents never to relax the reins of government.

                     <p>YOURS and mine, is a language we very early hear from children. They feel their right to what they poſſeſs, long before they can be made to underſtand the origin and foundation of property, by reaſoning about it, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Rouſſeau teaches Emilius, by their dialogue with Robert the gardener. The ſenſe of right and wrong, of yours and mine, ariſes from the nature and relation of man. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of poſſeſſing is much more powerful in childhood than this ſenſe. Happy for the world, had it been confined to that period! But for want of proper culture in childhood and youth, this ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dormant with many. Hence thoſe invaſions of one another's property; and interferences of intereſt, which cauſe ſo much diſturbance in the world.</p>
                     <p>"AS ſociety depends, in a great meaſure, on the ſenſe of property, neglect no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to fortify that ſenſe in your children. Make them ſenſible, that it is a

great wrong to take what belongs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other." It ſhould be conſidered that their poſſeſſions are as dear and valuable to them, as thoſe of grown people. If they are ſuffered to invade the property of others, however trifling, there is danger that it will grow into a habit of injuſtice. They ſhould be made to reſtore the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, with ſuch reproof, or puniſhment, as the nature and aggravation of the caſe may require. No tranſgreſſion of this nature is ever ſuffered to paſs unnoticed by the parents of Oſander and Rozella. They remonſtrate againſt ſuch actions, and endeavor to convey to the feelings of the child, a ſenſe of the wrong done, by reaſoning with it in this way—What right have you to what you have taken? Does it not belong to your ſiſter? How would you like it, if ſhe was to get away your things? Can you not be contented with what is your own? Tho the child cannot comprehend the idea of injuſtice, yet it can feel the force of this application. And, indeed, very little underſtanding in

                     <p>THE evening was ſerene, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to walk. The ſweet fragrance of the blooming flowers embalm the air, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring health. Pleaſures breathe thro the bending wood; exhale from the fair boſom of the floods, and ſwell with the nightingale's melodious note, while Mr. and Mrs. Bloomſgrove, accompanied by their children and Fanny, walk in the gravel way. The pale glimmering moon-beams,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:022570_0238_0FB994B0DA8A4BD8"/>
ſtealing thro the opening foliage, ſoftened all their feelings. The ſerenity of the ſky, the ſoftneſs of the air, and the many glittering objects around, inſpired a placid cheerfulneſs, which opened the heart to the moſt ſenſible delight. A cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which added much to the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the evening was, they had all dined at Mr. Bloomſgrove's father's that day, being the birth day of Rozella, who now commenced her thirteenth year.</p>
                     <p>HER grand papa and grand mamma were no leſs delighted with her ſprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, her reſpectful and pleaſing manners, and the manly conduct of Oſander, than their parents. The union of three gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations in convivial entertainment, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the heart of the aged, and taught them to bend to the manners of the young; while theſe, in turn, endeavored to repay ſuch goodneſs by reverence and attention, united to ſportive pleaſures. A day which renewed the age of ſixty in that of thirteen, could not be paſſed without the utmoſt enjoyment. I do not relate the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:022570_0239_0FB994B1C40E1DD0"/>
circumſtance of their dining together as an uncommon thing; but this being the birth day of Rozella, which raiſed her to A MISS IN HER TEENS, afforded peculiar pleaſure; and it drew forth from her grand mamma ſome ſparkling touches of humor, for which ſhe had formerly been celebrated, and by which ſhe pleaſantly conveyed inſtruction to her grand child. The dinner was compoſed of every thing good which the ſeaſon afforded; was ſerved up in an elegant ſimplicity of ſtyle; and the day paſſed in great conviviality, and good humor. After returning home, they paſſed the evening in the gravel walk. Fanny makes her obſervations on the pleaſures of ſociety, and eſpecially on the enjoyment of family circles, where all is harmony and friendſhip. Rozella prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles about grand mamma's good puddings and pies, wonders if ſhe ſhall ever look as old as grand mamma, and repeats many of her pleaſant and ſenſible ſpeeches. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander wonders if grand papa ever read all the books in his library, and thinks that if
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:022570_0240_0FB994B3F4CDAF58"/>
he has, his head is like a full moon, which reflects its light every where. Fanny en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpiritedly into their chat, and gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols with them on the green. Pleaſure ſparkles in the parents' eyes as they walk, and ſee the ſportive mirth of their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful family.</p>
                     <p>THE evening being cloſed, they return to offer praiſes, on the domeſtic altar, to that Almighty Being who guards the dwellings of the juſt, and is the friend of the faithful. Having committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the care of his providence, they retire to reſt with full confidence in his paternal protection. All is huſh—a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence reigns thro the manſion. Sweet, balmy ſleep had chaſed away the events of the paſt, rendered them uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the preſent, and unapprehenſive of the future. But, hark! A commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned meſſenger arrives—a ſudden and loud rap awakes the whole houſe—Mr. Bloomſgrove haſtily ariſes; and, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the window, inquires who is there. He is informed that a violent illneſs has
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:022570_0241_0FB994BB275B1A90"/>
ſeized his mother; that the phyſician thinks her ſymptoms threatening, and that ſhe deſires to ſee him and Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove as ſoon as may be. They haſten to the houſe, where feſtivity had prevailed the day before, to diſcharge the duties of filial piety.</p>
                     <p>IT will not be neceſſary to relate the minute circumſtances that took place on this occaſion, and the general alarm it ſpread thro the family. Suffice it to ſay, that they loſt no time to ſee ſo worthy a parent. The violence of the diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the morning; when ſhe deſired to ſee the children, and Fanny, whom ſhe numbered among them. They were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent for, and a deluge of tears ſucceeded their entrance into the room. The old lady recovered from the firſt ſhock, which the ſight of thoſe dear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects gave, and was able to adminiſter the moſt ſalutary advice. She appeared per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſigned to the will of the ſupreme diſpoſer of events. She ſpake of death with an unaffected firmneſs, as caſt in the
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:022570_0242_0FB994BCF56F61E0"/>
milder light of friend by the Chriſtian revelation, which ſoftens that grim viſage to the fair form of an angel, the meſſenger of peace.</p>
                     <p>HOW intereſting the ſcene! the parent of a numerous progeny, with a countenance rendered ſerene and venerable by piety and age, giving them her laſt advice, her part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bleſſing; the children and deſcendants adminiſtering the proper cordial to old age, by the tender hand of filial affection. Neither the native firmneſs of mind, nor the high rank in life which Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove held, leſſened his affection for a mother whom he had every reaſon to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate; nor did he omit any attention in his power, to render the cloſing ſcene comfortable. In this he imitated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Solomon, who, tho a KING, did not loſe the reſpect of a child; but roſe from his throne, and bowed himſelf, when his mother came to him with a requeſt. This ſickneſs gave them an opportunity to exhibit an example of filial piety, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and reverence, which made a

laſting impreſſion on the minds of their children.</p>
                     <p>THE diſorder continued, with various ſymptoms, ſeveral days, until feeble na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture became exhauſted, and ſhe gently ſunk down into ſoft ſlumbers; leaving to the young a ſtriking inſtance of the ſerene evening, which ſucceeds the virtuous morning of life. Here was one of the moſt beautiful and intereſting ſcenes you can conceive of! dutiful and affectionate children, ſurrounding the dying bed of a parent with unfeigned grief; and with reſpectful mourning, following her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to the grave; and recording in their faithful memories the debt of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude they owed to parental care and love:

                     <p>A PLEASING melancholy for a while pervaded the houſe, and caſt in ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening ſhades the illuſtrious qualities of its poſſeſſors. They failed not to improve the ſorrowful incident to moral and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious purpoſes. The ſudden tranſition from joy to ſorrow; from health and feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, to ſickneſs and death, afforded ſcope for many an uſeful leſſon of inſtruction. And as they had trained their children to ſubmit to the ills of life, ſo they exhibited an example of it on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>HITHERTO education has been carried on more by phyſical influence, than by the light of underſtanding in the pupil. The period is now arrived, in which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon begins to unfold more lively colors, and will bear a more active part in the future management of the children. Placing ourſelves on this boundary line between childhood and youth, we can look back and ſurvey, at a ſingle glance, the progreſs of education in infancy and
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:022570_0245_0FB994C53A846478"/>
childhood; but looking forward thro the devious paths of youth, an infinite variety and boundleſs proſpects open before us. To analyze this period of education, ſo that each part may be diſtinctly viewed, and no one paſs unnoticed, is not an eaſy taſk. The daughter is to be trained in the line of her ſex, and prepared to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to the beſt advantage, in the world, which will employ all the prudence and good ſenſe of the mother. And the ſon, to be brought forward in the higher branches of learning, and to be educated in ſuch a manner, as will beſt prepare him for uſefulneſs and happineſs in life.</p>
                     <p>BUT you will recollect that domeſtic memoirs, and not a treatiſe on ſchool learning, is our object. However the latter may be neglected, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to parents, and is properly of the domeſtic kind, is, perhaps, much more ſo. In ſchools we look for little elſe than the culture of the underſtanding; at home we are to look for the culture of the heart. If parents were as ſolicitous to do
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:022570_0246_0FB994C6BA67C840"/>
their duty in this reſpect, as they are to have teachers of ſchools do theirs, it would redound much to the honor of human nature, and the happineſs of their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. But where the underſtanding has been improved to the greateſt degree of perfection, the cultivation of the heart has been ſurpriſingly neglected. Now is the ſeaſon for the cultivation of both head and heart in our young pupils.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER was to have been ſent abroad to ſchool about this time, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for a public education; but the event of his grand mamma's death detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him beyond the intended period. In order to ſupply the place of his ſon, in ſome meaſure, Mr. Bloomſgrove invited a nephew, who had juſt finiſhed his aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic ſtudies, to reſide at his houſe. This nephew was a worthy youth, but had ſuffered much by being ſent abroad too young. Science he had acquired; but very little attention had been paid to the regulation of the heart. Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove ſoon diſcovered the diſeaſe and the
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:022570_0247_0FB994CA89E7B0B8"/>
cauſe of it. He ſaw that his nephew had been under preceptors, who conſidered not the culture of the heart as any part of their buſineſs; and, tho furniſhed with grammar rules, yet moral principles, which are uſeful in every part and ſtation of life, had not been inſtilled into his mind. This turned Mr. Bloomſgrove's thoughts into a new channel with reſpect to his ſon.</p>
                     <p>HE perceived that his nephew, whoſe paſſions were warm, but had a heart ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of any impreſſions, had been governed by the exerciſe of power, not by perſuaſion; that he had been taught by dry rules, but not according to nature. Authority, indeed, is indiſpenſable; and general rules, where there is a number of youth, cannot be avoided. But the ſeat of empire ſhould be the heart; and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral rules ſhould be made to bend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances, as far as may be, without endangering government, and making youth unſteady.</p>

                        <pb n="249" facs="unknown:022570_0248_0FB994CC9D2DCD88"/>THE noble writer of "Hints on Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" has propoſed ſeveral weighty objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt ſending a ſon abroad to a public ſchool, until ſufficiently prepared at home to reſiſt temptation. He diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of the government and method of inſtruction, uſed in the public ſchools in England. I believe, however, that the modern practice of many preceptors, in America, is leſs exceptionable. The current of his obſervations leads him to recommend a private tutor in preference to a public ſchool. This plan may do in England, where many an opulent family may employ as many needy ſcholars in the capacity of private tutors; but agrees not ſo well with the abilities of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. "Regular hours, at ſchool, of reading and diverſion, have a woful effect. Children, after a painful leſſon, are let out to play. Their time being circumſcribed, appears always too ſhort. From the height of amuſement, they are forced back to a dry leſſon. Can it be expected, that in ſuch a ſtate of mind, they will liſten to

ſerious inſtruction? Let them play, let them fatigue themſelves: guard only againſt ſauntering. When ſufficiently tired, lead them back, with a cheerful countenance, to a leſſon, as a change of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement. This is agreeable to human nature." This, the writer obſerves, can be put in practice only by a private tutor. I think that ſomething ſimilar might be practiſed in our public ſchools; that is, the exerciſes may be ſo varied, as to have the air of novelty. In a public ſchool, it is impoſſible that the youth ſhould be ſo conſtantly under the preceptor's eye, as is requiſite at that age. "Hence, ſays he, it is in a meaſure eſſential, that a young man be well tutored, in morals at leaſt, before he is left to himſelf, among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of young men of different diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions."</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove, obſerving that his nephew, who was naturally of a mild, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpoſition, had acquired a forwardneſs improper for his age, and an impatience of reſtraint, to which he had not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed;
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:022570_0250_0FB994D2ABB77B88"/>
that he aſſumed an high tone; and, in ſhort, that he had imbibed ſeveral of the ill qualities of the different boys with whom he had aſſociated, was convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the neceſſity of keeping his ſon much longer under his own eye. Altho his nephew had not ſo deviated from the paths of innocence and virtue, but that his prudent management cured him, in a little time, of all the ill habits he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; yet he choſe not to venture his ſon from his own hands, until his morals were formed and well eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>TO this end, ſeveral families, agreeing in their common views, aſſociated to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the inſtruction of their children; and placed a tutor in a ſituation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the pupils, and to accompany them in literary purſuits and playful excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>THE neceſſity and utility of general knowledge to the public, and eſpecially to the United States of America, are expreſſed in terms, juſt and ſtrong, by that renowned patriot and truly learned politician, The Vice Preſident of theſe ſtates.</p>
                           <p>"THE inſtruction of the people, in every kind of knowledge that can be of uſe to them in the practice of their moral duties, as men, citizens, and Chriſtians, and of their political and civil duties, as members of ſociety and freemen, ought to be the care of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and of all who have any ſhare in the conduct of its affairs, in a manner that never yet has been practiſed in any age or nation. The education here intended, is not merely that of the children of the rich, but of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery rank and claſs of people, down to the pooreſt.</p>
                           <p>"IT is not ſo much to ſay, that ſchools for the ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation of all ſhould be placed at convenient diſtances, and maintained at public expenſe. The revenues of the ſtate would be applied infinitely better, more char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itably, wiſely, uſefully, and therefore politically, in this way, than even in maintaining the poor. This would be the beſt way of preventing the exiſtence of the poor.</p>
                           <p>"IF nations ſhould ever be wiſe, inſtead of erecting thouſands of uſeleſs offices, or engaging in unmeaning wars, they will make a fundamental maxim of this, that no human being ſhall grow up in ignorance.

purpoſe, in the centre of a beautiful green, where all concerned might have an equal advantage; and, while the tutor conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the paths of literature, he was able to ſecond their parent's exertions, to cultivate the moral qualities of the heart. By this kind of ſchool they were not only

able to attend to their children, but to preſerve their affections. Another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage aroſe from the expedient. The ſame perſon who attended the boys, taught the young miſſes writing, arithmetic, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography, grammar, and the belles lettres.</p>
                     <p>IT was not till the inſtitution of this ſchool, that Mr. Bloomſgrove diſcovered
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:022570_0253_0FB994D8B4311968"/>
that his ſon had rather an averſion to claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ſtudies. For altho he had attended a grammar ſchool before, and, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the wiſhes of his papa, had made conſiderable progreſs in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, yet he had no love for theſe ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies. He loved books; but the dry ſtudy of Latin and Greek hung as a dead weight upon his active genius, and gave diſguſt rather than pleaſure. This averſion had been increaſed by the dull round, in which he had been plodding at the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ſchool; committing to memory long leſſons in a language he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and dry rules of which he knew no uſe.</p>
                     <p>MISANDER, the ſon of a reſpectable farmer, who attended the ſame ſchool, had neither genius nor taſte; and yet parental pride or partiality induced his father to think of an univerſity education.

<pb n="255" facs="unknown:022570_0254_0FB994DBD726CDB8"/>
ought? The child of ſmall abilities, and ſlow of apprehenſion, is often condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, contrary to reaſon and nature, thro a long courſe of ſevere diſcipline, to ſome profeſſional purſuit in life, in which he can never excel, becauſe he has neither taſte nor abilities for it. Another with ſhining talents, and an unconquerable thirſt for literature, will be cramped in his education; the plants of nature will be ſtinted, and the youth deſtined to ſome occupation for which he has no taſte, and in which native genius can make no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions.</p>
                     <p>THE watchful parent, who carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the gradual unfoldings of nature, will be able pretty accurately to diſcover the mould in which the mind is caſt, and what mode of education will be moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for it. Thoſe powers he will endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to draw forth and cheriſh, in that way which nature ſeems to point out: this will render them moſt uſeful, when brought to maturity. The modes of inſtruction and education ſhould be accommodated to the
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:022570_0255_0FB994DE68D2CE40"/>
caſt of the mind, without reference to any preconcerted plan. Miſander was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined from the cradle to the college, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to his abilities or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the conſequences of which we ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
                     <p>THE education of Oſander is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in the path of nature. Therefore his preceptor was deſired to let him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thoſe ſtudies, to which he ſeemed moſt inclined; making uſe of the claſſics only as an interlude, to diverſify the ſcene. Mr. Bloomſgrove hoped, by theſe means, his ſon would acquire a reliſh for them. This hope was excited by the love which he himſelf had for the literature of the ancients. As he advanced in life, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced more and more of the pleaſures of knowledge; and nothing could be more natural than to wiſh his ſon to taſte the ſame pleaſures. To a man who delights in books and contemplation, ſolitude can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be irkſome; nor will this ſource of entertainment, like moſt others, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by age.</p>

                     <p>TO cheriſh in the heart moral ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and engage youth to the practice of prudential virtues, you allow to be a matter of the higheſt importance. "But how, you aſk, is this to be effected?" I conceive it, my dear ſir, to be a thing practicable, however difficult it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The ſucceſs of this attempt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends more on obſerving the operations of human nature in various individuals, and the particular temper of the children to be taught, than on any dry rules. Mankind are formed with a diverſity of paſſions and inclinations. But it uſually happens that ſome one of theſe predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates over all the others, or, as was the caſe in ſome periods of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, there are two which bare ſway alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. This appears in childhood. Some children you early perceive to be proud and haughty; others, modeſt and diffident: ſome, warm and paſſionate; others, cool and gentle: ſome, obſtinate
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:022570_0257_0FB994E1E6673CE0"/>
and tenacious; others, ſoft and flexible: ſome, covetous and ſelfiſh; others, liberal and benevolent. When I ſpeak of theſe natural paſſions, and the difference in the ſtrength of them, I only mean that there is an aptneſs in the objects about us to touch ſome of thoſe ſprings of action more forcibly than others; and that different perſons will be variouſly affected by the ſame objects.</p>
                     <p>THESE propenſities exiſt, in a degree, in all men; but that which predominates, or has the greateſt facility in being affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſurrounding objects, marks the character of the man. As the ſeeds of thoſe paſſions which diſtinguiſh men in the public walks of life, are ſown in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the prudent parent will keep a ſtrict watch over that which appears to predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate. Againſt this will he will direct the full force of reproof, counſel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. He will, by prudent and ſteady management, check and control this maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſion; and will find that all the others will yield of courſe. This will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

him to inſtil thoſe virtuous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into his children, which form their principal glory and happineſs in life.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove was careful to impreſs on the minds of his children, maxims of prudence, reſolution, and induſtry. In order to draw their attention, and excite the love of theſe qualities, he gave them an example from the economy of Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Ceſar, Emperor of Rome; and of the induſtry of his wife Livia, and his ſiſter Octavia, who ſpun all the clothes the Emperor wore: of "Scipio, the glory of Rome, and terror of Carthage, who dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his garden with his own hands: and of the venerable old ſenator, Fabricius, illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious by many triumphs, who ſupped on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the herbs he himſelf had raiſed." Theſe were examples of ſocial and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic virtues, very uſeful to the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and they derived great force from the illuſtrious characters who exhibited them.</p>
                     <p>SENSIBLE that happineſs does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſo much on the quantity of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:022570_0259_0FB994EB11EF3B78"/>
as on the manner of acquiring it, and the uſe to which it is applied; he was eſpecially careful to inſpire his ſon with magnanimity; with ſentiments of truth, juſtice, temperance, moderation, contentment, and all thoſe ſubſtantial vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which add dignity to human nature, elevate the ſoul to its proper rank, and form the welfare of ſociety. Succeſs in eſtabliſhing theſe eſſential virtues in the mind, depends much on preſerving it from meanneſs and duplicity: theſe are not native qualities, but the effect of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management, and the occaſion of many vices.</p>

                     <p>AS children are naturally candid, Mr. Bloomſgrove found it not only prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, but a pleaſant taſk to keep them ſo. He ſhewed them the beauty of this temper, by relating examples of it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny celebrated characters. Eſpecially an
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:022570_0260_0FB994EC34CA2130"/>
inſtance of it in the Mariſchal de Turenne, who, when he commanded in Germany, was offered a conſiderable ſum by a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral city, to march another way. "I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accept of it, ſaid the Mariſchal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do not intend to take the road to your city."</p>
                     <p>CHILDREN who are taught to be frank and candid, if they find they can always be ſo without danger, will never think of diſſembling, but when they are conſcious of having done wrong; and then, if they find as much ſecurity, and more comfort, in confeſſing, than in diſſembling, they will be candid and honeſt. Candor is the baſis of friendſhip and mutual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It ſecures the good will of others; is the ſweetener of ſociety, and endears men even to their enemies; and a high degree of it is inconſiſtent with the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any vice.</p>
                     <p>THERE is a meanneſs which ſometimes appears in children, that does not belong to nature; it is either caught from exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or inſpired by injudicious manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:022570_0261_0FB994EDD78BEC70"/>
This is ſometimes the effect of too great ſeverity; their ſpirits are broken by too great reſtraint, and they become ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. In others, it may ariſe from having the views croſſed, and the purſuits check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where there has been an unconquerable thirſt for ſome particular object. From whatever cauſe it may ariſe, the effect is moſt unhappy. It damps that noble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of mind which is a ſpring to worthy actions, and ſhould be cheriſhed with great care.</p>
                     <p>"EMULATION, inh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rent in the nature of man, appears ever in children: they ſtrive for victory, without knowing what makes them ſtrive. Emulation, kept within proper bounds, is an uſeful princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and far from being unſociable; it becomes only ſo, when it degenerates into envy. Approbation is beſtowed on thoſe who behave well; but in ſtruggling for victory, the proſpect of being approved is a very faint motive compared with emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thro the force of that incitement, a young man will perſevere in acquiring

knowledge, who, without it, would have made no progreſs."</p>
                     <p>THE ſame is true of making advances in virtuous qualities. The deſire of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling others muſt be kept awake, and fanned by education, or the progreſs will be ſlow. Oſander ſtrives to acquire as much knowledge, and as good a character, as his couſin. Rozella endeavors to equal Fanny in the gentleneſs of her manners; aad wiſhes to be as old as her mamma, that ſhe may do as much good, and make as many poor folks happy as ſhe does.

                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove omitted no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable opportunity of inſtilling into the
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:022570_0263_0FB994F542EF4FF0"/>
minds of his children, that a man ſhould be regarded in proportion to the good he does. There cannot be a more uſeful leſſon of inſtruction to the young mind than this. Dazzled with the glitter and pageantry of the gay world, young people are too apt to reſpect a man according to the wealth he poſſeſſes, and the external ſhow he makes; and to emulate thoſe qualities, while real virtues, which make no ſplendid figure, are overlooked or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. Deluded by theſe appearances, they form their judgment of men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſplendor, and not the merit of actions.</p>
                     <p>"ALEXANDER demanded of a pirate, whom he had taken, by what right he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the ſeas? 'By the ſame right,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, boldly, 'that you enſlave the world. But I am called a robber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have only one ſmall veſſel; and you are ſtyled a conqueror, becauſe you command great ſleets and armies." A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the falſe maxims and ſentiments which too commonly prevail, Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:022570_0264_0FB994F6C52064A8"/>
guarded his children; teaching them that the diſtinction between high and low, rich and poor, is nothing in compariſon with that which ariſes from the different degrees of uſefulneſs in the world; that the honeſt, induſtrious farmer who trains his children to be uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety, is more worthy of reſpect, than the moſt wealthy who regards not the poverty or diſtreſſes of his neighbor, while he gratifies all his own expenſive fancies. He accuſtomed them to bridle their love of pleaſure; and endeavored to initiate them into the true ſecret of worldly felicity; ſhewing them that it conſiſted in the ſuitableneſs of a perſon's ſituation to his natural taſte; in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate uſe of the enjoyments of life; in doing good to others, and in making ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery condition and circumſtance in life ſubſervient to the intereſts of virtue.</p>
                     <p>CERTAIN it is, that happineſs conſiſts in being of a quiet, peaceful mind, and not in ſonorous titles, nor extenſive poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. To exalt and elevate the mind,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:022570_0265_0FB994F835B2A888"/>
therefore, was his object, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heating the imagination; to inſpire cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and firmneſs, without kindling the fire of ambition into an unhallowed flame. He was more ſolicitous to make his ſon a good, than a great man. It is vanity that makes moſt people prefer ſhining and dangerous qualifications to the more retired and milder virtues: the latter are the only qualities which can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the repoſe and happineſs of life.</p>
                     <p>ALTHO he had every thing to build upon which anceſtry in America could give, yet he carefully inſtilled into his children this idea, that perſonal merit was what they ſhould attend to, without refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to anceſtors. Often would he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to them, in a winter evening, or in a leiſure hour after dinner, the ſpeech of Gaius Marius to the Romans, in which he ſhewed the abſurdity of their conduct in heſitating to confer on him the rank of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, on account of his deſcent.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>"I HAVE, continues he, from my youth, been familiar with toils and dangers. I was faithful to your intereſt, my countrymen, when I ſerved you for no reward but that of honor. It is not my deſign to betray you now, that you have conferred upon me a place of profit. You have committed to my conduct the war in Jugurtha. The Patricians are offended at this. But, where would be the wiſdom of giving ſuch a command to one of their honorable body? a perſon of illuſtrious birth, of ancient family, of innumerable ſtatues, but—of no experience? What ſervice could his long line of dead anceſtors, or his multitude of motionleſs ſtatues, do his country in the day of battle? What could ſuch a general do, but, in his trepidation, have recourſe to ſome inferior commander for direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in difficulties to which he was not himſelf equal? Thus your Patrician general would in fact have a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral over him; ſo that the commander would ſtill be a Plebeian. So true is this, my countrymen, that I have, myſelf, known thoſe, who have been choſen conſuls, begin then to read the hiſtory of their own country, of which, till that time, they were totally ignorant; that is, they firſt obtained the employment, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themſelves of the qualifications neceſſary for the proper diſcharge of it.</p>
                           <p>"I SUBMIT to your judgment, Romans, on which ſide the advantage lies, when a compariſon is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Patrician haughtineſs and Plebeian experience. The very actions, which they have only read, I have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, and partly myſelf atchieved. What they know by reading, I know by action. They are pleaſed to ſlight my mean birth: I deſpiſe their mean characters. Want of birth and fortune is the objection againſt me; want of perſonal worth againſt them. But are not all men of the ſame ſpecies! What can make a difference between one man and another, but the endowments of the mind? For my part, I ſhall always look upon the braveſt man as the nobleſt man. Suppoſe it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the fathers of ſuch Patricians as Albinus and Baſtia, whether, if they had their choice, they would deſire ſons of their character or mine? What would they anſwer, but that they ſhould wiſh the worthieſt to be their ſons? If the Patricians have reaſon to deſpiſe me, let them likewiſe deſpiſe their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, whoſe nobility was the fruit of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Do they envy the honors beſtowed upon me? let them envy likewiſe, my labors, my abſtinence, and the dangers I have undergone for my country, by which I have acquired them. But thoſe worthleſs men lead ſuch a life of inactivity, as if they deſpiſed any honors you can beſtow; while they aſpire to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, as if they had deſerved them by the moſt induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious virtue. They lay claim to the rewards of activ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, for their having enjoyed the pleaſures of luxury. Yet none can be more laviſh than they are in praiſe of their anceſtors: and they imagine they honor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by celebrating their forefathers; whereas they do the very contrary: for as much as their anceſtors were diſtinguiſhed for their virtues, ſo much are they diſgraced by their vices. The glory of anceſtors caſts a light, indeed, upon their poſterity; but it only ſerves to ſhew what the deſcendants are. It alike exhibits to public view their degeneracy and their worth. I own I cannot boaſt of the deeds of my forefathers; but I hope I may anſwer the cavils of the Patricians, by ſtanding up in defence of what I have done myſelf.</p>
                           <p>"OBSERVE now, my countrymen, the injuſtice of the Patricians. They arrogate to themſelves honors on account of the exploits done by their forefathers, while they will not allow me the due praiſe for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſame ſort of actions in my own perſon. He has no ſtatues, they cry, of his family. He can trace no venerable line of anceſtors. What then? Is it matter of more praiſe to diſgrace one's illuſtrious anceſtors, than to become illuſtrious by one's own good behavior? What if I can ſhew no ſtatues of my fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily? I can ſhew the ſtandards, the armor, and the trappings, which I have myſelf taken from the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. I can ſhew the ſcars of thoſe wounds, which I have received by facing the enemies of my country. Theſe are my ſtatues. Theſe are the honors I boaſt of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not left me by inheritance, as theirs; but earned by toil, by abſtinence, by valor; amidſt clouds of duſt, and ſeas of blood; ſcenes of action, where the effem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate Patricians, who endeavor by indirect means to depreciate me in your eſteem, have never dared to ſhew their faces."</p>

                     <p>OSANDER and Rozella, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained from nature and fortune every advantage which can be derived from them. Every thing which educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can add to theſe may be expected from the care of their parents. Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious

of any merit from their own rank and fortune, they treat every one with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability and reſpect. Their parents never flattered them with any ideas of ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of rank; but taught them that all juſt claims to ſuperiority were founded in real excellence and perſonal merit.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove ſpoke ſlightly of dreſs before her daughter.—"Gay dreſs,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:022570_0268_0FB995013459E6B8"/>
ſhe obſerved, is ſeldom neceſſary, and ſhould never come into competition with the improvements of the mind; that dreſs may ſerve to recommend a female among ſtrangers, but that a plain dreſs is more becoming a young lady of known excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and that a flaunting dreſs only
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:022570_0269_0FB995072132C780"/>
derogates from her character. She did not mean, by theſe leſſons, to depreſs the ſprightly mind of Rozella, nor to hurt her taſte in dreſs, but to prevent any thing finical, and to elevate her mind to more ſuitable objects.</p>
                     <p>IN order to guard Oſander from being led aſtray by his ſtrong and lively paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:022570_0270_0FB99508B7DB1280"/>
Mr. Bloomſgrove takes every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to teach him how to gain an empire over himſelf; and to inſpire him with a deſire to diſtinguiſh himſelf, not by borrowed or ſuperficial qualities, but by the gentleneſs of his temper, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of his ſoul. Ideas like theſe, graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the young mind, will lay a ſure foundation for future good conduct. The ardor of his ſpirits, under ſuch culture, will exalt his ſentiments, and add delicacy to his manners. His ambition will nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſuffer him to be guilty of baſe actions, becauſe it is directed to noble objects. Eager to be at the head of the liſt among his mates, and deſirous of the approbation of his father, he will be ready to ſacrifice every other pleaſure to that of deſerving and obtaining a good name.</p>
                     <p>THIS mode of education, you will ſay, may be proper for a youth of ſuch lively ſpirits as Oſander; you may warm his imagination and elevate his mind. But what is to be done with ſuch an one as Miſander? He is a youth of confined
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:022570_0271_0FB9950A3422DCE0"/>
ideas; is capricious in his temper, and has no aſpirings of mind towards great objects. To excite a degree of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be neceſſary, but the particular mode of treatment muſt be adapted to the natural character and diſpoſition of the youth.</p>
                     <p>MISANDER might have been, in a great meaſure, cured of theſe ill qualities by a ſeaſonable attention to them; or they might never have appeared, had they not been fanned into a flame by injudicious management. If oppoſite diſpoſitions had been cheriſhed with due care, they would have prevailed and borne theſe down. But, unfortunately for him, he was left, like too many other children, to grow up without cultivation; and, as "ill weeds grow apace," he was ſoon overrun by evil paſſions. Theſe became too deeply rooted ever to be eradicated; and tho conducted into the field of ſcience, it was only to make his follies the more conſpicuous. A public education is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally loſt upon ſuch characters. Their
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:022570_0272_0FB9950BB3B4A220"/>
minds, not properly diſciplined to virtue by domeſtic education, have no ſecure baſis; and having acquired ſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out virtue, they are in the ſituation of an edifice without a foundation, and, like that, overſet before the firſt blaſt, and fall among the ſplendid ruins of ſociety.</p>
                     <p>PHILO has merit, but not great talents. He has moderate abilities, with a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and a noble ſoul. He has forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and, for his age, a ſound judgment. With theſe qualities, directed in a proper manner, Philo promiſes fair to make a greater, and, certainly, a more uſeful man, than many who are endued with ſuperior genius. The difference of character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two youth muſt be principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribed to the difference in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic education. The one had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in every thing; and never had his mind directed to higher objects, than thoſe which are ſuited to excite childiſh deſires. This had a moſt unhappy effect on his temper, by debaſing his mind and corrupting his heart. The other had
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:022570_0273_0FB99511353356C8"/>
been diſciplined to virtuous habits under a ſteady government; and altho his geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was not brilliant, his heart was good; his ſoul was averſe to every thing mean and ſordid; and his underſtanding was adequate to all the purpoſes of uſeful life.</p>
                     <p>THE education of the laſt Czar of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, was ſuited to make him appear fooliſh and ridiculous. "Born without genius or courage, his education principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in inſpiring him with military ideas. Had he poſſeſſed ambition to be an hero as well as a ſovereign, he might have made a conqueror."</p>
                     <p>"CHARLES the twelfth, king of Sweden, whoſe valor rendered even his follies glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſhould have poſſeſſed leſs valor or more genius. If he had had leſs enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, his name might not have been ſo celebrated, but would have been more truly great." It was the imprudent zeal of Charles that gave PETER THE GREAT an opportunity of acquiring that illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous title, by conquering him. This Peter acknowledged, by drinking his

                     <p>LONG leſſons on morality become tedious to children, and loſe their deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effect. In the management of their paſſions, therefore, Mr. Bloomſgrove uſed great moderation with his children, and, by coolly exhibiting to them examples of great ſelf command, would ſooth them, when irritated; and make them aſhamed of themſelves, if at any time they gave way to a fit of anger.</p>
                     <p>"TWO gentlemen, ſaid he to his young ſon, were riding together, one of whom, who was very choleric, happened to be mounted on an high ſpirited horſe. The horſe grew a little troubleſome, at which the rider became very angry, and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſpurred him with great fury. The horſe, almoſt as headſtrong as his
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:022570_0275_0FB99513FACAD3B8"/>
maſter, returned his treatment by kicking and plunging. The companion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the danger, and aſhamed of the folly of his friend, ſaid to him coolly— Be quiet, be quiet, and ſhew yourſelf the wiſer of the two."</p>
                     <p>THE child who has been taught from his infancy to reſtrain angry paſſions, may, when further advanced in age, be convinced of the impropriety of ſuffering them to carry him away. They make a man appear ridiculous in the eyes of the world, and render him unhappy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and are attended with the moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequences. Againſt the ill effects of theſe, the affectionate parent will carefully guard, by the interpoſition of advice, remonſtrance, and authority when neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER was thrown into a violent paſſion with one of his ſchoolmates, as they were diverting themſelves; and, in the heat of his paſſion, expreſſed himſelf in a manner highly diſpleaſing to his father, who, when it came to his ears,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:022570_0276_0FB99519C97CBDD0"/>
called him to account for his conduct, and ſoon made him aſhamed of his folly. After ſhewing him the folly and danger of giving way to anger, and remonſtrating againſt the like again, he related ſeveral inſtances of greatneſs of ſoul in repreſſing anger, with the good effects of it. He recommended to him to obſerve the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im of a Roman emperor, never to ſpeak, when he was in a paſſion, till he had leiſurely repeated all the letters in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet. He inſtanced alſo Socrates ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ſervant, who had offended him— "I would treat you as you deſerve, were I not in a paſſion." But his generous ſoul melted at the relation of the diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate conduct of Themiſtocles, who was the means of ſaving Greece from ruin by his calmneſs, in anſwering the paſſionate threatenings of Euribiades, admiral of the Grecian fleet which was collected againſt the Perſians.</p>
                     <p>"ANGRY at being oppoſed in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of war by Themiſtocles, a young offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, he brandiſhed his ſtaff in a threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:022570_0277_0FB9951B77AA1388"/>
manner—'Strike, ſaid Themiſtocles, but hear me firſt.' Subdued by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſelf command, Euribiades liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, followed the advice of the young offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and obtained a complete victory. The cool behavior of Themiſtocles ſaved Greece, which would probably have been ruined by the old general." Not more complete was the victory over the Perſians than that which the recital gained over the ſpirits of Oſander. He confeſſed his error, and declared that he wiſhed for nothing ſo much as to be a ſecond The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles. By embracing thoſe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which particular incidents afforded, Mr. Bloomſgrove's lectures were agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and doubly uſeful. This method proved effectual with his children; not to prevent an emotion of anger ſometimes; but to accuſtom them to reſtrain their paſſions, and to reduce them ſpeedily to order, when they were put into motion; to remain ſilent, while they were under the influence of irritated paſſions; and to be doubly on their guard, when injured or affronted.</p>

                        <pb n="279" facs="unknown:022570_0278_0FB9951DD2AB8E68"/>THOSE perſons are very ill qualified for ſociety, who take fire at every inſult, and give vent to their paſſions without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. They live in a ſtate of hoſtilities with the world, and more ſo with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their impatience involves them in perpetual difficulties, and often into great diſtreſſes. All theſe evils are avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a due reſtraint on the paſſions; and the peace and order of ſociety is preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while individuals enjoy the pleaſures of calm, ſerene ſpirits. A gentleman was one day attacked in public by a brutiſh fellow, with opprobrious language, but took no notice of him: as he returned home at night, he was followed by the ſame perſon venting himſelf in a ſimilar manner againſt him. It being dark, when he reached home, he ordered a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to light the man back, for fear he ſhould loſe the way. To overlook or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble ſmall injuries, is the ſureſt way to avoid great ones.</p>

                     <p>XENOPHON, in his Cyropoedia, tells us that "The Perſian children went to ſchool, and ſpent their time in learning the principles of juſtice, as children do in other countries to learn the knowledge of letters. Their governors devoted the greateſt part of the day to deciding cauſes among them, reſpecting theft, violence, and deceit; puniſhing thoſe whom they found guilty in any of theſe matters, or who were convicted of unjuſt accuſation. Ingratitude too, they puniſhed; a crime, which, tho the principal occaſion of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, is little taken notice of among men."</p>
                     <p>HAPPY would it be for this riſing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, if a ſimilar practice was adopted by our ſchools, academies, and univerſities, and by all heads of families. Children are ſoon to be initiated into ſociety; and ſociety cannot exiſt, unleſs the principles of juſtice are underſtood, and its ſacred bonds preſerved inviolate. It requires
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:022570_0280_0FB99524976BED08"/>
no abſtract reaſonings to become acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe principles. They lie near the ſurface, and are within the reach of the moſt moderate capacities. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of commutative juſtice, which are expreſſed in that ſhort ſentence—"All things whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them," are applied to the natural ſenſe of right and wrong. They are addreſſed to the feelings of every man, and appeal to their own ſenſe of wrong, when unjuſtly treated, to aſſign to themſelves the ſame penalty in doing injuſtice to others, which they do to thoſe who injure and offend them.</p>
                     <p>THAT a ſenſe of right and wrong is nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural to man, and ought to be cheriſhed by education, and explained to children as ſoon as they are capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the relation of things, was an opinion in which Mr. Bloomſgrove was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. He therefore took care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and impreſs on the minds of his children the obligations of juſtice and
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:022570_0281_0FB995272841AA00"/>
equity in all their actions, as ſoon as they could comprehend any thing of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations; and he enjoined their preceptor to let no favorable opportunity paſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the ſame.</p>
                     <p>IN order to try their invention, and to aſſiſt them in underſtanding the principles of juſtice, he would propoſe queſtions to them on the caſe of certain tranſactions, and requeſt their determination. Theſe judiciary proceedings were as amuſing as they were inſtructive to the children; and while they led them to an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the principles of common juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, they gave him an opportunity to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their judgment when wrong.</p>
                     <p>WHAT do you think, my ſon, ſaid Mr. Bloomſgrove to Oſander, one evening after he came home from ſchool, when Miſander had been puniſhed for doing wrong to his mates—of the conduct of Cyrus?—Pray, papa, repeat the ſtory. That I will do with pleaſure, my ſon, if you will profit by it.</p>

                        <pb n="283" facs="unknown:022570_0282_0FB9952838EF3200"/>"CYRUS was a little boy of a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and a very humane temper, and had been well educated from childhood. One evening his father aſked him what he had done or learned that day.—Sir, ſaid Cyrus, I was puniſhed to day for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding unjuſtly. How ſo? ſaid his father. There were two boys, replied Cyrus, one of them was a great, and the other a little boy. It happened that the little boy had a coat that was much too big for him; but the great boy had one that ſcarcely reached below his middle, and was too tight for him in every part; upon which the great boy propoſed to the little one to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change coats with him, becauſe then, ſaid he, we ſhall both be exactly fitted, for your coat is as much too big for you, as mine is too little for me. The little boy would not conſent to the propoſal; upon which the great boy took his coat away by force, and gave his own to the little boy in exchange. While they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting upon this ſubject, I chanced to paſs by, and they agreed to make me judge
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:022570_0283_0FB99529B4AB3B08"/>
of the affair. But I decided that the little boy ſhould keep the little coat, and the great boy the great one; for which judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my maſter puniſhed me. Why ſo? ſaid Cyrus's father; was not the little coat moſt proper for the little boy, and the large coat for the great boy? Yes, ſir, anſwered Cyrus; but my maſter told me, I was not made judge to examine which coat beſt fitted the boys, but to decide, whether it was juſt that the great boy ſhould take away the coat of the little one againſt his conſent; and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided unjuſtly, and deſerved to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed." I think ſo too, replied Oſander; for no body has any right to take anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's coat without his conſent.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove was going to relate ſome other inſtances of erroneous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about right and wrong actions; but juſt as he finiſhed this, the bell rang for ſupper, and the young maſter and miſs retired to bed, much edified and pleaſed.</p>

                     <p>NOTHING can be more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſociety than falſehood; nor can any thing deſerve the attention of parents and teachers of children ſo much, as to cheriſh in them a love of truth. This, like good coin; will paſs every where; but falſehood, like counterfeit money, is liable to ſuſpicion; and perſons addicted to this vice are deſpiſed and rejected. There is a dignity peculiar to that character which preſerves a ſacred regard to truth, while thoſe of an oppoſite character fall into the loweſt contempt.</p>
                     <p>ROUSSEAU has objected, with conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable force of reaſon, againſt the uſe of fables for the inſtruction of children, as having a tendency to teach them falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. A fable is in fact a falſe ſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to teach ſome moral truth. "How is it poſſible, ſaid he, men can be ſo blind as to call fables the moral lectures for children, without reflecting that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, in amuſing, only deceives them;
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:022570_0285_0FB9953017ED4268"/>
and that, ſeduced by the charms of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the truth couched underneath it eſcapes their notice? Yet, ſo it is; and the means which are thus taken to render inſtruction agreeable prevent their profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it. Fables may inſtruct grown perſons, but the naked truth ſhould be preſented to children: for if we once ſpread over it a veil, they will not take the trouble to lay it aſide, in order to look at it."</p>
                     <p>WHATEVER force you may allow to theſe obſervations, you may be aſſured that Mr. Bloomſgrove was cautious of uſing them. Very few ever came to his children's knowledge, until they were grown to years of diſcretion; and of thoſe few, he or his good lady had the chooſing, that they might have only ſuch as were plain and well ſuited to convey inſtruction without any ill effect. They paid an early attention to every circumſtance which had any tendency to inſpire their children with a regard to truth, and an abhorrence of falſehood. In order to
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:022570_0286_0FB995313A2A07A8"/>
this, they were careful to encourage their ſpeaking truth, by making it moſt conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ient for them. Cautious not to drive them into ſubterfuges and diſſimulation, they were ſeldom found guilty of fraud or falſehood; and as they advanced to years of underſtanding, they were taught the nature and obligations of truth: its beautiful image was preſented to their mind in a pleaſing and engaging manner; and the deformity of falſehood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, painted in all its odious colors. They repreſented to their children and family, the mean and contemptible light in which thoſe are held, who practiſe ſo baſe a vice. They would adduce inſtances of each, ſome of which fell within their own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and others ſelected for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>ONE evening as Mr. and Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove were walking on the verdant mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the river, with their nephew, Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and their children, the moon ſhone beautifully upon the ſmooth ſurface of the water. Oſander, obſerving that every
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:022570_0287_0FB99537278E3880"/>
object appeared crooked in the water, aſked his papa the reaſon of it. Inſtead of replying that it was occaſioned by the refraction of the rays of light, as they paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a denſer medium, he ſaid that it was a deception, and that the water in that caſe was not the proper repreſentative of the truth. Juſt ſo it is with thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the truth, by repreſenting things in a falſe light in many inſtances; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be credited in other caſes.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove turning to Fanny, aſked her what ſhe had read that day, that made the deepeſt impreſſion on her mind. She replied, with a modeſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy peculiar to her, that the ſtory of the frankneſs of a galley ſlave in owning the truth, though he knew not but it might be the means of his ruin, had ſtruck her more than any thing ſhe had read. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, my dear, ſaid her excellent patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs. That I will do with pleaſure, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, as ſoon as I can recollect it, and ſhall feel myſelf extremely happy, if I can grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify you in any thing; and proceeded as follows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="unknown:022570_0288_0FB99537F4C17A58"/>IN the memoirs of the Duke d'Oſſuna, I found the following anecdote—"The Duke having leave from his Catholic Majeſty to relieve ſome galley ſlaves, ſuch as he ſhould think beſt deſerving of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, went on board the Admiral galley at Barcelona, and aſked ſeveral of the ſlaves what were the crimes that had ſent them to the gallies. Every one endeavored to excuſe himſelf, that it was out of malice, that the judges were corrupted, and the like. The ſame queſtion being put to a little ſturdy fellow, he acknowledged that he was juſtly condemned; for that, being in want of money, he had robbed a man on the high way. On which, the Duke gave him a blow over the ſhoulders with a cane, ſaying, you rogue, why ſhould you be with ſo many honeſt innocent men? get you out of their company, for ſhame."</p>
                     <p>THEY were all much pleaſed with the ſtory, and agreed that if any thing could entitle him to his freedom, it was his frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in telling the truth, Now, ſays Mr. Bloomſgrove to Oſander, your couſin Fanny has related ſo pretty a piece, and
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:022570_0289_0FB9953980DA3360"/>
done it very well, (at this unexpected compliment Fanny's cheeks were crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned) let us hear what you can give on the ſame ſubject. Oſander, with his uſual frankneſs, immediately proceeds—"Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio had contracted ſuch a habit of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the bad company he kept, that he could ſcarce ever be believed by his friends; and was often ſuſpected of faults, becauſe he denied the commiſſion of them; and could not get reparation for injuries of which he complained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe he could never be credited. A luſty boy, of whom Eugenio had told ſome falſehoods, often way laid him as he went to ſchool, and beat him very much. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his ill deſert, Eugenio bore for ſome time, in ſilence, the chaſtiſement; but the frequent repetition of it, at laſt overpowered his reſolution, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to his father of the uſage he met with. His father, tho doubtful of the truth of his account, applied to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the boy who he ſaid abuſed him. But he could obtain no redreſs from them, and only received for anſwer, "Your ſon
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:022570_0290_0FB9953BAD1601E8"/>
is a notorious liar, and we pay no regard to his aſſertions. Eugenio was therefore obliged to ſubmit to the wonted correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till full ſatisfaction had been taken by his antagoniſt for the injury which he had ſuſtained." The evening advanced, and they all returned home much pleaſed with the excurſion.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt formation of children's minds being impreſſions; and their firſt actions the notices of impreſſions, it will follow that children are capable of conſiderable progreſs in falſehood, before they can learn the uſe of words. An ignorant or careleſs nurſe, not diſtinguiſhing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tones of pain and hunger, will ſoon teach a child to deceive in thoſe ſenſations. Hence it is that parents, who do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend carefully to their offspring, are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed that the firſt uſe of ſpeech is to deceive. This they aſcribe to an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py perverſion in the nature of their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; or to any but the true reaſon—their own criminal negligence. Under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that their children were born with a lie in their mouth, or with lying
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:022570_0291_0FB9953C867F6420"/>
conſtitutions, they attempt beating it out by ſtripes. The diſorder will only be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by theſe means. Proper manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have prevented it. A very cautious and tender uſage is neceſſary to remedy the evil.</p>
                     <p>CHILDREN can have no deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, till it is made their intereſt. They feel their dependence, and naturally wiſh to be on good terms with thoſe on whom they depend; but if they are directly charged with any crime, and are ſenſible that if they plead guilty, it will endanger that harmony, they will deny it. If they have not been trained to make voluntary confeſſions, at leaſt to great candor and frankneſs, they will diſſemble, when queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioned; and deny, when charged with a fault.</p>
                     <p>IF Oſander, at any time, ſeems diſpoſed to equivocate, his papa draws him off from ſuch ungenerous attempts. He queries whether the frankneſs of the galley ſlave did not make him appear better, than the wealthieſt man who has no regard to the
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:022570_0292_0FB99541E5592840"/>
truth. As to Rozella, her mamma's prudent management inſpired her with ſo delicate a regard to truth, that ſhe would ſhudder at the thought, even of the leaſt equivocation. An excellent example for thoſe of her age!</p>

                     <p>THE virtue, fidelity, ſeems to be but little underſtood by children. They are made, like a parrot, to promiſe any thing that is put into their mouth, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the nature of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the fear of puniſhment or the hopes of reward lead them to make engagements, which they will violate as ſoon as the force of the motive abates, the violation is not to be conſidered as want of the principle in the child. It muſt be charged to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence in the parent or preceptor. A child cannot be ſaid to be unfaithful in not fulfilling engagements which he makes, before he is capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of ſuch obligations. No
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:022570_0293_0FB9954336569178"/>
ſuch promiſes, therefore, ſhould ever be extorted from them. The obligation does not exiſt in nature, but in contract or agreement. If the nature of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is not ſo far underſtood, as that the moral ſenſe of right and wrong will exert itſelf in producing a fulfilment, from what cauſe do we look for it?</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove was ever attentive to this matter, when the children were young and under her more immediate care; nor did their papa ever exact any promiſes of them, until they were able to comprehend the reaſon, and ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of promiſing. The principal ſenſe which children have of engagements, is their utility. But when the innate ſenſe of right and wrong begins to exert it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and conſcience impoſes that as a duty which convenience only had dictated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then the force of engagement is felt from an underſtanding of its principles. Theſe are unfolded to Oſander as he can bear them, and enforced by conſiderations ſuited to touch his feelings. He is taught
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:022570_0294_0FB9954550674B88"/>
never to promiſe any thing ſlightly; but to conſider what he is about to engage, and whether he ſhall be able to perform; and having made an engagement, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever trifling, he is cloſely watched as to the fulfilment of it. This ſtrengthens his reſolution and accuſtoms him to punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. But if he at any time violates his word, his papa expreſſes as much ſurpriſe as indignation; and tells him, "If you were not quite young, ſuch an action would be very diſgraceful; and if you ſhould do the like again, you would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yourſelf contemptible in the eyes of every one."</p>
                     <p>HIS inſtructions were always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with example. He conſidered promiſes made to children as of ſacred obligation; and was careful to fulfil them, however trifling in themſelves. Many parents fail much in this point. They promiſe children, perhaps to get rid of a preſent importunity, that they ſhall have ſuch a thing, or go to ſuch a place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thought or intention of fulfilling
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:022570_0295_0FB9954670CE7220"/>
their promiſe. The child remembers the promiſe, and, at the time, claims a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; but the parent has forgotten it, or declines a fulfilment. What is this but teaching them to deceive and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful?</p>
                     <p>IN ſome animals there appears an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive principle, which bears a ſtrong analogy to this virtue. It begets the ſtrongeſt attachment to certain objects; and leads to do every thing in a certain line, which the moſt ſacred engagements could effect. But this moves in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined circle, and never enlarges as it goes round. The ſtrength of it, in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, puts to the bluſh men who claim the rank of intelligence, and who profeſs to act on principles ſuperior to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</p>
                     <p>THE following inſtance of fidelity in a dog, is worthy of notice; and it muſt be the more agreeable, as it happened not many years ago—An officer in the late American army, on his ſtation at the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, went out in the morning with his
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:022570_0296_0FB9954D0BE5AF50"/>
dog and gun, in queſt of game. Ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too far from the garriſon, he was fired upon by an Indian, who was lurking in the buſhes, and inſtantly fell to the ground. The Indian running to him, ſtruck him on the head with his tomma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk in order to diſpatch him; but the button of his hat fortunately warding off the edge, he was only ſtunned by the blow. With ſavage brutality he applied the ſcalping knife, and haſtened away with this trophy of his horrid cruelty, leaving the officer for dead, and none to relieve or conſole him, but his faithful dog.</p>
                     <p>THE afflicted creature gave every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of attachment, fidelity, and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He licked the wounds with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible tenderneſs, and mourned the fate of his beloved maſter. Having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every office which ſympathy dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and ſagacity could invent, without being able to remove his maſter from the fatal ſpot, or procure from him any ſigns of life, or his wonted expreſſions of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:022570_0297_0FB9954E765531E8"/>
to him, he ran off in queſt of help. Bending his courſe towards the river, where two men were fiſhing, he urged them by all the powers of native rhetoric to accompany him to the woods.</p>
                     <p>THE men were ſuſpicious of a decoy to an ambuſcade, and dared not venture to follow the dog, which finding all his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes fail, returned to the care o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, licking his wounds a ſecond time, renewed all his tenderneſſes, but with no better ſucceſs than before. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he returned to the men; once more to try his ſkill in alluring them to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. In this attempt he was more ſucceſsful than in the other. The men ſeeing his ſolicitude, began to think the dog might have diſcovered ſome valuable game, and determined to hazard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of following him. Tranſported with his ſucceſs, the affectionate creature hurried them along by every expreſſion of ardor. Preſently they arrive at the ſpot where—behold an officer wounded, ſcalped, weltering in his own gore, and
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:022570_0298_0FB99550153B6108"/>
faint with the loſs of blood—Suffice it to ſay, he was yet alive. They carried him to the fort, where the firſt dreſſings were performed. A ſuppuration immediately took place, and he was ſoon conveyed to the hoſpital at Albany, where, in a few weeks, he entirely recovered, and was able to return to his duty.</p>
                     <p>THIS worthy officer owed his life, probably, to the fidelity of this ſagacious dog. His tongue, which the gentleman afterward declared, gave him the moſt exquiſite pleaſure, clarified the wound in the moſt effectual manner, and his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance brought that aſſiſtance without which he muſt ſoon have periſhed.</p>

                        <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THIS day is announced to us, the agreeable intelligence of the arrival of our late BELOVED General, now the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preſident of the United States, at the preſent ſeat of federal government.</p>
                     <p>I SUSPEND all other concerns for a moment, to felicitate you on the auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious event which commences a new era in the hiſtory of human affairs. Other nations, after many years of effort and miſery in the cauſe of freedom, have been obliged, either to yield to their haughty
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022570_0307_0FB99017ACFD6908"/>
conquerors, or to accept conditions of a partial deliverance from their oppreſſors, unworthy of their attempts. But Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica preſents to the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſublime and affecting ſpectacle of a brave people, after a few years ſtruggle againſt a proud and rapacious nation, becoming free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent; founding a mighty empire, which, tho agitated awhile, like the ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boſom of the ocean, is now ſettling down into calmneſs and tranquillity. She preſents to the world a conſtitution of civil government, which, founded in equality and juſtice, unites energy in the executive with the liberty of the ſubject; in ſuch a manner as moſt effectually to ſecure the reſponſibility of the one, and the common good of the other.</p>
                     <p>THE preſent may with propriety be ſtyled the age of philoſophy; and Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, the empire of reaſon. The agitations which uſually follow ſuch convulſions, and the diſmemberment of kingdoms, are rapidly ſubſiding, and ſhe is faſt riſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuperior conſequence. America now
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022570_0308_0FB9901A98402140"/>
promiſes fair to be the aſylum of genius and liberty, the ſeat of arts and learning, and the univerſal emporium of wealth and commerce.</p>
                     <p>ALL this is acknowleged by a tranſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic panegyriſt, who ſays—"Amidſt the number of intrepid ſoldiers, of experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generals, and wiſe legiſlators, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed themſelves on this occaſion, an illuſtrious name appears, which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eminently conſpicuous in the annals of the preſent age, but ſhines unrivalled by the moſt celebrated characters of antiquity. The irreſolute only, who fail in reſiſting oppreſſion, are branded with the name of rebels. The brave, who ſucceed in the arduous ſtrife, reap, with the glorious fruit of their toils, the laurel of renown: convinced of this, the great WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON drew his ſword; at the eventful, perilous moment, when the world, with eager concern, attended to the fate of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, in the infancy of her ſtrength, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly invaded by the overwhelming power of a monarchy, grown wanton, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022570_0309_0FB9901F8AB7E968"/>
deemed irreſiſtible: thro an almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſeries of victory and conqueſt, this great man ruſhed forward; and, to ſave his country, riſked his fame, his property, and his life! Animated with a generous, a diſintereſted ardor, he ſtood forth a volunteer in the ſacred cauſe of juſtice! Freedom, and not power, was his aim: independence, happineſs, and the prayers of virtuous millions, were his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward."</p>
                     <p>I AM highly gratified by your account of the emulation which appeared in every claſs of citizens to be foremoſt in their expreſſions of joy on the occaſion. It muſt be flattering to a mind, ſuperior to vanity, to ſtand unrivalled in the hearts of a grateful country, who unanimouſly hail him WELCOME to the ſeat of federal empire.</p>

                     <p>I AM about to arraign myſelf at the tribunal of your ſex. To ſtand approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſo equitable a bar, I ſhall rank in the firſt claſs of my felicitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides your acquaintance in the republic of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, you have a more there knowledge of the female character than I can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to poſſeſs; and can better judge of proper expedients to raiſe and dignify that character.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE, therefore, ſent to your peruſal thoſe ſheets on the ſubject of female edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which I mentioned in my laſt. If, in caſting an eye over them, any thing ſhould appear unfriendly to your ſex, your goodneſs will place it to an error in judgment, not to a want of eſteem and reſpect for ſo amiable a part of our ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. If your long acquaintance with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life, and the neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022570_0311_0FB99022C76109C0"/>
for diſcharging its duties, ſuggeſts any expedients for cultivating thoſe qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities which have eſcaped my notice, you will be ſo obliging, Madam, as to mention them with freedom.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE aſſigned to the female an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant rank in domeſtic ſociety; and, with that rank, a laborious taſk—a taſk impoſed by nature; not by me. In the former part of theſe memoirs, I have ſhewn the obligations our ſex are under to participate the cares, and lighten the burden of yours, by every poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of tenderneſs and affection. The thoughtful, anxious, and affectionate mother intereſts my eſteem, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my ſincereſt reſpect. She renders the moſt eſſential ſervice to the world; and doubly bleſſes her huſband by the happineſs ſhe entails upon the objects of their mutual affection.</p>
                     <p>ON the moſt critical, and perhaps, leaſt pleaſing part of the ſubject, I have only to ſay, that I have endeavored to follow nature, and to vindicate the juſt claims
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022570_0312_0FB990243941CE70"/>
of the ſex. The idea of inferiority on the part of your ſex, I renounce with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. While the names of Mrs. Rowe, Chapone, Macauley, Barbauld, Miſs Burns, Moore, and many others are remembered, the ſprightlineſs, ſtrength, and elegance of female genius muſt be acknowledged.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>HITHERTO, my dear ſir, have I ſpoken in general terms of Oſander and Rozella; and, indeed, every thing which has been ſaid on the ſubject of ſenſibility and impreſſions, on the culture of the head or heart, applies, with little varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to both ſexes.

will readily occur to the vigilant mother; for their different propenſities ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>THE difference, neceſſary to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mode of treatment, increaſes with their years; and muſt now make fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male education a diſtinct part of theſe memoirs.

                     <p>THE dignity of females conſiſts in their acting always agreeably to their own character; and in preſerving their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that way which nature points out; by a mixture of reſerve and benevolence, in young women; of affection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, in the married ſtate; by a dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent attention to the formation of the character and manners of children of both ſexes, in their earlieſt years, and the entire education of daughters.</p>
                     <p>THE importance of the female character conſiſts in the extenſive influence which the ſex has on the face of human affairs. This influence is much greater than is commonly imagined; greater than women themſelves have any idea of; for, beſides their extenſive ſway over gallants and huſbands, the minds of our whole ſpecies receive their firſt formation under the foſtering care of female tenderneſs. How, then, does female education riſe into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? How much praiſe is due to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022570_0321_0FB990448B207ED8"/>
thoſe mothers, who, filling with dignity their own rank in ſociety, and diſcharging the duties of domeſtic life with fidelity, bleſs the world with virtuous ſons and amiable daughters?</p>
                     <p>GREAT as the conſequences of female education are to the world, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that it has been much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the objects of it greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Boarding ſchools have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the ſeminaries of female educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here they have been taught a graceful deportment, ſome of the fine arts, and the leſs uſeful parts of needle work. They have learned to diſſemble gracefully, rather than to think or act virtuouſly. To what purpoſe is all this, if they are not taught the ſcience of econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy, and the neceſſary branches of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic buſineſs? Let their young hearts be inſpired with virtuous principles, and with benevolence which is the baſis of true politeneſs, and they will ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all the forms which are neceſſary to good breeding. Let them be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022570_0322_0FB99046067EBC28"/>
with the moſt uſeful kind of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erature, and they will not only be better qualified to be miſtreſſes of families, but more ſuitable for companions and friends in the connubial ſtate. Females ſhould be directed to ſuch ſtudies, as have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to enlarge the underſtanding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the labor of cloſe inveſtigation; to entertain the mind, while they direct the affections of the heart. Economy and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic employments are neceſſary branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of female education; and works of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and fancy may innocently and agreeably fill up many of their leiſure hours.</p>
                     <p>IT is not the buſineſs of education to alter the courſe of nature, but to follow her dictates, and bring to perfection the plants of her own production. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent parent will arreſt every native paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and direct its influence to the noble objects of education. The paſſion which females early diſcover for ornamental and ſhowy dreſs may be made an uſeful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine for teaching induſtry, economy, taſte,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022570_0323_0FB9904FA9F02CF0"/>
and cleanlineſs. A little girl will ſpare no pains, nor think the time long, which is employed in dreſſing and undreſſing her doll; in making and adorning this idol of her fancy. But, in order to have it properly formed and attired, ſhe is obliged to have frequent recourſe to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for aſſiſtance: this affords the mother, or the elder ſiſters, where there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral daughters, an opportunity to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate uſeful inſtruction in a moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. The little artiſt will liſten to every propoſal for altering, amending, and beautifying it: ſhe receives any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhe can obtain as a favor: ſhe will work with indefatigable induſtry to complete the object of her wiſhes, and uſe great economy in ſaving all the ſhreds which fall from the ſciſſors. But ſhe would be more happy, if leſs dependent: ſhe endeavors, therefore, to become miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the buſineſs, that ſhe may enjoy the undivided ſatisfaction of making and dreſſing her image.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="unknown:022570_0324_0FB990520314F4A8"/>WHILE her mamma and Fanny were teaching Rozella the art of making the requiſite articles of dreſs for her doll, they were communicating knowledge to her, not as a taſk but as a favor, which was uſeful thro life. The dreſs muſt be clean, or it will look ugly: this begets a habit of cleanlineſs, which is of great conſequence in females, both as a pleaſing and a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful quality. The aſſemblage of colors and materials in the dreſs muſt be proper, or it will not be ornamental: this excites taſte and attention to propriety. Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with her own hand gives ſcope to invention, and renders induſtry neceſſary: this draws forth into exerciſe, the latent powers of nature, and keeps them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. The effects of her own induſtry are enjoyed with a double reliſh; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is a ſource of new pleaſures every moment, and keeps alive the diſpoſition to induſtry.</p>

                     <p>THOSE who are not engaged in domeſtic education, or have no concern in the inſtruction and government of families, may think a minute detail of childiſh matters frivolous and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but the thoughtful, anxious, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate mother, who is immediately oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in domeſtic education, has very different ideas. She is perpetually ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with difficulties; is anxious for a minute detail of particulars in the proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of education. She wiſhes not only to know wherein ſhe is wrong, but to have every particular track pointed out which will lead to the great object in view, the good of her children. In this, the moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhews leſs judgment than ſolicitude. To give inſtances and explanations which will apply to every caſe, would exceed the bounds of any compoſitions on the ſubject of education. As education muſt be conducted by improving incidents and occaſions, ſo the conſiderate mother will
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022570_0326_0FB99054F9C1EB50"/>
ſeize general principles, and improve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and examples, by ſimilitude or analogy.</p>
                     <p>THE object Mrs. Bloomſgrove had principally in view, in the education of her daughter, was to make it proper for her ſex; to inſpire her with the love of thoſe occupations which are their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar province; to inſtruct her in that modeſt unaſſuming air, which beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes her ſex; and to make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe things, which will make her the moſt uſeful and happy in life. To theſe ends ſhe avails herſelf of opportunities and incidents as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.</p>
                     <p>IT ſhould be conſidered that in this country, marriages generally take place earlier than in older countries; and, from the circumſtances of the people, the miſtreſs of the family muſt be at the head of her domeſtic affairs. The term allotted, by this uſage, for the education of females, being ſhort, it ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved with the more diligence. Not
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022570_0327_0FB9905F4445D770"/>
attending ſufficiently to the difference of circumſtances between our own country, and that, from which we have been too long accuſtomed implicitly to borrow our maxims and manners, many parents have laid the foundation of great domeſtic dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and wretchedneſs by miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the education of their daughters. Deluded by romantic ideas of elegance and ſplendor, borrowed from European writers, cuſtoms, and manners, many have copied them in the education of their children, without making proper allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for the difference which ſubſiſts in the ſtate of ſociety and government of the two countries.</p>
                     <p>DAUGHTERS born to expectations, as it is phraſed, have had their minds ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vanity, from an idea of their own conſequence on that account; and felt themſelves above the drudgery of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſary parts of domeſtic duties. Their education, proceeding on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a certain inheritance, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted moſtly in the arts of dreſs, muſic,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022570_0328_0FB99062816550A8"/>
dancing, paying and receiving viſits, and the graces of an aſſembly room; while very little attention has been paid either to the head or heart—ſtill leſs to the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful branches of domeſtic economy. Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of leſs eſtates, but not leſs vanity, have followed on in full career. What kind of wives theſe have made, you may read in the ſhattered fortunes of many induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious huſbands, who have been caught by the waving plumage.</p>
                     <p>WHETHER this would be a proper mode of education, if eſtates were as ſure and durable as the everlaſting mountains, I am not about to inquire—I think it will not bear a queſtion. But when we conſider that in a free country, under a republican form of government, induſtry is the only ſure road to wealth; and economy the only ſure means of preſerving it, we ſee the neceſſity of educating females in a manner ſuited to the genius of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. It is an old adage, "A man muſt aſk his wife, whether he may be rich." He gets the eſtate by his induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022570_0329_0FB99064C2E1F5F8"/>
ſhe preſerves it by her economy. If ſhe has no economy, he labors in vain. The want of attention to this branch of female education, has poiſoned the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ruined the circumſtances of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny families. I know ſeveral females, whoſe only boaſt has been that they were never taught to do any labor, and that they never did any work in their lives. They are now old; and have nothing to boaſt of, but extreme poverty, without the power of remedying their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

                     <p>I DO not mean to ſpeak ſlightly of the polite and graceful accompliſhments; but to ſhew the neceſſity of uniting to them, the knowledge and habits of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic duties. Her own houſe is the place for a lady to ſhine in. The ſhowy accompliſhments will appear advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abroad; but domeſtic qualities,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022570_0330_0FB9906C8BE03CC8"/>
like the <hi>robe de chambre</hi> are of conſtant uſe: without theſe a lady muſt make an awkward figure at home, however grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhe may appear abroad. She may grace an aſſembly room, but do no honor to herſelf at the head of a table. Her parlour may appear neat and in order, but her kitchen like that of a ſlattern. Her own dreſs may be a proper aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of materials to adorn her perſon; but the education of her children, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to her domeſtic character.</p>
                     <p>AS the portrait painter ſhould never ſuffer an unfiniſhed piece to go out of his hands, ſo a mother ſhould never give her daughter in marriage, till ſhe is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to fulfil the vow, of being "a true and faithful wife." After ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, in the preſence of her mother, who has had the care of her education, and is ſuppoſed to have qualified her for the ſtation to which ſhe preſents her; what muſt be the mortification of her huſband, when he finds her wanting in almoſt every part of domeſtic knowledge?
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022570_0331_0FB9907020B16280"/>
This diſappointment is a fruitful ſource of domeſtic animoſities, when family cares increaſe and multiply. This want of knowledge in the duties of her ſtation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the occaſion of many difficulties with ſervants. The miſtreſs of the houſe being unacquainted with their duties, cannot judge of the merits of their ſervice; expects too much from them, and makes too little allowance for the feelings attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on human nature.</p>
                     <p>IF proſpects of intereſt could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed any one from attending to theſe concerns, Rozella might have pleaded an exemption. But her mamma, who knew the importance of this kind of knowledge, determined to depart from the too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtom of educating daughters. "I conſider," ſhe ſaid to a friend, who had obſerved to her that he could not conceive the neceſſity there was for her daughter to labor—"I conſider that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the events which may attend her future days, poverty is a poſſible event. Should any unforeſeen occurrence render
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022570_0332_0FB990718FBD1168"/>
it inevitable, ſhe will now be prepared for the worſt, and provided with a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. If the ſun of proſperity ſhould ſhine upon her, ſtill, at its meridian ſplendor, this will be uſeful to her; ſhe will be a better wife, a better miſtreſs, and a better woman, in every view, and in every rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                     <p>I HAVE already obſerved that ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed her daughter to be always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſome employment; and as far as poſſible, made her amuſements ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the great objects of education. At the age of twelve, ſhe had become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſeveral branches of cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, underſtood the compoſition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of paſtry, and even before that period, ſhe could aſſiſt her mamma in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the honors of the table. This made her ambitious to riſe above childiſh toys. At that age, ſhe was intruſted with the inſpection of ſome parts of the houſe; with the adjuſtment of the parlour for the reception of company; of the lodging rooms, with the aſſiſtance of Fanny, who
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022570_0333_0FB990798B29BA20"/>
was better able to judge whether every thing was in proper order to receive their gueſts. In this reſpect Fanny was of no ſmall advantage to her; for to her was committed the care of things which were of too great magnitude for Rozella, who was to aſſiſt Fanny, and to have the whole charge of them, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould be able to receive it. This confidential com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment of affairs, according to the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſtages of ability and merit, gave a conſtant ſpring to improvement and fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
                     <p>TOO much pains cannot be taken on this head, ſince the moſt of our time, and eſpecially that of a female, is to be paſſed at home; and ſince the proſperity and happineſs of the whole depend on the ability and diſpoſition of each member to diſcharge the duties of her particular ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the miſtreſs of the houſe, who holds the firſt place in all the economical concerns within it, is unacquainted with the duties of ſo important a place, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things muſt be broken in upon,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022570_0334_0FB9907C8EA05E98"/>
and peace, in the ſame proportion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and ſhe muſt be the greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>YOU will not conclude, my dear ſir, from any thing which has been ſaid, that Rozella's time was wholly occupied in domeſtic concerns, or that theſe were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a daily taſk. Her attention to theſe was granted as a favor; and it was made to yield to other improvements. "You can be uſeful to me, ſaid Mrs. Bloomſgrove, by attending to theſe things, and by alleviating the burden of the ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who, you ſhould recollect, are of the ſame ſpecies with yourſelf: they will love you and think labor more honorable for your taking a part in it, and will do it with more cheerfulneſs."</p>
                     <p>THE time which was ſpent in domeſtic occupations, was far from being loſt in the view of a poliſhed education. It rather facilitates than impedes progreſs in knowledge and polite literature. It fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022570_0335_0FB9907DB0EE5A18"/>
many opportunities for putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to practice the uſeful parts of knowledge, and of practiſing many civilities, which become e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſy and graceful by uſe only. Another advantage flowing from thoſe domeſtic exerciſes is, it prevents too great a degree of effeminacy, and inures to a little hardineſs, which is requiſite for oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reaſons than the preſervation of the health. The delicate and effeminate manner, in which many females are foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered when young, deſtroys their health, deprives them of the power of enjoying life, and entails on poſterity enervated conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>HENCE moſt writers on education bring up to view, the Spartan and Roman young ladies mixing with the young men in mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary games, wreſtling, and other violent exerciſes. This practice was ſaid to have been introduced with a view of rendering the female conſtitution healthy and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt, that their ſtates might never be wanting in well nerved ſons for defence at
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022570_0336_0FB9907F21C3C0C8"/>
home, or for carrying on their military operations abroad. But theſe exerciſes ſeem to me too athletic, to have the force of example upon our ladies, who do not wiſh their ſons to be ſoldiers, nor their daughters wreſtlers. All that is neceſſary for health, is plain food, with frequent exerciſe. Engliſh females far exceed thoſe in this country in the exerciſe of walking. I am told that it is no uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing for them to walk ſeveral miles, of choice, when they might have paſſed it in a coach.</p>
                     <p>ELOISA has the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, charmingly made, in a letter to her friend.</p>

Her ſweet and gentle affability of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as far removed from the levity of childhood as the frowns of auſterity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my entire confidence.

Had ſhe kept me at an awful diſtance, and never condeſcended to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear intereſted in my childiſh purſuits, I had never dared to confide thoſe purſuits to her; and that fear would have taught me to diſſemble, before I knew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word.</p>

                     <p>MUCH has been ſaid by Rouſſeau and others on the ſubject of the ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of women. If by the term, they mean to expreſs any inferiority of ſpecies, or a ſurrender of any natural rights, there cannot be any ground in nature, or any reaſon in ſociety, for the odious idea. If they mean that women ſhould ſubmit to the caprice of man's will, becauſe of his ſuperior ſtrength, then they are priſoners at diſcretion; which is an idea equally deteſtable. But if nothing more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it, than that delicate modeſty which is a dictate of female nature, and the effect of conſcious weakneſs, which leads them to look to men as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors; it will be the delight of every ſenſible woman to exerciſe her daughter in the habits of it. No woman of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or of goodneſs, would attempt to ſubvert the order of nature, and train her daughter to maſculine ſentiments and manners. There is no decent woman
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022570_0341_0FB99094762C0AC0"/>
but would be mortified at having it ſaid ſhe ruled her huſband, eſpecially if it was true. To have it ſaid, that ſhe has a complaiſant huſband, is the pride of every woman; as it is of every huſband to have it ſaid of his wife, that ſhe has all that ſenſibility of heart, that delicacy of ſentiment, and pliability of manners which belong to her ſex.</p>
                     <p>IN order that the voice of nature may be obeyed; that the modeſty and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which is the glory of the ſex, and the palladium of virtue, may be preſerved, it is neceſſary that females be habituated to reſtraint. This will be an unavoidable attendant of female life; and without it they cannot preſerve conſiſtency of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter.</p>
                     <p>I FIND it difficult to expreſs myſelf with clearneſs and preciſion on this part of the ſubject. I beg leave to advance under the ſtandard of Lord Kaimes and Rouſſeau. "Women, ſays the firſt, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined by nature to be obedient," (to be under reſtraint, I think, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022570_0342_0FB9909BDAE0C490"/>
the idea better) "ought to be diſciplined early to bear wrongs without murmuring. This is a hard leſſon; and yet it is nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary even for their own ſakes." "The perverſeneſs and ill nature of the women only ſerve to aggravate their own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and the miſconduct of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; they might plainly perceive that ſuch are not the arms by which they gain the ſuperiority."</p>
                     <p>"SULLENNESS or peeviſhneſs, ſay both, may alienate the huſband, but tend not to ſooth his roughneſs, nor to moderate his impetuoſity. Heaven did not beſtow on them the powers of inſinuation, to make them perverſe and moroſe; it did not conſtitute them feeble, to make them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious; it did not give them ſo ſoft and agreeable a voice, to vent abuſe; nor fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo delicate and lovely, to be disfigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with anger."</p>
                     <p>BUT after all, ſays the NOBLE writer, "has nature dealt ſo partially with her children, as to beſtow on one ſex abſolute authority, leaving nothing to the other
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022570_0343_0FB9909D08709560"/>
abſolute ſubmiſſion? This indeed has the appearance of great partiality. But has a woman no influence over her huſband? I anſwer, providence has provided her with means to rule over his will. He governs by law, ſhe by perſuaſion; nor can her influence ever fail, if ſupported by ſweetneſs of temper and zeal to make him happy."</p>
                     <p>ROUSSEAU charmingly ſays—"Hers is a ſovereignty founded on complacence and addreſs: careſſes are her orders; tears, her menaces. She governs in a family as a miniſter does in the ſtate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing commands to be laid upon her, for doing what ſhe inclines to do." And adds—"When they give way to rage, therefore, they forget themſelves, for tho they may often have reaſon to complain, they are always in the wrong to SCOLD.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>THE influence of females over the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the world is ſufficiently great and extenſive. It is only to be wiſhed that their education might be ſuch, as to direct that power to the beſt purpoſes. "That little boy you ſee there, ſaid Themiſtocles, is the arbiter of all Greece: for he gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns his mother; his mother rules me; I, the Athenians; and the Athenians, all the other Greeks."</p>
                     <p>SUBMISSION in females does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imply the leaſt ſervility of obedience to capricious men, but only an acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the conſtitution of nature, which, having formed them of finer materials, renders them more feeble in habit, more ſuſceptible in heart, and more complacent in manners. With theſe arms nature has furniſhed them for defence at every point. When they employ theſe, they follow nature, and ſucceſs attends them. But
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022570_0345_0FB990A6C69E3AA8"/>
when they commence hoſtilities, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the deciſion to the event of the field, they muſt ſurrender priſoners at diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>TO cheriſh this ſoftneſs, pliability, and power of ſelf reſtraint, is one great object of female education. It is under her mother's tuition, and from her example, that a young lady acquires the knowledge of what properly conſtitutes the female character, and the habits of reſtraint. Rozella is all ſubmiſſion to her mamma, without the uſe of any ſeverity. She is modeſt but not baſhful; is ſprightly and tractable, but not unhappy under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. In her mamma ſhe ſees a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant example of thoſe domeſtic qualities, which are requiſite to conjugal and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic enjoyment; that her inferiority in point of ſtrength is amply compenſated in the commanding gentleneſs of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that her empire is attendant on her virtues. She reigns triumphant in the mildneſs of her diſpoſition, and her mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty renders her ſway abſolute. It is in
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022570_0346_0FB990ADF48EE908"/>
this way that nature has provided a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of power between the ſexes.</p>

                     <p>THE evening was overcaſt; and the ſoft murmur of expiring day had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Fanny to the window, that ſhe might enjoy the cheerful note of a muſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al truſh, ſweetly warbling in a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grove.

While meek eyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation ſoft effuſed its balmy influence over her gentle ſpirit, a ſtranger called with a large packet, which he ſaid he was to deliver there, and went directly away. Fanny, who ſuppoſed it to contain ſome papers from Mr. Bloomſgrove, who was then at the general aſſembly, ſat down to enjoy the reverie which had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the incident.

domeſtic concerns, hearing ſomebody at the door, ordered a candle into the room where Fanny was ſitting—Judge, my dear ſir, what muſt have been her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, when ſhe ſaw the budget was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to her! She read the letter with avidity. It was from her twin ſiſter Conſtantia; of whom, as I have had no occaſion to ſpeak till this time, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay: She is ſenſible without oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; tall without elegance; agreeable without beauty; amiable without a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of virtues, and admired without a fortune.</p>
                     <p>HAVING read the letter, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many family matters with which we have no concern at this time; ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the books, contained in the budget, were a preſent from her brother Edward, who was then in England. The books ſhe unfolded, and opening one of them, ſhe ſaw at the head of a ſection, the complaint of a female concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of men to the charms of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male mind cultivated with polite and ſolid
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022570_0348_0FB990B2C96FE0D8"/>
learning. The piece drew her attention; and ſhe ſat down and read it. Juſt as ſhe had done it, Mrs. Bloomſgrove and Rozella came into the room. Fanny read to them the letter, which was very affectionate, and cloſed with many reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compliments for the family. After ſome converſation ſuggeſted by the letter, Fanny related what ſhe had been reading, which was in ſubſtance as follows.</p>
                     <p>A YOUNG lady, who was the daughter of a gentleman of literature, having loſt, her mother when ſhe was very young, was educated by her father. As he lived in a ſolitary village and had leiſure, he devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of his time to her; and, being fond of claſſical learning himſelf, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced her into an acquaintance with ſeveral languages. The attention ſhe had paid to theſe (I ſuppoſe) made her neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſome more agreeable and uſeful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; for ſhe complained that ſhe did not meet a very favorable recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in company. As ſhe was very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wrote poetry well, ſhe thought it
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022570_0349_0FB990B60D413040"/>
beneath her to attend to dreſs and the et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquette of the polite world. Tho ſhe was verſed in the ſciences, and had been taught muſic and even dancing, yet ſhe was unverſed in domeſtic ſcience. "She can make verſes, ſaid the gentlemen wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily; but give me the woman who can make a pudding." She complained that after all her improvements, and her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to prevent them from becoming invidious, ſhe was avoided by her own ſex, and treated with the cold formality of conſtrained civilities by the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>WHEN Fanny had finiſhed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation turned upon the pedantry of ſome of the female literati, in which many ſmart things were ſaid by the young ladies, as well as by Mrs. Bloomſgrove, who gracefully deſcended to their pleaſantries on this occaſion. After a little diverſion at the expenſe of a certain deſcription of LEARNED ladies, ſhe reſumed her uſual ſerenity and dignity in converſing with her family; and availed herſelf of the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022570_0350_0FB990BC36A015C8"/>
occaſion to make many judicious remarks on female propriety, and on the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the female character. To her own obſervations ſhe added many anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes uſeful and entertaining, ſome of which I will offer for your peruſal in my next.</p>

                     <p>YOU will not expect that I ſhall give a particular detail of the evening's converſation; nor that I relate exactly and in order, all the particulars of Mrs. Bloomſgrove's judicious and inſtructive obſervations. I ſhall relate them as they occur.</p>
                     <p>THE path of life, on which you, my dear girls, are entering, is narrow, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and intricate: you can ſee but little way in the devious courſe, and therefore muſt be watchful at every ſtep you take. Life, in its beſt condition, is a mixed ſtate: thorns growing with flowers attend
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022570_0351_0FB990BFB12BD848"/>
our whole progreſs. But life is very much that to us which we make it to be. The condition of young females is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly critical, and requires to be guarded by c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nſtant circumſpection; but there are pleaſures peculiar to the female life, which, by maintaining their proper char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, will afford a full balance againſt all its difficulties.</p>
                     <p>THE dignity of that character conſiſts in an equal mixture of reſerve with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence; of modeſty with civility; of a ſenſe of the refinement of female virtue, with a degree of prudence void of affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Conſider how tender a thing a woman's reputation is; how hard to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; and, when loſt, how much harder to recover; how frail many of the gifts you have received, and how dangerous moſt of them; what miſeries have been occaſioned by an abuſe of them, and how great the acceſſions of enjoyment in life by a proper uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>VANITY, a foible too incident to our ſex, is, if poſſible, more abſurd than in the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022570_0352_0FB990C317FD6F08"/>
other ſex. Men have bodily ſtrength, learning, power, and the like, to pride themſelves upon. Beauty is the only pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar boaſt of a female; for virtue and good ſenſe are never the ſubjects of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. Againſt this folly it will be neceſſary to guard, or it will grow with years, and become as obvious as it is diſguſting. Wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ever misfortune the want of beauty may be to a young lady, it is a greater misfortune to be vain of it.</p>
                     <p>I WILL give you an inſtance, my dear children, which will illuſtrate my idea. "A youth from the country went to a neighboring fair, where were to be exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited a number of foreign animals, as well tame and uſeful, as beaſts of prey. An animal of uncommon ſize, but great ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, firſt preſented itſelf to his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed view. After ſurveying the monſter, with great ſurpriſe and ſome degree of fear, his attention was called to an animal of a beautiful and elegant form. When he had, for ſome time, contemplated the ſmoothneſs of its hair, the ſymmetry of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022570_0353_0FB990C4D20B6A50"/>
its limbs, and eſpecially the apparent ſweetneſs of its countenance, he inquired of the keeper, the name of that beautiful animal; and whether he did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> place it hy the ſide of that ugly creature, in order that it might ſhine the more by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt. The intelligent keeper admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the young man to be cautious not to be too eaſily captivated with external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The animal which you ſo much admire is called a tiger, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his placid appearance, he is fierce and ſavage beyond deſcription, and is an untameable beaſt of prey. But the one you deſpiſe, which is a camel, is a docile, affectionate animal, and highly uſeful to man."</p>
                     <p>YOU cannot but perceive, continued Mrs. Bloomſgrove, that mere external beauty is of little worth, and that deformity, when aſſociated with amiable diſpoſitions and uſeful qualities, does not preclude our reſpect and approbation. I would not be underſtood to deſpiſe, or even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue beauty. Where it is the gift of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022570_0354_0FB990C8800C5440"/>
nature, we ought to value and cheriſh it, as we ſhould all her other gifts. But if the poſſeſſor ſpends her mornings at the toilet, and under the hands of the friſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur; and her evenings in company, to diſplay the additional beauty ſhe derives from adventitious ornaments, her mind muſt be neglected, while her heart is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by flattery and poiſoned by van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. They who live only to diſplay a pretty face and a fine dreſs, can ſcarcely be ranked above an inſenſible ſtatue, or a painted image. A head without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will always appear contemptible, whether it be covered with a cap or a wig.</p>
                     <p>A FEMALE, who plumes herſelf on her beauty, is in great danger of having her temper ſoured by the apprehenſion of flights and neglects with which ſhe meets. One inſtance of this will cancel a thouſand flatteries of profeſſed admirers. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of them irritates the ſpirits; and the mind, being awake to the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of inattention, is ſo often in a ferment, that ſourneſs of temper is the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022570_0355_0FB990D29DD16088"/>
conſequence. Sicklineſs, fears, falſe del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacies, pride, affectation, and weakneſs of nerves, are incidents not uncommon to females of this ſtamp. Finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves admired without ſaying or doing any thing worthy of notice, they ſave themſelves the trouble of acquiring any valuable accompliſhments. A taſte for reading and a habit of thinking would be too much trouble for them. But beauty is a roſe that ſoon withers. With the loſs of that, they loſe the power of pleaſing others; and, what is ſtill worſe, poſſeſs not the power of pleaſing themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE, indeed, known very beautiful women, who have been educated with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common care, both ſenſible and amiable. Their beauty was doubly valuable, when combined with a cultivated underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the moral qualities of the heart. There are now to be found many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which ſhew to the world, that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males may poſſeſs beauty without vanity, and learning without pedantry.</p>

                     <p>THE next evening being very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, they were induced by the ſerenity of the ſky and the mildneſs of the ſeaſon to walk in the ſhrubbery. As they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating ſome things which had paſſed the evening before, Mrs. Bloomſgrove ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that all ſhe had then ſaid was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the character of Catharina, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of Ruſſia. In her were united vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, with beauty; piety, with poverty; humility and great benevolence, with great proſperity. Fanny joined with Rozella in earneſtly requeſting her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat her ſtory; to which ſhe readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. They repaired to the bowery; and being ſeated where the moon ſhone pleaſantly upon them, ſhe related the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of her hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>"CATHARINA was born in a ſmall city in Livonia, and heir to no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance than the virtues and frugality of her parents. Her father being dead, ſhe lived with her aged mother, in their
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022570_0357_0FB990D7002DE218"/>
cottage covered with ſtraw; and both tho very poor, were very contented. Here, retired from the gaze of the world, by the labor of her hands ſhe ſupported her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who was now incapable of ſupporting herſelf. While Catharina ſpun, the mother would ſit by, and read ſome book of devotion: thus, when the fatigues of the day were over, both would ſit down by their fire ſide, and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant feſtivity.</p>
                     <p>"THO her face and perſon were models of perfection, yet her whole attention ſeemed beſtowed on her mind: her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er taught her to read, and an old Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an clergyman inſtructed her in the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and duties of religion. Nature had furniſhed her not only with a ready, but a ſolid turn of thought; not only with a ſtrong, but a right underſtanding. Such truly female accompliſhments procured her ſeveral ſolicitations of marriage from the peaſants of the country; but their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were refuſed, for ſhe loved her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er too tenderly to think of a ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="unknown:022570_0358_0FB990D858905480"/>"CATHARINA was fifteen, when her mother died: ſhe now, therefore, left her cottage, and went to live with the Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an miniſter, by whom ſhe had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed from her childhood. In his houſe ſhe reſided in quality of governeſs to his children, at once reconciling in her character, unerring prudence with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing vivacity.</p>
                     <p>"THE old man, who regarded her as one of his own children, had her inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in dancing and muſic, by the maſter who attended the reſt of the family. Thus ſhe continued to improve until he died, by which accident ſhe was once more reduced to priſtine poverty. The country of Livonia was at this time waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by war, and lay in a ſtate of deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thoſe calamities are ever moſt heavy upon the poor; whereof Catharina, tho poſſeſſed of ſo many accompliſhments, experienced all the miſeries of hopeleſs indigence. Proviſions becoming every day more ſcarce, and her private ſtock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely exhauſted, ſhe reſolved at laſt
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022570_0359_0FB990DF257E82C0"/>
to travel to Marienburgh, a city of great plenty.</p>
                     <p>"WITH her ſcanty wardrobe, packed up in a wallet, ſhe ſet out on her journey on foot. She was to walk thro a region miſerable by nature, but rendered ſtill more hideous by the Swedes and Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, who alternately plundered it at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: but h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"ONE evening, upon her journey, as ſhe had entered a cottage by the way ſide, to take up her lodging for the night, ſhe was inſulted by two Swediſh ſoldiers. They might, probably, have carried their inſults into violence, had not a ſubaltern officer accidentally paſſing, come to her aſſiſtance. Upon his approach the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers immediately deſiſted; but her thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs was not greater than her ſurpriſe, when ſhe inſtantly recollected in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, the ſon of the Lutheran miniſter, her former inſtructor, benefactor, and friend.</p>

Her generous countryman parted with what he could ſpare, to buy her clothes; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her with an horſe, and gave her letters of recommendation to a faithful friend of his father, who was then ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> well received: ſhe was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately admitted into the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's family, as governeſs to his two daughters; and tho yet but ſeventeen, ſhewed herſelf capable of inſtructing her ſex, not only in virtue, but politeneſs. Such was her good ſenſe and beauty, that her maſter himſelf, in a ſhort time, offered her his hand, which, to his great ſurpriſe, ſhe thought proper to refuſe. Actuated by a principle of gratitude, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to marry her deliverer only, even
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022570_0361_0FB990E2C3153710"/>
tho he had loſt an arm, and was otherwiſe disfigured in the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>"IN order, therefore, to prevent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolicitations from others, as ſoon as the officer came to town upon duty, ſhe offered him her perſon, which he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tranſport, and their nuptials were ſolemnized according to cuſtom. But all the lines of her fortune were to be ſtriking. The very day on which they were married, the Ruſſians laid ſiege to Marienburgh: the unhappy ſoldier had no time to enjoy the well earned pleaſures of the connubial ſtate: he was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called off to an attack, from which he was never after ſeen to return.</p>
                     <p>"IN the mean time the ſiege went on with fury, aggravated on one ſide by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent peaſant, and the harmleſs virgin often ſhared the fate of the ſoldier in arms. Marienburgh was taken by aſſault; and ſuch was the fury of the aſſailants,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022570_0362_0FB990E9F86BF070"/>
that not only the garriſon, but almoſt all the inhabitants, men, women, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, were put to the ſword. At length, when the carnage was pretty well over, Catharina was found hid in an oven.</p>
                     <p>"SHE had hitherto been poor, but free; ſhe was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a ſlave: in this ſituation, however, ſhe behaved with piety and humility; and tho misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had abated her vivacity, yet ſhe was cheerful. The fame of her merit and reſignation reached even the Prince Menzikoff, the Ruſſian general: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee her—was ſtruck with her beauty—bought her of the ſoldier, her maſter, and placed her under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his own ſiſter. Here ſhe was treated with the reſpect which her merit deſerved, while her beauty every day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved with her good fortune.</p>
                     <p>"SHE had not been long in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Peter the Great paying the Prince a viſit, Catharina happened to come in with ſome dry fruits, which ſhe
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022570_0363_0FB990EC33F45E88"/>
ſerved round with peculiar modeſty. The mighty monarch ſaw, and was ſtruck with her beauty. He returned the next day— called for the beautiful ſlave—aſked her ſeveral queſtions, and found her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding even more perfect than her perſon.</p>
                     <p>"HE had been forced, when young, to marry from motives of intereſt; he was now reſolved to marry purſuant to his own inclinations. He immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the hiſtory of this fair Livonian, who was not yet eighteen. He traced her thro the vale of obſcurity, thro all the viciſſitudes of fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanneſs of her birth was no obſtruction to his deſign. Their nuptials were ſolemnized; the prince aſſuring his courtiers, that virtue alone was the ſureſt path to greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>"WE now ſee Catharina, from the low mud walled cottage, Empreſs of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kingdom upon earth. The poor ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary wanderer is now ſurrounded by thouſands, who find happineſs in her

ſmiles. She, who formerly wanted a meal, is now capable of diffuſing plenty upon the whole nation. To her fortune ſhe owed a part of this preeminence, but to her virtue more.</p>
                     <p>"SHE ever retained thoſe great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which firſt placed her on a throne; and while the extraordinary prince, her huſband, labored for the reformation of his male ſubjects, ſhe ſtudied in her turn the improvement of her own ſex. She altered their dreſſes—introduced mixed aſſemblies—inſtituted an order of female knighthood—and, at length, when ſhe had greatly filled all the ſtations of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, friend, wife, and mother, bravely died without regret, regretted by all."</p>
                     <p>SHE ceaſed—the young ladies ſat in ſilent aſtoniſhment at the variety and greatneſs of incidents which attended this lovely woman. The full tide of nature had prevented their utterance, and they waited for Mrs. Bloomſgrove to break the ſilence, which ſhe did after a little pauſe. She obſerved to them that new beauties

ſhe enriched her converſation with a variety of ſprightly obſervations and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable anecdotes.

"He went one Sunday to church, at the diſtance of more than two hours ride. The clergyman of the pariſh invited him to dinner, but Swift excuſed himſelf by ſaying it was too far to ride home afterwards; no, I ſhall dine with my neighbor Reilly, at Virginy, which is half way home. Reilly, who was there called a gentleman farmer, was proud of the honor, and immediately ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to his wife to prepare for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſo extraordinary a gueſt. She dreſſed herſelf in her beſt apparel; the ſon put on his new ſuit, and his ſilver laced hat adorned his head. When the lady was introduced to the Dean, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022570_0368_0FB991078CD28050"/>
her with the ſame air, as if ſhe had been a dutcheſs, making ſeveral congees down to the ground, and then handed her with great formality to her ſeat.</p>
                     <p>"AFTER ſome polite compliments, he addreſſed his hoſt—'Mr. Reilly, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have a conſiderable eſtate here; let us go and look over your demeſne.' Eſtate, ſays Reilly, not a foot of land is there belonging to me, or any of my gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration. I have a pretty good leaſe here, indeed, from Lord Fingal, but he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens me that he will not renew it, and I have but a few years of it to come.</p>
                     <p>"WELL—but when am I to ſee Mrs. Reilly? 'Why, don't you ſee her now before you?' That Mrs. Reilly! impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! I have heard ſhe was a prudent woman, and as ſuch would never dreſs herſelf in ſilks, and other ornaments, fit only for ladies of faſhion. No—Mrs. Reilly, the farmer's wife, would never wear any thing better than plain ſtuff, with other things ſuitable to it. Mrs. Reilly happened to be a woman of good

ſenſe, and taking the hint, immediately withdrew, changed her dreſs as ſpeedily as poſſible, and in a ſhort time returned to the parlour in her common apparel. Swift ſaluted her in the moſt friendly manner, taking her by the hand, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'I am heartily glad to ſee you, Mrs. Reilly. This huſband of yours would fain have palmed a fine lady upon me, all dreſſed in her ſilks, and in the pink of the mode, for his wife, but I was not to be taken in ſo.'</p>
                     <p>"HE then laid hold of the young maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's fine hat, with his penknife ripped off the lace, and folding it up in ſeveral papers, thruſt it into the fire. When it was ſufficiently burnt, he wrapped it up in freſh paper, and put it in his pocket. It may be ſuppoſed that the family was put into no ſmall confuſion at this ſtrange proceeding; but they did not dare ſhew that they took any umbrage at it, as the preſence of Dr. Swift ſtruck every one with uncommon awe, who was not well acquainted with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:022570_0370_0FB9911277B7B3D0"/>"HOWEVER, as he ſoon reſumed his good humor, entertaining them with many pleaſantries to their taſte (for no man knew better how to adapt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to all claſſes of people) they ſoon recovered their ſpirits, and the day was paſſed very cheerfully. When he was taking his leave, he ſaid, I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to rob you, Mr. Reilly; I ſhall take nothing away with me belonging to you; there's your ſon's hat lace. I have only changed the form of it to a much better one. So God bleſs you, and thanks for your good entertainment.</p>
                     <p>"WHEN he was gone, Mrs. Reilly opening the paper, found there were four guineas encloſed in it, together with the burnt lace. While he ſtayed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he kept an eye upon them, and found his leſſons had not been thrown away, as they were cured of their vanities and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of grandeur, and lived in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more conſonant to their ſituation in life. In conſequence of which, one of the firſt things he did on his return to Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:022570_0371_0FB991144A142F58"/>
was to pay a viſit to Lord Fingal, and engage him to renew Reilly's leaſe; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the poor man would, in a few years, have had nothing for his own or his family's ſupport."</p>
                     <p>YOU ſee, my dear children, the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which gentlemen of abilities and diſtinction entertain of affectation. All attempts to pleaſe by an appearance, or by manners which do not properly belong to us, are not only loſt, but become the occaſion of raillery and contempt. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeeks admiration and applauſe by means of affectation, acts as wiſe a part as the female, who, ſeeking after beauty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys her real complexion and her health by artificial paints. I have ſeen ladies, in public places, of the moſt exquiſite forms, render themſelves perfectly ridiculous by a conceited and affected air, a ſimpering ſmile, or a general air of diſdain. Thoſe ladies, who might, by a modeſt and truly female behavior, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded univerſal admiration, became the diſguſt of the company, and the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:022570_0372_0FB99115C3B71C60"/>
ſubject of ridicule in every circle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                     <p>AFFECTATION in men is bad enough, but in women, whoſe conduct ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be eaſy and proper, it is much worſe. Indeed, added Mrs. Bloomſgrove, it is generally owing to the other ſex that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation appears in ours; for no woman can become completely fooliſh, or vicious, without their aſſiſtance; and then they deſpiſe her for it.</p>
                     <p>AFFECTATION is that in manners which hypocriſy is in religion—an attempt to impoſe on others by an appearance of qualities which we do not poſſeſs. We cannot pay ourſelves a worſe compliment than by affectation: it is a tacit acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgement that we ought to be what we are not. Like a maſk, it may conceal our face; but is ſtill known to be a falſe face. However common affectation may be, there is no failing more generally deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it is uſed to hide all the other failings, and to diſplay perfections to which we have no claim.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:022570_0373_0FB9911741D8B3B8"/>THIS is a folly incident to youth, but not confined to that age. It is generally worn off by age, and by an acquaintance with the world. It is always diſguſtful, not only becauſe unnatural, but becauſe it indicates a trifling vanity of mind. It uſually ariſes from a fondneſs to imitate ſome one who is admired for ſuperior ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. But it is blind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning, and adopts the infirmities and defects of the perſon admired, as readily as the beauties and the graces.</p>
                     <p>ADELINA is a young lady who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined ſeveral advantageous offers of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, becauſe ſhe had too much virtue to give her hand where ſhe could not beſtow her heart. She moves in the firſt circle of females, without the help of a fortune; is handſome, without being beautiful; has an elegant form, and an engaging aſpect; her natural good ſenſe and lively genius are much improved by a polite education, with an extenſive knowledge of books and of the world. She is agreeable in all companies, without deſcending to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022570_0374_0FB99120606F9AA8"/>
of any. In converſation ſhe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways entertaining. She is companiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but never loquacious, or aſſuming. She can be humorous, without departing from innocence, or the delicacy of her ſex; witty, without ridiculing religion, or aſperſing characters. She never morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies any one in her company, by a ſeeming indifference to what they ſay, nor offends any by direct contradiction; ſhe rather inſinuates, than impoſes her ſentiments upon thoſe with whom ſhe converſes. Her language is pure and accurate, but not labored; her temper is calm, with great ſenſibility; her deportment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful without courtlineſs, and dignified without haughtineſs.</p>
                     <p>ASPASIA is a young lady of more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but leſs genius; of more vanity, with leſs reaſon for it. She has had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of marriage, but loſt her lovers by coquetiſh airs. She is but little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with books, and leſs with the world. She is thought, by ſome, to be a beauty, but few think her pleaſing; ſhe is tall and
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:022570_0375_0FB9912278CC6F90"/>
ſtraight, but not of a comely form; ſhe is not without animation, but is not engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet ſhe affects to be all this and more. Without a fund for converſation, ſhe ſays much, but little to the purpoſe. She uſes bad grammar, and a worſe ſtyle; engroſſes the converſation in company, and will venture upon any ſubject, becauſe ſhe thinks to imitate, and even excel, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delina. Aſpaſia affects wit—politeneſs may induce ſome of the gentlemen to force a ſmile, but no one laughs at it: this ſhe aſcribes to any other cauſe rather than the want of ſmartneſs in her witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms. Aſpaſia might paſs for an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able companion, if ſhe would act herſelf, and not affect to be ſomething more than ſhe really is. She would never appear to be deſtitute of wit or good ſenſe, if ſhe had enough of either to prevent forced attempts to diſplay them.</p>
                     <p>"MAMMA, ſaid Rozella, why do not ſome of her friends tell her how ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation appears to others, and break her of it?" It is not eaſy, my dear, replied
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022570_0376_0FB991242129E610"/>
Mrs. Bloomſgrove, to break off bad hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its; and beſides, ſhe might only attribute it to envy, if any one was to mention it to her; for nothing is more difficult than to make people ſee their own errors, eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially if they have much vanity. Do you, my dear, avoid affectation as you would a ſiren. Nothing conduces more to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a perſon agreeable, than eaſy and graceful manners. That our manners, may be graceful, they muſt be natural; for actions which are forced, are ſtiff and awkward, and therefore diſguſtful. Shun affectation therefore in all its odious forms; aſſume no borrowed airs; and be content to pleaſe, to ſhine, or to be uſeful, in the way which nature points out, and which reaſon approves.—Juſt as Mrs. Bloomſgrove had finiſhed theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on affectation, which I think you will allow were judicious, the nephew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from a neighboring county, whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he had been to tranſact ſome buſineſs of his own. As the moſt perfect harmony ſubſiſted between all the members of this

family, they ſuſpended all further conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation on the ſubject of female conduct, to welcome him home after a few weeks ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But the young ladies wiſhed for the next evening to arrive, that they might have the pleaſure of hearing more on that ſubject.</p>

                     <p>THE next day, being on a viſit at Mr. —'s where a large number of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were collected, they were entertained by the converſation of Miſs —, a lady who had been ſome years out of her teens, but had not loſt the power of ſpeech. This lady had been a great reader; but her reading had not furniſhed her with the moſt uſeful knowledge, nor the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt judgment. Her converſation conſiſted of ſuch materials, as are to be found in books written merely to amuſe the mind, without inſtructing it; to vacate the paſſing hour, without leaving one uſeful
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022570_0378_0FB99129843CFDD0"/>
impreſſion. Shady groves and purling ſtreams, faſhions, etiquette, and romantic ſcenes of love and high life, filled up the mighty void, and waſted the afternoon.</p>
                     <p>AS this lady was a ſtranger, lately arrived from the capital on a viſit, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her perpetual motion was endured with that fortitude and calmneſs which true politeneſs inſpired. But the cloſe of the day was far from being; the leaſt agreeable part of it. To a woman of Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove's clear underſtanding and ſolid judgment, nothing could have appeared more inſipid: ſhe was glad, therefore, to retire at as early an hour, as ſhe could with propriety. The young ladies, who had been mute moſt of the time during the viſit, recovered the power of ſpeech, as ſoon as they returned. Tho Mrs. Bloomſgrove never allowed them in the uſe of any ſcandal; nor did ſhe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permit them to make any remarks to the diſadvantage of any one of the company they had left, yet on this occaſion ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged them in a few liberties of ſpeech
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022570_0379_0FB9912AC2EA8560"/>
on "the elegance of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" with which they had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>FINDING themſelves once more aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in their own circle, Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove renewed the converſation which had been interrupted the evening before, in the following manner—I was going on to obſerve, when your couſin arrived laſt evening, and agreeably prevented my proceeding, that another thing which has a tendency to leſſen the excellence of the female character, and render the minds of young ladies empty and vain, is the books they read, and the manner in which they ſpend their time. Nothing can have a worſe effect on the mind of our ſex, than the free uſe of thoſe writings which are the offspring of modern noveliſts. Their only tendency is to excite romantic no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while they keep the mind void of ideas, and the heart deſtitute of ſentiment. They create a falſe taſte, without balanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the account by the weight of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:022570_0380_0FB9913378426B88"/>I DO not mean, my dear girls, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that all books bearing the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of novels or plays, are of the above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: there are many works of imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, and of entertainment, which are the moſt agreeable vehicles of pure and excellent inſtruction. But the common herd of both thoſe kinds of writing ſerve to corrupt the heart, while they prevent improvements in uſeful knowledge; and yet what a proportion of that agreeable part of life, from twelve to twenty years old, do many girls devote to this kind of amuſement! It is amuſement, only as it ſerves to waſte the time inſenſibly.</p>
                     <p>THE female mind being left thus vacant, or filled with trifling and romantic ideas, it is not at all ſtrange that the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion partakes of the ſame. The other ſex laugh at the weakneſs of ours on this account. "In order to pleaſe the ladies, they ſay, they are obliged to trifle:" and this reflection appears but too well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when we obſerve how much better reception the empty ſkull, cringing fop,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:022570_0381_0FB9913546495448"/>
who can talk an hour without ſaying any thing to purpoſe, meets among females of this ſtamp, than the gentleman whoſe head is enriched with uſeful knowledge, and whoſe heart is formed by virtuous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. This is as great a reflection as can be caſt upon our ſex, and degrades the female character in the mind of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe eſteem is worth enjoying.</p>
                     <p>IT is not my wiſh that you, my dear children, ſhould ever acquire the epithet Of LEARNED LADIES; but that you ſhould enrich and adorn your minds with ſuch knowledge, as will both raiſe you above the danger of being corrupted by the falſe taſte, or the artful inſinuation of any books you may read; and render you leſs dependent on external amuſements and empty gratifications. If young girls indulge freely in reading books of mere amuſement, theſe will unavoidably give their minds a caſt, which can never be ſuitable to the uſeful part of a female character, which is wholly domeſtic. Let your underſtandings be enriched
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:022570_0382_0FB9913982C5ABC8"/>
with attainments, which will enable you to ſhine in converſation, without affecting or even appearing to know it; to unite decorum and good ſenſe with mirth and joy, and to inſpire complacence, while you command attention and reſpect. How would it raiſe the female character in the view of the world, if young ladies would generally ſpend their leiſure hours in reading books of this tendency?</p>
                     <p>BOOKS written with a view to convey inſtruction thro the channel of the imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, are not only harmleſs and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but uſeful and improving to the young mind. To theſe I would turn your attention, as being proper to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the more ſolid parts of learning. The world abounds with works of this kind, where the enlightened authors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play genius, and a thoro knowledge of the world. With fine ſenſibilities, and an extenſive view of men and manners, they addreſs the heart with ſimplicity and chaſteneſs, in a variety of images, where the likeneſs is caught warm from the life,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:022570_0383_0FB9913E12E81A68"/>
ſentiment is united with character, and the beautiful portrait preſented to their mind.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>"WORKS of this kind are peculiarly calculated to allure the lively and the gay, who are not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to licentiouſneſs. Hardly indeed will girls, who mean no ill, but whoſe fancies are alive and reſtleſs, ſubmit to have their underſtandings attired at wiſdom's glaſs; if lovely forms and ſmiling images be not often reflected thence, to detain the eye and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the heart."</p>
                           <p>IT has often been urged that a catalogue of books, ſuitable for females, ſhould be publiſhed; but it would be impoſſible to give a liſt of books which would reach the object, on account of the great diverſity in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of intellectual accompliſhment, at which they aim; (there being no profeſſional ſtandard) in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, opportunities, and encouragements they ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally enjoy. A deſcription of the <hi>writings</hi> may be much more uſeful than an enumeration of authors.</p>

                     <p>AMONG all the writings, which unite ſentiment with character, and preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of life, Richardſon's, perhaps, may be placed at the head of the liſt; of whom it has been juſtly ſaid—"He taught the paſſions to move at the command of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon." His Clariſſa has been conſidered, by good judges, as the moſt finiſhed
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:022570_0384_0FB9913F02B8BF30"/>
model of female excellence which has ever been offered for their imitation; and yet even this great maſter in the ſcience of human nature, has laid open ſcenes, which it would have been ſafer to have kept concealed; and has excited ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which it would have been more advantageous to early virtue not to have admitted. He has pointed out dangers and temptations which ſeldom occur; and altho I doubt not that his novels were written with the pureſt intentions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting virtue, yet it is much to be feared whether the moral view is not loſt by the youthful reader in thoſe love ſcenes, which intereſt the paſſions more than the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The beautiful productions of his incomparable pen, are, therefore, to be read with caution, and under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a guide.</p>
                     <p>THE ſame danger attends the works of Fielding. They will always be read with pleaſure, becauſe they exhibit a ſeries of pictures drawn in a maſterly manner; but they may corrupt a mind not well eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:022570_0385_0FB991408BF84520"/>
in the principles of virtue. Smol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let has merit; but, on account of his unpoliſhed humor, is not read with the ſame pleaſure as the others.</p>
                     <p>ALL books which lead to a falſe taſte of life and happineſs, in which vicious characters are painted in captivating col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, their vices repreſented as manly graces, and their intrigues as genteel gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries, are dangerous to the morals, and incompatible with the chaſte mind of young females. It is a great unhappineſs to a young woman to be deſtitute of wiſe parents, or faithful friends, to direct her to the choice of proper books of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and entertainment. The little time which females can devote to reading, ſhould be employed in the moſt econom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical manner in peruſing thoſe books from which they may draw the moſt, and the pureſt ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>THE extreme inſipidity of many of our modern novels, one would ſuppoſe a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient preventive againſt their being read; and yet, with what avidity are they
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022570_0386_0FB991421EB6A3F0"/>
devoured by many young girls? The futility of many of them is an effectual ſecurity againſt their doing any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, than conſuming that time which ſhould be better employed. How much more profitably might young females ſpend their time in reading hiſtory, biog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphy, travels, voyages, memoirs, and thoſe periodical pieces where the powers of wit, fancy, and judgment, have united in expoſing vice and folly, ſuch as the Spectator, and many other ingenious writers who have purſued the ſame track? To theſe I would add geography, both as an agreeable ſtudy, and requiſite to the reading of the others to advantage; and ſome acquaintance with aſtronomy, as a pleaſing ſcience and uſeful in expanding the mind to comprehend more of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator's works, and to dilate the heart to univerſal being. To what cauſe ſhall we aſcribe the general neglect of theſe ſtudies by our ſex? Is it becauſe they have not ſolidity of judgment enough to reliſh them? or is it becauſe they are not calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:022570_0387_0FB9914E8AA1EC80"/>
to touch the fancy and flatter the paſſions? To acknowledge either of theſe, as the cauſe of ſuch neglect, would be humiliating to me as a woman; and yet what can remove juſt ground of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion that it is the caſe, unleſs our ſex can be prevailed upon to pay greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to theſe more uſeful and ſolid parts of learning? Females ſhould think, as well as read: by inuring themſelves to this exerciſe, they will qualify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the ſtations they are to fill in life. If they read without reflection, they may ſtore their memories with facts, but never will know how to apply them: leſs reading and more ſtudy and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore, would be of inconceivable advantage to them.</p>
                     <p>NO longer can our ſex complain that they are depreſſed and kept in ignorance by man, who, jealous of dominion, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to furniſh them with the means or opportunities of attaining knowledge. I am fully ſenſible that the female mind has been too much neglected in the domeſtic

ſtate, and more ſo at boarding ſchools.<note n="*" place="bottom">IT is ardently to be wiſhed that academies for the education of females, in the ſciences neceſſary for their accompliſhment, may be the future boarding ſchools of America.

to profit by them, they muſt be read with attention and reflection. Females have more time for reading than the other ſex, and actually read more books. Why then are they not as well verſed in ſolid and uſeful literature? evidently, becauſe they neglect thoſe ſtudies which have a tendency to enlarge the mind, enrich the underſtanding, and expand the heart.</p>
                     <p>IT is a ſuggeſtion unſupported by fact, that women are either feared or deſpiſed by the other ſex on account of their being learned: both thoſe paſſions may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited for the want of it, and by the ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry of ſome females. A woman who affects to diſpute, to decide, to dictate on every ſubject; who watches or makes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of throwing out ſcraps of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, or ſmatterings of ſcience in every company; who engroſſes the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if ſhe alone was qualified to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, and diſcovers more inclination, to ſhine than capacity to effect it, ſuch an one will juſtly become the object of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and contempt. In this caſe ſhe is
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:022570_0390_0FB9915B6C60D700"/>
deſpiſed, not for having too much knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, but too little; for an attempt to diſplay more learning than ſhe has. It is ſhallow water that makes the moſt ſound: deep rivers flow ſilently along, and bear down all before them. Wherever real learning appears, matured by reflection, accompanied with judgment and unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming manners, it will never diſguſt, but always give pleaſure to every man or woman of diſcernment and worth; and will inſpire even the envious with awe and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE hitherto ſaid nothing of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and advantages of reading the ſcriptures and books of devotion. I am happy, my dear Fanny and Rozella, that your attachment to thoſe writings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the neceſſity of my ſaying much on that head. There is a majeſty in the ſcriptures peculiar to themſelves; a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity of ſtyle, to which the meaneſt capacities are competent, and yet an elegance which renders them pleaſing to the greateſt. The hiſtoric part is filled
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:022570_0391_0FB9915C4909B880"/>
up with ſuch a variety of incidents and intereſting events, as to combine in one view, all the advantages of character and ſentiment, deſcription and precept; to paint the different ſhades of virtue and vice in real life and genuine character. All the human paſſions, with their various operations, are unfolded in the numerous ſcenes exhibited, and the picture preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the heart thro the medium of the imagination. Beſides the agreeableneſs of the narrative and its inſtructive tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, there is a refinement of benevolence, a ſublimity of morals, an extent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of precept and example, which cannot fail to entertain, pleaſe, and enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the mind of the attentive reader.— Mrs. Bloomſgrove was going on in this ſublime ſtrain of panegyric on the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when Mr. Bloomſgrove's unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arrival, at ſo late an hour, put an end to her proceeding further on the ſubject.</p>

                     <p>PERSONAL qualities are of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more conſequence, than thoſe which are merely adventitious, and tranſient in their nature; ſuch as beauty, dreſs, or any external embelliſhments. Fond mothers too often prefer beauty before every other qualification; and if their daughters are poſſeſſed of that, dreſs is ſtudied with great aſſiduity—vanity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by flattery—but the more uſeful and durable qualities are neglected. Cornelia, daughter of Scipio the Great, and mother of the Roman Gracchi, who makes a diſtinguiſhed figure in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Rome, was viſited by a lady of rank, who valued dreſs, and was remarkable for an elegant toilet. Obſerving every thing plain in Cornelia's apartment—"Madam, ſays ſhe, I wiſh to ſee your toilet, for it muſt be ſuperb." Cornelia waved the ſubject until her children came from ſchool.—"Theſe, my good friend, are my ornaments, and all I have for a toilet."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:022570_0393_0FB991684DD43110"/>IN Mrs. Bloomſgrove, America can boaſt a Roman matron, as in her huſband, more than Roman greatneſs of ſoul. Senſible that dreſs may make a FINE woman, and beauty command a tranſient admiration, but that good ſenſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone can preſerve what beauty gains, ſhe attended to theſe as the richeſt and moſt durable ornaments of her ſex. In dreſs and ornaments, for Rozella, her mamma does not diſregard the faſhion, but inſtructs her always to yield to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; aſſuring her, at the ſame time, that ſimplicity in dreſs, as well as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is moſt becoming.</p>
                     <p>SHE takes her daughter into polite cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; but enjoins upon her affability to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all claſſes of people. When on a viſit to her at the boarding ſchool, ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Rozella to the ball; but, to check that avidity for pleaſure which too often precipitates young girls into a round of diſſipation, takes an opportunity to ſhew her that ſuch pleaſures are to be conſidered as mere amuſement—unfit to
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:022570_0394_0FB99169CACB07F0"/>
employ much of the time of a young woman, who is deſtined by nature to more important concerns—the care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a family.</p>
                     <p>IT was under the care of Mrs. —, that ſhe made great improvements in a graceful deportment and in the etiquette of the faſhionable world. This lady was celebrated for her piety and good ſenſe; and for her attention to the minds and morals of thoſe miſſes who were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her care. Rozella's parents were not willing to place her at any boarding ſchool till they could find ſuch an one; nor was ſhe placed under the care of Mrs. —, till ſhe had paſſed that giddy age at which miſſes are too commonly ſent to ſuch ſchools, and before they have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make the beſt uſe of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for improvement. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count her preceptreſs was able to enlarge her mind, and regulate her heart, as well as embelliſh her manners; for reading the ſcriptures and books of uſeful knowledge, as well as works of taſte and imagination,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022570_0395_0FB9916F5E00BD88"/>
made a part of the daily exerciſe of this ſchool.</p>
                     <p>HAVING an exquiſitely fine ear for muſic, a maſter was provided to inſtruct her in that pleaſing art. In a few months ſhe acquired a conſiderable know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>edge of the theory, and, by practice, became a complete miſtreſs of the buſineſs. Thoſe who have a great taſte for muſic, I think, ought to be encouraged; but it is ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for one who has neither voice nor ear to throw away that time in forcing nature, which might be ſpent to more uſeful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. I am acquainted with a lady, who has long been attended by a muſic maſter, at the enormous price uſually ſet on that ſervice, and has learned to touch every note by rule. I know another, who, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er having received any inſtruction, but being poſſeſſed of a fine ear for muſic, will play any tune after a few times hearing it. The artificial performance of the one will always give pain to the company, while the natural air of the other will never fail to communicate the moſt ſenſible delight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="unknown:022570_0396_0FB99172C2283B18"/>VOCAL muſic may be more eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than inſtrumental. This falls within the reach of moſt people, and ſhould be a part of the education of every female, as well to enable them "to ſooth the cares of domeſtic life," as "to join in that pleaſing part of public worſhip which conſiſteth in pſalmody." This was alſo a branch of inſtruction at the boarding ſchool, where Rozella acquired a thoro acquaintance with that celeſtial ſcience.</p>
                     <p>DRAWING is alſo a pleaſing art, where there is a natural taſte for it; and it is an accompliſhment not altogether uſeleſs; but without that taſte, it ought never to be attempted. Neither the uſefulneſs of the art, nor the time or abilities of people in this country, will juſtify its being a nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary part of a polite education. Rozel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la having early diſcovered a natural geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us for drawing, was indulged with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of gratifying her inclination.</p>
                     <p>I NEED not mention that dancing made a part of the inſtruction of this ſchool, nor that a young lady of Rozella's activity,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:022570_0397_0FB98C966204B998"/>
diſtinguiſhed herſelf at ſo graceful an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. To be a good player is no index of mental faculties; it requires only a fine ear, with perſeverance. But to dance with grace and expreſſion, is an index of the mind; a certain dignity of mind is requiſite, ſupported by good ſenſe: and beſides, the general deportment and geſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure will partake of the eaſy elegance which is thereby acquired. "Much time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in teaching a girl to dance, is thrown away, if ſhe has not a pregnant genius: it is ſufficient that her motions be made eaſy to prevent her being awkward."</p>
                     <p>ROZELLA was to have ſpent a few months longer at the ſchool, but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an intereſting nature ſuddenly called her home, and ſhe did not return to it any more. Fanny was ſeized with a violent fever which threatened her life; and indeed it was wholly deſpaired of by her phyſician. Rozella was ſent for—ſhe flies with all ſpeed to her dear Fanny— was deluged in tears at ſeeing her, and never left her bed ſide, until her ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:022570_0398_0FB98C97524932B8"/>
became more favorable, which took place in about twenty four hours after her arrival. After a long confinement, ſhe was reſtored to health; but never loſt the favorable impreſſions which this near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to death made upon her mind.</p>
                     <p>THE ſickneſs which had left ſuch good impreſſions on Fanny's mind, gave them both a greater reliſh than ever for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene pleaſures of mental and moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Their time paſſed on balmy wings, becauſe undiſturbed by the vanity of diſſipation, and diſtributed in juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions between buſineſs, amuſement, and rational improvement. Their pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures were ſweet and uncloying, becauſe they flowed from a pure ſource.</p>

                     <p>DURING her ſickneſs, in which ſhe had the perfect exerciſe of her reaſon, Fanny was viſited, at her own requeſt, by the clergyman, whoſe miniſtry ſhe had,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:022570_0399_0FB98C98BA188F00"/>
for a few years, attended with pleaſure. It may naturally be ſuppoſed that in this ſituation, when the awful period of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution appeared to her to be at hand, a young lady in the bloom of life would wiſh for the counſel and ſupport of ſome friend, on whoſe judgment ſhe could rely. Such was her confidence in his abilities to adminiſter the moſt ſalutary advice at this period, that ſhe liſtened with avidity to the ſentiments which dropped from his lips, and from the ſequel appears to have found that ſatisfaction of mind which ſhe moſt ardently wiſhed. In the courſe of theſe converſations ſome ſentiments of importance were dropped, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a correſpondence between them after her recovery. Among the many intereſting letters, which paſſed between them, I ſhall give the two following a place in theſe memoirs, both on account of the ſentiments expreſſed in them, and of the advantage of female education diſcoverable in the eaſy ſtyle of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's letter.

                     <p>THE calmneſs of the evening, the ſolemn ſilence which at this late hour reigns thro the houſe, a prevailing incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to gratify and oblige you, all contribute to the deſign!

                     <p>MY inclination conſpires with my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional duty in exertions for the good of human kind; nor is it poſſible for me to expreſs how much your happineſs is the object of my wiſhes.

                     <p>NOT many weeks have paſſed, ſince my amiable friend, whom I now addreſs, was, to all appearance, launching into the vaſt, the unexplored world of ſpirits. On my laſt viſit, before the diſorder formed a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, I had little doubt but that a few hours would have cloſed your eyes forever upon all mortal things.—The ſcene was tender —it was truly affecting! The grief of your friends was of that luxurious nature, which is crowned with hope, and can be underſtood by perception only.</p>
                     <p>I WISH not to give pain by recalling to your view, an event from which, thro the goodneſs of your heavenly Father, you have ſo happily eſcaped. Fain would I make a recollection of the whole ſcene you ſo lately paſſed thro both agreeable and beneficial, by exciting the pleaſing emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gratitude to heaven for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of mind you experienced in the

moſt threatening moment, and for the health you now enjoy; and by offering a friendly hand to guide you thro the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious paths of youth in virtue's peaceful courſe.</p>
                     <p>YOUR late experience evinces more than words can do, what is neceſſary to render us happy in the moſt trying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to which our feeble nature is liable to be reduced. The books I this day put into your hand, will convince you of the importance of a public avowal of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which your own experience has taught you is eſſential to happineſs. Your conſpicuous ſituation in life makes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it more to be deſired, as its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence would be more extenſively felt.</p>
                     <p>AS I did not take the advantage of your weakneſs, and the alarming proſpects of approaching diſſolution, to precipitate an entrance into the pale of the viſible church, when juſt going to the church triumphant, I ſhall be juſtified in earneſtly enjoining upon the living, that incorporation with the church, which I could not think nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:022570_0403_0FB98CA88859C1A0"/>
for the dying. By a public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of religion we ſhew to the world our readineſs to comply externally with the commands of God; and by a living example of that religion, which is our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſolation when dying, we ſhew our inward ſenſe of its truth and excellence, and add our teſtimony to its reality and importance.</p>
                     <p>TO make an open profeſſion of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Chriſtian religion, of our regard to Chriſt and his inſtitutions, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to obey his precepts, amidſt the unreaſonable prejudices of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the goſpel, requires a ſpirit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and perſeverance: it may draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us the obloquy of ſuch perſons. But can we call ourſelves the diſciples of Chriſt, or expect the reward of ſuch, if we regard their unkind ſpeeches more than <hi>his</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive command, of whom it is our greateſt reproach to be aſhamed?</p>
                     <p>HOW much does it become us to obey the commands of Chriſt, by obſerving thoſe inſtitutions by which we publicly
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022570_0404_0FB98CAA1E9F08F8"/>
declare our faith in his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and by which a lively remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his love, and of our obligations, are perpetuated, and their happy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence felt in the world. If we were <hi>only</hi> to repair to our devotions, as the diſciple of quality did to his Lord and Maſter, ſecretly and by night, for fear of the Jews, would not religion, thus lonely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended, ſoon decay for want of public countenance and encouragement?</p>
                     <p>BUT it is not neceſſary for me at this time to adduce many arguments upon the ſubject, as you will ſee them fully ſtated in thoſe books, to which I doubt not you will pay due attention. May you, my dear Fanny, be directed by a ſpirit of wiſdom and prudence, and be guided in the ſure path of virtue and piety; the great end of all external forms of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion!

could not, I wiſhed not to reſiſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe which prompted me to give you ſome idea of my ſentiments on the ſolemn, and, I believe, important ſubject of your letter; and yet they are too deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a veil of ignorance and error, for me to arrange them clearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—I have been reading your letter again, and again: it ſwell'd a ſweetly painful tear into my eye.

Your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are weighty; they are convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But a ſtep of this kind is of too high a nature, to be ſlightly adopted.

                        </gap>ps, too fondly attached to the ſociety, the pleaſures, the follies of the world.

                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="unknown:022570_0407_0FB98CB06D2DDB60"/>THE truth is, tho I reſpect, tho I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely venerate the holy inſtitution, yet I never, till now, thought it my indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty to be initiated into its myſteries. I hope, ſir, you will not impute my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect wholly to inattention, much leſs to a diſinclination to my duty, when convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it. I knew my own weakneſs: I felt my heart, tho not vicious, too often cold and culpable. I had not the temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make a public offering of a luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm virtue. I knew myſelf too well, not to be afraid of profeſſional devotion. I ſtill tremble at the idea of aſſuming a character, leſt I ſhould not have virtue enough to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>PERHAPS it has been a miſtake in me to conſider an attendance on the holy rite as the reward only, and not the aſſiſtant of virtue. An admiſſion into the church, I have viewed as more properly the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and reward of thoſe firm ſpirits, whoſe ſolid and perſevering virtue entitles them to a nearer approach, a more filial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with heaven, than the enjoyment
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:022570_0408_0FB98CB2423B1350"/>
of unconfirmed and unhallowed virtue. A ſhort lived enthuſiaſm has, I believe, led many a youth to the ſacred altar, and to a ſonorous profeſſion, whoſe ſucceeding conduct, tho it could never pollute the ſpotleſs image of religion in the eyes of the good and the diſcerning, has given the infidel, and the thoughtleſs, a pretext to contemn her precepts.

I did not deſpair; not for one moment did the horrid phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom haunt me; but I could not diſpel the doubts which the humbling conſciouſneſs of my own inſignificance and my multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied errors awakened. It was one oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the ſoothing voice of heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended piety which breathed thro your lips, and bade me truſt with implicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence the goodneſs of that being, before whoſe awful tribunal, I thought a few hours would preſent me. You then, my dear ſir, added another to the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements I before had, to reſpect your counſels, to approve and obey your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, to be virtuous myſelf, that I might merit the friendſhip you have deigned to favor me with.

                     <p>LEAVING boarding ſchools to the management of thoſe who have the care of them, with this remark—The time devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the acquiſition of the graces, ſhould

bear due proportion to the time uſually allotted females to qualify themſelves to move with propriety and dignity in the important ſphere, to which the cuſtom of this country generally calls them early in life—I ſhall now return from female ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation to the conſideration of ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of domeſtic management with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to both ſexes, of great importance to the peace of families, the happineſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and the welfare of ſociety.</p>
                     <p>AS tranquillity and contentment are requiſite to the enjoyment of life, ſo alſo to improvements in knowledge and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for when the mind is reſtleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, it cannot pay that attention which is neceſſary for the acquiſition of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge; and, by indulging a diſcontented humor, is diſqualified for virtuous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. The mind will be more or leſs at eaſe, according to the impulſes of thoſe different paſſions or principles which agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it. In order to make the progreſs of learning eaſy and certain, it is neceſſary to bring the mind to a balance, and to fix
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022570_0414_0FB98CC415E40CB8"/>
its ſituation. This diſpoſition, like the order of the heavenly bodies, is generated by the harmonious effect of ſeveral pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, acting in different directions. It may be difficult to adjuſt the exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of theſe different impulſes, where the ſenſibilities are ſtrong, lively, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; but in general it may be effected, by exciting one paſſion to counteract an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and throwing in one circumſtance in ſuch time and order, as to balance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. By the conſtant vigilance of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which the domeſtic ſtate gives them opportunity to exerciſe, they may almoſt invariably preſerve harmony in the minds of children, by this oppoſite influence. Children who are dull or ſtupid, may be eaſily rendered contented: but thoſe who are formed for enjoyment as well as to charm others, are eaſily deranged; and, if a coincidence and harmony of the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral principles and cauſes of action be not ſecured by proper management, will gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally be unhappy.</p>
                     <p>

Youth, who are accuſtomed to have every paſſion grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified, will ſoon learn to fancy every ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did object they ſee; and, deſirous of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing whatever they fancy, can never reſt contented with any thing. Children and youth become reſtleſs and diſcontented, by having their vanity excited, either by hearing themſelves praiſed, or by the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with which they are loaded. By theſe means parents often blow up a flame in the minds of their children, which cannot eaſily be extinguiſhed, but will conſume all their peace in life.</p>
                     <p>MISANDER was ſelf conceited, becauſe he had been flattered by his parents from a child. This was a perpetual ſource of mortification to him; for he was often ſtung by APPREHENDED ſlights or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and ſuffered a thouſand IMAGIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARY
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:022570_0416_0FB98CCA99FD1F38"/>
affronts. He was therefore perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcontented and unhappy. Florinda, his only ſiſter, was made vain by the ſame cauſes. After loading her with finery, her mother would call her A LITTLE AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEL, and flatter her with the idea of being admired by every body, becauſe ſhe was gaily dreſſed. At the age of fourteen, ſhe had acquired an immoderate paſſion for dreſs. Being uſed from a child to be loaded with ornaments, ſhe grew up with this impreſſion, that dreſs conſtituted the principal qualification of a female; and deſpiſed all who dreſſed more plain, or leſs faſhionable than herſelf.</p>
                     <p>ROZELLA was more ſimple in her taſte, and appeared beſt in her own eyes, and in the eyes of every one elſe, when dreſſed with a becoming plainneſs. She thought not the worſe of any body on account of their dreſs, however plain it was; and treated every one with civility, whatever their condition in life might be. Rozella was contented and happy with what ſhe had, becauſe ſhe had learned to check and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:022570_0417_0FB98CCC890AD990"/>
moderate her deſires: ſhe attracted the notice of every one who ſaw her, becauſe ſhe was modeſt and unaſſuming. Florin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, on the other hand, was neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented nor happy, becauſe her deſires were extravagant and ever roving. She diſguſted every one who ſaw her, becauſe ſhe was haughty and trifling; and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unhappy, becauſe ſhe never thought ſhe had ſufficient attention paid her.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove, obſerving the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful landſcape in the river, occaſioned by the perfect tranquillity of its ſurface, which, like a mirror, reflected every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before it, took the opportunity to recommend moderation to his children, as the only means of enjoying the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of a ſerene mind. From the pleaſing images then before them, he borrowed many inſtructive and entertaining ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which he farther illuſtrated by ſeveral agreeable anecdotes.</p>
                     <p>"A BOY, fond of a butterfly, purſued it from flower to flower. He thought to ſurpriſe it among the leaves of a roſe;
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:022570_0418_0FB98CCE5A70B8F8"/>
then to cover it with his hat, as it was feeding on a daiſy. He followed it from bloſſom to bloſſom, but the nimble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtill eluded his graſp. Obſerving it now half buried in the cup of a tulip, he ruſhed forward, and happened to cruſh it. The poor boy, chagrined at his raſhneſs, ſeemed to be addreſſed by the expiring inſect in the following words.—"Behold the fruit of thy impetuoſity! Know that pleaſure is but a painted butterfly, which may be indulged for amuſement; but if embraced with too much ardor, will periſh in thy graſp."</p>
                     <p>THE other which I ſhall mention was the different appearance of Parnabaſus, lord lieutenant to the king of Perſia, and Ageſilaus, king of Lacedemon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom the other had invited to a treaty of peace with him. "The interview was in the open field. The firſt appeared in all the pomp and luxury of the Perſian court. He was dreſſed in a purple robe embroid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with gold and ſilver: the ground was ſpread with rich carpets, and cuſhions
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:022570_0419_0FB98CD699C8D868"/>
were laid down for him to ſit upon. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus, in a plain dreſs, ſat down on the green graſs without any ceremony. The pride of the Perſian was confounded; and he appeared little in the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders compared with the Lacedemon."</p>
                     <p>THE frequent repetition of ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had a good effect on Oſander, inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with a noble independence of ſpirit; and his ſiſter, who liſtened to them with pleaſure, ſaw that no part of true excellence conſiſted in parade and finery, and that, to moderate her deſires was the only ſure road to contentment.</p>

                     <p>MEMORY is one of thoſe uſeful faculties which deſerved notice before, becauſe it may be improved by early cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But it will not be miſplaced here, if we conſider that it may be cultivated to much greater advantage in a miſs in her teens, or a youth in the higher forms
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:022570_0420_0FB98CD893F204A0"/>
of ſchool learning, than in infancy, when it is difficult to fix the attention. The firſt act of a child's memory is nothing more than a retention of ſimple images, which are painted on the mind by ſenſible objects, without any idea of the relation of thoſe objects, by which the impreſſion was made, to each other. That is, the child forms no judgment about the things ſo impreſſed; for it is merely paſſive in receiving them. But the ideas formed in conſequence of ſuch ſenſations, ariſe from a capacity of judging of them. The only effectual way, therefore, to increaſe the retentive faculty, is to enlarge the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Whatever is committed to the infant memory ſhould be adapted to the child's capacity, and be of uſeful tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for the treaſures ſtored up in the memory, will have their influence in forming the character.</p>
                     <p>MR. Locke ſuppoſed that this faculty cannot be ſtrengthened by exerciſe. I believe that a contrary opinion, has been generally received. I ſhall only remark,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:022570_0421_0FB98CDA124C6AF0"/>
that there were no children in the ſchool or vicinity, whoſe memories were equal to the memories of Mr. Bloomſgrove's child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. Whether this was owing more to a native ſtrength of this faculty, or to a habit of recollecting and frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating things committed to memory, I pretend not to ſay. They were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from childhood to commit to memory little pieces, ſuited to their age and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. That theſe pieces might never tire, but be a conſtant amuſement, Mrs. Bloomſgrove, who was a favorite of the muſes, uſed to compoſe ſhort pieces, in proſe and poetry, calculated to make virtuous impreſſions. In theſe ſhe would give a lively deſcription of the tranſient beauties of the flowers, which bloom with great ſplendor for a little while, and then fade away; and would take occaſion to celebrate the beauty of virtue, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of fading like a flower, grows bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by time. Sometimes ſhe would give a little hiſtory of the humbird, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually came and drew nouriſhment from
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:022570_0422_0FB98CDC64C39B18"/>
the richeſt flowers, ſuſpending its neſt on the ſlender branch of a weeping willow. As they grew, theſe pieces were enlarged, and others, of the moſt chaſte and pure ſentiment, collected from hiſtory, or poet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhort ſketches of the character of great and good men, dialogues, and ſelect pieces. If the memory was not improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe means, the heart was. And the world now abounds with ſuch judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious collections, that parents have no other trouble than to purchaſe them.</p>
                     <p>THE following remarkable inſtance of ſtrength of memory affords a pleaſant ſtory. The fact is related in the life of Frederic the ſecond, king of Pruſſia.</p>
                     <p>"WHILE the celebrated Voltaire reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Potſdam, as the literary friend and companion of the late king of Pruſſia, an Engliſhman was introduced to his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as one who poſſeſſed ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary memory, that he could repeat word by word, a very long diſcourſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having heard it once. Frederic put him to an immediate proof of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:022570_0423_0FB98CE00D4E20C0"/>
retention, and the Engliſhman juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the character that had been given of him. At this inſtant Voltaire was to wait upon his majeſty, to read him ſome verſes he had juſt finiſhed. The king, who was deſirous of enjoying ſome amuſement from this ſingular circumſtance, cauſed the Engliſhman to be concealed in a cloſet adjoining, and deſired him to get by heart all that the poet might read. Voltaire entered, and read the verſes with great animation. The king heard them with an air of coldneſs and indifference, to which the poet had not been accuſtomed. "Indeed, my dear Voltaire," exclaimed his majeſty, "you have taken it into your head, for ſome time paſt, to ſteal verſes from others, and to repeat them to me as your own." Voltaire affirmed with great earneſtneſs, that they were his, and that he had finiſhed them but that very morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The king then ſent for the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and deſired him to repeat the verſes he had ſhewn him that morning. The Engliſhman, without heſitation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022570_0424_0FB98CE304F60CD0"/>
the omiſſion of a ſingle ſyllable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the whole of what Voltaire had read. The poor poet was aſtoniſhed and enraged, and declared he muſt be the Devil himſelf. The king did not fail to enjoy his anger and agitation for ſome time; but at laſt he confeſſed the whole trick, and the ſcene was concluded by his making a handſome preſent to the Engliſhman for the pleaſure he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them."</p>

                     <p>AMONG all the monſtrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature, there can ſcarcely be found a greater, than the heart of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which makes an idol of one child, while it neglects another. There may be a great difference in the qualities of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which is apt to induce a degree of partiality. But this is as imprudent, as it is wrong and unnatural; for where the others diſcover a decided partiality, they
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:022570_0425_0FB98CE96FD55C80"/>
cannot feel either filial piety or fraternal affection.</p>
                     <p>A MORE affecting inſtance of the fatal effects of it cannot be found, than in the hiſtory of Joſeph. The whole ſtory is intereſting, and contains a variety of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which furniſh many important leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of inſtruction. Beſides the miſchiefs of parental partiality, it diſplays the fatal effects of envy, jealouſy, and diſcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong brethren; the bleſſings and honors with which virtue is rewarded; the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a forgiving ſpirit; the joys which flow from fraternal love, and filial piety. But I ſhall only relate that part of it which has reference to the preſent ſubject.</p>
                     <p>WE are told that "Jacob loved Joſeph more than all his children;" and whence this extraordinary partiality? The only reaſon aſſigned for it, is, that "he was the ſon of his old age." As good a reaſon as can generally be aſſigned for the partiality of parents! It is a blind guide, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom chooſes its objects from the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peculiar merit. The favorite ſon
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:022570_0426_0FB98CEA919B9568"/>
is diſtinguiſhed by ſome peculiar marks of affection, which render him the object of jea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ouſy, envy, and hatred to the reſt. "His father made him a coat of many colors." Long had a ſpark of envy lurked in their breaſts, and this decided prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence kindled it into a flame. "And when his brethren ſaw that their father loved him more than the reſt, they hated him, and could not ſpeak peaceably unto him." Of all the feuds and animoſities which diſturb the peace of the world, thoſe of a domeſtic kind are the bittereſt and moſt to be dreaded. They ſhould therefore be ſtudiouſly avoided. The circumſtance which fixed this hatred, and determined them to ſtrike the deadly blow, which they had ſo much reaſon to regret after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was his relating to them a dream; which was, that "they were binding ſheaves in the field, and that his ſheaf ſtood upright, while theirs made obeiſance to his." He probably related it in the ſimplicity of his heart. But their minds, awake to jealouſy, conſtrued it into an inſult. "And his brethren ſaid unto
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022570_0427_0FB98CEC5F65D780"/>
him, ſhalt thou indeed reign over us?" Another dream of a like tenor, in which "he ſaw the ſun, moon, and eleven ſtars make obeiſance to him," gave umbrage even to the fond mother; and wrought up fraternal hatred to a perfect rage.</p>
                     <p>THE latent purpoſe only waits a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity to break forth into a dreadful ſtorm. When domeſtic jars have divided the affections of the family, and they lie in wait to injure each other, an opportunity is ſeldom long wanting to the vigilant eye of malice and ill will. This was truly the caſe with the ſons of Jacob. The unſuſpecting father ſends the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite ſon, but envied brother, to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the welfare of his brethren, who were feeding the flocks in a diſtant field. As they were ripe for vengeance, little elſe was neceſſary, than to form a plan for the execution of it. "Behold, ſay they, the dreamer cometh," and they conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to ſlay him. When the end is determined upon, malice and envy are ingenious at inventing means for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:022570_0428_0FB98CF66E718AA8"/>
the vileſt actions, and throwing a veil over them. So dangerous is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of theſe paſſions!</p>
                     <p>"COME now, and let us ſlay him, ſay they, and caſt him into a pit; and we will ſay ſome evil beaſt hath devoured him; and we ſhall ſee what will become of his dreams." One of his brethren, a little more humane than the reſt, propoſed to commute the revenge from death, to ſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery in Egypt. They accordingly ſold him to a company of traders who were going thither, where he was ſold as a ſlave. Horrid as the alternative was, it ſeemed to be ſome alleviation of the crime.</p>
                     <p>THUS ended their malice and envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a brother, hated and deſpiſed, not for any fault of his own, but for the ill judged partiality of a doating parent. But the heart of the aged parent is ſoon to bleed thro the effects of its own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence. The party coloured coat is to be brought before him, all drenched in blood. By this ſtratagem, they attempt
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:022570_0429_0FB98CF7AEB2AA88"/>
to cover the baſe, the cruel deed. It ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. The father recogniſes the coat, all ſtained as it was. Yes; "it is my ſon's coat: an evil beaſt hath devoured him: Joſeph is without doubt rent in pieces." The full tide of parental affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion riſes on the occaſion. He refuſed to be comforted, and ſaid—"I will go down to the grave, unto my ſon, mourning."</p>
                     <p>IT would be entertaining and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to follow the young captive down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, to note the various fortune of the exiled youth, and mark the ſeveral ſteps by which he roſe from his depreſſed condition to the chief ſeat of government there; his great wiſdom in becoming the ſavior of his country; and to review all the tender ſcenes of meeting his brethren, and of rejoicing the heart of his aged pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, who had long mourned for him as dead. But theſe belong not to our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent deſign.</p>
                     <p>THE ſtory of Joſeph was ſo familiar to Mr. and Mrs. Bloomſgrove, that they conſidered it as a ſerious warning to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:022570_0430_0FB98CFC4D6A43E0"/>
themſelves and all parents to guard againſt the like conduct. They obſerved that thoſe parents who had a ſtronger affection to one child than another, were blind to the faults of the favorite, which often proved its ruin. They alſo obſerved that ſuch partiality was often followed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude from the favorite child. Solic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous to raiſe him above the reſt, ſaid Mr. Bloomſgrove to the father of Miſander, they think no labor or expenſe too much: they deny themſelves every pleaſure, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what they enjoy in anticipating the figure which their darling child will make in the world. They are commonly much too ſanguine in their expectations. But ſuppoſe them quite anſwered, and that they ſee him riſe ſuperior to their hopes, yet how often does it happen that the conſequence of ſuch partial regard, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exciting ſentiments of gratitude and reſpect, is, that he feels himſelf ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to his original, and bluſhes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his parents and benefactors, who receive no other return for all their
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:022570_0431_0FB98CFD7854FD70"/>
exertions than being ſhunned in public and deſpiſed in private! This may be a juſt puniſhment upon the parent for an unjuſt partiality, but does not extenuate the baſe ingratitude of the child.</p>

                     <p>IN a family like Mr. Bloomſgrove's, where no enviable preeminence of one raiſes the hatred of the reſt, filial rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may always be expected. The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified familiarity which theſe parents ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved towards the children and family, preſerved the moſt perfect bond of union; and while it prevented a ſervile fear, it created veneration and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>THO the authority of parents is, in its nature, abſolute, yet it is by no means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with familiarity, as their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren advance in age. This indeed is the moſt effectual way to ſecure their rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and obedience, becauſe it engages their eſteem and confidence. If family
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:022570_0432_0FB98D03F1539428"/>
diſcipline is preſerved by coertion only, there can be no harmony between the heads and the members, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very little domeſtic enjoyment. Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren may by this means be rendered abject and ſervile, but they will feel no reſpect or veneration.</p>
                     <p>MANY parents ſeem to have no other ideas of family government, than that which conſiſts in keeping their children at an awful diſtance, being ſilent and reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before them, never ſuffering any pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry to paſs between them, and ſeldom ſpeaking to them but in a commanding tone of voice. In this caſe they loſe the beſt part of authority, that over the heart. The parent cannot diſcover the genius of the child, for it dares not exert itſelf. Nor can he ever know the true character of the child, for he is driven to aſſume a maſk in the preſence of the parent. There can be no pleaſure in each others company. The houſe is a priſon to the child, and the parent is the keeper. They muſt either ſit ſilent at home, or ſteal
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:022570_0433_0FB98D04C2DB04A0"/>
away to ſeek enjoyment abroad; and they never feel ſo happy, as when out of the parent's ſight. This muſt be a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition for perſons connected by the cloſeſt ties of nature and ſociety.</p>
                     <p>ON the other hand, what can be a more pleaſing ſight than that of a parent, with condeſcending greatneſs, mixing in the ſocial pleaſures, and innocent mirth of his little flock? The young mind feels the obligation; and children will be cautious of doing any thing to diſpleaſe a parent who will ſtep out of himſelf, without loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight of his character, ſo far as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their intimate friend, and contribute to their pleaſures, at leaſt appear intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their childiſh purſuits. As they advance towards maturity, more ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental converſation, and more elevated pleaſures, may occupy the place of the puerile. The heart is open to receive any thing from ſo good a parent. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and admonition have the full force of authority; inſtruction is eaſily conveyed to the heart warmed with filial affection
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:022570_0434_0FB98D07776630A0"/>
and reſpect. They need not rove abroad for agreeable and rational ſociety: of this they experience the ſweeteſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment within their own domeſtic circle.</p>
                     <p>OSANDER, during his tutelage, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der entire government, but felt no awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in his father's preſence. He could addreſs him without any reſerve, but never without reſpect; and as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards manhood, he ſeemed to be on terms of familiarity with his father, and felt all the pleaſures of friendſhip, but never loſt the reverence of a ſon. As the parent ſtooped to meet the child, the child naturally roſe to meet the parent. By converſing freely with him, he raiſed the youthful mind to a manly habit of thinking and acting. Often would he adviſe with his ſon about his affairs; and, whenever he could conſiſtently, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the plan he ſtruck out. By this mode of treatment, his ſon acquired ſome knowledge of his father's circumſtances, and of a proper method of doing buſineſs. He ſecured the friendſhip and confidence
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:022570_0435_0FB98D0AC5E1A168"/>
of his ſon, and erected the moſt effectual barrier againſt fraud, diſſimulation, and the vices to which young people are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Feeling the reverence of a ſon unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ties of familiar friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, he was holden by a three fold cord, from thoſe dangerous combinations in vice, which are ſometimes ſanctioned by the ſacred name of friendſhip; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this ſecurity, he was conſtantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving from his father's experience and obſervations.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT conclude theſe obſervations, without noticing the advantage which might be derived from a ſimilar practice in thoſe to whom the care and inſtruction of children are committed. You never can forget the ridiculous figure which young Mr. —, one of the officers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction at —, made even in the eyes of all the pupils, by aſſuming an air of wiſdom and authority which did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his age. See the vain youth, how he ſwells! and ſtoutly exerts his borrowed power! His inſtruction and government
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:022570_0436_0FB98D0D165B4828"/>
are carried on, not by lenient arts, but by magiſterial dictation. To be polite, or even civil, to thoſe young gentlemen who fell within the reach of his official power, he thought would be to let down his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical dignity.</p>
                     <p>MR. —, the preceptor at Tuſculum, treated his pupils in a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He converſed freely with them, but with a dignity of manner that inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed awe, while it ſeemed to admit them to the greateſt familiarity. His government was ſteady and firm, but not ſevere. There were few tranſgreſſions, becauſe there were few rules, and no unneceſſary reſtraints. He inſtructed more by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to them than by dry leſſons. He encouraged their aſking him queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, by the kind and communicative manner in which he anſwered them. This mode of treatment greatly facilitated their improvement, and gave him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſcovering how far they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſubject they were upon. A dry leſſon, placed before a boy, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:022570_0437_0FB98D13B5A087E8"/>
without his underſtanding any thing of the ſubject. But knowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the other way, will be clear and durable, and what is ſo acquired will be his own.</p>
                     <p>HE was not only a man of ſcience and literature, but of polite accompliſhments. He treated his pupils as rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as young gentlemen, who were to borrow their manners, in ſome degree, from himſelf. This endeared him to his pupils, and gave him an entire ſway in their affections; and it recommended him to the notice and attention of all his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers. How far preferable ſuch a teacher to one of unformed manners, who has read books, but knows not how to read men!</p>

                     <p>INGRATITUDE and diſreſpect to parents is unnatural, ſaid Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove to a neighbor who was complaining
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:022570_0438_0FB98D16939ED3C0"/>
of the diſobedience of his ſon, as they were one morning walking thro a grove; it muſt therefore be owing generally to the miſmanagement of parents. Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, continued he, in his account of the cuſtoms and manners of the Perſians, tells us that "They looked upon parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide as a thing impoſſible; and that, when any thing happened that looked like it, the reputed ſon was conſidered as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious, and probably owing his birth to adultery." This ſentiment ſhewed in what light they viewed undutifulneſs in general: and it is ſaid, that, among the Chineſe, diſodedience to parents is looked upon in ſuch a light, even at this day, that, "If a ſon ſhould ſo far forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to lift up an hoſtile hand againſt his father, not only himſelf, but his wife and children, would be put to death; his ſervants and dependents would ſhare the ſame fate, the houſe where he lived would be razed, and the ground ſowed with ſalt, as ſuppoſing there muſt be the moſt hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depravity of manners in a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:022570_0439_0FB98D1A18097528"/>
to which ſuch a monſter belonged." The gentleman acknowledged the juſtneſs of the ſentiment, and left him with a ſigh.</p>
                     <p>IN the evening, happening to meet in the ſame ſhady grove, the gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the ſubject, and ſaid—Ingratitude and diſobedience to parents is a conduct to be ranked among the baſeſt crimes. It is increaſed and aggravated by the count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs obligations conferred on children by parental care and tenderneſs. What anxious ſolicitude and daily fatigue attend the nurture of helpleſs infancy! What unwearied application is requiſite in forming the minds and guarding the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of youth! What anxieties often rend the parents' breaſt for the future welfare of their offspring! How often do they deny themſelves the conveniencies of life, that their children may have the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities? "Theſe are obligations, replied Mr. Bloomſgrove, which never can be cancelled."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:022570_0440_0FB98D1C06D592A0"/>AND yet, continues the other, after all this, how often are they treated with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect and ingratitude, and perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed for thoſe very infirmities which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental aſſiduity has brought upon them! "This ſurely, rejoined Mr. Bloomſgrove, is a height of impiety, that admits of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addition nor palliation: and 'he who fills his father's ſoul with bitterneſs, and drowns his mother's eyes in tears, may juſtly fear a ſon that will revenge their wrongs.' Such baſeneſs may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to experience, in turn, thoſe ſharp pangs which itſelf has occaſioned."</p>
                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the long tried friendſhip of parents, the continual recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of benefits, which ought to engage ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery expreſſion of duty and affection, it is an obſervation of undoubted truth, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman replied, that there are many more undutiful children than there are unkind parents. "Our all wiſe Creator, ſays Mr. Bloomſgrove, has ſo ordered it, for the ſecurity and preſervation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind, that there ſhould be very few
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:022570_0441_0FB98D1D8FDB72C0"/>
of the latter; for if parental care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs were generally rewarded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, there would not be that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid to children which is neceſſary to rear them up. The whole body of the Athenian laws, in the early ſtate of that people, was compriſed in this ſhort ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence—"Honor your parents; worſhip the Gods; hurt not animals." And by one of the laws of Solon, that perſon was accounted infamous, who treated his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with diſreſpect, or neglected that care of him which his circumſtances required. That great legiſlator never would eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any law againſt parricides, ſaying— "The Gods forbid that ſuch a monſter ſhould ever come into our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth." And it is certain that upwards of two centuries elapſed, from the firſt founding of Rome, before the name of parricide was known among them.</p>
                     <p>IN this reſpect the ſentiments of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Jews, and Chriſtians, harmonize; and the laws of revelation perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the language of nature. "Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:022570_0442_0FB98D25EE6A56E8"/>
thy father and thy mother, was the firſt command, with a promiſe" of temporal good. And the Moſaic law bears the moſt ſolemn teſtimony againſt diſreſpect to parents—"Curſed be he who ſetteth light by his father or his mother, and all the people ſhall ſay Amen." The crime is ſo unnatural, that all men will approve the ſentence.</p>
                     <p>HE then adduced ſeveral inſtances of filial piety worthy the imitation of all of every age, ſex, and condition—That of Eneas, who is ſo juſtly celebrated in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtory for ſaving his aged father from the flames of Troy, whom he reſcued on his back thro raging flames, armed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies, and innumerable dangers: that of Joſeph, who, when advanced to the chief ſeat of government in Egypt, reſpectfully bowed himſelf to his father, and made his aged heart leap for joy, by his expreſſion of filial reſpect and duty. Solomon did not loſe the reſpect of a child in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a king. He aroſe from the throne and bowed himſelf in a reſpectful
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:022570_0443_0FB98D2740CEBDC8"/>
manner to his mother. Excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples indeed, ſaid the gentleman! It was our early care, continued Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove, to habituate our children to treat us with reſpect and dutifulneſs; and that which they did in childhood from habit, they now do from principle. They are conſtantly endeavoring to repay, by acts of filial piety, the debt of gratitude due to parental care and labor. The gentleman dropt a tear and bid him a good night.</p>
                     <p>CONTRASTED to the character of Mr. Bloomſgrove's children, and the effect it had on their friends, was that of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Miſander. He was the ſon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, worthy people, in good circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but too eaſy and indulgent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Miſander did not want abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, but they had been much neglected. While young, and under the management of his mother, he was gratified in every thing he aſked for, and never croſſed in any reſpect; and as he increaſed in years, his paſſions grew without check or control. So blind was the eye of the indulgent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:022570_0444_0FB98D28CAC20F10"/>
that his very faults were converted into perfections: His pertneſs, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued into wit; his pride, into noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit; and his artfulneſs, into good ſenſe. It was thought time enough to improve his mind and correct his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when riper years had eſtabliſhed his conſtitution. The teachers to whom he had been committed for inſtruction, were deſired not to correct him, nor to be ſtrict in requiring of him the exerciſes that were exacted of other children; and he muſt often be excuſed from ſchool on one pretence and another. This farce was carried on, till his paſſions had gathered too much ſtrength to be reſiſted. He had aſſociated himſelf with companions ſuitable to his taſte, and ſuch as prevented him from being reclaimed. He had long ſince uſurped that authority over his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which they ſhould have exerciſed over him: His will was law; and as he advanced towards manhood, his deſires gradually became demands: His paſſions led him blindfold to every gratification.
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:022570_0445_0FB98D3289A26A58"/>
At an early period of life, he was loſt in a hopeleſs depravity of manners. The counſel and authority of his parents, he treated with contempt. From an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural indifference to them, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſpiſe them.</p>
                     <p>OVERWHELMED with grief and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, they follow him with tears and intreaties: But in vain do they now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt his reformation: he laughs at their impotent efforts; and plunges himſelf tho deeper into expenſive vices, and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of manners. He never ſtopped in his fatal career, till he had reduced himſelf to beggary, and broken the hearts of his parents. His vices at length un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined his conſtitution—a threatening diſorder ſeized him—Emaciated by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worn out with pain, he gave up the ghoſt, amidſt the horrors of an awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened conſcience, and the tremendous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his future condition; and, what rendered the ſcene moſt diſtreſsful, was, that reflecting upon the neglect and indulgence of his parents, as the cauſe of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:022570_0446_0FB98D34DDD1CDE8"/>
all his miſeries, he curſed them with his dying breath.</p>
                     <p>SO fatal to virtue and the filial piety of children, are an indiſcriminate gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every childiſh wiſh, and a blind partiality to all their foibles. May you, my dear ſir, never taſte the bitterneſs of diſobedient children, but be the happy occaſion of adding to ſociety the ineſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bleſſing of virtuous ſons and amiable daughters; who, enjoying the fruits of parental care and attention, will riſe up and call you bleſſed. This will be the moſt valuable legacy you can bequeath the world, and will reflect the higheſt honor upon yourſelf, while it will lay the ſureſt foundation for their happineſs.</p>

                     <p>THE tranſition from filial to frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affection, is natural and eaſy. That parent who teaches his children to look up with affection and reſpect to himſelf,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:022570_0447_0FB98D370EAE1650"/>
will not fail to cheriſh in them a recip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocal affection towards each other: and, indeed, in a family conſiſting of ſeveral children, there is a degree of fraternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due from the youngeſt to the eldeſt; of protection from the eldeſt to the youngeſt; of delicacy, even in childhood, between the different ſexes, and of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them all, which require cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, and afford the attentive parent an opportunity to inculcate many uſeful leſſons.</p>
                     <p>THE following extract of a letter which I have juſt received from a judicious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, I think deſerving of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice. "The rights of promogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo much eſteemed among the Jews, I believe, are founded in nature, and have their uſes in every family. Where the eldeſt ſon or daughter is honored and preferred by parents, a family is never without government in the abſence of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from home; and when theſe parents are removed by death, there is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid in the habits of the younger
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:022570_0448_0FB98D38A42BA0D8"/>
children for a continuance of ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a family—a circumſtance always eſſential to harmony and happineſs!"</p>
                     <p>ON reading this, an inſtance immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately occurred to me, of the uſefulneſs of ſubordination among children. There was a family, conſiſting of ſeveral ſons and daughters, who were made orphans, while they were young. The oldeſt, a daughter of an amiable diſpoſition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to preſerve the family together by her own management, which ſhe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected greatly to her own credit, and to the advantage of the reſt. The ſons were trained to buſineſs, and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were well educated in the habits of induſtry and the embelliſhments of taſte. They lived together in great harmony and affection, until ſhe had an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous offer in marriage, when they were all nearly grown to mature age, which ſhe accepted, and was happily ſettled with a worthy companion, who is now in flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing circumſtances. She engaged the eſteem of all her acquaintance, and is
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:022570_0449_0FB98D4026E492D0"/>
now juſtly numbered among the moſt amiable of her ſex in domeſtic life.</p>
                     <p>BY the eldeſt child being honored and preferred, my friend could mean no more than that reſpect which is due to a priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in age; and this is juſt and reaſonable, for it is founded in nature, and is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſociety. Let a perſon be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to you as excelling in affection to his brothers and ſiſters, as remarkable for his attention to his mother, and for tenderneſs and attachment to his family, your heart will inſtantly bear teſtimony in his favor; you will eſteem and honor him.</p>
                     <p>THE wiſe author of nature hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our breaſts thoſe tender ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies, which, while they are uſeful to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, are very pleaſing to ourſelves: and this affection ſtrengthens in proportion to the nearneſs of the relation, or the habits of living together. Therefore it may naturally be expected, from the general idea of man as a ſocial creature, and from that of a family, as the firſt ſocial connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:022570_0450_0FB98D4180A91140"/>
that affection and friendſhip ſhould prevail here in perfection. Here we are to look for the moſt perfect amity, a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that ſtands oppoſed not only to prejudice and ill will, but to indifference and reſerve.</p>
                     <p>CONTEMPLATE a whole family, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their union and affection to each other: See the brothers not only dutiful to their parents, but kind and attentive to their ſiſters; affectionate and obliging in their conduct towards each other—You cannot help admiring them; you are ſure there is virtue and goodneſs among them; you think, you ſpeak of them with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; and certainly you would prefer a connexion in buſineſs with ſuch, to thoſe of an oppoſite caſt.</p>
                     <p>DOCTOR Percival, in one of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining pieces, gives us the following agreeable mirror. "I will amuſe you with a little experiment, ſaid Sophron, one evening, to Lucia, Emelia, Alexis, and Jacobus; and riſing from the table, he took the candles, and held them about

half an inch aſunder, oppoſite to a medall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of Dr. Franklin, and about two yards diſtant from it. The motto round the figure, UNHURT AMIDST THE WAR OF ELEMENTS, was juſt diſtinctly viſible. When the degree of light had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently obſerved, he united the flames of the candles together; and the whole fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, with the inſcription, became inſtantly illuminated in a much ſtronger manner than before.</p>
                     <p>"THEY were all pleaſed and ſtruck with the effect; and they deſired Euphronius, who now entered the parlour, to explain the cauſe of it. He commended their entertainment, and informed them that a greater degree of heat is produced by the junction of the two flames, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a further attenuation and more copious emiſſion of the particles, of which light conſiſts: But, my dear children, continued he, attend to the leſſon of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as well as of ſcience. Nature has implanted in your hearts, benevolence, friendſhip, gratitude, humanity, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity;
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:022570_0452_0FB98D4C0C257F40"/>
and theſe ſocial affections are ſeparate ſhining lights in the world. But they burn with peculiar warmth and luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, when more concentrated in the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red charities of brother, ſiſter, child, and parent; and harmony, peace, ſympathy in joy and grief, mutual good offices, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and forbearance, are the bright emanations of domeſtic love. Oh! may the radiance of ſuch virtues long illumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this happy houſehold!"</p>
                     <p>FOR the exerciſe of theſe virtues, there will be room in the beſt regulated fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Many little tranſactions will be daily taking place, which, if viewed with a jealous eye, will breed diſguſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence: But fraternal love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs will, if not wholly annihilate thoſe evils, in a great meaſure, correct them. It will diſpoſe each to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the other, and to make the moſt candid allowances for each others foibles. It will ſhew itſelf in attempts to reclaim a diſſolute and vicious brother, and the tear of ſympathy will waſh away the ſtain of guilt.</p>

                     <p>THE cultivation of domeſtic affection and friendſhip, depends much on the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male head of the houſe. Not only is ſhe more with the family, and conſequently has more opportunities to reconcile the little jarring intereſts which ariſe, but her native tenderneſs qualifies her better for it. We have already ſeen Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove interpoſing, with judgment and ſucceſs, in ſettling the differences which ſometimes ariſe among children of the beſt diſpoſitions; and ſhe cheriſhed the moſt endearing cordiality between her children, and the whole family. They partook in each others griefs, and ſhared
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:022570_0454_0FB98D4F0A86FA10"/>
each others joys. A ſigh does not paſs unnoticed, nor does a tear fall unpitied. In Oſander you behold a ſon reſpectful to his mother, kind and attentive to his ſiſter, ever mindful of her wiſhes, her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, companion, and friend.</p>
                     <p>THIS is one of the moſt pleaſing traits in a young gentleman's character, and will never fail to recommend him to the female ſex, and ſecure him the eſteem of his own. They will naturally conclude, that he, who, from motives of brotherly affection, devotes his attention to a ſiſter, on account of the delicacy of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is poſſeſſed of a good diſpoſition. They will have little doubt that a dutiful ſon, and a complaiſant brother, will make an attentive huſband. A complaiſant brother never need tear neglects on a ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's part. I will pledge myſelf for the female world, that they will never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to ſuch attentions, nor ever ceaſe to return them with tenderneſs and every office of ſiſterly affection. Should ſuch a brother, in any inſtance, experience the
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:022570_0455_0FB98D55A40B1CA0"/>
neglect of a ſiſter, he would be much leſs affected by it, than ſhe would be by his: he is more independent, and has leſs need of attentions. He may act as he pleaſes; ſhe muſt always do what is proper. He can defend himſelf; ſhe muſt be kindly protected. He may ſay what he knows; ſhe muſt ſay what is agreeable. A young gentleman may be uncouth in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; if he has underſtanding, it in a great meaſure compenſates the want of the graces: but a young lady without taſte cannot by any means balance the deficiency. A brother's politeneſs to a ſiſter conſiſts in offering her every ſervice in his power; a ſiſter's, in receiving his attentions gracefully, and returning them by gentle and obliging manners.</p>
                     <p>ROZELLA is all goodneſs to her brother. The ſweet ſympathy which heaves her gentle breaſt, when he is ill; the lenient hand and aſſiduous care with which ſhe renders a thouſand kind offices, ſhew the ardor of a ſiſterly affection, and how much ſhe prizes a brother's civilities. I know a
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:022570_0456_0FB98D57CA5A2968"/>
young gentleman who is remarkable for his attention to the ladies. They are not diſpleaſed at his gallantry; but his want of politeneſs to an amiable ſiſter often draws upon him their ſevere remarks. His civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities would be much more pleaſing to the ladies in general, if his ſiſter ſhared in them. Such neglects are the more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, becauſe they wound a ſiſter very ſenſibly, and becauſe his attentions might be rendered to her without pain or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe on his part. It is in the power of brothers to alleviate their condition, and to contribute much to their convenience, with very little trouble; and where there is any ſincerity of affection, thoſe acts of friendſhip will not be neglected.</p>
                     <p>ACCUSTOMED from their childhood to be together, on the moſt friendly terms, to go hand in hand to amuſements, to viſits, and to public worſhip, and always to ſpeak kindly to each other, Oſander and Rozella lived together in youth on the happieſt terms.

Growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like a cluſter of cherries from the ſame bough, and in continual contact, it will not be difficult to confirm the union nature hath created. I have named only the brother and ſiſter in the light of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic harmony; but to a ſtranger, the nephew and Fanny appear to hold the ſame relation to the family as they do. As each had acquired a ſpirit of benevolence by always breathing in its atmoſphere, ſo they all participated in the common ſtock of domeſtic affection and tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>I WILL give an inſtance of the ſtrength of fraternal affection in the following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſtory.</p>
                     <p>"IN the year 1585, the Portugueſe Caracks ſailed from Liſbon to Goa, a very rich and flouriſhing colony of that nation in the Eaſt Indies. On board of one of thoſe veſſels, there were no leſs than twelve hundred ſouls. The beginning of
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:022570_0458_0FB98D5E8C04EF50"/>
their voyage was proſperous, but not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days after, thro the perverſeneſs of the pilot, the ſhip ſtruck on a rock, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant death began to ſtare them in the face. In this diſtreſs, the captain order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pinnace to be launched, into which having toſſed a ſmall quantity of biſcuit, and ſome boxes of marmalade, he jumped in himſelf with nineteen others, who, with their ſwords, prevented the coming of any more, leſt the boat ſhould ſink. Thus ſcantily equipped, they put off into the great Indian ocean, without compaſs to ſteer by, or any freſh water, but what might happen to fall from the heavens, whoſe mercy alone could deliver them. At the end of five days, the captain died with ſickneſs, and they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to prevent confuſion, to elect one of their company to command them. This perſon propoſed to them to draw lots, and caſt every fourth man overboard, their ſmall ſtock of proviſion being now ſo far ſpent, as not to be able, at very ſhort allowance, to ſuſtain life above three days
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:022570_0459_0FB98D5F9AB43E20"/>
longer. To this they agreed; ſo that there were four to die out of their unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py number, the captain, a friar, and a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter being exempted by general conſent.</p>
                     <p>"THE lots being caſt, three of the firſt ſubmitted to their fate, after they had confeſſed and received abſolution. The fourth victim was a Portugueſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had a younger brother in the boat; who, ſeeing him about to be thrown overboard, moſt tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> embraced him, and with tears beſought him to let him die in his room; enforcing his arguments by telling him, "that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, beſides the care of three ſiſters, who abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depended upon him for ſupport; whereas himſelf was ſingle, and his life of no great importance." He conjured him therefore to ſuffer him to ſupply his place; aſſuring him that he had rather die for him, than live without him. The elder brother, aſtoniſhed, and melting with his generoſity, replied, "that ſince the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence had appointed him to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:022570_0460_0FB98D650AE955C0"/>
ſuffer, it would be wicked and unjuſt to permit any other to die for him, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially a brother to whom he was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely obliged." The younger, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, perſiſting in his refuſal, would take no denial; but throwing himſelf on his knees, held his brother ſo faſt, that the company could not diſengage him.</p>
                     <p>"THUS they diſputed awhile, the elder bidding him be a father to his children, and recommending his wife and ſiſters to his protection; but all he could ſay could not make the younger deſiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This was a ſcene of tenderneſs that muſt fill every human breaſt with pity. At laſt the conſtancy of the elder brother yielded to the piety of the other, and ſuffered the gallant youth to ſupply his ſtead; who being caſt into the ſea, and a good ſwimmer, ſoon got to the ſtern of the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and laid hold of the rudder with his right hand. This being perceived by one of the ſailors, he cut off the hand with his ſword; then dropping into the ſea, he preſently regained his hold with his left
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:022570_0461_0FB98D66428BDEE8"/>
hand, which received the ſame fate by a ſecond blow. Thus diſmembered of both hands, he made a ſhift, notwithſtanding, to keep himſelf above water with his feet and two ſtumps, which he held bleeding upwards. This moving ſpectacle ſo ſtung the pity of the whole company, that they cried out, "he is but one man; let us endeavor to ſave him!" Accordingly, he was taken into the boat, where he had his hands bound up as well as the place and circumſtances would admit. They then continued rowing all night; and the next morning, when the ſun aroſe (as if heaven would reward the gallantry and piety of this young man) they deſcried land; which proved to be the mountains of Mozambique, in Africa, not far from a Portugueſe colony. Thither they all ſafe arrived, where they remained till the next ſhip from Liſbon paſſed by, and carried them to Goa. At that city, a writer of credit aſſures us he himſelf ſaw them land, ſupped with the two brothers
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:022570_0462_0FB98D69CFAB71B0"/>
that very night, and had the ſtory from their own mouths."</p>
                     <p>CONTRAST the characters of a Cain and a Joſeph, and you find fraternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection recommended at every point. The former, for his fraternal hatred, driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from ſociety, ſtigmatized by the hand of God, made an outcaſt and a vagabond, hated and deſpiſed by all his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The latter you behold melting with fraternal love, forgiving every inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, providing for his father's houſe, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the necks of his brethren who once ſought his deſtruction, bowing with reverence to an ancient and venerable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

                     <p>I SHALL not, perhaps, find a more convenient place to notice the manner in which Mr. Bloomſgrove's ſervants were treated, than the preſent. On the right management of this claſs of the family, and on the conduct of children towards them, depend a large ſhare of domeſtic tranquillity and enjoyment. Of all the troubles and difficulties which infeſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life, there is ſcarce one which is ſo
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:022570_0464_0FB98D6E96B32840"/>
fruitful a ſource of complaint, as the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſervants; and it muſt be granted that there is much room for it. I will hazard a conjecture, that, if the truth was known, there is nothing of which ſervants ſo much complain, as the want of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gentle uſage in maſters and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes.<note n="*" place="bottom">"IT is the government that corrupts the people; not the people, the government. Reform the maſters; and you will have no great reaſon to complain of ſervants."</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>THAT ſervants ſhould be ſubject to government, is readily granted; but this ought to be exerciſed agreeable to the rights of human nature, and with a kind allowance for its imperfections; and it ſhould be ſo exerciſed, as to ſecure their eſteem and affection as well as ſubmiſſion. How can it be expected that a ſervant will be faithful to his maſter, while he is conſtantly ſuffering injury from the abuſe of his authority? Or how can good natured and cheerful ſervices be looked for from a ſervant, who is always harraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:022570_0465_0FB98D7040B06828"/>
and irritated by the peeviſhneſs of his miſtreſs?</p>
                     <p>IN a country, where the diviſion of property approaches ſo near an equality as in the United States, particularly in New England, and where the government is founded in equality, ſervitude will be lighter than in thoſe countries, where cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom has eſtabliſhed a greater and more decided diſtinction. It muſt therefore be conducted on different principles. Thoſe who attempt to influence their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, of whatever deſcription, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of benevolence and mildneſs, will find it much more effectual, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of mere authority. They will be more faithful, becauſe obedience will be a pleaſure; and more uſeful, becauſe the ſervice will be more cheerful. Ideas of ſuperiority, and of the power we poſſeſs of commanding, may prevent our conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to court the eſteem and affection of a ſervant; but a contrary conduct ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them hoſtile to us.<note n="*" place="bottom">"ALL tyrannical governments have perfidious ſubjects; and the perfidy is nearly in proportion to the degree of illicit, or capricious power.

for awhile from fear or neceſſity, but will take the earlieſt opportunity to retaliate, and will never do any thing more than the force of authority compels them to do.</p>
                     <p>MRS. —, a lady of reſpectable char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, who now lives in —, has many excellent qualities, is famed for piety, and it is confidently ſaid ſhe has but one fault, and that is, her conduct towards her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. This indeed is of ſuch magnitude, as to abſorb many good qualities, and to caſt a ſhade over the moſt brilliant char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. It is ſaid, ſhe often entertains her friends with tedious tales of the vileneſs and ill behavior of her ſervants. She has charity for almoſt every one elſe, but none for them. She often laments, as a good woman, the weakneſs and infirmity of human nature; but appears to expect from her ſervants a conduct, which we
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:022570_0467_0FB98D7782C1FA78"/>
are to look for only from beings who have none of thoſe imperfections. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that ſome of her ſervants have ventured to ſay, that, altho ſhe is called a good woman, yet ſhe is ſevere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind towards them; that ſhe is never ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied with what they do, even when they do their utmoſt to pleaſe her; and I am inclined to believe that the report is not without foundation, for ſhe often changes them. Her huſband makes no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to religion. He is a man of quick and violent paſſions, and is governed in all his conduct by preſent feelings. But altho he is paſſionate, capricious, and ſometimes very ſevere, yet he does at times treat them with kindneſs, and is willing to allow that they have ſome merit.</p>
                     <p>IN order to make ſervants faithful, and render them ſubmiſſive to order and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, we muſt ſecure their eſteem and affection; then every thing will go on eaſy and agreeable. But, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to procure ſubmiſſion by the force
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:022570_0468_0FB98D792D24C340"/>
of authority only, the taſk will be ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and our eye muſt be perpetually over them; we muſt iſſue our orders in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory tone, and, after all, muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently endure the painful jealouſy of undutifulneſs, and want of fidelity. On the contrary, if, by our equity and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs towards ſervants, we ſecure their affection, we have the beſt poſſible influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over them. They will not only be ſubſervient to our pleaſure, but be ſo with cheerfulneſs. Feeling intereſted in our perſons, they will extend the ſame affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all our affairs, and every thing that concerns us; and ſeeing us have ſome regard to their eaſe and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they will aim as much as poſſible to pleaſe us. While this attachment ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures their fidelity, it relieves us of many anxieties and exertions, which would oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe be unavoidable.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove had the moſt entire government over his houſehold. But his ſervants were more afraid of diſpleaſing him, than of being puniſhed. They o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:022570_0469_0FB98D7EDD9B6820"/>
becauſe they love him. They feel intereſted in all his intereſts, and troubled in all his troubles. They feel themſelves rich, becauſe they think he is ſo; and they conſider all his misfortunes as befalling themſelves. He reigned ſecurely in their affection, and poſſeſſed an authority over them, on all occaſions cordially acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged, without ſeeming to be aſſerted.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove was the idol of her ſervants, and every thing depends on the miſtreſs of a family with reſpect to them. They were loud in her praiſes; for ſhe always treated them with great humanity and tenderneſs. She conſidered them as fellow creatures, placed indeed in a lower ſtation, but not the leſs entitled to kind and gentle uſage. She ever conſidered it a dictate of humanity, to render a ſtate of ſervitude and dependence as light and eaſy as poſſible. She viewed them as friends of humbler rank. She never deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to a familiarity which leſſened her in their eſteem; and if, at any time, they preſumed too far upon her goodneſs, ſhe
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:022570_0470_0FB98D8150AA8290"/>
knew how to preſerve her dignity. She was careful to ſee them well inſtructed in their duty to God, and to one another, as well as to do the office of menial do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics. In order to this, proper books were provided and kept for them; for they were all taught to read who fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of her care. Nothing could be a finer ſtroke of domeſtic policy, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from religious conſiderations. By thus appearing to have an intereſt in their happineſs, it rendered her very dear to them, and made them hold her in high veneration.</p>
                     <p>THE character and condition of ſervants requires ſome degree of diſtance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve on our part, of humility and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on theirs: but all this may conſiſt with a degree of familiarity, eſpecially of equity and kindneſs, to which they have the faireſt claim, as well from the ſervice rendered, as from the equality of nature; and if we conſider that we have all one maſter, to whom we are amenable for all our conduct towards each other, in our

                     <p>THE loweſt domeſtic is entitled not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to civility, but to benevolent and kind uſage from every member of the family. In ſome families you ſee them treated in a taunting, overbearing manner, by child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and the younger parts of the family, who are ſupported in ſuch ungenerous conduct by their parents; but nothing can be more cruel and impolitic. It is cruel, becauſe it is a violation of the laws of nature and humanity. It is impolitic, becauſe it ſours their mind againſt thoſe whom they ſerve, and renders them leſs deſirous to pleaſe, and more averſe to the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove taught her children from infancy, to ſpeak kindly to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to aſk, not command, them to do any ſervice they wiſh from them. "They are not your ſervants, my dear,"
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:022570_0472_0FB98D8441366108"/>
ſaid ſhe to Oſander, who was refuſed by a ſervant to whom he had ſpoken in a domineering tone. Caſpina, a maid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, never refuſes any ſervice to Rozel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la; for ſhe aſks in ſo kind and gentle a manner, that ſhe who does the ſervice ſeems to be the moſt obliged. Rozella never forgets her, when ſhe has any cake or fruit, but always imparts a ſhare to Caſpina. The preſent is of little worth, but the notice and attention are of ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable value. Her mamma affords her a conſtant example of tenderneſs and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſervants. She lends them every ſeaſonable aid, and never truſts one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant wholly to the care of another in caſe of ſickneſs; but viſits their apartments herſelf, and ſees that every thing comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is provided for them; and the whole of the family expreſs a moſt friendly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy on thoſe occaſions. "If one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuffers, all the members ſuffer with it."</p>
                     <p>TO the kind and affectionate manner in which they treated their ſervants, is to be

aſcribed the diligence and fidelity for which they were remarkable. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and happy in their ſtation, they were ever diſpoſed to do their duty from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of affection as well as of intereſt. It was their aim, not only to eſcape the reproaches of their own conſcience, but to enjoy the good will and applauſe of thoſe whom they ſerved. How amiable muſt that maſter and miſtreſs have been, who could thus "enchant beings, the very beſt of whom can ſcarce pardon us for their ſervitude, or for our ſuperiority!"</p>

                     <p>IN forming and preſerving the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of youth, two things are eſpecially nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary to be regarded. They are, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious effects of bad company and bad books. As theſe are different ſources of the ſame kind of corruption, I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them ſeparately, and begin with viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated aſſociates as the origin of the greateſt
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:022570_0474_0FB98D8D2ED34630"/>
evil, becauſe it commences at a much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier period than the other.</p>
                     <p>MAN is formed for ſociety; and, in a ſtate of abſolute ſolitude, there can be no enjoyment. Our joys are inſipid, when alone; and our ſorrows inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, without a friend. "From ſociety proceed all the refined comforts and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior enjoyments of life; and from ſociety, (ſo very much mixed are all human bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) proceed the greateſt advantages and evils of life. Good ſociety is no leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to attain, than it is advantageous when attained. Evil ſociety, as common as the air, is as blaſting to the manners, as that air, when it bears on its noxious wings peſtilence and diſeaſe." So true is this, that it became a ſacred maxim, that "Evil communications corrupt good manners." And it is an adage of long ſtanding, "Tell me with whom you go, and I will tell you what you are."</p>
                     <p>MRS Bloomſgrove, who appears to have ſtudied human nature with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was extremely cautious on this head.
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:022570_0475_0FB98D8DFACAA8C0"/>
Leſt the minds of her children ſhould be tainted with the bad qualities of others, ſhe endeavored to find amuſements for them at home; and when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, ſhe commonly accompanied them, or rather carried them with her on viſits when young; and afterwards ſhe and her huſband were very watchful over the characters of the youth with whom they aſſociated. Boys are in much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from this quarter than girls: they have more opportunities, and leſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they have need therefore of more conſtant watchfulneſs. If they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to mix intimately with rude, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly children, they will inſenſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſimilar habits, which will baffle all dry leſſons to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>AN intimacy therefore was encouraged between Oſander, Philo, and two or three others of good diſpoſition and decent manners. With theſe he was permitted to make a little party at home, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at their houſes. On theſe occaſions they were indulged full latitude in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:022570_0476_0FB98D8F8359E518"/>
mirth; to walk in the garden, and to gather fruit for themſelves. It was by means of an early acquaintance with boys of this caſt, that Oſander had a taſte for good company only; and it made it no difficult thing, to preſerve him free from the danger of vicious companions. His ear became too delicate for the vile lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the profane, and the vociferous mirth of the rude. His taſte was too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and elevated, to receive any pleaſure from companions whoſe enjoyments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in a gambling table, a tavern, or the gratification of ſome vitiated appetite. No one ſees his companions with more pleaſure, or has a higher reliſh for ſocial enjoyments; but aſſociates in vice have no charms for him.</p>
                     <p>LOOSE and diſſolute companions prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bane of Miſander; and theſe are the moſt formidable enemies a young man is in danger of. From the very nature of ſocial union, he will ſtudy to be aſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilated to his companions, and they will ſtrive to make him ſo, for without likeneſs

there can be no complacency. Under the ruins of ſuch connexions lie buried many a promiſing youth, the hope of his parents; many a ſplendid genius, the pride of human nature, and which prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed great public uſefulneſs. Inſtances innumerable might be ſummoned to the preſent purpoſe, but I ſhall ſatisfy myſelf with the following.</p>
                     <p>A WRITER of reputation, ſpeaking of prince Eugene of Soiſſons, ſays—"All thoſe qualifications and endowments that can procure love and eſteem, ſhone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in this young prince. A grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon, the moſt engaging affability and ſweetneſs of temper, a quick under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, an heroic ardor, a ſkill in the ſciences, and other parts of polite litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which was the more extraordinary in a prince then but fifteen years of age) united to juſtify the exalted hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him. He ſhewed a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to a military life, and at that early period was inuring himſelf to it; ſo that commonly a bare board ſerved him
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:022570_0478_0FB98D97C038F220"/>
for a pillow. The king had taken the greateſt care of his education, and ſuffered him to be ignorant of no branch of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, which might contribute to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture advancement.</p>
                     <p>"TO keep him out of the way of public diverſions and other diſſipations, he reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a diſtance from court, having apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the riding academy: there he gave himſelf up to the ſtudy of the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with ſuch intenſeneſs and application, that he ſcarce came to court once in a week, nor appeared at any public diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The apartments of the prince and his excellent tutor were full of a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical apparatus, and mathematical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; of the conſtruction and uſe of which the prince had gained a perfect knowledge, as it were by way of diverſion. He allowed himſelf no other amuſements, but ſuch as improve, as well as divert the mind; and was as fond of theſe as too many young gentlemen are of diverſions which tend to alienate their minds from any intenſe application, and render them unable to bear the leaſt hardſhip.</p>

                        <pb n="182" facs="unknown:022570_0479_0FB98D99E621F680"/>"HOW great things were to be expected from a prince of ſuch endowments, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the worthieſt purſuits, ſo cloſely applying himſelf to them, making ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a progreſs in them! Alas! every pleaſing expectation formed of him prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the event, vain! Bad companions inſinuated themſelves into his eſteem; bad examples found him unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them: when the vicious were his companions, their manners were no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his abhorrence. By aſſociating himſelf with them, he ſoon became as abandoned as the worſt of them; and in a few years, having loſt his virtue, he unhappily loſt his life.</p>
                     <p>"THERE cannot be a ſtronger or more melancholy proof of the fatal influence, which bad company and bad examples have over the beſt cultivated and beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed minds.

their eyes a youth, thus well trained, blaſted at once, and all his fair bloſſoms withering, ere they were ripened into promiſed fruit?"</p>
                     <p>BISHOP Burnett gives us the following account of the learned and pious Sir Matthew Hale—That when a youth he was too much addicted to the ſociety of ſome vicious people, which he did not break off, till an alarming accident drove him from it. Being invited with ſome other young ſtudents to a carouſe out of town, one of the company drank to ſuch exceſs, that he fell down as dead before them. All preſent were terrified, and uſed every means in their power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him again to himſelf. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſo affected Mr. Hale, who had remonſtrated againſt the exceſs, that he went into another room, and ſhutting the door, fell on his knees, and prayed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to God, both for his friend, that he might be reſtored to life again, and that himſelf might be forgiven for having coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced ſuch exceſſes. He alſo vowed
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:022570_0481_0FB98D9E244C6778"/>
to God, that he never would again keep company in that manner, nor drink an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other health while he lived. His friend recovered, and Mr. Hale moſt religiouſly obſerved his vow, till his dying day. It was this great man's reſolution, drawn up by him in writing for his own private uſe, with regard to company (among other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of conduct) to "do good to them; to uſe God's name reverently, while with them; and to receive good from them, if they were more knowing than himſelf."</p>

Oſymandias; and upon the front of it was the following inſcription, "MEDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINE FOR THE MIND." This was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the true deſign of books. But it is with books, as it is with ſociety; they are the occaſion of much good to the world, and vehicles of great miſchief. Bad company and bad books have a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar effect on the mind; they corrupt and debauch the heart, while they pleaſe the fancy. It is a melancholy reflection, that ſuch books ſhould be extant. But ſo it is. The world abounds with them; and they are generally written in order to catch the imagination of the reader, and beguile into vice and error unawares. I do not confine the idea to books of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, profeſſedly written to undermine the beautiful fabric of chriſtianity, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to all books which have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſerve the cauſe of immorality, and to be the foul vehicles of indecency, obſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and profanity.</p>
                     <p>IT is therefore a great happineſs for children to have parents, who are able to
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:022570_0483_0FB98DA3372D3E80"/>
judge of the merit of books, and to direct them to the choice of the beſt authors; and thoſe parents who are not converſant with books, ſhould conſult thoſe who are eſteemed judges of them. Much time is waſted, even by thoſe who wiſh to read uſeful books, for want of a proper ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt authors, and a judicious arrangement of them. Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove, whoſe mind was enlightened by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive reading, as well as ennobled by virtue and benevolence, had the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal direction of her daughter's reading, as we have already ſeen. Her huſband, of bleſſed memory, provided books ſuitable for both his children, and all his family. He took care to keep from their ſight, when quite young, the wretched traſh with which the world abounds. The free acceſs which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays, has poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promiſing youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſeful knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="unknown:022570_0484_0FB98DA7C0FA8CA0"/>I MEAN not to paſs an indiſcriminate cenſure on all writings of this ſtamp; but on a promiſcuous and an indiſcriminate uſe of them. Parents take care to feed their children with wholeſome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the proviſion for the mind, whether they are furniſhed with ſalutary food, or with traſh, chaff, or poiſon? How many thouſands have, by a free uſe of ſuch books, corrupted their principles, inflamed their imagination, and vitiated their taſte, without balancing the account by any ſolid advantage?</p>
                     <p>IT was never the wiſh of Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove to deprive his children of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pleaſures of imagination. But he collected for them the writings of the beſt poets, hiſtorians, travels, characters, geog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphy, elements of natural philoſophy, and books of taſte and elegance, miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, moral, and entertaining. He uſed them to give him ſome account of the books they read. This method made them read with attention and recollection. In the evening, he would often inquire
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:022570_0485_0FB98DAB7277BD20"/>
how they had paſſed their time; what they had read, and what improvement they had made; and when they had read a book thro, he would requeſt them to favor him with a particular account, in their own language, of the ſubject, the author's deſign, and their opinion of the execution of the work. In the courſe of this converſation, he would make his own remarks and obſervations, which made it a ſcene of entertainment and inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES, that they were prevented by theſe means from reading books preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to them, many advantages aroſe from rendering an account of what they read. They found it was neceſſary to read with attention, and to make the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their own, by digeſting it in their own minds; and were ſure to be ſet right, if they had miſtaken the writer's deſign. Many take upon truſt whatever they read, eſpecially upon a favorite topic, and nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſider the objections which lie againſt it. Others run over books in ſo curſory a manner, that they ſcarcely collect a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:022570_0486_0FB98DACC088DB28"/>
from what they read. They exert no powers of the mind, in order to pluck the flowers which are ſcattered up and down the unfolding pages, as they go on. If books of ill fame and bad tendency ſhould be read even in this manner, they may be ſweet in the mouth, but bitter in the end, for the lurking poiſon will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly conveyed thro the ſyſtem, and, if repeated, will corrupt the whole maſs.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER thing which contributed much to their improvement, was their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed to keep a common place book, to note the material occurrences, the books they read, the ſubjects on which they treated, with their own comments upon them, and to tranſcribe ſome of the moſt remarkable paſſages they contained. This proved a very great advantage to them, both on account of preſerving the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge they acquired, and alſo of maturing their judgment. While many other young people, who had read no leſs than they, could recollect little more of a book than
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:022570_0487_0FB98DB500B7FD90"/>
the author's name, they could give a good account of their contents.</p>
                     <p>APROPOS—I conſider it a circumſtance moſt auſpicious to the riſing generation, that our country now abounds with books ſuitable to every age, and both ſexes. From the liſping infant to the full grown youth, there are books ſuited to pleaſe and inſtruct; which beguile to virtue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hile they invite the reader to gratify his imagination. How much is it to be lamented that books of an oppoſite caſt, with which the country alſo abounds, ſhould be read with ſo much avidity by young people! and how unhappy it is "that any of our ſpecies ſhould be ſo loſt to all ſenſe of ſhame, and all feelings of conſcience, as to ſit down deliberately, and compile a work, entirely in the cauſe of vice and immorality; a work, which, for aught they know, may ſerve to pollute the minds of millions, and propagate contagion and iniquity thro genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yet unborn; living and ſpreading its baneful effects long after the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:022570_0488_0FB98DB71D247300"/>
hand, which wrote, is mouldered into duſt!"</p>
                     <p>"WORDS, ſays Mr. Addiſon, are the tranſcript of thoſe ideas, which are in the mind of man. Writing and printing are the tranſcript of words. As the Supreme Being has expreſſed, and, as it were, printed his ideas in the creation, men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their ideas in books; which, by this great invention of latter ages, may laſt as long as the ſun and moon, and periſh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the general wreck of nature. Books are the legacies which a great genius leaves to mankind, and which are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from generation to generation, as preſents to the poſterity of thoſe who are yet unborn. Now, if writings are thus durable, (continues he) and may paſs from age to age, throughout the whole courſe of time, how careful ſhould an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor be of committing any thing to print, that may corrupt poſterity, and poiſon the minds of men with vice and error? Writers of great talents, who employ them in propagating immorality, and ſeaſoning
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:022570_0489_0FB98DB80B922C68"/>
vicious ſentiments with wit and humor, are to be looked upon as peſts to ſociety, and the enemies of mankind. They leave books behind them to ſcatter infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſtroy their poſterity. They act the counterparts of a Confucius, or a Socrates; and ſeem, as it were, ſent into the world to deprave human nature, and ſink it into the condition of brutality."</p>

                     <p>ON the ſubject of religion, mankind are crumbled into an almoſt infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſchemes; and, not ſatisfied with enjoying that which their education, or their own choice, led them to embrace, have poured out torrents of abuſe upon others.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove, being a perſon of an independent ſpirit, and diſregarding the terms of reproach with which ignorance or intolerance would guard its uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, purſued his own judgment in the religious inſtruction of his family. His firſt object was, to ſtamp on their docile minds, an impreſſion of a benevolent Deity; not doubting but ſuch an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:022570_0491_0FB98DBB0B3AC180"/>
early made, would become a ruling principle of action.</p>
                     <p>IT was placing morals on a ſure foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to aſſiſt their young minds in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome idea of a Supreme Being, and to cheriſh ſuitable affections towards him, as a continual ſpring of good actions. A regard to perſonal intereſt or reputation, may induce a man of buſineſs to punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and honeſty in his dealings. A love of praiſe may excite to many actions of uſeful tendency; and a variety of motives may operate in diſpoſing men to preſerve a fair character; but no reſpect may be had in all this to any fixed principles of action. As God is the ſupreme object of all religious exerciſes, ſo a conduct flowing from reſpect to him will be ſteady and uniform, like the motive itſelf. This depends not on any preſent apparent good, nor on the opinion of the world; but on the ſenſe of moral obligation; and as the authority of God is invariable, and extends to the intention as well as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo to have this moral ſenſe cheriſhed
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:022570_0492_0FB98DBF2BCEFB28"/>
in the mind, will afford the moſt effectual ſecurity againſt vice, however ſecretly it may be practiſed, and will be a conſtant ſtimulus to virtue, tho it be not ſeen of men.</p>
                     <p>THERE can be very little doubt, that where the morals of youth are preſerved pure, religion will have its proper influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the heart. Religion is natural to man; and ſo long as the human heart can be guarded againſt acquired corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will feel a tendency to the indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of devotion. Senſibility, refined and elevated affections, will mark its char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter in this ſtate of purity. But in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as vice is ſuffered to make its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads, that delicacy and ſuſceptibility, with which nature uſually furniſhes the heart, will be deſtroyed; "and in the general extinction of our better qualities, it is no wonder that a ſentiment ſo pure as that of piety, ſhould be one of the firſt to expire. It is certain that the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be improved in a knowledge of the world, and in the arts of ſucceeding
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:022570_0493_0FB98DC11ACFA5C0"/>
in it, while the heart, or whatever conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the moral and ſentimental feelings, is gradually receding from its original perfection. Indeed, experience ſeems to evince, that it is hardly poſſible to arrive at the character of a complete man of the world, without loſing many of the moſt valuable ſentiments of uncorrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A complete man of the world is an artificial being. He has diſcarded many of the native and laudable tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his mind, and adopted a new ſyſtem of obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cts and propenſities of his own creation. Theſe are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as tend directly to blunt the ſenſe of every thing liberal, enlarged, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted; of every thing, which partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates more of an intellectual than of a ſenſual nature."</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove took great care to preſerve this moral ſenſibility; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways directed the minds of his children to God, as the firſt object of all religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. This he conſidered as the great principle which binds together univerſal intelligence, and leads all rational beings
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:022570_0494_0FB98DC981EFF8C0"/>
up to the common ſource. Without this nothing can be ſecure; no actions or promiſes, relied upon; all appearances muſt be deluſive; morality, but a name, a ſign without the thing ſignified; ſociety muſt crumble to pieces, and all things fall into confuſion!</p>
                     <p>SINCE, then, religion is the great combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power which unites the moral world, and ſecures the order and courſe of things among men, without ſome degree of which they could not ſubſiſt, and with the higheſt degree of it would be entirely happy, how wiſe a part did Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove act, in cheriſhing it in his children! As this could not be effected but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating juſt ideas of the Deity, he conceived it a duty of indiſpenſable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to ſecond the voice of nature (which has engraven on the mind the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God and the worſhip due to him) by more explicit inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE Oſander and Rozella were able to comprehend any conſiſtent idea of a Supreme Being, their mamma always
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:022570_0495_0FB98DCC4857B248"/>
repreſented him in the moſt pleaſing and amiable light; in ſuch a light, as was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to diſpel gloomineſs, inſpire love, and contribute to ſerenity and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind. This had a moſt happy effect on their diſpoſitions; and led th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> to form the moſt pleaſing idea of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character, when they were capable of receiving more rational inſtruction concerning it. At this period, they were taught to look up to God as their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father and friend; that they ought to perform his will, which is to do all the good in their power; that God is always preſent, and that not a thought can be concealed from him. Theſe inſtructions were accompanied with deſcriptions of the Deity, as kind and benevolent; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting all things for the good of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; always countenancing the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and rewarding them, if not in this life, yet moſt certainly in a life to come. They deſcribed him as the friend of the good, and the enemy of none but the wicked, whom he readily forgives
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:022570_0496_0FB98DCE8E74F550"/>
and receives to favor, when they repent. "As your papa and I, ſaid Mrs. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove, when inſtructing them one day on this ſubject, are never diſpleaſed with you, my dear children, except when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have amiſs, ſo our heavenly father is "an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the wicked only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Good child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, continued ſhe, are not afraid of their parents; and they have no reaſon to be afraid of their heavenly parent."</p>
                     <p>"AS it is a capital branch of education, I think the moſt capital, ſays Lord Kaimes, it merits great attention. It is eaſy to fortify in children the belief of a Deity, becauſe his exiſtence is engraved on the human heart; but it is far from being eaſy to fortify belief, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ruling principle of action: and yet this is indiſpenſable; for belief, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out producing that effect, is of little ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy in any caſe; and leaſt of all with reſpect to the duties of religion, which are the great and ultimate end of inſtruction. In order that a firm belief of the Deity may warm the mind to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:022570_0497_0FB98A118D8F4870"/>
in what is right, the following hints may be of uſe to parents and tutors.</p>
                     <p>"TAKE early and proper opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of talking pleaſantly to your children of their heavenly father, who loves them, and who, tho unſeen, is always doing them good; that he created the ſun to warm them, and made the earth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce every thing neceſſary for their nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and for their clothing. In fine weather, lead them to the fields, and point out to them the various beauties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 'How beautiful that ſmooth plain, interſected with a ſtream perpetually flowing! how comfortable to the eye its verdure, and how beneficial, by giving food to many innocent and uſeful ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals! Behold that gay parterre, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with a thouſand ſweet colors. See that noble oak ſpreading its branches all around, affording a ſhade in ſummer, and ſhelter in winter. Liſten to the birds which cheer us with their muſic, and are buſily employed in bringing forth their young.' Impreſs it upon the minds of
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:022570_0498_0FB98A131463ECC8"/>
your children, that all theſe things are contrived by our heavenly father to make us happy; and that it ought to be our chief delight to teſtify upon all occaſions our gratitude to him."</p>
                     <p>THE parents of Oſander and Rozella, who conducted their religious education in this manner, were happy in finding that it prevented them from entertaining any of thoſe frightful notions of the Deity, which were formerly thought to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the eſſence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eligion. In thoſe ages, when ſuperſtition reared its ſable ſtandard, and taught men that, to ſerve God with fear and dread was the only acceptable manner of worſhipping him, the Deity was repreſented as ſevere and unforgiving. Nothing could be more pernicious to the cauſe of religion, than ſuch ideas of its author. Weak minds, it rendered abject and ſervile; but the bold and the inconſiderate became totally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of religion. But as men acquired more rational notions of the Deity, the gloom of ſuperſtition diſſipated, as vapor before the riſing ſun.</p>
                     <p>

Bloomſgrove took an early and unceaſing care to cheriſh the devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in his children, while his eye watched over the other paſſions of nature, which were ſpringing up. "The fear of God is the beginning of wiſdom;" of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious knowledge and practice. But the love of God is the parent of devotion in the heart. Whenever they admired the ſun's refulgent beams, the full orbed moon, or any of the ſtriking beauties of nature, he endeavored to raiſe their thoughts to the Creator; to ſet before them his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and majeſty, without thoſe terrors that might drive them from the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, but inſpire them with a glow of piety and gratitude. In their ſeaſons of recreation and innocent delights, he would repreſent him as the indulgent parent, from whoſe bounty they enjoyed ſuch bleſſings, and who, at all times, can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow every good, and guard from every pain and evil. In ſickneſs he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them to bear it patiently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were in the hands of God, who
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:022570_0500_0FB98A160DE8CE68"/>
will do what is beſt for them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will reward their patience in a proper time. It was by means of this cheerful doctrine, early inſtilled into their minds, that they acquired a habit of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Deity in the amiable light of friend and benefactor, while awe and veneration, free from ſervile dread, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their minds.</p>
                     <p>AT the age of twenty, Rozella affords to her ſex a moſt pleaſing example of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and whatever advantage religion can receive from the luſtre of female ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, it derives from her. In the midſt of youthful life, and polite cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſhe never forgets who, and what ſhe is. She never does any thing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, without firſt conſidering whether it will be agreeable to her maker, and ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfactory to her own mind, upon reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The intercourſe with heaven which they had maintained by habit from childhood, became their delightful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, when they arrived at mature age. They fly to God as their beſt friend, and only ſure protector in every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and pour out their hearts in grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful praiſes for his favors.

with theſe worthy parents, to make their children acquainted with its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and doctrines, as their minds opened to receive them. Altho they led them on in their own mode of worſhip, which they conſidered the indiſpenſable duty of all parents, yet they were aſſiduouſly taught that theſe differences of ſentiment, and modes of worſhip, which they obſerved among Chriſtians, afforded no juſt ground of diſcord; that all perſecution on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of religion, or ſtrife and contention about modes and forms of it, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to that ſyſtem, the deſign of which was to eſtabliſh peace on earth, and to promote good will among men; that religion was given for our good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that any ſcheme of it, which has a tendency to diſturb the peace, or endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the ſafety of ſociety, comes not from God. They were taught that the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian religion conſiſts, not in external forms and appearances, but in truth and ſincerity, and in the practice of every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial virtue; that modes of faith or

The ſtate of human nature was repreſented to them as degraded by ſin, and expoſed by tranſgreſſion to the heavieſt penalties; but that a remedy is provided in Jeſus Chriſt; that the Goſpel contains the moſt aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſplay of God's mercy to a revolting world; that it is a ſcheme of benevolence, ſuited to engage the warmeſt gratitude to its great author; and that it is divinely accommodated to the nature and condition of man, and ſuited to inſpire mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, kindneſs, and condeſcenſion; that it opens the door of hope, which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man apoſtacy had cloſed; that it teaches us wherein our true intereſt conſiſts in this world, and holds up to view a ſtate of tranſcendent glory and felicity in that which is to come.</p>

                     <p>SURE I am that you will not admit Rouſſeau's plan of religious inſtruction. He ſays it ſhould be deferred till fifteen,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:022570_0505_0FB98A1D8219FE90"/>
or even eighteen years of age, becauſe "the idea which a young mind forms of God is low and unworthy of him;" and becauſe "it is better to have no ideas of God than ſuch as are injurious." The ſame objection will hold againſt cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſenſe of Deity upon the mind at all, for at beſt our notions of him muſt be groſs and imperfect: and, as to having ideas injurious, becauſe childiſh, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there can be no danger from this quarter, if he is repreſented in the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light above deſcribed. "Will not the idea of divine benevolence be reliſhed, while pleaſure and hope combine to make the morning of life ſerene? Is there a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier means of averting injurious thoughts of God, than preſenting ſuch as are juſt?" A mind, early enlightened with views of the divine goodneſs, and touched with the participation of it, is prepared to meet with temporary evils, and to diſcern good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thro the veil. But if religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is deferred till the late period mentioned by Rouſſeau, there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:022570_0506_0FB98A1F42781098"/>
reaſon to expect that it will ever be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. Such perſons muſt paſs thro life, deſtitute of the ſureſt guide; and thro death, without the light of religion to illumine, or a ray of hope to cheer their paſſage thro the gloomy vale.</p>
                     <p>"THE propriety of prayer, ſays the noble writer before mentioned, is ſeldom queſtioned, except by philoſophers."</p>
                     <p>ROUSSEAU ſays, "I thank God for his favors, but I do not pray to him. What ſhould I aſk?" He profeſſes "not to phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophize with his pupil, but to aſſiſt him in conſulting his own heart." And is there not in the heart a tendency to prayer ſtrongly felt, at times; as in dangers that human power cannot avert; in perplexity, from which human prudence cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate; under ſorrow, for which this world yields no conſolation, and under the pangs of an awakened conſcience? Was it not a dictate of the heart, which made the mothers in Iſrael bring their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children to Jeſus, that he might lay his hands on them and pray?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="unknown:022570_0507_0FB98A216CB66558"/>"SHORT forms of prayer are of uſe at firſt. As children advance, let the form be varied. Let it expreſs a ſenſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, gratitude, and a deſire to grow in favor with God and men. Let prayer to God be made with reverence. Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence may be felt, even before the object of it is diſtinctly apprehended. From that ſympathetic reverence which the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of worſhip excite, the mind gradually riſes to an inviſible object.</p>
                     <p>"THE preparation of the heart is nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary. It may be prepared by elevating views of nature:—'The heavens declare the glory of God:' they declare it to the inhabitants of the earth. 'There is no ſpeech nor language, where their voice is not heard.' 'Their awful and majeſtic ſilence ſpeaks the language of every peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It ſpeaks to the heart of every man.' Before that powerful and benign Majeſty, let us bow and worſhip. Views of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may in like manner prepare the heart. 'I wound and I heal. I kill and I make alive.' To that being, in whoſe
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:022570_0508_0FB98A24899648E0"/>
hand our life is, and who alone can make us happy, let us devote ourſelves. Select paſſages of ſcripture may be uſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe the heart. Prayer degenerates into rote, if the heart is not prepared. While you pray with and for your child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, the principles of devotion in their minds unfold. In that ſacred hour, they feel themſelves the objects of tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: they perceive that you are as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent as they; that bleſſings muſt be derived from a higher hand on yourſelves and on them. The ſtated and avowed exerciſe of devotion, is the only remedy againſt falſe ſhame; the ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot overcome it. Let parents who believe in the efficacy of prayer, and who are yet aſhamed to pray, deliver their children from the ſame temptation. When the habit of praying daily is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, devout thoughts aſſociate with the hour of prayer. The impreſſion of God's preſence, often renewed, checks tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtrengthens virtue, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes tranquillity of mind on a good foundation."</p>

<pb n="213" facs="unknown:022570_0510_0FB98A28115433F8"/>
Then ſhould the heart ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly riſe into the admiration of what is great; glow with the love of what is fair and excellent; and melt at the diſcovery of tenderneſs and goodneſs: and where, my dear children, can any object be found, ſo proper to kindle theſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the great Father of the univerſe, and the Author of all theſe beauties, which afford ſo much pleaſure to the eye? If the grandeur and majeſty, which his works every where diſplay have ſo agreeable an effect on the mind, what reverence and pleaſing awe muſt the contemplation of his moral character inſpire?—He was here interrupted a few minutes, by the arrival of Philo and his ſiſter Aurelia, who had called on the young gentlemen and ladies. After the introductory ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were over, they made ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the beautiful ſcenery which lay before them. Yes, ſaid Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove, I was juſt conducting the minds of your young friends thro theſe effects, up to their original cauſe; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:022570_0511_0FB98A2A0F1F75C0"/>
to Philo and his ſiſter, who were amiable youths, the ſubſtance of what he had been ſaying; and added; you cannot, ſurely, my dear friends, view that profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of good, which, in this pleaſing ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of life, the beneficent hand of heaven pours around you, without emotions of gratitude. God is ſeen in his works and felt in his favors.</p>
                     <p>YOU are now capable of taſting the pleaſures of admiration and praiſe, of truſt and confidence, of ſociety and friendſhip. Happy in the love and eſteem of your connexions and friends, you are to look up to the author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the inſpirer of all the friendſhip which has been ſhewn you by others; himſelf your beſt friend, the ſupporter of your infancy, the guide of your child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, now, the guardian of your youth, and the hope of your coming years. You ſhould conſider religious homage as a natural expreſſion of gratitude to him, for all his goodneſs; and let not your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion be the cold and barren offspring of ſpeculation, but the warm and vigorous
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:022570_0512_0FB98A2B8E4774E0"/>
dictate of the heart, guided by the light of the underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove was prevented fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the delightful ſubject any further at that time, by the approach of night. Fearing that the heavy dew, which began to fall, might injure their health, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed returning to the houſe. As they were paſſing thro the ſpiral walk, which aſcended from the river to the ſummit of the hill, inhaling the ambroſial ſweets which perfumed the air, he took occaſion to diſplay the beauties of virtue, and the ſweet fragrance of innocence, by analogy. His converſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enlivened by thoſe nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural and ſtriking figures, appeared to his youthful friends, like "apples of gold in pictures of ſilver."</p>
                     <p>THIS converſation, united to the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antneſs of the ſcene, had ſo engaged their attention, that they were ſurpriſed to find themſelves ſo ſoon arrived at the houſe. Here Rozella entertained the company with a few ſprightly airs on the harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord, interluded by many pleaſantries
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:022570_0513_0FB98A2C81756DA8"/>
between the young people. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galed themſelves with fruit, and enjoyed a ſocial hour in youthful amuſement, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia reminded Mr. Bloomſgrove that he had promiſed to entertain them with ſome account of the true art of pleaſing, and very modeſtly ſaid ſhe hoped he would now gratify them. Mr. Bloomſgrove, pleaſed at the delicate manner in which Aurelia expreſſed her wiſh, replied, with a ſmile, "I find promiſes made to young ladies are of indiſpenſable obligation. But previous to that, I will entertain you with a number or two of Mr. Addiſon's Spectator, (which he then had in his hand) on a ſimilar ſubject, if it is agreeable." They all joined in requeſting him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and, having read the numbers he propoſed,<note n="*" place="bottom">HOW much more rationally might many of the ſocial hours of young people be employed in reading ſome book of entertainment and improvement, than in the too common cuſtom of waſting them at cards, or in vain and unmeaning converſation.</note> he complied with Aurelia's requeſt, which was, indeed, the wiſh of all the company. The ſubſtance of what he
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:022570_0514_0FB98A2E04C13578"/>
ſaid on that ſubject, I ſhall endeavor to collect and tranſmit you by the next poſt.</p>

                     <p>TO render ourſelves agreeable to each other by ſoft and graceful manners, is a dictate of humanity. To do this from principles of benevolence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſſimulation, is among the leading precepts of Chriſtianity. I am ſorry to find that polite writers have recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the art of pleaſing upon different grounds. Some learned writers, of auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere virtue, have condemned the art of pleaſing, not only as having no connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with religion, but as inconſiſtent with the purity and ſimplicity of its doctrines. While others, inattentive to true excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, have conſidered religion either as incompatible with, or no ways related to the art of pleaſing. The former we ſhall diſmiſs, with their brother Diogenes, to
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:022570_0515_0FB98A2F9583DBB8"/>
his ſolitary tub, and endeavor to rectify the miſtaken notion of the other.</p>
                     <p>IF the true art of pleaſing conſiſts in an appearance of good diſpoſitions and amiable qualities, exhibited in an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light, then the perfection of this art muſt conſiſt in poſſeſſing the qualities which we would diſplay. For the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt certainly be more agreeable than an appearance only. Can any one be more pleaſed with flattery and deceit than with truth and ſincerity? Can ſoftneſs and plauſibility of manners atone for the want of benevolence and generoſity? Or can attention, aſſiduity, and gracefulneſs, compenſate for meanneſs of ſpirit, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, ſelfiſhneſs, and a total want of thoſe virtues which can flow only from oppoſite paſſions?</p>
                     <p>I WOULD recommend to you, my young friends, to exalt the talent of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ove the fraudful arts of flattery and deceit: place it in the rank of virtues ſounded upon principle, and on the beſt diſpoſitions of human nature. Indeed,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:022570_0516_0FB98A311B2A4110"/>
the virtues and the graces are much more nearly allied, than thoſe who are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of the latter, without poſſeſſing the former, are ſenſible of. The moral virtues, when clearly underſtood and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practice, afford an aſſemblage of every thing beautiful and excellent; and what can be more agreeable than that placid ſerenity, by which image the true character of religion is deſcribed? You will readily allow that good coin is, in all caſes, preferable to counterfeit; and it will never fail of having a currency from its own intrinſic value. As much more valuable, and ſure of ſucceſs, are attempts to pleaſe, when excited by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and religion (to which all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments of external gracefulneſs may be added) than the tinſel outſide of falſe pretenders, with all their duplicity.</p>
                     <p>WHAT can be more conducive to the true art of pleaſing, than that gentleneſs of diſpoſition and manners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that pliability of temper and conduct, which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime morality of the goſpel recommends?
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:022570_0517_0FB98A330F98CC40"/>
Whatever is malignant in its nature, or hurtful in its tendency, religion roots out or corrects; and inculcates whatever is juſt, mild, and candid. By curing the heart of its moral diſorders, eradicating pride, envy, malice, and all the malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions, it deſtroys the ſource of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing diſagreeable in manners; and, by inculcating the oppoſite diſpoſitions, promotes a ſyſtem of conduct, which, without any guile or deceit, cannot fail of being agreeable.</p>
                     <p>TO form an opinion of the different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that pleaſing art which flows from principle, and that which is void of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, contraſt the character of Mr. M— with that of Mr. N—. The former is diſtinguiſhed by the ſoftneſs and gentleneſs of his addreſs: aſſiduous to pleaſe, he aſſumes every appearance of benevolence, generoſity, and friendſhip, eſpecially towards people of faſhion and fortune; and his attentions, aſſiduities, and gracefulneſs, procure him a favorable reception among thoſe who are pleaſed
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:022570_0518_0FB98A34017F4148"/>
with varniſhed qualities, which are not ſupported by any thing within correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding to them. Under this diſguiſe, lurk meanneſs, ſelfiſhneſs, and avarice. In his private character, he is as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for cruelty to his ſervants, unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs to the poor, and the want even of an appearance of friendſhip or benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to thoſe, whoſe riches or rank do not lead him to cultivate their favor, as he is for the elegance of his manners in polite circles.</p>
                     <p>ON the other hand, Mr. N—, whoſe actions are the true index of his heart, poſſeſſes qualities equally capable of pleaſing all, without the danger of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending any by the want of virtue and benevolence. To the polite addreſs of an accompliſhed gentleman, he unites all the virtues of the Chriſtian. He evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derives his talent at pleaſing, not from the ſtudy of the world, not from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of qualities which diſguiſe real deformities; but from the amiable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the heart, expreſſed in his grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:022570_0519_0FB98A35E68C06D8"/>
and obliging manners. As he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the ſubſtantial powers of pleaſing, poliſhed by a taſte for ſociety, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no neceſſity of injuring his conſcious feelings, by aſſuming deceitful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances without any reality: and, what is of more conſequence to his happineſs, than pleaſing others, he will be ſatisfied with himſelf; and, on a review of life, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy tranquillity of mind, unalloyed by the recollection of treachery and deceit.— The converſation was here interrupted by the arrival of Angelina, Fanny's ſiſter, who, combining in one fair form all the virtues and the graces, was juſtly entitled to the elegant perſon and ample fortune of young Mr. —, to whom ſhe had been united in marriage a few months ſince: and Philo and his ſiſter returned home much pleaſed with THE ART OF PLEASING.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>"IT is certain that the art of pleaſing which is founded on ſincere principles, and derived from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality, is as far ſuperior to that baſe art, which conſiſts in ſimulation and diſſimulation, as the roſeate hue on the cheek of Hebe, to the painted viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of an haggard courtezan."—</p>

                     <p>IT is a circumſtance very deſirable, that parents ſhould be agreed in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the importance of obſerving the ſabbath, and of attending upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip with their families. An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on public worſhip has ever been conſidered, by all wiſe and good men, a
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:022570_0521_0FB98A3CA3746A80"/>
decent avowal of piety. It was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of one of this character, that— "In the ſolemn aſſembly, the diſtinction of ranks is ſuſpended, mutual benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence kindles, and the fire of devotion burns: the laws of God are heard with reverence. Tho the effects of ſocial worſhip are not always felt, thro the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the worſhipper, or the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of thoſe who miniſter; ſtill one of juſt and liberal ſentiments, will add the weight of his example to an inſtitution, which, with all its imperfections, promotes a ſenſe of God and of moral obligation among men."</p>
                     <p>SATISFIED that all religion ſtands or falls with this, Mr. and Mrs. Bloomſgrove accuſtomed their children and family to a decent obſervance of that day, ſacred to inſtruction and piety. That they might derive every poſſible advantage from an inſtitution ſo admirably fitted to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the preſent life, they roſe at an early hour to hail the welcome day; and, having offered the morning incenſe on the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:022570_0522_0FB98A3DCDA73570"/>
domeſtic altar, they repaired conſtantly to the place of public worſhip; alluring their family to a cheerful attendance by motives ſuited to their age and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the beauty and order of worſhip, and by their own example, and that of others.</p>
                     <p>HAVING eſtabliſhed the practice of a ſteady attendance, they found no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in continuing it; and nothing could exceed the beauty of this little flock, moving together in ſolemn pace, to pay their devout attendance on the ordinances of religion. Every member of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who could poſſibly be ſpared from the neceſſary offices of a domeſtic ſtate, always appeared at both public ſervices of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. They never ſuffered them to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from one place of worſhip to another; not from want of charity to all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but to avoid an appearance of levity, and of diſreſpect to their own miniſter, and the church to which they belonged. Great regard was had to thoſe whoſe ſervile ſtate made their abſence
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:022570_0523_0FB98A3F47DFE268"/>
ſometimes unavoidable: their ſervice was alleviated as much as poſſible on that day; and whenever circumſtances would admit, their attendance was regarded as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty.</p>
                     <p>THOSE parents and houſeholders, who think it their indiſpenſable duty to pay their devotions at the houſe of worſhip themſelves, muſt be ſenſible that duty binds with equal force to ſee that their children and domeſtics regularly attend upon it alſo. Their attendance was not only conſtant but punctual, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an exemplary decency in their external deportment. I the rather mention theſe circumſtances, becauſe there are many who wiſh to educate their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren well, and yet pay very little attention to theſe means of improvement. They appear never to have conſidered, of how great importance they are to domeſtic ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation. A well regulated houſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip is a ſchool of refinement and good manners, as well as of inſtruction and devotion. What plan could be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:022570_0524_0FB98A414DCCF968"/>
of, as having a ſtronger tendency to correct the follies, and form the morals of youth, than a ſteady attendance on ſocial worſhip with thoſe, whoſe decent and rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erent behavior inſpires them with the love of order and propriety, and gives them exalted ideas of their Maker?</p>
                     <p>THAT no kind of influence might be wanting to render the public ſervices uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the family, the worthy clergyman, whoſe miniſtry they attended, was treated with every mark of reſpect by them; and was often made a gueſt at their hoſpitable table and in their friendly circles. The learning, politeneſs, and piety of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable miniſter of religion, rendered his company always agreeable and profitable. Eaſy and affable in his manners, the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren liſten with pleaſure to his obſervations on various ſubjects. Charmed with his delicate manner of expreſſing himſelf, and delighted with the beautiful images by which he would repreſent the excellence of virtue and religion, they wiſhed to be poſſeſſed of that, to which he gave ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:022570_0525_0FB98A424EB63088"/>
a form. Often would he amuſe them with entertaining ſtories and anecdotes, ſuited to catch the ear and reach the heart; and in turn would hear their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and pleaſantly ſhew them how to draw a moral from them.</p>
                     <p>MRS. Bloomſgrove uſually ſpent ſome time, after the ſervices of the Lord's day were over, with her children and domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, inſtructing them in the principles of religion and virtue, following her inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with advice and counſel. Moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately would ſhe preſs it upon them to regard their Maker as their beſt friend, and the practice of virtue and piety as their higheſt wiſdom; and ſhe was able to ſay in language of maternal affection— "My dear children, be ye followers of me, even as I am of Chriſt."</p>
                     <p>I HAVE mentioned Mrs. Bloomſgrove, becauſe theſe exerciſes commonly fall to the mother's lot; and, to the early care of pious mothers, are we generally to aſcribe the firſt dawnings of true wiſdom: But Mr. Bloomſgrove was not wanting in due
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:022570_0526_0FB98A4430FB3710"/>
attention to whatever practice would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a ſpirit of piety and virtue among his houſehold. Attendance on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip was not the only exemplary exerciſe of the ſabbath with him. In ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to domeſtic worſhip, reading the ſcriptures and books of rational devotion, he aſſiſted them in refreſhing their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories, and impreſſing their minds with what they had heard. Theſe exerciſes, conducted in an eaſy familiar manner, and ſo varied as to have the air of novelty, never appeared long and tedious; but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the attention, and informed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, while they warmed the heart. Other advantages beſides inſtruction aroſe from this practice. It preſerved the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily together on the ſabbath, a thing of great conſequence to domeſtic order. It prevented the reprehenſible practice of viſits, parties, and of vain and uſeleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, by which all good influence from public inſtruction is often loſt.</p>
                     <p>MARK well the happy effects of all this care and pains! With what pleaſure do they aſſemble together for the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:022570_0527_0FB98A454E22C640"/>
purpoſes! What ſerene cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mingles with the ſeriouſneſs of the parents! With what attention do the children and ſervants liſten to the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which, like the gentle dew of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, diſtil from their lips! Sweet was the harmony which prevailed; and happy the effects which this practice produced in their temper and manners! This houſe was a lively emblem of the fair manſions above. Their days flowed ſweetly on, unembittered by contention, undiſturbed by reflections on the paſt, or anticipations of the future. They accounted the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a delight, the holy of the Lord, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable; and the church of Chriſt the gate of heaven: and tho rich in the goods of fortune, and high on the liſt of fame, yet they eſteemed religion to be their chief riches; and that it was their higheſt hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to be numbered among the diſciples of the humble Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>LET the vain and the giddy, if they will, condemn all this as ſuperſtition and bigotry; it adds dignity and amiableneſs to the eminent character of Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove,

while it ſpreads the genial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of religion thro his houſe. Let them who will, conceive of religion as inimical to cheerfulneſs and pleaſure; the reverſe is the caſe: Fear and gloomineſs are neither the offspring, nor the companions of religion: Pleaſantneſs and peace are her inmates. Who has ſo much reaſon for enlivening joy, as he who lives under the ſmiles of approving heaven? and what domeſtic joys are ſo highly flavored, as thoſe which are tinctured, and kept alive by a genuine ſenſe of religion? Where ſhall happineſs be found, if not in thoſe dwellings, where good nature, good ſenſe, and piety reign? A thouſand acts of the moſt endearing love and friendſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their mutual attachment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly add new pleaſures to the domeſtic ſtate.</p>
                     <p>ADIEU, my dear ſir; I rejoice with you in the recovery of your ſon from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſickneſs with which he has been viſited.

                     <p>AMONG the many excellent remarks which Governor Jefferſon, now Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at the court of Verſailles, makes on this ſubject, I think the following worthy the ſerious conſideration of Mr. M—, which may have eſcaped his notice.</p>
                     <p>SPEAKING of Virginia, he ſays, "There muſt doubtleſs be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the exiſtence of ſlavery among us. The whole commerce between maſter and ſlave is a perpetual exerciſe of the moſt boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſions, the moſt unremitting deſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm on the one part, and degrading ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions on the other. Our children ſee this, and learn to imitate it; for man is an
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:022570_0533_0FB98A5773AA97D0"/>
imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in him. From his cradle to his grave, he is learning to do what he ſees others do. If a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy or his ſelf love, for reſtraining the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of his paſſion towards his ſlave, it ſhould always be a ſufficient one that his child is preſent. But generally it is not ſufficient. The parent ſtorms, the child looks on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on the ſame airs in the circle of ſmaller ſlaves, gives a looſe to his worſt of paſſions, and thus nurſed, educated, and daily exerciſed in tyranny, cannot but be ſtamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man muſt be a prodigy, who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his manners and morals undepraved by ſuch circumſtances. And with what execration ſhould the ſtateſman be loaded, who, permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other, transforms thoſe into deſpots, and theſe into enemies, deſtroys the morals of the one part, and the <hi>amor patriae</hi> of the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:022570_0534_0FB98A58C80F4350"/>
For if a ſlave can love a country in this world, it muſt be any other in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that in which he is born to live and labor for another; in which he muſt lock up the faculties of his nature, contribute as far as depends on his individual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to the evaniſhment of the human race, or entail his own miſerable condition on the endleſs generations proceeding from him.</p>
                     <p>"WITH the morals of the people, their induſtry is deſtroyed. For, in a warm climate, no man will labor for himſelf who can make another labor for him. This is ſo true, that of the proprietors of ſlaves a very ſmall proportion indeed are ever ſeen to labor. And can the liberties of a nation be thought ſecure, when we have removed their only firm baſis, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that theſe liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="238" facs="unknown:022570_0535_0FB98A5BC834E420"/>
natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is among poſſible events: that it may become probable by ſupernatural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference! The Almighty has no attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that can take ſides with us in ſuch a conteſt."</p>
                     <p>IT hence appears that true policy and domeſtic education, as well as religion and morals, loudly plead againſt a practice, which has no other than intereſted and avaricious motives to plead in its favor. As the public mind is now prepared to bear teſtimony againſt this practice, which centres in the hands of a few individuals only, and is rapidly growing into diſrepute in Europe, query whether the evil might not be radically cured, by making it a part of domeſtic education? And it were to be wiſhed that ſhort dialogues, and other pieces, ſuitable for ſchools and academies, were offered to the public by ſome able hand, in which the injuſtice and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the practice may be properly exhibited. This would have a tendency
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:022570_0536_0FB98A5D542D5438"/>
to beget, in the minds of youth, an early deteſtation of it. It is undoubtedly our duty to arreſt the attention of young minds to the cauſe of virtue and human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, peace and charity, by every means which has any proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>HOW incompatible this commerce is with the character of a Chriſtian people, you may clearly learn from Iſaiah's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic deſcription of the peaceable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Meſſiah, and the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it would produce on the temper and conduct of mankind towards each other? Beautiful is the figure, and peaceful the motto of this prophetic portrait. The ſcene is laid as on the ſummit of a gilded mountain, which reflects its divinely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening rays on every ſide, until "the whole earth is full of the knowledge of the Lord." On the top of this mountain ſprings up a branch, from an ancient ſtock, green, vigorous, and ſpreading. Under its ſhadow, the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and the kid, the lion and the ſatling, the young child and the ſerpent,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:022570_0537_0FB98A640761EC50"/>
all reſt together in harmonious ſort. And this is their perpetual motto, "THEY SHALL NOT HURT NOR DESTROY IN ALL THIS HOLY MOUNTAIN."<note n="*" place="bottom">ISAIAH, xi. 9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>P. S. IF we ſhould, for a moment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Mr. M— to be right in his theory, it does not follow that we have a right to the involuntary and unrewarded ſervice of the Africans; much leſs that we have any right to make property of them; for God never gave man this right. The original grant of dominion to man over the inferior ranks of creatures extended only to "the fiſh of the ſea, the beaſts of the earth, the fowl of the air, and every thing that CREEPETH upon the earth." Any order of creatures, however inferior to us, not anſwering either of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, cannot fall under the dominion of man in the ſenſe in which they do.</p>
                     <p>AND in what reſpect do Africans an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this deſcription? If in none, it will follow that there is no ſenſe in which we can claim them as property.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="unknown:022570_0538_0FB98A658E302038"/>BUT if we ſhould grant that the claims of property, founded on ſuppoſed inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in the ſcale of being, is juſt; yet nothing can juſtify the cruel uſage they often experience. The ground on which dominion over the animal world was given to man, was, the likeneſs he bore to the Deity. It was merely on account of his being endued with reaſon and moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and inſpired with kind and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent affections, by which he was aſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the divine character, that he was conſtituted lord of this lower creation, and made the repreſentative of its great author and governor, and the diſpenſer of his authority. And as we are created after the image of God, ſo we ſhould imitate his example, in the government of the univerſe, in exerciſing that dominion over the animal world which he has given us. Cruelty or ſeverity to them ſhews that we have loſt thoſe ſentiments of goodneſs and pity, which are our moſt glorious reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Creator. How much more does cruelty to our own ſpecies ſhew the depravity of the beſt affections of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart.</p>

                     <p>WILL you now, my dear ſir, take a turn with me back to the ſchool at Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, where we find Oſander making improvements under his judicious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, which anſwered the expectations and gratified the wiſhes of his father. He purſued his ſtudies with ſuch induſtry, as ſoon gained him the firſt rank of ſcholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among the youth. He did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, acquire a reliſh for the dead lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. The native energy of his genius made him pant for more improving and agreeable ſtudies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="unknown:022570_0541_0FB98A6A0BD167E8"/>I THINK it is a matter worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether the Latin and Greek languages have not been made, too much, the teſts of genius in our ſchools; and whether public advantage might not ariſe from aboliſhing the cuſtom of making a knowledge of them an indiſpenſable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a public education. Many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of genius, perhaps, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented gaining their proper rank in ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, becauſe they could not plod the dull round of taſteleſs languages. The time, which is conſumed in the ſtudy of theſe languages, by thoſe who will have no uſe for the knowledge of them in the buſineſs or occupations of life, might, ſurely, be better employed in the purſuit of ſuch branches of learning, as would apply more directly to their future employments.</p>
                     <p>OF this Mr. Bloomſgrove became more convinced, as he perceived that his ſon made great proficiency in other parts of literature. As he deſigned his ſon for a civilian, he determined to waſte no more time in the ſtudy of languages, for which
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:022570_0542_0FB98A6B9569D3A8"/>
he had no taſte. In order that his mind might be formed to a right temper, and the habits of virtue might be well fixed, he continued him longer at the ſchool than uſual, for the ſake of having him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own eye. He conſidered, on the other hand, the danger which might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from retaining him too long within the narrow ſphere of the domeſtic ſtate.</p>
                     <p>A YOUTH of genius, at the age of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſeventeen, who has been induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at ſchool, begins to require new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to excite emulation, and a new field for exertion. Altho his paſſions begin to gather ſtrength, at this period, and new appetites begin to ſpring up, yet, if do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic education has been well conducted, the mind will be provided with a balance againſt them; and he may be ſafely truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad in the higher walks of ſcience.</p>
                     <p>INDUCED by ſentiments like theſe, Mr. Bloomſgrove placed his ſon at the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity at —, whither his vigilant eye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; and every prudent method was taken to guard him againſt the ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:022570_0543_0FB98A7024FB8780"/>
of vice, and to allure him to virtue. It is too commonly the caſe, that when parents have committed their children to the care of others, they relax in their own attention to them. Confiding entirely in the integrity and abilities of thoſe, to whoſe care they are committed, they no longer watch over them. But thoſe, to whom the care of youth is committed, ſeldom conſider themſelves under any other obligations than to teach the art or the ſcience for which they apply, and to reſtrain them from vicious habits, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than is neceſſary to the purpoſe of doing this. Between theſe two errors, the culture of the heart is neglected.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove determined that no effort ſhould be wanting on his part, to complete the culture of his ſon's heart, and preſerve his morals. He, therefore, aſſured his ſon that he ſhould follow him to the univerſity with a watchful eye, with a parent's heart; expreſſing great confidence in his prudence and attention to the objects before him. He enjoined
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:022570_0544_0FB98A7284B3DF68"/>
it upon his ſon to write him frequently; and, at the end of every month, to render him an account of his ſtudies. This method enabled Mr. Bloomſgrove to judge of his proficiency, while it gave him an opportunity of adminiſtering ſalutary advice.</p>
                     <p>THE proficiency, which Oſander made at the univerſity, was flattering to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as well as honorable to himſelf. But this pleaſure was a little interrupted, ſome time after his entrance there, by an information that he was in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enſnared, and led aſtray by ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute youth, as it appears from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter. As the moderation, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and confidence expreſſed in it, had the deſired effect, I will ſend it you by the next poſt.</p>

                     <p>THUS far, my dear ſon, have your parents watched over you from helpleſs infancy. They have conducted you, with all parental care and ſolicitude, to an age in which your mind is capable of manly improvements. To withdraw that ſolicitude and attention at the preſent, which is the moſt critical and important period of your life, would be no leſs cruel to you than unnatural in them. In your prudence, integrity, and virtue, we have all that confidence, to which your years can lay claim.</p>
                     <p>IN order that our confidence in you may not be ſhaken, it is neceſſary that we call your attention to the ſituation you are in, and to the circumſtances which ſurround you. Conſider, my ſon, that you now ſtand on the vibrating line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween childhood and majority. The paſſions acquire new ſtrength; objects,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:022570_0546_0FB98A772BACD4F8"/>
ſuited to excite them, are addreſſed to every ſenſe; open to your view, appear a variety of faſcinating proſpects. Even that frankneſs and generoſity of temper, which is uſually attendant on youth, and is amiable in itſelf, may become a ſnare.</p>
                     <p>THE vigilance and artfulneſs of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profligates may improve that facility of mind as a means of ſeduction; but a prudent youth will ever be upon his guard againſt the dangers to which he is expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and never ſuffer the generoſity of his temper to be the dupe of their crafty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. The moſt fatal conſequences would, probably, attend a falſe ſtep at this period. Every thing in the future part of your life is depending on the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moment. Puerility ſhould now yield to more ſolid judgment. Fancy ſhould give place to conſideration; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhould ſupply the place of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and impreſſions. But time alone can give experience: and during that progreſs, the want of experience can only be ſupplied by ſubſtituting that of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

On your own exertions you muſt rely for rendering the means of literary acquiſitions effectual; and on your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for proficiency in knowledge. Let the buſineſs of the univerſity be your pleaſure; and let amuſements be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, only as a neceſſary relaxation from ſtudy. Regard not the miſapplied ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule of thoſe, whoſe want of learning and virtue excites envy at thoſe who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of both; and whoſe love of pleaſure leads them to prevent the mortifying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of others, and, if poſſible, to ſeduce them to their own guilty practices. Under the maſk of their gaiety and good humor lurks the malignant ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, which endeavors to render the induſtrious and the virtuous ridiculous.</p>

You ought to diſplay, at leaſt, as much fortitude in your purſuits, as they do obſtinacy in theirs. Your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude will ſoon overcome theirs; and you will effectually repel every attack by a dauntleſs ſpirit, and an unyielding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</p>
                     <p>ADORN your mind with uſeful and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant literature: Eſtabliſh yourſelf in the habits of virtue; and you will baffle all the devices of the crafty. You will then be able to pay an undiſturbed attention to your ſtudies; you will enjoy peace and tranquillity of mind; and you will lay the foundation for reſpectability of character, while thoſe, who would gladly ſeduce you to ſacrifice at the ſhrine of pleaſure, will ſuffer merited reproach for their idleneſs, extravagance, and folly.</p>
                     <p>BE aſſured, my ſon, that we hear of your proficiency in learning with great
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:022570_0549_0FB98A80037A5D98"/>
pleaſure; and, that nothing could ſo much wound our feelings, as to have your reputation marred by any conduct incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the character of a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, walking in the noble paths of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Aim not merely to avoid faults, but to cultivate the moſt amiable virtues. Do not content yourſelf with the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge only, but aim at the elegance of literature, and the refinements of taſte: this has a connexion with many virtues. Elegance of taſte, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the fine arts, tend to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the poſſeſſor both good and agreeable.</p>
                     <p>PLEASANT, indeed, are all the paths of ſcience. Great is your opportunity for improvement; and I doubt not of your reſolutions to make the beſt uſe of them, and to add the unſpeakable bleſſing of a virtuous ſon to</p>

He furniſhed Oſander with a memorandum book, in which he was directed to give credit for all the monies he received, and charge all his bills, which he was to preſerve as vouchers; and make minutes of his looſe expenſes, noting the places, and for what they were incurred.</p>
                     <p>THO Oſander's expenſes could not be great, from his ſtudious turn, yet keeping an exact account of the monies received, and how expended, had a good effect in accuſtoming him to method in his affairs, and to accuracy in accounts. It would not have been eaſy, if he had been diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to have eluded his father's vigilant eye, or to have paſſed many impoſitions upon him. It could not be very difficult to judge of the probability of the account

from the general character, and from the company he kept.</p>
                     <p>VOLATILE youth often become profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate for want of this check; and if ſuch an one has a plentiful ſupply of money at college, without rendering to his father any account of his expenſes, it is much but his expenſes prove his ruin. His ambition to diſtinguiſh himſelf as a perſon of ſpirit and figure, will ſoon lead him to look upon the drudgery of college exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes as beneath him. His books and his inſtructors will be inimical to his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and he will find more pleaſure in his vices than in literary purſuits.</p>
                     <p>"A NOBLE Venetian, whoſe ſon wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the plenty of his father's riches, finding his ſon's expenſes grew very high and extravagant, ordered his caſhier to let him have, for the future, no more money than what he would count when he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. This, one would think no great reſtraint to a young gentleman's expenſes, who could freely have as much money as he could tell. But yet this, to one who
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:022570_0553_0FB98A8B78C9B840"/>
was uſed to nothing but the purſuit of his pleaſures, proved a great trouble, which at laſt ended in this ſober and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous reflection: 'If it is ſo much pains to me, barely to count the money I ſpend, what labor and pains did it coſt my anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not only to count, but to get it?' This rational thought, ſuggeſted by the little pains impoſed upon him, wrought ſo effectually upon his mind, that it made him, from that time forward, prove a good huſband."</p>

                     <p>THE progreſs of learning might be greatly accelerated by a regular ſyſtem in the purſuit of it. Inſtructors of youth might afford great aſſiſtance to their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, by directing them to a proper arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſtudies, to books proper to be read on each ſubject or ſcience to be purſued, to a ſuitable proportion of time to be allotted to each branch. Much time is loſt by a confuſion of ſtudies, and by a promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner of reading books.</p>
                     <p>BUT my object is to conſider the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of ſyſtem on a larger ſcale, which befits the age and employments of young Mr. Bloomſgrove, who is ſoon to appear on the great theatre of the world. From the ſyſtematic manner in which he has been trained, we may naturally ſuppoſe that ſyſtem and order will attend all his affairs. He who does not meet every duty in its own place, and aſſign it its proper rank, cannot expect to preſerve
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:022570_0555_0FB98A9087C0FC40"/>
the natural order and connexion of things, or form any conſiſtency of character.</p>
                     <p>A RIGHT diviſion of time is as neceſſary as order in the arrangement and diſcharge of the duties of our reſpective depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nothing is performed right, where nothing is performed in its proper time and place. Confuſion muſt attend the life of ſuch a man. But, by a prudent management of his affairs, and an orderly arrangement of time, a man may live more in a few years than others do in many. He arreſts every flying hour: He loſes no time by confuſion in his affairs; but, uſing it with economy, he accumulates a ſtock, to which the indolent waſter of time muſt be forever a ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>METHOD in every part of conduct is a matter which deſerves the particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of young people; and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maxims ſhould be deeply fixed in their minds.</p>
                     <p>"PROVIDE what is neceſſary, before you indulge in what is ſuperfluous."</p>

                     <p>THE want of economy has been a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſource of diſtreſs and miſery: Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, once flouriſhing, have been reduced to ruin: the melancholy widow, the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs orphan, have been thrown out friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon the world.

                     <p>WHEN young men live beyond their means, they tread on enchanted ground; their path is ſtrowed with poiſonous flowers; perplexity and danger muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their progreſs. It is as incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with induſtry as it is with prudence. Their paſſions gather ſtrength with the prodigal waſte of ſubſtance.

At this hideous ſpectacle, ſo offenſive to all the ſenſes, the young man grew ſick. 'Go thou wretched debauchee, ſaid the father, with a ſignificant look and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis, follow thy looſe inclinations; it will not be long before thou wilt think thyſelf happy in being admitted into this place.

                     <p>FATAL, indeed, are the effects of prodigality, or the neglect of method in living! But he who forms his conduct upon his circumſtances, and diſcharges the obligations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he owes to ſociety, will neither waſte his ſubſtance by prodigal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, nor deſtroy his virtue by extravagant pleaſures.

will be able always to act his part with fortitude as a man, and with fidelity as a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>"THE youth, who has acquired a reliſh for the pleaſures of devotion, yields his heart to thoſe pleaſures.

                     <p>THE regulation of amuſements is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great conſequence for young people to attend to, both as to time and place. Parents and others of rigid virtue, having paſſed the ſeaſon of youthful pleaſures, are too apt to look with indignant eye upon all thoſe recreations by which human
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:022570_0560_0FB98A9E8177FA00"/>
cares are relieved, and the union of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety cemented. By thus paſſing an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate cenſure on all amuſements, they loſe all that influence over youth, which age, rendered reſpectable by virtue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poſſeſſes.</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove, therefore, did not aim at reſtraining his children from all amuſements, but at aſſiſting them in the regulation of amuſements, ſo as not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the higher duties of life. In countries full of inhabitants and of wealth, pleaſure becomes the buſineſs of many. But in a country juſt riſing into national exiſtence, induſtry muſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ts wealth, and buſineſs muſt form its pleaſures. When Virgil ſung, in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating ſtrains, the peaceful occupations and affecting pleaſures of rural life, the Romans had loſt all taſte of them, and ſought the means of luxury and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by oppreſſing or plundering prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces. Neglecting the exerciſe of their talents in uſeful duties, and ſeeking ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did pleaſures, by ſucceſsful depredations
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:022570_0561_0FB98AA1E32F7240"/>
on their more wealthy neighbors, they ruined the commonwealth. It would not require a ſpirit of prophecy to predict the fate of theſe ſtates, if a love of pleaſure ſhould ſo far prevail, as to root out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or to render it diſreputable. Money conſtitutes the ſinews of war; numbers, the ſtrength of a country; and induſtry, its wealth. But a ſpirit of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation deſtroys the latter, relaxes the other, and cuts off the ſinews of the former.</p>
                     <p>HOW neceſſary to regard time, ſeaſon; and meaſure in pleaſures and amuſements! Strong and eager is the propenſity to theſe; and great vigilance is requiſite to guard againſt their deluſive influence. He, whoſe paſſions are in a continual ferment, cannot look thro the ſober eye of reaſon, nor hear its milder voice thro the buzz of tumultuary pleaſures. Whereas he, who mingles pleaſures in a temperate ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the higher buſineſs of life, preſerves the maſtery of himſelf, and is able to make a juſt diſtribution of his time
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:022570_0562_0FB98AA3B7AEC6A8"/>
between the employments and the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life; between the concerns of the preſent, and a proper regard to the intereſts of the future world. Accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to contemplate nobler objects, and to taſte more rational enjoyments, young Mr. Bloomſgrove meets amuſements with a manly indifference; and, by the habits of ſelf command, is guarded againſt exceſs, and prepared for every occurrence.</p>
                     <p>A YOUNG gentleman, who has no ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of conduct, with reference to aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others, is in danger of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by the time, place or manner of ſocial enjoyments. If he ſuffers himſelf to be led into places conſecrated to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal demon of debauchery, he ſoon finds himſelf on enchanted ground. The example of others, the ardor of his own paſſions, excited by the faſcinating influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of vicious indulgencies, give him a licenſe he never before felt. All moral reſtraints, being bantered and ridiculed, ſoon appear to him as the idle dreams of ſuperſtition. This barrier broken down,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:022570_0563_0FB98AA78C408D08"/>
he loſes his innocence, and with that his peace of mind.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES the character of aſſociates, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſhould be had to time and ſeaſon for ſocial pleaſures. Confuſion and ruin muſt attend the affairs of that man, who devotes thoſe hours to company, in which his buſineſs calls his attention. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, buſineſs, and reading or ſtudy, ſhould ſucceed each other at proper intervals. Theſe ſhould be ſo conducted, as not to interfere with the duties of life. He, who can find no enjoyment in diſcharging the duties of life, will not long be happy. To a vacant mind, company may afford a temporary relief; but he will be ſo much the more oppreſſed and languid, when forced to return to himſelf. By a due mixture of public and private life, or of ſociety and buſineſs, young Mr. Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove kept free from the ſnares of both, and enjoyed each to much greater perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>THE ſyſtem by which he directed all his actions, extended to the moſt minute
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:022570_0564_0FB98AA9048AD398"/>
part of his tranſactions in life: even the little punctilios of civility were invariably obſerved by him. He, who is negligent and careleſs in the ſmaller parts of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, will be in the utmoſt danger of a growing remiſſneſs in higher duties of life. Diſorder will imperceptibly grow upon his affairs. Inattention towards others, will generate indifference to their happineſs; and from actions, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of little worth, will proceed habits of criminal remiſſneſs. As a little ſpark kindles a great fire, ſo the inconſiderable beginnings of inattention to the rules of civility, which are generally agreed upon as proper marks of reſpect to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, affection to individuals, or of eſteem and reſpect for particular characters, have been the occaſion of deſtroying friendſhips and converting them into enmity.</p>

the domeſtic ſtate, he returned, and was united in marriage to this object of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affections.</p>
                     <p>THE conſent of her patrons evinced their affection to him; while the reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with which they parted with Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhewed the ſtrength of their regard for her.

                     <p>TO furniſh you with a complete portrait of young Mr. Bloomſgrove, I muſt call in the aid of your own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is tall, ſtraight, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned; has a piercing black eye, a florid complexion, with an open, placid, and manly countenance, indicating good ſenſe, magnanimity, and benevolence: Every thing within correſponds to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal

To good ſenſe, he unites good nature; to magnanimity, a compaſſionate heart; to ſobriety, cheerfulneſs; and to ſtrict vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, elegant accompliſhments, and the moſt graceful manners. Affable and courteous towards all, he was held in high eſtimation by all who knew him.</p>
                     <p>FOR his intimates, he choſe the wiſe and virtuous; having no reliſh for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of an oppoſite character. Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by his father's attention to his young friends, (for they were always received by him with an open hearted cheerfulneſs) he enjoyed their company, without ſeeking it at places of public reſort. He was not deſtitute of all reliſh for amuſements; but he enjoyed much greater pleaſure in the ſociety of a circle of ſentimental ladies, and with ſome literary friends, than in the uſual amuſements of young people.</p>
                     <p>HAVING been trained to diligence and application, the habits of induſtry were ſo fixed that he became a great economiſt of
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:022570_0569_0FB98AB68F7D58E8"/>
his time. His taſte for agriculture and the mechanic arts, was a ſource of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure and amuſement, as well as of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to him. He found an agreeable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in the uſe of the mechanical tools which he procured for that purpoſe. He not only gained a theoretical acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the arts, but became a proficient in the practice of ſome of the moſt uſeful arts. "Czar Peter worked as a common ſhip carpenter in the yard, and ſerved as a drummer in his own troops." Mr. Bloomſgrove did not think it beneath his ſon to be acquainted with the uſe of tools, or to ſpend ſome time with the workmen, as well for improvement as for exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>IT is impoſſible to ſay what revolutions of fortune may take place; and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage this acquaintance with ſecular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs may be to him in future. Beſides the contingencies of life, which may make ſuch knowledge neceſſary, it will render him leſs dependent on others, and more able to help himſelf; and it gave him an opportunity of contracting an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:022570_0570_0FB98AB86537D500"/>
with a claſs of people, by far the moſt numerous in all communities: and by theſe means he gained a more perfect knowledge of human nature, than is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe who keep themſelves aloof from them.</p>
                     <p>WHAT can be more ridiculous than the airs which ſome young gentlemen put on towards thoſe who have been trained up in a different—a ſuppoſed humbler— walk in life from themſelves? A youth educated behind a counter, plumes himſelf on his own importance, and often looks down, with diſdain, upon the more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and promiſing youth who has been trained at the work bench. Vain youth! knoweſt thou not that the king is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the labor of the huſbandman; and that thou art indebted to the mechanic's art and induſtry for every thing that is convenient, ornamental, or ſplendid in life?</p>
                     <p>WHILE young Mr. Bloomſgrove ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf more extenſively uſeful, by attending to the theory of agriculture and

mechanic arts, and by gaining ſome prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical knowledge of thoſe occupations, he endeared himſelf to the people who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and daily grew in the eſteem of all about him. It was particularly happy that his love for literary purſuits had not deprived him of a taſte for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar employments; the period being now arrived, in which he is to be placed in a ſituation, to exerciſe his talents both in his ſecular occupations and learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>

                     <p>IN carrying on an occupation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing a profeſſion, much is depending on the place choſen for the purpoſe, and on the manner of entering upon the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life. A father's aid and counſel can never be better applied than in this critical and important tranſaction. Young Mr. Bloomſgrove, having eſtabliſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the patronage of the beſt of
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:022570_0572_0FB98ABD855D8130"/>
fathers, began to think of aſſuming the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſtate. But in a tranſaction, on which the happineſs of life ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, he determined to profit by the wiſdom and experience of his father.</p>
                     <p>TAUGHT, from childhood, to revere his father's judgment, he liſtened attentively to all he ſaid on the ſubject of chooſing a companion for life. Mr. Bloomſgrove does not object to early marriages; but adviſes that, when a young man is ſettled in buſineſs, and has the means of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a family, with the exertions of induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he ſhould look out for a ſuitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Many and great are the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of early marriages in young coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                     <p>I CAN promiſe you, my ſon, ſaid Mr. Bloomſgrove, upon the general experience of all wiſe and prudent men, that, if you make a judicious choice, you will not have reaſon to repent the ſtep you take; but every thing is depending on that choice. In placing your affections upon a lady, to be the partner of your days, employ your
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:022570_0573_0FB98ABF89D55580"/>
reaſon and judgment, as well as your fancy. Suffer not yourſelf to be taken by ſurpriſe, but preſerve the maſtery of your affections.</p>
                     <p>IF you are not well upon your guard, you will fall a prey to beauty, or ſome other external qualification, which will be of little conſequence in the matrimonial ſtate. Beauty is a dangerous property, as it tends to corrupt the mind; and it ſoon loſes its influence. But good ſenſe and ſweetneſs of temper, united to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable figure and engaging manners, are durable qualities; and never loſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, like beauty. Conſider that the happineſs of the married ſtate does not depend on fortune, birth, or beauty; nor on any external qualification, ſeparate from the properties of the mind. The management of domeſtic affairs and the education of a family, are duties of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable nature in a married woman. But as the cheerful diſcharge of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the happineſs thence reſulting, depend upon a certain degree of correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:022570_0574_0FB98AC10079F6A8"/>
of character and circumſtances in the parties, ſo, in forming this connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, regard ſhould be had to them.</p>
                     <p>IN order to enſure permanent affection and harmony, there ſhould be ſuch a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſimilarity of age, natural temper, ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation, external accompliſhments, and religious ſentiments, as that the difference in them, may leave no impediments in the way of the tendereſt affection and moſt perfect harmony.</p>
                     <p>A YOUNG man, who has profited by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions like theſe, will not be captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a pretty face, a ſprightly air, or any external accompliſhment. "The picture of a good wife is fixed in his mind; and he compares with it every young woman he ſees:—'She is pretty, but has ſhe good ſenſe? She has ſenſe, but is ſhe well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered? She dances elegantly, or ſings with expreſſion; but is ſhe not vain of ſuch trifles?"</p>
                     <p>MR. Bloomſgrove did not wiſh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol his ſon with reſpect to the particular object; but to point out the character
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:022570_0575_0FB98AC29D4DD0D8"/>
ſuitable for him. He deſcribed the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, without pointing to any particular one, in which he would moſt probably find ſuch an one. "A family where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I need only to obſerve, therefore, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta, to whom he was united in marriage in the twenty fifth year of his age, was the daughter of reſpectable parents, who had paid great attention to her education. She was more diſtinguiſhed by her good ſenſe than by her beauty, tho equalled by few in perſonal figure. Mild and gentle in her temper, with a heart ſenſible to the

miſeries of others, and always ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, ſhe was engaging in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The pleaſing, as well as more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated qualities, were ſo happily blended in her compoſition as to make her, at once, tender, ſprightly, and agreeable, and to render her worthy of ſo amiable and excellent an huſband.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>FRIENDSHIP is a principal ſource of the pleaſures of life. It is founded in the ſociability of our nature, and conſiſts in a reciprocity of affections, which have been accuſtomed to ſacrifice immediate gratification to the hope or enjoyment of high participated pleaſures. Theſe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures are the moſt highly flavored of any enjoyments in life; and without them all others are taſteleſs. If we purſue pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, we cannot enjoy it alone. Without a friend, to whom we may communicate with freedom, our knowledge would afford no pleaſure; wealth would beſtow no happineſs, and every ſituation would be joyleſs. In proſperity, a friend multiplies
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:022570_0579_0FB98ACC3B03AA80"/>
our joys; in adverſity, he divides, and, by dividing, leſſens our ſorrows. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by adminiſtering the beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the pureſt ſatisfaction, alleviates our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under diſappointment, and renders all our miſeries ſupportable.</p>

                     <p>THOSE, who ridicule the idea of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing firſt ſenſations to reflected pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, and all attempts to render the force of friendſhip ſuperior to the direct opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of intereſt, can have no idea, either of the reality, or of the pleaſures of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. "Hiſtory affords atteſted inſtances of perſons, who have ſacrificed property, views of intereſt, proſpects of honor, and even their lives, to the affections of this union.

to ſelf love. Selfiſhneſs is inconſiſtent with the noble and generous affections of friendſhip. Truth, honor, integrity, and ſincerity, are eſſential ingredients in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and to be deficient in theſe, is to want capacity for this connexion. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, formed at random, and regulated by intereſt or convenience, ſeldom afford a permanent connexion. Hence complaints of ingratitude and inconſtancy frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe. Of what importance, then, is a proper and judicious choice of friends? What an acquiſition, a real friend! This exhibits the art of diſtinguiſhing the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, by which that choice may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily made, as an important object in the education of youth.

                     <p>THE following ſtory, related in a Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na paper of July, 1788, which is ſaid to have taken place in the camp before Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, affords a ſtriking ſpecimen of the ſtrength of ſuch friendſhips.</p>
                     <p>"ACHMET Marowa was the ſon of an eminent magiſtrate of that city, with great merit and fine accompliſhments. He had long addreſſed Fatima, the only daughter of Haſſan Buglo, a Baſhaw in the armies of the Porte, and on the morning of the day on which the ſiege of Belgrade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, led, exulting to the altar of Alla, one of the lovelieſt women of the empire. Moſt of the diſtinguiſhed families of the place, on the approach of the imperial troops, retired to Barrowza, and other places further down the Danube; but the nuptials of Achmet and Fatima, and the rapid movement of our forces, prevented that, otherwiſe fortunate pair, from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:022570_0583_0FB98AD541D3ED10"/>
ſhelter in the interior country till the inveſtment of the city was complete.</p>
                     <p>"ON the night of the fourth of June, however, Achmet determined at all haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards to convey his bride from the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perils to which ſhe would be expoſed during a ſiege that threatened ſcenes of carnage. He had her dreſſed as a young man of faſhion; and putting himſelf in the habit of a ſlave, left the city at twelve o'clock at night, hoping to avoid our guards, and to reach a place of ſafety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the return of day. Unhappily for the wanderers, they had ſcarce begun their midnight meander, when loud peals of thunder appalled the heart of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed Fatima; torrents of rain ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the darkneſs increaſed, the fugitives wandered about bewildered and forlorn, till, upon the gleam of day, they found themſelves ſurrounded by a patrolling party of Hungarian Huſſars, and were hurried to the main guard.</p>
                     <p>"THE Prince of Cobourg having notice given him immediately, that a youth of
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:022570_0584_0FB98AD6DEA5D340"/>
apparent diſtinction, attended by a ſlave, was taken in his camp, ordered them to be kept apart; and if, on examination, any circumſtance occurred that ſhould mark them as ſpies, that their execution ſhould take place inſtantly. To the interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were put to Fatima, ſhe replied that ſhe was the ſon of a merchant of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, and attended by a poor domeſtic of her father, and only wiſhed to join her family at a village at about ten leagues diſtant. She, however, was ſoon given to underſtand, that the manner of their being taken precluded all apologies from having the effect ſhe wiſhed; and that the rigid uſages of war allowed her but half an hour to live. She received this dreadful information without manifeſting any perturbation, and only begged that her ſlave might be permitted to carry her friends a few remembrances that ſhe particularized.</p>
                     <p>"WHILE ſhe was cloſing this requeſt, ſhe beheld the beloved Achmet, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by armed men, paſſing the door of the
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:022570_0585_0FB98ADA1516B268"/>
tent ſhe was in. As ſhe had not doubted of his ſafety, from the ſervility of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſhe inquired in an agony of agitation what was to be his fate? and was anſwered—'immediate death.' At the word DEATH ſhe ſhrieked out, and fell from her ſeat in convulſions. The officers around her flew to her aſſiſtance; and, to give her free reſpiration, unbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned her waiſtcoat; when, to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, they found their unhappy priſoner a lady.</p>
                     <p>"THE execution of Achmet was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, until the Prince of Cobourg could be informed of theſe particulars. The generous chieftain examined each of them apart, and received ſuch informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as convinced him that they were not the inſidious agents he had ſuſpected. The heroic Fatima and her huſband were furniſhed with habits befitting their real ſituations, and before the cloſe of the day, ſafely eſcorted to the village whither their deſpairing friends had retired."</p>

                     <p>THE education of a daughter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as at an end, ſo long as ſhe continues in a ſingle ſtate. Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preparatory to marriage have been conſidered, by writers on education, as of the greateſt conſequence in bringing child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren forward into life.</p>
                     <p>THE fondneſs, which mothers have ſometimes diſcovered, for precipitating their daughters' appearance on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic theatre, has been the ſource of many mortifications. Unacquainted with the world, young and volatile, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall a prey to diſhonorable preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and ſuch is the delicacy of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male character, that the foul breath of ſuſpicion may ſtain it, but all the ſtreams that flow can never reſtore its former luſtre: or, incapable of making a prudent choice, they beſtow themſelves on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy object, and owe a whole life of inquietude and ſorrow to a ſingle raſh and indiſcreet action. Here a prudent

mother will keep a vigilant eye, and, by her maternal advice, cautiouſly adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, will ſupply the want of a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's experience by her own.</p>
                     <p>"MOTHERS and nurſes, ſays Lord Kaimes, are continually talking of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to their female pupils, long before it is ſuggeſted to them by nature; and it is always a great eſtate, a fine coat, or a gay equipage that is promiſed. Such objects impreſſed on the mind of a child, natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally biaſs her to a wrong choice, when ſhe grows up." But Mrs. Bloomſgrove has never ſpoken to her daughter upon that ſubject, till ſince ſhe has arrived at mature age; and, indeed, the habits of diſcretion have become ſo fixed, by her manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with her from childhood, as to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede the neceſſity of much inſtruction on the ſubject at this period. The whole of her education has been preparatory to the duties, connexions, and changes of life.</p>
                     <p>BUT as her age, and the attentions which ſhe now receives from many young
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:022570_0588_0FB98ADEFB356110"/>
gentlemen, indicate the propriety of ſome preparatory inſtruction, Mrs. Bloomſgrove lets no favorable opportunity ſlip, of dropping ſuch hints, as ſhe thinks may be uſeful. Her main object is, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any direct inſtructions, to prepoſſeſs the mind of Rozella in favor of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, rather than the appearance of a man. She repreſents the happineſs of the married ſtate, as depending more on the good temper, ſobriety, and induſtry of an huſband, than on any particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of intereſt, or outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that men of good morals are the only true admirers of females; that, tho they may not have all the fulſome jargon of gallantry, yet that their aſſiduities are more ſincere and more tender.</p>
                     <p>THAT permanent affection, which lays the only ſure foundation of connubial bliſs, is ſo far from being bought or ſold, that money frequently deſtroys it. Never conſider, my dear, ſaid Mrs. Bloomſgrove to her daughter, what the eſtate is valued at, but attend to the character of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;

and the only ſure way of judging of a man's character, is from the figure he makes among his own ſex. The preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that men are beſt able to judge of one anothers merits. Accuſtomed to leſs delicacy and reſerve than the female ſex, a man's character may be very preciſely aſcertained from his male aſſociates; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his temper and diſpoſition, upon which the happineſs of the married ſtate depends much more than on any outward circumſtance.</p>
                     <p>MUTUAL affection is eſſential to recip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocal enjoyment; but where the moral pleaſures of love do not exiſt, what ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can either have, that a virtuous attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which will warrant an entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, exiſts between them? The perſon may remain the fame, but if the paſſion decays, it is no longer viewed in the ſame light. The veil of deluſion falls off, and love takes its flight. In order to guard her daughter againſt the danger of making a raſh choice, ſhe converſes on marriage as an hazardous ſtep to a female, becauſe an
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:022570_0590_0FB98AE646EE0088"/>
error in chooſing an huſband admits of no remedy. Every ſtep towards that ſhould be taken with caution.</p>
                     <p>THE great object of female education, thro the whole courſe of it, ſhould be to qualify females for the important ſtation they are to hold in domeſtic ſociety, and to make them uſeful and agreeable compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions in the matrimonial ſtate. Domeſtic concerns are the province of the wife; and nature prompts young women to qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify themſelves for behaving well in that ſtation: and the influence of the female character over the manners of men, both before and after marriage, exhibits female education in a point of light extremely intereſting.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>"LET the ladies of a country be properly educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they will not only make and adminiſter its laws, but form its manners and character.</p>
                           <p>"IT would require a lively imagination to deſcribe, or even to comprehend, the happineſs of a country, where knowledge and virtue were generally diffuſed among the female ſex. Our young men would then be reſtrained from vice, by the terror of being baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their company. The loud laugh, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſmile, at the expenſe of innocence, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal infirmities; the ſeats of ſucceſsful mimickry, and the low prized wit, which is borrowed from a miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſcripture phraſes, would no more be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a recommendation to the ſociety of the ladies. A double entendre, in their preſence, would then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a gentleman forever from the company of both ſexes.</p>
                           <p>"THE influence of female education, would be ſtill more extenſive and uſeful in domeſtic life. The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of gentlemen to qualify themſelves, by knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge and induſtry, to diſcharge the duties of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, would be increaſed by marriage; and the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, the hero, and the legiſlator, would find the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reward of their toil in the approbation and applauſe of their wives. Children would diſcover the marks of maternal prudence and wiſdom in every ſtation in life; for it has been well remarked that there have been few great, or good men, who have not been bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wiſe and prudent mothers. Cyrus was taught by his mother Mandane, to revere the Gods. Samuel was devoted to his prophetic office, before he was born, by his mother Hannah. Conſtantine was reſcued from paganiſm by his mother Conſtantia: and Edward the ſixth inherited thoſe great and excellent qualities, which made him the delight of the age in which he lived, from his mother Lady Jane Seymour."</p>

                     <p>IT is now time, my dear ſir, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the detached traits of female excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which, like the ſcattered rays of the fair morning that tinge the mountain tops with their golden hue, when drawn to a point, will afford a beautiful aſſemblage of colors. I ſhall only aim at collecting the principal features of Rozella's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will preſent you with her portrait, as drawn by the hand of nature and of ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="295" facs="unknown:022570_0592_0FB98AE98B84F598"/>IN the firſt rank of her virtues, I ſhall place that reſpectful attention with which ſhe treats her parents. Often does the tear of maternal affection ſtart from Mrs. Bloomſgrove's eye, at beholding the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity and reſpect with which her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter endeavors to reward a mother's care. The love of virtue is Rozella's ruling paſſion. She loves it, not only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its native excellence, and of its being the only ſure road to happineſs; but on account of its being dear to her reſpectable father and tender mother. Her ſenſibility is too great for an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:022570_0593_0FB98AED1140EA78"/>
enjoyment; but is ſuch as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the moſt exquiſite pleaſure in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtreſſed. "We ſometimes ſee inſtances of young ladies, who weep away a whole forenoon, over the criminal ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of a fictitious Charlotte or Werter, turning, with diſdain, at two o'clock, from the fight of a beggar, who ſolicits in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accents or ſigns, a ſmall portion only of the crumbs which fall from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's tables." But Rozella never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any one to go unrelieved, to whom ſhe could afford relief.</p>
                     <p>ROZELLA is poſſeſſed of ſuperior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but ſhe endeavors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal that ſuperiority with as much care, as many take to diſplay the ſuperiority they have not. She conforms to the company ſhe is in; and never offends any by a diſplay of talents greatly above theirs. She is cheerful with the merry, ſerious with the grave, and ſilent with the abſurd. To good nature ſhe unites good breeding: is therefore, polite without ceremony, and obliging without oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:022570_0594_0FB98AF09E04D080"/>
Rozella never talks of her own ſex but to expreſs the good ſhe knows of them; and never ſuffers ſlander or detraction to eſcape from her lips. She experiences leſs pain, from the wrong ſhe receives, than from that which ſhe does.</p>
                     <p>ROZELLA prepares for managing a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily of her own, by aſſiſting her mother in the care of hers. She is well acquainted with cookery, and with the price and qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of proviſions; and ſhe can do the honors of the table with dignity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. While ſhe continued the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful companion of her mother, ſhe reigned in the hearts of all the ſervants, to whom ſhe always ſpoke in the kindeſt manner; received the benedictions of the poor, and the merited applauſe of all who knew her.</p>
                     <p>THE perſonal charms of Rozella allure many young gentlemen to ſeek her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. She has that ſweetneſs of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which intereſts without dazzling beholders. Her ſprightly and ſentimental converſation (for ſhe never, of choice,
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:022570_0595_0FB98AF1C17AFF70"/>
conſumed her time over an unmeaning card table) renders her a moſt agreeable and entertaining companion, eſpecially to her intimate acquaintance; for, in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſtrangers, a modeſt reſerve, blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that native frankneſs which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nders her eaſy and graceful, caſts a tranſparent veil over her mental accompliſhments, which, while it ſeems to conceal, diſplays them to the beſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>AND while Rozella's perſonal qualities, graceful manners, and ſentimental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, attract and pleaſe the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, her virtues teach them to reſpect her character. The vicious and profane are awed by her white robed innocence, and never profane its purity in her preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Great is her influence over the mora's of thoſe who have the honor of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociating with her. Her empire is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on her virtues; her gentleneſs and modeſty confirm the ſway. In her company, the rudeſt and moſt inſenſible of men will abate their ferocity, and will affect more engaging manners. Her
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:022570_0596_0FB98AF9A080A9D8"/>
beauty ſeems but a proper and decent lodging for her mind; it never makes her unmindful of her ſex nor of her age. Her modeſt diffidence intereſts every one in her favor, and ſhe draws that reſpect and attention to herſelf which ſhe pays to the company.</p>
                     <p>YOU will naturally conclude, my dear ſir, that a young lady, poſſeſſed of ſo many accompliſhments, did not remain long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtage without offers of marriage. The deep rooted habits of education had taught her to move with caution, and never to decide on an important matter, till her judgment had gained an aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency over her fancy. She was not to be deluded by the aſſiduities of fulſome gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, by the pageantry of wealth, nor by the falſe luſtre of beauty, elegance, or any external accompliſhments. Nor could any of her admirers gain a favorable reception, till the young Auguſtus, ſon of an eminent planter, made an offer of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in marriage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="300" facs="unknown:022570_0597_0FB988A39DA3FF58"/>THE offer of ſo elegant a perſon, with a mind uncorrupted by vice, enlightened by extenſive ſcience, dignified by the moſt amiable virtues, and embelliſhed by grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manners, was not to be declined. To him ſhe liſtened with a pleaſure before unexperienced: and, with the perfect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of her parents, her friends, and her own heart, the happy Auguſtus called the lovely, the excellent, the accompliſhed Rozella HIS, in the twenty ſecond year of her age.</p>
