            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>DEAR BRETHREN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN ASMUCH as Baptiſm was inſtituted by the great King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, I ſhall make no apology for being deſirous to know who are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that ordinance: and ſeeing you would be great lovers of what you call truth, and not deſirous that the people ſhould be in an error, I hope you will not be offended with my making ſome remarks on that ſubject, and aſking a few queſtions concerning the chief arguments that I have ever heard uſed by any perſon in favor of infant baptiſm; and alſo in reſpect of perſons being deſired, or forced to pay to the ſupport of a miniſtry that they have no fellowſhip with.</p>
            <p>The firſt argument I ſhall mention, is what is generally uſed to ſhew that baptiſm was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the room and ſtead of circumciſion, and to be adminiſtred to the ſame ſubjects.</p>
            <p>We have an account in Act. 15 chap. of the judaiſing teachers going down to Antioch, and ſaid, <hi>Except you be circumciſed after the manner of Moſes, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Paul and Barnabas were ſent up to the apoſtles and elders, about that queſtion; who wrote back a letter, in which are theſe words.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010571_0003_0F80D243EEC34870"/>viz. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen than theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things; that ye abſtain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things ſtrangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourſelves, ye ſhall do well.</hi> Now if baptiſm was inſtituted in the room and ſtead of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, did not the apoſtles know it? And if they knew it, would they not have taught it? Surely as they declared the counſel of God, they would have informed us that baptiſm was inſtituted in the room of circumciſion. I believe there is none ſo abſurd as to ſay the Holy Ghoſt did not know it; or that he did, and would not reveal it to the apoſtles. But in the letter it is ſaid, <hi>from which if you keep yourſelves, ye ſhall do well;</hi> let me aſk you, could it be ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall do well,</hi> unleſs they did all that was required in the room and ſtead of circumciſion, concerning which they wrote?</p>
            <p>Again, it is argued in favor of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, or infant baptizers, that the apoſtles practiſed baptizing infants; for they ſay houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde were baptized, viz. the jailor and his houſhold, Lydia and her houſhold, and the houſhold of Stephanus: they ſay probably there was infants baptized in ſome one or other of theſe houſholds. But let us conſider of the probability.—As to the jailor we are told, Act. 16.34. <hi>That be rejoiced, believing in God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all his houſe.</hi> Now if they were believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010571_0004_0F80D244BB82E8B8"/>as is evident they was, they were proper ſubject, of baptiſm, as appears by Philip's anſwer to the Ethiop an that requeſted bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſee Act 8 37. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayſt:</hi> Which plainly ſhews that faith in Chriſt was abſolutely neceſſary, in order to be admitted to the ordinance of baptiſm, ſee alſo, Act. 10 47. <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Which plainly ſhews that the receiving the Holy Ghoſt was an evidence of faith in Chriſt, and the rule upon which they were admitted to the ordinance of Baptiſm. But to return: As to Lydia, if we believe the ſcriptures, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>her</hi> houſhold; ſhe had no huſband; for if ſhe had, it would have been ſaid HIS houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and not <hi>her</hi> houſhold: and it is not half the virgins and widows that have houſholds, that have children in them ſo ſmall, that if they had faith in Chriſt, it could not be known. Beſides, what would ſhe do with infants tending her ſhop? Again, we find in Act. 16 40. <hi>And when they had ſeen the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they comforted them and departed.</hi> Now then if theſe brethren are ſuppoſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, how, and with what did the apoſtles comfort them? Upon the whole, it is evident that ſhe had no children in her houſhold, but ſuch as could and did make a profeſſion before they were baptized.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect to the houſhold of Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010571_0005_0F80D2455DEBB2D0"/>ſee 1 Cor. 16.15, 16. <hi>I beſeech you brethren, ye know the houſe of Stephanus, that it is the firſt fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themſelves to the miniſtry of the ſaints; that ye ſubmit yourſelves unto ſuch.</hi> Now from the time of the writting this firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, back to Paul's preaching at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, was but about five years, as appears by the dates in the bible. Now then, if the houſhold of Stephanus were baptized in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they muſt have been in the miniſtry over the church, at about ſix or ſeven years of age, which I think is exceeding unlikely.</p>
            <p>But let me aſk you, if the apoſtles had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly practiſed baptizing infants, is it not much more probable there would have been ſome direct account of it, ſome where in the new teſtament, than that there was infants baptized in ſome one or other of theſe houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds? Where were the infants of the three thouſand that came together to ſee that ſtrange thing? As it is in the eyes of all unconverted people, to ſee the Holy Ghoſt poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the apoſtles, do you think they brought their infants with them to be baptized, or no? No, it is evident they did not; as may be ſhewn preſently. But why do I talk thus of probabilities; let us prove from ſcripture what the apoſtles practice was; re-conſider and ſee Gal 3 27. <hi>As many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> Says the Rev. Mr. Fiſh, on the text, <q>That as, in your
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010571_0006_0F80D245DFF35628"/>baptiſm, you put on the character of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, you declared or profeſs'd, that you received Chriſt as your Lord and Saviour.<note n="‖" place="bottom">See his ſermons. pag. 37.</note>
               </q> And I verily believe the gentleman was quite right; for I cannot believe, that to put on Chriſt, can mean any thing leſs than that they were true believers in Chriſt. Now then, if as many, or all of them that were baptized, had made their profeſſion, ſo that it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they had faith in Chriſt, then the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles did not baptize children that made no profeſſion: nor is there any believers that dare declare that all their infants have faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The third argument is drawn from Act. 15.10 <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples?</hi> Here they ſay, inaſmuch as it appears from the chapter, that the yoke was circumciſion which they would have laid upon children at eight days old, infants are called diſciples in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore they are ſo, and have a right to be baptized by the commiſſion, Mat. 28.19. where diſciples are ordered to be baptized, tho' the word children or infants is not mentioned.</p>
            <p>But let me aſk you why you do not admit infants to the Lord's table, inaſmuch as our Saviour tells us in Mat. 26.27. <hi>Drink ye all off it.</hi> Is not that as much an inſtitution for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as baptiſm? Do you indeed keep ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010571_0007_0F80D2469D0CFF18"/>according to your own mind?</p>
            <p>But for anſwer, I ſay the word <hi>why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples,</hi> doth not conclude, that all on whom they would have laid that yoke, were diſciples. The church of Antioch was a Gentile church, ſee Act. 21.25 the believers in it bad not been circumciſed; ſo that the putting the yoke upon the neck of the believers of the church of Antioch, of whom they ſpake, was putting a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples; altho' there might be thouſands of infants, or others which were not diſciples, on whom they would have laid that yoke. This will appear to be the true meaning of this text, if it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with our Saviour's explanation of the word DISCIPLE, ſee Luk. 14 27. <hi>And whoſoever doth not bear his croſs, and come after me, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my diſciple.</hi> Now did all the infants of the church of Antioch, and do all infants of all believers, take up their croſs and follow Chriſt? Ver. 26 <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple.</hi> Did, and do all the infants of believers, love God to that degree that their love to their fathers and mothers, and to their own lives, when in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition to their love to God, is but hatred? Of if you do not like my explanation, do all the infants of all believers hate their fathers and mothers, and their own lives, with a perfect hatred?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010571_0008_0F80D2475F5CF9F8"/>
The fourth argument is drawn from Acts 2. and part of the 38 and 39 verſes. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you—For the promiſe is to you and to your children.</hi> Here they argue that the promiſe was mentioned as an encouragement to both parents and children, to be baptized. I anſwer, that the promiſe is mentioned as an encouragement to them to repent, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; but not that they ſhould be baptized without repentance. But as true repentance cannot be, without true faith, this text is another inſtance of true faith's being a rule, in order to be admitted to baptiſm. Eſpecially when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the laſt part of the ſame verſe. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here I would aſk, was there ever a promiſe of remiſſion of ſins and of the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, made to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm without repentance? if not, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe they ſpeak of could be no encouragement to baptiſm without repentance. Again we ſee in the chapter theſe jewiſh believers were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed themſelves; but did they have their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized. NO. It is evident they did not, for we ſee verſe 42, they continued ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in the apoſtles doctrine: But they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſteadfaſtly in the practice of circumciſing their children, therefore that was the apoſtles doctrine, ſee Acts 21.20. <hi>And they were all zealous of the law:</hi> that is the law of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as appears from the 21ſt verſe. And they alſo adviſed St. Paul to ſhew the jewiſh believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010571_0009_0F80D2482537C560"/>that he kept that law, as in verſe 24. To circumciſe the children therefore, was the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les doctrine and the jewiſh believers practice. But if baptiſm was appointed in the room and ſtead of circumciſion, then circumciſion muſt have ceaſed, and would have been no more an inſtitution, than if it never had been inſtituted. Now to ſet up circumciſion as a ſeal after that, without divine warrant: was to ſet up a ſeal of their own in oppoſition to that which God had ſet up. Pray what manner of men do they make of the apoſtles, were they the vileſt of men? ſurely no.</p>
            <p>The fifth argument is drawn from Mark 10.14, 15. I do not remember any account of our Saviour's being diſpleaſed, but when ſomething was ſaid, which tended to hinder the channels of his mercy to poor periſhing ſinners. But I ſuppoſe no one will deny that thoſe children were brought to Chriſt to plead for mercy: likely their parents were poor and deſpiſed in the world; perhaps the diſciples therefore, tho't it below their bleſſed maſter, to take notice of ſuch miſerable creatures, as likely they appeared to be. But our Saviour ſoon corrects their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; and ſays he, <hi>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> I underſtand it is, as if he had ſaid, thoſe children are in a deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, polluted with ſin, and expoſed to the everlaſting wrath of God. Hinder them not from coming to me for mercy. In me is a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby is ſuſtained the whole kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010571_0010_0F80D248E2D8BEF0"/>
But they argue from the words, <hi>ſuffer little children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> That ſome little children belong to the kingdom of God, and therefore have a right to church-memberſhip and its ordinance. But why do they ſay ſome children? I never knew them to argue that the children that were brought to Chriſt, were children of believing parents. But I believe thoſe perſons that brought theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Chriſt, were converted perſons; and as it is truly every one's duty to ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to know what is their duty, and not to pin their faith upon other men's ſleeves without evidence, I am willing you ſhould make the beſt of your arguments; I will therefore give you the reaſon why I think ſo. — But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn — Obſerve the word, <hi>of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God:</hi> here is an ALL implied: —the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom means all the kingdom. Does it not? Is the kingdom of God made up of ſuch infants? Have all the infants of believing parents an intereſt in Chriſt by faith? If there be evidence of that, then they are proper ſubjects of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; but if not, how do they belong to the kingdom of God? But if you would have it, that by the kingdom of God is meant church-memberſhip, our Saviour tells you in the next verſe, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he ſhall not enter therein.</hi> — And can no perſon enter into your church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he receive it as a little child? You will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, doubtleſs they can and do.</p>
            <p>But I come now to let you know, why I think
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010571_0011_0F80D24AA0C0A0D8"/>thoſe perſons that brought the children to Chriſt, were converted perſons. When any perſon (at a time) is under the operation of the Spirit of God, and is brought to ſee that the puniſhment, eternal miſery! is, if any thing, much leſs than he deſerves; oh! now he is amazed at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God! that he is not ſent into the eternal torments of hell, Lev. 26.41. Ezek. 36.31. Now if his heart cries to God for mercy, God does ſhew himſelf, in and through Chriſt, Joh. 17.3. and chap 6.40. to be more willing to forgive him, than any of you could be to pull an only ſon, or your deareſt friend on earth out of the flaming fire, if he lay ſcreaming there. For <hi>we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</hi> Now if thoſe that brought the children to Chriſt, had not been made thus to know Chriſt, likely they would, with the unconverted multitude of that age, have called him the carpenter's ſon; or with the topping phariſees of them times, who were not willing that Chriſt ſhould preach, have demanded by what authority, and have ſaid <hi>this fellow, &amp;c.</hi> and not have come to him for a bleſſing upon their children. But the word <hi>(at a time)</hi> was put becauſe moſt people think they have known their puniſhment for ſin was juſt, ever ſince they came to the years of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, altho' their heart riſes up againſt it, and thinks hard of the puniſhment. This is what ſome call an hiſtorical knowledge, or learnt by man, and is not of the operation of the ſpirit of God. Job 36.22. <hi>Behold God exalteth by his power, who teacheth like him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010571_0012_0F80D24B1C8D3440"/>
Again, if they ſhould ſay they have had the ſame lively ſenſe of it always, ever ſince they had an underſtanding, I ſhould think it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame hiſtorical knowledge which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all natural men of underſtanding, and not from the Spirit of God, Song 3.4. and 5.4.</p>
            <p>The ſixth argument is taken from 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>And the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by the huſband, elſe were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</hi> Here they aſk what holineſs this can mean, if it is not ſuch an holineſs as intitles the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to baptiſm? To which I anſwer, that it may be ſuch an holineſs as the children of Iſrael had, on account of which they were called an holy people, an holy nation, &amp;c. which was an holineſs that did entitle them to circumciſion, but now to abſtinence from meats offered to idols, &amp;c. but not to baptiſm. Baptiſm is a profeſſion of the ſubject, that he has faith in Chriſt. See Col. 2.12. <hi>Being buried with him in baptiſm; wherein alſo ye are riſen with him thro' the faith.</hi> Says the Rev. Mr Fiſh, in his ſermons, p. 41. <q>As if he had ſaid, in and by your baptiſm, you ſignify and declare, that your old man, the body of ſin, is crucified with Chriſt.</q> Then how can the body of ſin be crucified with Chriſt, without faith in him? But was circumciſion a profeſſion of faith in Chriſt? The anſwer is, No: it was ordered to be adminiſtred to the males of the ſojourner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of Iſrael, who had a mind to keep the paſſover, and to all the males of the children of Iſrael. Were theſe all converted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010571_0013_0F80D24E6C4E4518"/>perſons? ſuch as could in truth profeſs that they were true believers in Chriſt? Do you think that God ordered or directed his people to be falſe? But ſays the Rev. Mr. Parſons, in his book, intitled, <hi>Infant Baptiſm vindicated,</hi> p. 28. <q>Circumciſion ſignified putting off the ſins of the fleſh and ſo does baptiſm, Coloſ. 2.11.</q> This text doth not ſay that circumciſion made with hands, did ſignify that the ſubjects of it had put off the ſins of the fleſh: but Abraham did not circumciſe without hands. Did circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſignify that the ſubjects of it had put off the ſins of the fleſh? No. Circumciſion was given to teach faith in Chriſt, and was a ſeal of the promiſe that God would juſtify ſuch as had or ſhould have faith in Chriſt, ſee Gal 3.8—29. <hi>And the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would juſtify the heathen through faith, preached before the goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying, in thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed. And if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi> Thus circumciſion was a token, aſſurance, or ſeal, that God would juſtify Abraham, inaſmuch as he had faith in Chriſt, tho' it was before he was circumciſed, Rom. 4 11. But does not baptiſm ſignify that the ſubjects of it had put off the ſins of the fleſh? Why then did the apoſtles require faith in Chriſt, as a rule for their adminiſtring the ordinance of baptiſm? You don't pretend that the commiſſion, Mat. 28.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>9 authorized the apoſtles to baptize any but diſciples; and they are ſuch as are true believers in Chriſt, if I can underſtand our Saviour's explanation of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010571_0014_0F80D24F316F9038"/>the word <hi>Diſciple,</hi> in the 14th chapter of Luke. Will not God's ſaying in Jer. 31.31, 32. <hi>I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah: Not according to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that I made with their fathers,</hi> convince you that there is a difference between the new church-covenant, and that made with Abraham; altho' the new excels, yet that made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was great. Although the apoſtle Paul, writing to the Roman church, ſays, 2 chap. 26. <hi>Shall not his uncircumciſion be counted for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion?</hi> Such as have faith in Chriſt will be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when one that is circumciſed, not having faith in Chriſt, will be condemned. He in the 3d chap v.i ſays, <hi>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumciſion?</hi> ver. 2. <hi>Chiefly, becauſe that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</hi> A great gift this, which taught the main errand of the bible, viz. Faith in Chriſt. But oh! how ſlothful is man, that he muſt be whipt with the yoke of circumciſion, to make him remember himſelf, and to teach his children. <hi>O the depth of the riches hath of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his ways paſt finding out. To whom be glory forever.</hi> Amen. Rom. 11.33.36.</p>

               <head>With Reſpect to the Mode of Baptiſm.</head>
               <p>IT is argued by ſome, in favor of believers bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, from Acts 8.38, 39. that both Philip and the Eunuch went down into the water, and came up out of the water; from whence they ſay it is evident that the Eunuch was baptized by dipping.</p>
               <p>This is anſwered by ſome, in favor of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for baptiſm, that the Greek prepoſition (<hi>ek</hi>) here rendered <hi>out of,</hi> properly ſignifies <hi>from.</hi> To which for anſwer I ſay, that the word <hi>from.</hi> being alone, has no ſignification at all. If I ſhould meet you in the ſtreet, and ſay <hi>from,</hi> what could you know by it? <hi>Ek,</hi> therefore of itſelf, or with ſome additional word, muſt ſignify <hi>from</hi> the place where they were. Now if the place where they were was <hi>in</hi> the water, then the old tranſlators were right in ſaying <hi>out of the water;</hi> for to ſay <hi>from in the water,</hi> is not good Engliſh, although it would have the ſame meaning: but if the place where they were was <hi>at</hi> the water, then theſe new tranſlators. Wherefore the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument turns upon the Greck prepoſition, <hi>eis,</hi> which they ſay in the place under conſideration, was rendered <hi>into,</hi> and naturally ſignifies <hi>unto,</hi> and is commonly ſo uſed in the new teſtament. Thus Mat. 15.24. <hi>Unto the loſt ſheep.</hi> Joh. 13.1. <hi>Unto the end.</hi> Joh. 7.8. <hi>Unto the feaſt.</hi> 1 Theſ 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>into,</hi> ſo that we might have ſeen the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But caſting my eyes into a Greek teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where in the text under conſideration, Act. 8.38. the apoſtle has written <hi>eis to;</hi> now if they ſhew us that <hi>eis to,</hi> was always tranſlated <hi>unto,</hi> and never tranſlated <hi>into,</hi> and that ſome other Greek word was always tranſlated <hi>into,</hi> and never tranſlated <hi>unto,</hi> I ſhall believe the old tranſlators were wrong then, and never till then. Thus they have utterly failed of ſhewing that the old tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators were wrong. How, when in the text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, the Greek is <hi>eis to,</hi> do they think to convince us by ſaying that <hi>eis</hi> alone ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>unto?</hi> Nevertheleſs in my obſervation, there is verſes in ſcripture wherein there is <hi>into</hi> in Engliſh, and only <hi>eis</hi> in Greek. Thus the Greek, in Acts 16.40. there is <hi>eis,</hi> the Engliſh in that text is, <hi>and entered into the houſe of Lydia;</hi> and in Rev. 17.11. there is <hi>eis,</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>into perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> which gives me reaſon to think that the Greclans, when they intended <hi>into,</hi> wrote <hi>eis to,</hi> unleſs where there was a word in the text that forced the ſenſe, <hi>into,</hi> as in the firſt of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ENTERED, we cannot ſuppoſe that they entered the houſe, and did not go in: ſo in the ſecond inſtance, the beaſt could not be ſuppoſed to go <hi>to</hi> perdition, and not go <hi>into</hi> perdition. The like obſervation I have in our own language in many inſtances: ſee 1 Sam. 1.21. <hi>And the man Elkanah, and all his houſe, went up to offer.</hi> What perſon of ſenſe can ſuppoſe that Elkanah went up with his houſe to offer, and left all his people at home. But what if the text had declared,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010571_0017_0F80D2511FC93500"/>that Elkanah's houſe was all of a light fire, would you have ſuppoſed his people were all of a blaze, and burnt like tinder? Is not the like done by thoſe people, with reſpect to the Greek word, <hi>hudata polla,</hi> which they ſay ſignifies <hi>many waters,</hi> altho' it is tranſlated <hi>much water,</hi> ſee Joh. 3.23. <hi>And John was baptizing in Enon, near to Salem, becauſe there was much water there.</hi> Had John any need to baptize in Enon, becauſe there was much water there, when a ſmall vial full of water would baptize an hundred, according to your mode of ſprinkling? Surely now if the people had water to drink, they might have eaſily ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two drops to put in their face, for that would be ſprinkling; for they ſay it is not in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water which they baptize with: but they ſay they went unto Enon, to get drink for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their horſes. Who ever took a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Enon to get drink for himſelf and his horſe, and all his other creatures at home, had a ſufficiency and to ſpare, ſo had no need to drive them. But they baptized in Enon, becauſe there was much water there, or water ſufficient to plunge the ſubject in. But they further ſay in favor of ſprinkling, that it appears from Acts 2. 41. that there was three thouſand baptized at Jeruſalem in one day, (moſt certainly towards the cloſe of the day) and was there any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that they all ſhould be baptized by dipping in ſo ſhort a time? I do not underſtand the text, that they were baptized that day, but that they were added that day. Now when perſons are converted, they do in heart give up themſelves
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010571_0018_0F80D25262CB3230"/>ſolemnly, voluntarily and freely to God, as their king to rule and reign over them, and to obey all his commands, which teaches them every duty to their brother or brethren. Baptiſm therefore is a renewing and ſolemn profeſſion of this covenant, and is to be complied with as ſoon as may be. 1 John 2.19 <hi>They went our from us, but they were not of us.</hi> It muſt be ſuppoſed that thoſe here ſpoken of were baptized perſons, yet they were not of the apoſtles or children of God, becauſe they were not converted perſons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not of them. Ergo, baptiſm is not adding. Jer. 31.33. <hi>But this ſhall be the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, After thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> It is not to be ſuppoſed that God never conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a perſon before, but that this ſhould be the rule of church-membering in the new church-covenant, a covenant which is not according to the old national church-covenant, in which they had to teach every man his brother. This ſhews that they did not all know the Lord, which were in the old covenant, ver. 32. But with reſpect to the new covenant, how ſoon was it declared, that Simon the ſorcerer had neither part nor lot in the matter when it was found that his heart was not right in the ſight of God, Act. 8.21. further ſee Act. 2.47. <hi>And the Lord added to the church daily, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> and not that the apoſtles added them. Therefore the text, a and 41 of Acts, doth not prove but they were baptized the next day, or onwards.</p>

                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:010571_0019_0F80D11560A02470"/>
Again, if the word of God, as recorded in the original languages, is wrong tranſlated into the Engliſh tongue, then that which is wrong can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the word of God. But the truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bible is proved by many witneſſes, that as it is now tranſlated it is the word of God. For there is no perſon who has been converted in the path way or line of the goſpel, but what knows aſſuredly that the bible is the word of God. But if you ſhould tell me that there are ſome paſſages in ſcripture which are not thus proved, I would tell you for anſwer, that the tranſlators were not men that were then carrying on arguments in favor of their own party: but as they were men of the greateſt knowledge in the tongues that were then to be found in the nation, and doubtleſs were vaſtly ſuperior to any of our learned men that pretend in this day to correct them, and that they did tranſlate <hi>into,</hi> &amp;c. from the ſame Greek word that they uſed to tranſlate <hi>into</hi> from; therefore; I ſhall believe them, if a thouſand reverends tells me to the contrary. But if theſe men may tranſlate the bible as they pleaſe, what argument can they not gain? And now it appears from Acts 8 38.39. that ſprinkling is not according to the initituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and it alſo appears by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>NOW ſuffer me to ſay ſomething reſpecting the unreaſonableneſs of compelling the people of one perſuaſion to hear or ſupport the miniſters of another. Can a perſon who has been redeemed, be ſo ungrateful as to hire a miniſter to preach up a doctrine which in his heart he believes to be directly contrary to the inſtitution of his redeemer? Now if one of you ſhould happen to be in company with a number of Roman Catholicks, who ſhould tell you that if you would not hire a miniſter to preach up tranſubſtantiation, and the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images to your children and to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking people, they would cut off your head; could you do it? Can you any better ſubmit to hire a miniſter to preach up a doctrine which you in your heart believe directly contrary to the inſtitution of Chriſt? I do not doubt but that many of you, and do not know but that all of you know what it is to experience redeeming love: and if ſo, how can you take a perſon of another perſuaſion, and put him in goal for a trifling ſum, deſtroy his eſtate and ruin his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily (as you ſignify the law will bear you out) when he is careful to ſupport the religion which he in his conſcience looks upon to be right, who honeſtly tells you it is wronging his conſcience to pay to your miniſter, and that he may not do it though he ſuffer? Mat. 18 33. Should you not <hi>have had compaſſion on thy fellow ſervant, even as I had pity on thee?</hi> How doth it ſeem to a people of another perſuaſion, to have you ſay, hire me a miniſter to preach up my doctrines to myſelf

May we not as well do it ourſelves, and that would be lying in us, and knowingly contradicting our Saviour. Do you grudge to ſupport your own miniſter, ſo far as he is faithful in what you ſay is your Saviour's religion? Mat. 10.8. <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> What if a number of children, on the requeſt of a father, ſhould ſay one to another, Do you do it; and do you do it; and I wiſh bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would do it?
