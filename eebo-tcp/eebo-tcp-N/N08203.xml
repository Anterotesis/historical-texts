            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Cartaret Rede, Daughter of Mr. John Rede, late of Potton, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, near the City of Sarum, Wiltſhire, was born the 7th of January, 1693.</head>
            <p>WHEN ſhe was about 4 Years of Age, ſhe being aſked who was her greateſt Enemy, ſhe reply'd <hi>SIN</hi> was her greateſt Enemy. When ſhe was between 4 and 5 Years of Age, ſhe took great delight in reading the 2d of <hi>Luke;</hi> and when ſhe read about <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> that there was no room for them in the Inn, and that the Babe was laid in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhe burſt out into a Paſſion of Tears, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'What! was there no room in the Inn for the Lord of Glory, but muſt He lie in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, among the Beaſts.

Creatures: Then ſaid ſhe, it may be the Lord may take me away before my Father and You. I told her ſhe ſhould not ſpend her Spirit. She reply'd, when I am with God and good Angels, I ſhall want neither Food nor Raiment, for God will give me all I want. A little while after, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me?</hi> He did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me one Night, and I hope He will reſtore me again. Another time as ſhe ſat by the Fire, ſhe ſaid my heart trembles, and burſt out into a Paſſion of Tears. I aſking her what ſhe did a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the Evening, the Maid putting on the Child's Linnen to go abroad the next Day, ſhe aſked me if ſhe ſhould not learn to dance, to which I reply'd, that ſhe ſhould, but that I was afraid it would take up her Mind from bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Things. Then ſhe ſaid I hope the Lord will keep me from Pride and Vanity; for it is the Lord that muſt keep me from ſinning againſt him; for we can do nothing without Him; then ſhe mentioned that Scripture, <hi>Let the Sinner forſake his Ways; and the unrighteous Man his Tho'ts and

            </p>
            <p>The 14th. Inſtant in the Evening ſhe cry'd for ſomething I tho't not fit to give her, fearing it would make her ſick; I aſk'd her whether ſhe was ready to die? ſhe immediately anſwer'd Yes, if the Lord will take away Sin from me, then I ſhall go to Heaven, for I would not die in my Sins; for if I ſhould, God hath ſaid that ſuch ſhall depart to the Devil and his Angels: The Lord knows all we do and ſay, and our very Thoughts; his Preſence is every where; I muſt meditate upon God in the Night watches, and if I do, I ſhall rejoyce in him; Then ſhe ment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd that Place of Scripture, Iſaiah 55. 6. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 26th Inſtant, complaining of a pain in her Ear ſhe ſaid it is the Lord that ſends me this pain, I know how I can be ſav'd, only by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; for he hath ſaid, <hi>they ſhall be my People, and I will be their GOD;</hi> her Father being by, ſaid, that if ſhe underſtood what ſhe ſpake, ſhe were fit for Church Communion; ſhe anſwer'd him, I hope God will teach me to underſtand what I ſay, for he has promis'd me <hi>to write his Laws in my heart and put it in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part,</hi> and I muſt pray to him, that I may

never depart from him. And having a little eaſe, ſhe ſaid, the Lord hath eas'd me, and I muſt pray to him, for he hath ſaid, <hi>Enter into your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and ſhut your Door and pray to your Father which is in ſecret, and your Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward you openly.</hi>

            <p>The 27th Inſtant, having ſome Friends which came to ſpend a little time in Prayer with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enter'd upon the Duty, the Child of her own accord went to them, and ſaid, Pray to the Lord for me, that he would make me his Servant, that I may love, fear and obey him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> the 9th being ſpeaking of Pride by Way of Diſcourſe, not minding the Child, ſhe took it up ſaying, we muſt not be Proud, for God has ſaid, <hi>He reſiſteth the Proud but giveth Grace to the Humble. God's ways are ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all his Paths are Peace.</hi>

Then I aſk'd her how ſhe knew her Sins were Pardoned? ſhe ſaid, in and thro' Chriſt, God could Pardon her Sins, for I am nothing of my ſelf, but he can do every Thing Another time ſhe ſaid, ſometimes I do believe that Chriſt dy'd for my Sins, and roſe again for my Juiſtfication; but ſometimes I am afraid, and do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He did or no. <hi>March</hi> 17 ſhe ſaid, as my Father was at Duty, this came into my Mind; that <hi>when Chriſt ſhall appear, we ſhall appear with him in Glory</hi> And at another time, this came into my Mind, that <hi>when Chriſt ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, and we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> She further ſaid, I can go to God in none but Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for I have no Righteoſuſnes but his; the Wicked eat the Bread of Wickedneſs, but we muſt wait for the Salvation of the Lord; and we muſt not only ſpeak of the Things of God but we muſt act them, or elſe we mock God; the Lord give me a heart ſo to do; in Hell there is no reſt, but crying out Day and Night. The Day we left <hi>London,</hi> I being in a low frame of Spirit, the Child came to me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before we took Coach, and ſaid, I'll tell you what came into my Mind, this Text, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Abraham, I am thy Shield, and thy exceeding great Reward,</hi> Gen 15 1 I could not but admire the Goodneſs of God, to ſend me ſuch a ſuitable Word by the Mouth of ſuch a Child.</p>

awoke very early, ſpeaking to me, ſaid, theſe words juſt now came into my Mind, that God does puniſh us much leſs than our iniquities do deſerve: A little after ſhe ſaid, God brings Judgments upon Men and Beaſts. Then I bid her go to Sleep, ſo ſhe lay ſtill a little while, and then ſhe ſaid I wiſh my Brother <hi>Charles</hi> may mind Faith in Chriſt, for <hi>every one that is in Chriſt, is a new Creature:</hi> The Lord does trouble us in this World, but in Heaven we ſhall have no Trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 17th, ſhe ſaid Father, when we are in Heaven, we ſhall want no Food but be fill'd with Righteouſneſs: Then ſhe fetch'd that place of Scripture where Chriſt ſaid to the Young Man, Luke 12. 33. <hi>Go ſell that thou haſt and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven.</hi> Yeſterday Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſaid to her Father, pray look me this place of Scripture, which juſt now came into my Mind, Coloſ. 3. 4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life, ſhall appear, we ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi>

Pray that I may be with God when I die, and that He would take away this wicked Heart; And another time, a little time before we went to Duty, ſhe ſaid, to her Father, I deſire you would Pray for me; he ſaid, what ſhall I Pray for, for thee? ſhe ſaid, that God would keep me, and that He would give me a Heart to know Him, love and fear Him, and give me Faith in Chriſt, that I might have an Intereſt in Him; for, ſaid ſhe, He is the Maker of Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and all that are therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> the 11th in the Evening, as ſhe went up to Bed, ſhe ſaid to me, I deſire, that when You pray to the Lord, you would remember me, and I will pray my ſelf alſo; for 'tis ſaid in Scripture, <hi>pray always.</hi> When ſhe came up, ſhe deſir'd me to read her two Hymns, which ſhe look'd out her ſelf, about Chriſt's Death and Satisfaction, which read, ſhe went to her Father, and ſaid to him, we have ſinful Hearts by Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me again, on a ſudden ſhe was ſtruck with a very great Pain in her Stomach, which caus'd her to cry out aloud, <hi>Eaſe me, and lay no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me than Thou wilt enable me to bear.</hi>

            <p>O ſaid ſhe again, that I could ſay with <hi>David, It is good for me that I have been Afflicted</hi> I may ſay, it has been good for me; for before I was afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I went aſtray. I being much concern'd, ſhe perceiving that I wept, ſhe ſaid, pray don't be troubled for me, you have cauſe to rejoice; for if I die, I ſhall be with God, and never Sin no more; ſhe deſir'd her Father to pray for her, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was taken ill, ſhe had been at Prayer,

amongſt other Expreſſions ſhe had this; begging God that ſhe might truly Repent, be a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Chriſt, that God would give her a new Heart, and renew a right Spirit within her: As ſhe went to Bed, ſhe ſaid, the Lord be with You, and keep you the approaching Day: The next Morning I went to take her up, ſhe ſaid, I bleſs God, I am much better; then ſhe mention'd that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 37. ſaying, <hi>He that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry:</hi> but Oh! that he may not come before I am Converted; for to ſuch as look for him, he ſhall appear a ſecond time.</p>
            <p>This Day I was ſpeaking of having an Iſſue made for her, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I had rather not, I would rather die, that I might ſin no more.</hi> This Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went up with the Maid to put her to Bed, ſhe deſir'd me to bleſs God on her behalf, and alſo to pray for her. <hi>Sept.</hi> 21ſt, ſhe ſaid, Father, where are theſe words? <hi>This is our God we have waited for him, we will joy and rejoyce in his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> he told her where it was, ſhe looking it out read it: then ſaid ſhe, where is that word, <hi>The Earth is the Lord's and the fulneſs thereof?</hi> I aſk'd her why ſhe aſk'd for thoſe places? ſhe ſaid becauſe they came into her Mind. <hi>Sept.</hi> 29. ſhe ſaid to me, Mother, when I die I muſt leave all theſe Earthly Things behind me: About an Hour after, ſhe ſaid to her Siſter and I, as I was coming up Stairs, theſe Words came into my Mind, <hi>According to the Day, ſo ſhall thy Strength be;</hi> I aſk'd her what ſhe did infer from that place? ſhe ſaid I ſhall have ſtrength in my Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some Hours after ſhe mention'd the ſame place

The 2d Day, having done ſome childiſh Things, being taken ſoon after with a Pain in her Teeth; her Father told her the Lord did puniſh her for being Naughty; ſhe burſt into a Paſſion of Tears. I could not get from her what was the Matter for ſome time, but at laſt ſhe ſaid, Oh! that God would take this wicked Heart out of me! I have an abominable wicked Heart; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Repent of my ſelf; if I did <hi>reſiſt the Devil, he would fly from me;</hi> I am ſorry I have griev'd You, pray forgive me: Juſt before ſhe was taken ill, ſhe was reading the 55th of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſhe ſtopt and ſaid, nothing but the Blood of Chriſt can cleanſe me from Sin: I ſaid, why ſo? if you are good, and do good Works, will not your own Righteouſneſs ſave you? this I ſaid to prove her, ſhe reply'd our Righteouſneſs is a wicked Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, therefore it cannot ſave us.

            </p>
            <p>In the Evening I aſk'd her how ſhe came to aſk for ſuch a Scripture? ſhe ſaid the Lord bro't it to her Remembrance. I was reading about the Sins of Iſrael, where God ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Nov.</hi> the 2d. I came up into her Chamber, and found her reading Mr. <hi>John Janeway'</hi>s Life and Death; ſhe was all in Tears, ſhe ſaid to me, Oh! that I were ſuch a Worm as this was! that God would give me Repentance unto Life! Oh! that

            <p>Another time ſhe ſaid, I have the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to wrap me round, I ſhall be ſav'd, I ſhall appear without ſpot. This being Sabbath Day, ſhe ſaid, the Lord make me ſuch an one as may taſte His Royal Meat; I hope the Lord will Convert me to Himſelf, and will not let me Periſh in the State of Sin and Miſery.</p>

               <hi>Nov.</hi> the 20th, ſhe ſaid to her Father, we muſt prepare for the Coming of Chriſt; yes, ſaid her Father, 'tis our Duty: ſhe ſaid ſo it is, and we, muſt ſay as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>Turn Thou me, and I ſhall be turned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 22d, ſhe ſaid, I wept this Morning for fear the Lord will caſt me into Hell. I ſaid, What diſſatisfies you now? what hopes have you that He will not? ſhe ſaid, He has promiſed me to change my Heart.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday Morning I went up to her Chamber, ſhe being in Bed, I found her in a great paſſion of Weeping, having a Book in her Hand; I aſk'd her why ſhe wept?

This Evening her Father and I ſpeaking of the Temptations of the Children of God; ſhe ſitting by, ſaid there are no temptation in Heaven,

there is nothing but Joy and praiſing of God. A few days ſince, I being gone from Home, ſhe was in a fault, which I was told when I came; I laid the Evil of it before her; ſhe burſt out into Tears and earneſtly deſiring me to forgive her ſaying, God will forgive me. I heard her ſaying, <hi>Who ſhall deliver us from the Body of this Death?</hi>

This Evening I was ſpeaking to my Maid of Chriſt; the Child ſtanding by, ſaid, Oh! that I were converted to Chriſt I long to have Chriſt. I aſk'd her whether ſhe would have Him to make her Holy as well as Happy; ſhe ſaid, Yes ſhe would have him upon his own Terms, for it was the beſt Marriage to be marry'd to Chriſt: Oh! ſaid ſhe, If I had an Intereſt in Chriſt, I ſhould be glad to go to God immediately. And then ſhe kneel'd down, and did earneſtly beg that God would reveal Chriſt to her, uſing this Expreſſion, <hi>My Soul, wait thou only upon God.</hi>

When I came Home, I found the Child very Ill, ſhe ſaid to me, I am Ill, but theſe Words came into my Mind; <hi>Thoſe that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their Strength; They ſhall mount up with Wings as Eagles; They ſhall run and not be weary; They ſhall walk, and not faint:</hi> And theſe Words led me to the Rock that is higher than I; I aſk'd her what that Rock was?

            <p>The Day ſhe was took ſick, which was the firſt of <hi>December.</hi> 1701, ſhe rehears'd the ſameplace, and ſaid, He has had Mercy upon me; ſhe ſpoke little all her Sickneſs for ſhe ſeem'd to have her Spirits much ſeiz'd.</p>
            <p>The Sabbath day Evening, ſhe ſaid to me, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I hope the Lord will reſtore me to do that Work He has for me to do; for he who has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

will perfect it; theſe Words are come upon my Mind. <hi>He that gather'd much, had none over; and he that gather'd little, had no lack.</hi> Her mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Scripture, has, and does give me ſuch Satisfaction; for I have been made to ſee that tho' ſhe had liv'd to gather little Grace, yet ſhe ſhould ſtand as compleat in the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as if ſhe had liv'd many Years to bring Glory to God. From this time to <hi>Thurſday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on which ſhe dy'd, ſhe ſpoke little, but ſlept much, till the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night: ſhe grew very reſtleſs, the <hi>Thurſday</hi> worſe; it was the fourth Day that ſhe had been blind; call'd to me, and ſaid, I do begin to ſee now. Her Eyes being faſt, I ſaid to her, What, is it with the Eyes of your Mind? She reply'd, Yes it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaid, What do you ſee? She anſwer'd, I ſee Chriſt hanging upon the Tree: Something ſhe ſaid ſoftly, her Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent. A little after I ſaid to her, Does God lift up the Light of his Countenance upon your Soul? She ſaid, I hope he doth. I aſk'd her. Are you willing to go to Chriſt? She anſwer'd, I hope I am. The Agonies of Death being upon her, the laſt ſenſible Word ſhe ſpoke to me, was, <hi>Pray for me;</hi> deſiring alſo her Father to pray for her, and then had ſome Flaſhings of Lightneſs as ſhe grew weaker. She lay very ſtill all the while her Father pray'd by her, and about Eleven a-Clock ſhe fell faſt aſleep, the 7th of <hi>December</hi> 1701, aged ſix Years; 11 Months, and 3 Day.</p>
