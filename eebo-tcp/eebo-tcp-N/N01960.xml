            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the moſt <hi>vile Perſonal Abuſes,</hi> and unprecedented Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies lately ſpewed out, it was reſolved, to drop the Affair, that Contention might ceaſe, and leave the <hi>habitual Scriblers</hi> Maſters of the Field of Scandal, they having already (after little or no Oppoſition) given up their Titles to correct Stile, Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Thought, and Force of Argument. But finding them ſtill oppoſing the Endeavours uſed to caution the Town and Country againſt their raſh and thoughtleſs Procedure in a <hi>medical Experiment</hi> of Conſequence, they continuing on their <hi>bare Word only,</hi> to affirm it well vouched, prudently managed, of uninterrupted Succeſs, and that the Miniſters Pretenſions to Phyſick is as good as that of the ableſt Practitioners in the Land: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Publick here and elſewhere being thus impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon, and to maintain the Practitioners in their <hi>Rights and Priviledges,</hi> againſt the Invaſion of ſome vain ſelf-conceited Men, is the Deſign of the following Pages.</p>
            <p>The weak Artifice they uſe to drown all Argument from the other Side, is the Clamour of <hi>Enemies to the Miniſtry of this Country,</hi> tho' theſe Men they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally aim at are well known to be their <hi>constant Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>generous Contributors</hi> towards their Support. If a Stranger to the Affair were to read their Writings, he could not think otherways than that all the Miniſters of <hi>Boſton</hi> are Inoculators, all at Variance with the Practitioners in Phyſick, in ſhort, that they all are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Things alledg'd againſt a few. To vindicate the Miniſtry of <hi>Boſton</hi> from theſe Inſinuations; all the Town knows, that ſeveral of them have declared againſt Inoculation till further Light in the Practice, and many of them do not in the leaſt meddle; we have here among our Miniſters <hi>Viros Eruditione, Probitate eſt Rerum uſte Spectabiles</hi>; that is, not only inoffenſive in their Life and Converſation, but alſo of ſhining active Virtues. There are in <hi>Boſton</hi> Sixteen Settled Miniſters; and of them, Six only are tranſiently ſaid to have by Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſured the Inoculated, whereof ſome, finding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb facs="unknown:002331_0004_0FDBC9A79F8EA8B8"/>
to ſpread among their Flocks, out of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Spirit of Meekneſs, forbear giving further Occaſions for Animoſities; only Two or Three of the whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have exceeded their Bounds, and wrote practically on a <hi>medical</hi> Subject, for which they were by the <hi>Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> called in Queſtion, not pretending to meddle with their Life and Converſation or Miniſtry; preſuming at leaſt that a Parſon out of his Office may be fallible.</p>
            <p>Moſt of their vile <hi>Calumnys</hi> I impute rather to an unguarded Paſſion, than to their Ignorance of the World and good Manners, or a Propenſity and Inclination to be malicious. The old <hi>venerable</hi> Dr. <hi>I. M.</hi> deſervedly eſteemed by all in this Country, his Name and Character with me ſhall be ſacred, no Provocation can oblige me to ſhow him any diſreſpect; but the Son, a <hi>Degener a Patre,</hi> the <hi>Hero</hi> in this Farce of <hi>Calumny,</hi> is uſed with a Philoſophical Freedom. The Univerſity of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> from the Reſpect they bear to <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> uſed him kindly, tho' to them <hi>nec de facie quidem notus,</hi> and gratify'd his Vanity with a <hi>D. D.</hi>; he in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital calls a Native of <hi>Great Britain</hi> (beſides many vile Names) a meer Stranger, abuſes their Country, ridicules their Family Names, makes their Church Diſcipline ludicrous, as if they were guilty of ſtooping to take Cognizance of little trivial Matters. Perhaps he may oblige this his <hi>Alma Mater</hi> to diſown him for a Son, as it ſeems the <hi>Royal Society</hi> have already done, by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Name in their yearly Liſts.</p>
            <p>In the following Letter, 1. Some harſh ſounding Words in the Letter concerning Inoculation to <hi>A. S.</hi> &amp;c. which have been miſrepreſented and given ſome Offence, are explained. 2. The late Calumnys of ſome Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, particularly in a little Book called, a <hi>Vindication of the Ministers,</hi> are modeſtly conſidered. 3. The <hi>idea</hi> of a good Voucher in <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> not conſiſtent with the Conſtitution of our principal Inſtrument of Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on whoſe Word all did at firſt depend. 4. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> Pretenſions and Qualifications for the Practice of Phyſick is enquired into. 5. Some Additional looſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Practice of <hi>Inoculation of the Small Pox</hi> in this Country.</p>

            <p>OUR former Intimacy in our Travels and Study abroad is all Apology I ſhall make for addreſſing you with this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which contains an Affair local, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and relating only to private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Deſign of the laſt to you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in this Place, was, that <hi>Inoculation might be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended</hi> from being carried into the Country Towns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Method or Contrivance was endeavour'd, to make it more eaſy to the <hi>Patient</hi> and ſafe to the <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,</hi> from the Hopes we had that the Severity of the Seaſon in a natural and ordinary Way might <hi>check</hi> its further Progreſs, or the after Seaſon might be <hi>more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> for the Practice, or till their cautious Procedure in <hi>England</hi> might be ſome <hi>Guide</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

As Guilt is apt to fly into a Man's Face, ſo it was here; it put them in a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which is commonly ſaid to be inconſiſtent with Reaſon, makes them drop all <hi>Argument</hi> (<hi>we will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Controverſy</hi> ſays the Vindicator <hi>Page</hi> 11.) and fall on with <hi>Calumny, Srurrility, flat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the good of their Country did publickly adviſe two or three Miniſters againſt being too impetuous, without Method or Contrivance, to puſh Headlong a <hi>novel</hi> and <hi>dubious Practice</hi> of Conſequence in <hi>Phyſick</hi>; this, <hi>with a Clamour,</hi> they call rendring the Miniſtry vain and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>To obviate the Miſrepreſentation of ſome harſh ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words, in the Letter concerning Inoculation to</hi> A. S. &amp;c. Becauſe it is reckoned very unfair and unbecoming a Gentleman, to aſſign Names to <hi>Anonymous</hi> Books (where the Author has not the Vanity to think that his Name can be any Recommendation to the Book, or does not value himſelf on the Performance) no Man's Name was wrote at Length, excepting Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s, (his Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prefixed to his little Book,) and that only in this Paſſage, <hi>Mr.</hi> Colman's <hi>Fever in the Fleſh</hi>; that he might have the Honour of this <hi>new Species</hi> of Fever, which has hitherto been overlooked by the eminent ancient and modern <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> The Words <hi>Judicious Magistrates and Miniſters</hi> are borrow'd from Dr. <hi>I. M.</hi>'s Reaſons for Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and not by way of Ridicule: For as Society is maintain'd by the Reverence of the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Reſpect due to the Authority of their <hi>Laws,</hi> to derogate from either is the Abhorrence of all good Men.

Is it not a Sort of <hi>Impiety</hi> to

aſſert that a Man dyes in the uſe of the Means, if he dye in the voluntary Uſe of a Practice which by infecting the Neighbourhood, certainly occaſions the Death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and is not without Riſque to himſelf? To compare the Difficulties they meet with in their Promoting of the ſpreading of Infection, to thoſe our Saviour met with in the Propagation of the Goſpel, is not this an <hi>Abuſe of the Scripture</hi>? Theſe Aſſertions whether <hi>Lay</hi> or <hi>Clergy</hi> may be contradicted, for in this Country we allow of no <hi>Infallibility</hi> from the youngeſt Clerk to the Pope himſelf.

            <p>The Vindicator of the Miniſters calls a Letter pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Mr. <hi>Campbells</hi> News Paper, <hi>July</hi> 24. 1721, a <hi>ſaucy Libel.</hi> I fancy he is beſide himſelf; for there is no Miniſter there ſo much as hinted at, excepting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr. <hi>C.

Miniſters ought to ſhow Men their Errors with the greateſt <hi>Temper and Humanity</hi>; but the <hi>reverſe</hi> of this, to the great Grief of ſome of their own People, has too much appeared on this occaſion. A <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> writer ſays, <hi>It is no mortal Sin to Calumniate ſafely to preſerve ones Honour</hi>; another ſays, <hi>We may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Slander any Perſon, by charging him with Crimes that are utterly falſe, if againſt his Teſtimony we cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways defend our ſelves.</hi> This is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Practice and not to be encouraged.</p>
            <p>The late <hi>Pamphlet</hi> called, <hi>A Vindication of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> is adviſedly ſaid to be wrote by ſundry Hands; for it is not poſſible to Imagine that one Perſon of any Degree of good Memory and ſound Judgment could ſo often <hi>contradict</hi> himſelf and Matter of Fact; ſometimes with one hand throwing the moſt <hi>fulſome Flatteries</hi> on himſelf and Brethren, not animadverting to that noted ſaying, <hi>He that commends himſelf, never purchaſes our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe</hi>; and with the other Hand the fouleſt Dirt, hit or miſs, acted by this Principle, <hi>Calumniare audacter,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Ministers Pretenſions and Qualifications for the Practice of Phyſick enquired into.</hi> Some of ours here, like the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Clergy of old, would have the People believe, that they are the only proper Judges in all Caſes of Literature.

<q>And we at laſt find too by ſad Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that they underſtood as well the managing the Diſtemper (Small Pox) then (43 Years ago) as we do now.</q>
I could not poſſibly conceive the Natural Cauſe of this Thought or Aſſertion, till a little Piece called a <hi>Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. was lately publiſhed, wherein he explains himſelf thus, (<hi>p.</hi> 10.) 'Mr. <hi>Thomas Thatcher,</hi> a Miniſters, Forty Three Years ago, wrote a Sheet of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections (which was certainly uſeful in the then Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Colony) and perhaps ſince that Time no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter has wrote on that Subject, till this Book of <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi> did appear, which is to make Amends for Forty three Years loſt Time in improving, and qualifies the Author to be ſuch a one, as he ſays, the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in the Land need not be aſhamed to adviſe withal.</p>

Further, we find in great Towns, where there is Variety and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Buſineſs, that the Practitioners may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified for their <hi>particular Profeſſions; Phyſick</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is divided into diſtinct Branches, as <hi>Phyſicians, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Apothecarys, Chymiſts,</hi> &amp;c. each keeping within his Bounds. How then can we ſuppoſe, a Man of a <hi>Vocation,</hi> which requires all his Time conſcientiouſly to diſcharge the ſame, ſhould pretend to a Buſineſs of ſo great Extent? <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> the Prince of Phyſicians, in his <hi>Epiſtola ad Democritum,</hi> modeſtly ſays, <hi>Ego enim ad finem Medicinae non pervent Etamſi jam ſenex ſim.

            </p>
            <p>To be more or leſs <hi>Book learned,</hi> is not a ſufficient Qualification for a <hi>Phyſician</hi>; there muſt be <hi>Inſtitutio a Puero</hi>; the candid <hi>Sydenham</hi> ſays, <hi>Haec ars haud rectius perdiſcenda eſt, quem ab ipſius artis excercitio et uſu.</hi> A very eminent modern Phyſician ſays, That many <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> of univerſal Reading, and <hi>old Women</hi> by long Nurſing, know as much of Phyſick as to kill themſelves and Neighbours when ſick, by the prepoſterous indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Uſe of ſome noted Medicines.</p>

<q>
                  <l>'Tis ſtrange how ſome Mens Tempers ſuit</l>
                  <l>(Like Bawd and Brandy) with Diſpute;</l>

            <p>Their Methods and procedure are acknowledged <hi>raſh</hi> by many of their own Inoculation Friends; this Man continues to affirm it a <hi>regular Procedure</hi> be ſetting the Matter in a falſe Light. Is it not Fact, that Dr. <hi>C.

About this Time the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had got into ſeveral Houſes, ſo that Watche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon the Noiſe of <hi>Inoculation</hi> being attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Justices</hi> and <hi>Select-Men</hi> appointed a Meeting of all the Practitioners, who <hi>unanimouſly gave their Opinion againſt it till further Light,</hi> which was accordingly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Select-Men, and the Practice is forbidden; but by the Inſtigation of this Man and his Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they proceed in <hi>Contempt</hi> of the Magiſtrates, and in Contradiction to the Practitioners. Is this a regular Procedure?</p>
            <p>If a Dr. <hi>C. M.</hi> in any other Country ſhould meet with the <hi>Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. finding him in expreſs Words aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the <hi>uninterupted and remarkable Succeſs of this Method; — the conſtant Succeſs of this Experiment,</hi> &amp;c. he would directly publiſh, that <hi>not one ever dy'd of Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation theſe Forty One Years, always producing the most favourable Sort; — a Practice well vouched,</hi> &amp;c. what
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002331_0014_0FDBC9CAB6996AC0"/>
fatal Errors may not <hi>Impartiality</hi> lead a <hi>credulous</hi> Man into? Such an Account as this may do with ſome of their Correſpondents abroad, till contradicted by better Hands; but here it is ridiculous and ſilly, we all know that ſeveral have dy'd of the Practice, and that many have ſuffered much.</p>
            <p>How trifling is it for us, who have had the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Two or Three Hundred Inoculated, to appeal to a Man who only conjectures it may be of Uſe, and has not had the Opportunities of adducing more that <hi>Two Inſtances,</hi> and theſe of <hi>Children,</hi> whoſe Age might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their having them favourable either Way; I mean Dr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s Diſſertation on the Inoculation of the Small Pox; the Juſtneſs of the Abſtract from it, I paſs over, not having ſeen the Original. From it we learn no more concerning Inoculation, than, <hi>v. g.</hi> may be learnt from Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s (the more eminent Man) Account of <hi>Transfuſion,</hi> addreſſed to the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> publiſhed by the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and with more Earneſtneſs recommended, and conſequently equally or better vouched, after this Man's weak way of reaſoning. Notwithſtanding of this <hi>Diſſertation, Timonius, Pylari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and many more Accounts of the Affair that have not come to our Hands; we find them ſo <hi>cautious</hi> at home, that it was ſome Time thereafter before any <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> were made, and theſe by Permiſſion of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on the Bodies of Perſons <hi>dead in Law.</hi> He advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Exactneſs in <hi>Regimen,</hi> which is abſolutely requiſite, to know the Advantage of any new <hi>Experiment</hi>; we to our Shame boaſt and glory in our not uſing any. The Conſequences he does not ſo much as hint at, which are Difficulties to be diſcuſſed. However, Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> abſtracted has this good Effect, it proves a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Cordial</hi> to ſome of the Inoculated.</p>
            <p>Since my laſt to you, the <hi>Small Pox</hi> has made little or no progreſs in the Country; Our News Papers tell us, that in ſome Towns it is entirely ceaſed, in others much abated. Who then but Madmen, would have adviſed Inoculation in the ſevereſt Seaſon to thoſe who are like forever to eſcape the Small Pox? In this Town ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hundreds have eſcaped, and it is probable many
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002331_0015_0FDBC9B5C64A88E0"/>
more might have eſcaped (as was the Caſe Nineteen Years ago) if Inoculation had not rendred the Infection ſo univerſal and intenſe. Laſt Small Pox the Month of the greateſt Mortality (<hi>December,</hi> a ſevere Winter Month) did not exceed 80 Perſons; at this Time the Month of the greateſt Mortality (<hi>October,</hi> a favourable Autumn Month) exceeded Four Hundred burials, which is more than all that dyed of the Small Pox Nineteen Years ago. For the three Months of <hi>September, October,</hi> and <hi>November</hi> laſt, in which Inoculation prevailed, the Town was a meer Hoſpital, and we bury'd Seven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Sixty Perſons. The laſt Small Pox ſpread <hi>gradually</hi> in the extent of ten or a dozen Months, and vaſt Numbers eſcape; Inoculation of the Small Pox this Time ſet us all in a <hi>Flame,</hi> and in half the Time leaves few People exempt from its rage. With what Face can any Man call our Methods of Inoculation a regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure?</p>
            <p>I heartily wiſh Succeſs to this and all other <hi>Means</hi> deſign'd to alleviate the Epidemick Diſtempers incident to Mankind; whether caſually diſcovered, or ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contrived by the Sons of <hi>AEſculapius</hi>: But raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and headſtrong irregular procedure I ſhall for ever exclaim againſt, eſpecially that deteſtable Wickedneſs <hi>of ſpreading Infection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may not incur the Cenſure of <hi>Scribling,</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to neglect and deſpiſe, all that may come from the other Side by way of <hi>bare Affirmation, Bombaſt, Calumny, Doggrel Dialogues,</hi> &amp;c. but if <hi>Solid Reaſoning,</hi> well vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and ſuch like appear againſt any thing aſſerted, or conjectured by the <hi>Practitioners</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>raſh procedure of the Inoculators</hi>; I doubt not but they will take it Kindly and Friendly.</p>
