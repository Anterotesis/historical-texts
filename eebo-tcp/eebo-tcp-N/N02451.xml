            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>TO Spiritualize the common Actions of Life, and make a religious Improvement of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs, is an</hi> holy <hi>and</hi> happy Art: <hi>A</hi> Walk with God <hi>very much lies in</hi> this, <hi>and is greatly aſſiſted by it: This is a part of that</hi> Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs <hi>which is</hi> Life <hi>and</hi> Peace. <hi>Were Chriſtians better skill'd in this, their worldly Buſineſs might be a</hi> Help, <hi>rather than a Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to them in their way to Heaven. Now no worldly Calling is more capable of a ſpiritual Improvement than that of the</hi> Husbandman: <hi>And as it is a Calling which neceſſarily takes up ſo great a part of the Sons of Men, to teach them the</hi> ſpiritual Uſe <hi>of it muſt needs be a noble and bleſſed Deſign. This is the Deſign of the preſent</hi> Tract; <hi>wherein the main Intentions of</hi> PIETY <hi>are ſerv'd with an excellent Accommodation, in the Buſineſs and Language of</hi> Husbandry. <hi>So our Saviour fetch'd ſeveral of the</hi> Parables <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he inſtructed his Auditors, from the</hi> Calling of the Husbandman. <hi>And tis to be hop'd ſuch a Book as this, (which inſtructs the Husbandman how to</hi> dreſs his Soul, <hi>while he</hi> dreſſes his Ground, <hi>and to make ſure of his being receiv'd to a</hi> Crown <hi>in Heaven, when he is taken from the</hi> Plow <hi>on Earth) will meet with a</hi> general Acceptance <hi>in a Country the Buſineſs of which is moſtly</hi> Husbandry, <hi>and which has been famous for</hi> religious Husbandmen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:002905_0004_0FE6912CF2FDE0F8"/>
               <hi>Indeed this Deſign has been excellently ſerv'd in the Labours of thoſe Servants of GOD,</hi> Flavel <hi>and</hi> Steel: <hi>But their</hi> Treatiſes <hi>are not common among</hi> us: <hi>Neither is it to be ſuppos'd that they have gather'd in</hi> all the Sheaves <hi>of this plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Harveſt. Or if we are in this treated with the ſame things, 'tis in a</hi> different Method, <hi>and with that</hi> Fervour <hi>and</hi> Pungency <hi>which is ſo peculiar to the Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning the</hi> very Reverend Author, <hi>we heartily pray that GOD would ſtill continue him long to Labour in his</hi> Harveſt, <hi>and crown all his</hi> laborious <hi>and</hi> excellent Eſſays <hi>to ſerve the Kingdom of GOD, with the deſired Succeſs.

            <p>A Call from <hi>Heaven,</hi> which every Man upon <hi>Earth</hi> is deeply concerned in.

When the Illuſtrious and Immortal Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> paſſed by One at the <hi>Plow,</hi> for whom GOD intended uncommon Favours, the Prophet put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the <hi>Melota,</hi> which he wore upon his <hi>Head;</hi> and Lo, the <hi>Influences of Heaven</hi> accompanied it, ſo that he left the <hi>Plow,</hi> and he could let nothing hinder his becoming a <hi>Man of GOD,</hi> and a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the beſt Man in the world.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, to be at the <hi>Plow,</hi> is to be where the <hi>Influences of Heaven</hi> may find us. Oh! That what paſſes from the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Speaker</hi> may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Influences of Heaven</hi> on the <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>Hearer.</hi> But what? <hi>Leave the Plow,</hi> upon it! GOD forbid. The Sermon, may find us at the <hi>Plow;</hi> But whether ſo or no, the deſign of the Sermon will be, to bring us all to the <hi>Plow,</hi> yea, to keep us at it all our Days.</p>
            <p>The Glorious GOD calls a ſinful People to REPENTANCE: REPENTANCE, without which 'tis impoſſible a Sinner ſhould be prepared for the <hi>Bleſſings of Goodneſs.</hi> Of this <hi>Repentance,</hi> we have a notable Deſcription, in that very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive and Inſtructive Metaphor; <hi>Break up your fallow Ground.</hi> Now, certainly tis the <hi>Plow</hi> in its <hi>Work,</hi> that is thus to <hi>Break up the fallow Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Plow,</hi> that grand Inſtrument of <hi>Husbandry;</hi> which we may celebrate, as, <hi>The Ancient,</hi> and, <hi>The Honourable! The ſtaff of Bread</hi> muſt ſail us, and we muſt ſoon fall down into the <hi>Earth,</hi> if the <hi>Plow</hi> wherewith we ſollicit the <hi>Earth</hi> for our <hi>Bread,</hi> were <hi>taken away.</hi> Doubeleſs, its Antiquity is higher than the Days of <hi>Tubal-Cain.</hi> And how much it Rivals the very <hi>Seeptre</hi> may be pondered, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; <hi>The profit of the Earth is for all; the King himſelf is alſo ſerved by the Field.</hi>

The <hi>Plow</hi> which is now called for, is, That which brings a <hi>Repenting Sinner,</hi> to what we muſt all come to, that we may find mercy with GOD. The <hi>Breaking up of the fallow Ground,</hi> with the <hi>Plow, is,</hi> The bringing of the Sinner to that <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is neceſſary for him.</p>
            <p>And the DOCTRINE of GOD our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, the <hi>entrance</hi> of which now to <hi>give light unto</hi> us is This.</p>

            <p>In the Proſecution of this Intention, let us En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, firſt; What is the <hi>fallow Ground,</hi> which in the work of <hi>Repentance</hi> requires the <hi>Plow</hi> to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd upon it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002905_0009_0FE691A2AF169C78"/>
Verily, 'Tis the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man. O Man, 'tis thy <hi>Heart,</hi> and my <hi>Heart,</hi> that is the <hi>fallow Ground.</hi> Whenever thou ſeeſt any <hi>Ground</hi> lying <hi>fallow,</hi> thou mayſt ſay. <hi>I now ſee a Soyl which my ſinful Heart may be ſadly compar'd unto.</hi> And, Oh! what will become of us, if the <hi>Plow-ſhare</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> do not go deep into it!</p>
            <p>REPENTANCE will bring us to make theſe Acknowledgments; and we ſhall make them with the bitterneſs of <hi>Wormwood</hi> and of <hi>Gall,</hi> and with a <hi>Soul humbled in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt; A <hi>Repenting</hi> Sinner will acknowledge This; <hi>My Heart is a very barren Soyl. Fallow Ground</hi> has growing upon it, none of thoſe <hi>good things</hi> which we ſet a value on. It has enough of thoſe things which are <hi>good for nothing,</hi> or, perhaps worſe than ſo. Our <hi>Heart</hi> is this <hi>fallow Ground.</hi> It is an <hi>Heart</hi> that is deſtitute of good Principles; and good <hi>Ends,</hi> and good <hi>Frames,</hi> and good <hi>Thoughts,</hi> are not now the <hi>natural Growth</hi> of the Soyl. Our Nature being wofully corrupted by our fall from GOD, our complaint muſt be That; Rom. VII. 18. <hi>I know, that in me, (that is, in my Fleſh,) there dwelleth no good thing. O Wretched Heart that thou art;</hi> How empty of all that is <hi>Good!</hi> It muſt come from an Hand which takes <hi>pains</hi> for thy <hi>good,</hi> if any <hi>good</hi> be found in thee. But for the Reverſe thereof, enough of <hi>that!</hi> The <hi>Thorns</hi> &amp; the <hi>Thiſtles</hi> of the <hi>curſed Ground</hi> are not ſuch unhappy things as what our <hi>Heart</hi> is over grown withal. What <hi>natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grows</hi> in our <hi>Heart,</hi> &amp; appears without our taking any <hi>pains</hi> to bring it forward, is, what will be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by an <hi>Heart fully ſet in us to do evil.</hi> What can be imagined, but what is <hi>Evil</hi> enough in an <hi>Heart,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002905_0010_0FE691A9A2E97C18"/>whereof every Imagination is <hi>Evil continually?</hi> What will be the <hi>growth</hi> of a <hi>carnal Mind</hi> that is full of <hi>Enmity againſt GOD;</hi> and of an <hi>Heart,</hi> that is <hi>deſperately wicked?</hi> The <hi>growth</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Soyl</hi> has been told us, by Him who <hi>ſearches the Heart;</hi> Mat.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly; A Repenting Sinner will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge This; <hi>My Heart is a very harden'd Soyl. Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ground</hi> is become <hi>hard;</hi> by lying long undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, its parts come to ſtick very cloſe to one another. Perhaps, 'tis the more <hi>hard</hi> for being often trod upon. Our <hi>Heart</hi> is this <hi>fallow Ground.</hi> The <hi>Truths</hi> of GOD which are the <hi>Seeds of Life,</hi> the <hi>Rays</hi> that are ſhot from the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which <hi>drops as the Rain,</hi> will not enter into ſo tough a Soyl. Our <hi>Heart</hi> will reſiſt all good Admonitions; and <hi>Eſſays to do good,</hi> ſignify nothing, becauſe of what we read of; Rom. II. 5. <hi>Thy hardneſs and impenitent Heart.</hi> Our <hi>Heart</hi> will remain as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An hard Heart! An Heart which there is no moving of!</hi> That moan is heard; Iſa LXIII. 17. <hi>Our Heart hardened from thy Fear.</hi> Oh!

Let us Enquire, Secondly; What are thoſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Repentance,</hi> in which the <hi>Plow</hi> is to <hi>break up</hi> this <hi>fallow Ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You take it for granted, The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, accompanied with the Influences of the Holy SPIRIT, is the <hi>Plow</hi> with which this work of GOD is carried on. And now,</p>
            <p>Firſt; In a true <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> is <hi>broken,</hi> with a <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> of the <hi>Sins,</hi> which the great GOD has been offended at. There is a <hi>compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and a <hi>contrition</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> in that <hi>Repentance,</hi> which therefore, O Tranſgreſſor, thou art ſo lothe to come unto, Of <hi>Penitents</hi> we read, Act. II. 37. <hi>They are pierced in their Heart.</hi> And of <hi>Penitents</hi> we read, Pſal. XXXIV. 18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken Heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite Spirit.</hi> We are adviſed; <hi>By ſorrow of Heart, the Spirit is broken.</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> is not more <hi>broken</hi> by the <hi>Plow</hi> tearing of it, than the <hi>Heart</hi> of a <hi>Repenting</hi> one, is <hi>broken</hi> with the <hi>ſorrow</hi> of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> There is a <hi>godly ſorrow working of</hi> and in <hi>Repentance.</hi> The <hi>Repenting</hi> one makes a <hi>ſorrowful Reflection,</hi> on what he has done in ſinning againſt the glorious GOD. With an <hi>Heart-breaking</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and Remorſe, and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> he thinks;
<q>
                  <hi>I have ſinned, and I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> But, Oh! What have I done, when I have ſinned! I have <hi>deny'd the GOD that is above,</hi> and ſet my ſelf and my <hi>Idols above</hi> him. I have trampled on the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of my <hi>Maker;</hi> defied his <hi>Power,</hi> derided his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> deſpiſed his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> diſputed his <hi>Faithfulneſs;</hi> and oppoſed his <hi>Holineſs.</hi> I have ſlighted the SON of GOD, and ſcorned all his gracious <hi>Tenders.</hi> I have vexed the SPIRIT of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002905_0012_0FE691AB465F2A20"/>GOD, and ſtifled all his gracious <hi>Motions.</hi> I have diſobliged the <hi>Angels,</hi> and gratified the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> I have <hi>wronged</hi> my own Soul, and <hi>ruin'd</hi> all my Intereſts. I have refuſed <hi>eternal Pleaſures,</hi> and incurr'd <hi>eternal Torments;</hi> all for a meer <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> of a <hi>delight,</hi> which is but for a Moment. Oh! What <hi>madneſs</hi> has poſſeſſed me!</q> Such ſentiments as theſe enter with the wounding force of a <hi>Plow-ſhare</hi> into the <hi>Heart</hi> of a <hi>Repenting</hi> one. He feels that anguiſh from them, that makes him cry out, <hi>My Heart is broken, O GOD, my Heart is broken. My wounded Spirit; Oh! I cannot bear it!</hi> This, O thou that haſt <hi>gone on in thy Treſpaſſes,</hi> This is what the <hi>Plow</hi> muſt bring thee to; Pſal LI. 17. <hi>The Sacrifices of GOD, a broken Spirit; a broken and a contrite Heart.</hi> And let not this be forgotten; One conſpicuous and perpetual <hi>mark</hi> of the <hi>broken Heart,</hi> will be This; The <hi>Heart</hi> is, like the <hi>Earth</hi> yielding to the <hi>Plow</hi> and what follows upon it, made willing to comply with the <hi>whole Will</hi> of GOD: Willing to come into whatever <hi>ſhape</hi> GOD would have it brought into; willing to be any thing, do any thing, take any thing, that GOD ſhall order for it. The <hi>Repenting</hi> one, lyes at the Foot of the glorious GOD, and ſays, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. In a true <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> is left no longer under the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Luſts,</hi> that were the <hi>Weeds</hi> of the Soul. There is the <hi>Luſt</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Luſt</hi> of the <hi>Eye,</hi> and the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> which engroſs the Soul, and bind the powers of it faſt, in oppoſition unto GOD. Theſe <hi>Weeds</hi> which cover the face of the Earth, in our <hi>Heart,</hi> and hinder our being filled with the <hi>Fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002905_0013_0FE691AB64294748"/>are extirpated in that <hi>Repentance</hi> which brings us unto GOD. What the <hi>Penitent</hi> comes to is that; Rom. VI. 16. <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you. Penitents</hi> have the experience of ſuch a Deliverance, as that; Pſal. CXVI. 16. <hi>Truly, O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant; Thou haſt looſed my Bonds.</hi> The <hi>deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind,</hi> and the <hi>diverſe Luſts,</hi> which are the <hi>Root of bitterneſs</hi> in the Soul, the intention of <hi>Repentance</hi> is to diſturb them; and anon the <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> one becomes diſpoſſeſſed of them. Theſe poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous <hi>Weeds of Death</hi> are diſturbed, yea, they are deſtroyed by the <hi>Plow,</hi> in the <hi>Heart</hi> of ſuch as are by <hi>Repentance</hi> brought home unto GOD. No <hi>Luſt</hi> can live quietly in a <hi>Repenting</hi> Soul. Every <hi>Luſt</hi> comes under a <hi>Mortification</hi> in the <hi>Heart</hi> of ſuch an one. The <hi>Plow ſhare</hi> does a notable Execution upon the <hi>Weods;</hi> and the Voice of the <hi>Repenting</hi> one is that; Hoſ. XIV. 8. <hi>What have I any more to do with Idols?</hi> The <hi>Repenting</hi> one comes to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I will never do what I judge to be a Sin, that my Fleſh may have its pleaſures.</hi> He comes to Renounce the <hi>World,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I will never do what I judge to be a Sin, that. I may gain the Riches of the World.</hi> He Renounces the <hi>Devil;</hi> and rejects and repels the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> one. The Language of <hi>Repentance</hi> is, <hi>O take away all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Whatever diſpoſitions to Sin, a <hi>Repenting</hi> one finds in his Heart, tho' they have never ſuch a deep <hi>rooting</hi> there, yet the <hi>Heart</hi> under the <hi>Plow,</hi> is become deſirous to be delivered from them all: It ſays, <hi>Lord, let my Heart be cleared of all thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable weeds, which cleave to an evil Heart of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, departing from the living GOD. Oh! do thou tear
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002905_0014_0FE691B2CF8B10A0"/>them to pieces, and let there be none to deliver them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ You have ſeen how the <hi>Plow breaks up the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ground,</hi> in the work of <hi>Repentance;</hi> But it muſt now be demanded, that you immediately feel the <hi>Plow</hi> operating on you.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>GOD ſpeed the Plow,</hi> when the <hi>good work of his Grace,</hi> is making its way into your <hi>Hearts,</hi> in thoſe Admonitions of PIETY, which are now brought unto you from him.</p>
            <p>We read, Prov. XXI. 4. <hi>The plowing of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is Sin.</hi> All his employment is nothing but <hi>Sin.</hi> Even what he does in his <hi>lawful Calling</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only for <hi>himſelf,</hi> 'tis no better than <hi>Sin.</hi> He looks no higher than <hi>Earth,</hi> in what he does, and ſo he does nothing but <hi>Sin;</hi> Yea, Even <hi>wearies himſelf to commit Iniquity.</hi> But now, Another ſort of <hi>plowing</hi> is exhorted to; The <hi>plowing</hi> which is to be uſed, in the <hi>confeſſing</hi> and <hi>forſaking</hi> of all <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,</hi> and in <hi>Repenting of Sin.</hi> In order to this;</p>
            <p n="1">I. You muſt apprehend well, the mighty and awful <hi>Importance</hi> of that REPENTANCE, which muſt be found in all the ſinful Children of Men, that would not <hi>periſh in their Sins. Lo, GOD hath ſent forth his Voice, and that a mighty Voice,</hi> unto all that ſin againſt him; And, <hi>There is no Man that ſinneth not.</hi> Yea, he has uttered it more than once; Luk. XIII. 3, 5. <hi>Except ye Repent, ye ſhall periſh:</hi> And again, <hi>Except ye Repent, ye ſhall periſh.</hi> 'Tis indeed, what the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of every Man does preach unto him. <hi>Conſcience,</hi> Do thou now lend thy Hand unto the <hi>Plow.</hi> And, Oh! let the <hi>Heart</hi> now under the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, feel theſe <hi>Queſtions,</hi> paſs like ſo many <hi>Plow-ſhares</hi> into it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002905_0015_0FE691B2EB003978"/>
Queſtion. I. Don't you really think, that you have been guilty of enough to be <hi>Repented</hi> of? A <hi>Mind</hi> ſo diſaffected unto the glorious GOD! A <hi>Life</hi> ſo full of Rebellion againſt him! And not enough to be <hi>Repented</hi> of! Surely, The beſt of us all have cauſe enough to come unto That; Job. XLII. 6. <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and I repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſtion. II. If you now come unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> can you doubt whether a merciful GOD will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you; or whether you ſhall not be the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> ones, whoſe <hi>Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and Sin covered?</hi> What? When you have that Aſſurance from the Mouth of the glorious One; Iſa. LV. 7. <hi>Return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy; and unto our GOD, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi>

            <p>Queſtion. IV. If you <hi>dy</hi> before you come unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> will it not be forever <hi>too late</hi> for you; or can you ſuppoſe, that your cry, <hi>Lord, have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me;</hi> will avail any thing, or be any other than all <hi>too late,</hi> when the Pit hath ſhut its mouth upon you, and you are lodged among <hi>Devils</hi> in the <hi>place of Torment?</hi> What? When you are ſo taught; Iſa. XXXVIII. 18. <hi>They that go down to the Pit, cannot hope for thy Truth.</hi>

Queſtion. V.

That GOD is not worthy of your <hi>Love;</hi> and his <hi>Threatnings</hi> are nothing to be regarded? That His CHRIST has nothing that is <hi>precious</hi> to beſtow upon you; and you can do well enough without him? And, <hi>What ſhall be given to thee, what ſhall be done to thee, O Tongue</hi> that can ſpeak ſuch things as theſe?

            <p n="2">II. 'Tis to be vehemently inſiſted on; It can by no means be diſpenſed with: You muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently endeavour to go thro' ſuch a PROCESS OF REPENTANCE, as <hi>lays hold on Eternal Life</hi> You have it <hi>Reveled from Heaven</hi> unto you, Act.

A <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting</hi> Soul muſt ſay, as in Pſal. LI. 3. <hi>I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my Tranſgreſſions, and my Sins is ever before me.</hi> The Aims of <hi>Repentance</hi> are to be <hi>ever</hi> within us; and the Exerciſe thereof is <hi>never</hi> to be laid aſide. There will be no Method ſo ſure as this, to aſſure us, That <hi>we have the Repentance never to be repented of.</hi> Let us <hi>Repent</hi> over and over again. The <hi>proceſs of Repentance</hi> muſt be tranſacted over and over again. More eſpecially, When any <hi>Calamitous thing</hi> befalls us, now let us, <hi>in the day of Adverſity conſider, To what ſpecial Expreſſions of Repentance am I now to be Awakened?</hi> And how often do we hear things preſſed in <hi>Sermons,</hi> whereof we ſhould make this <hi>Uſe;</hi> To <hi>Repent</hi> more particularly of <hi>miſcarriages,</hi> which we are minded of? Yea, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> is to be with us, a <hi>Daily Exerciſe of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> In our <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> Sacrifices, every Day, there is to be a <hi>Repentance</hi> exerciſed; and this with ſome <hi>Recollection</hi> of what we can find amiſs in our <hi>paſt Behaviour.</hi> And as often in the Day, as we are convinced of any <hi>Misbehaviour,</hi> we ſhould with a freſh act of <hi>Repentance look unto Him whom we have pierced,</hi> and <hi>mourn</hi> for what has been <hi>Amiſs.</hi> 'Tis with the <hi>ſpirit of Repentance,</hi> that we are to carry on the whole courſe of our <hi>Walk with GOD.</hi> The proud <hi>ſpirit of Quakeriſm</hi> which has done with <hi>Repentance,</hi> and in its <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> is never heard with <hi>Repentance</hi> praying for, <hi>The Pardon of Sin;</hi> It cannot but be deteſtable to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002905_0019_0FE6912E17D662F0"/>the Children of GOD. There needs no more to make every ſober Chriſtian ſay, <hi>To ſuch Aſſemblies, O my Soul, be not thou United.</hi> REPENTANCE TO THE LAST, is a Motto for one who <hi>walks</hi> with GOD. The Curtains of our <hi>Death bed</hi> muſt be hung with <hi>Penitentials.</hi> Our Eyes muſt be filled with the <hi>Tears of Repentance,</hi> when the cold Hand of Death, is cloſing of them. Syrs, Here is a <hi>Plow,</hi> that is never to ſtand ſtill. 'Tis to be going in <hi>all ſeaſons</hi> of the Year; Yea, And <hi>even in the Winter it ſhall be ſo!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. You muſt not think much of it, if you find <hi>Repentance</hi> to be a <hi>Laborious</hi> thing. If you will do any thing at <hi>plowing,</hi> you muſt not be they whoſe <hi>Hands refuſe to labour.</hi> The <hi>Sluggard</hi> will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Repentance,</hi> that will avail any thing. What a miſerable Soul, will be the <hi>Field of the Slothful?</hi> O Soul <hi>void</hi> of <hi>underſtanding! Lo, 'Tis all grown over with Thorns; Nettles cover the Face thereof; and the Stone wall thereof is broken down.</hi> We read, 2. Tim. II. 6. <hi>The Husbandman laboureth.</hi> If the Life of <hi>Husbandry</hi> be <hi>Laborious,</hi> a Life of <hi>Repentance</hi> is no leſs <hi>Laborious.</hi> GOD will be a <hi>Rewarder</hi> to none but thoſe who <hi>diligently ſeek Him.</hi> The Buſineſs of <hi>Repentance</hi> is to <hi>ſeek Him.</hi> A <hi>Diligence</hi> muſt be found in the performances with which we manage it. It is with <hi>all our Might</hi> that we are to do <hi>what our Hand finds to do.</hi> We are to <hi>Toyl</hi> at it, yea, to <hi>Sweat</hi> at it. It is to the <hi>Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beleever,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Laborious Husbandman,</hi> that it has been ſaid, <hi>In the ſweat of thy Face thou ſhalt carry on, what thou haſt to do.</hi> Things very tedious, very tireſome, to Fleſh and Blood, are to be encountred in a life of <hi>Repentance. O Repenting</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002905_0020_0FE6912E34B4D410"/>Soul, Thou ſhalt often be <hi>weary in well doing;</hi> I truſt; Never <hi>weary of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. But won't you look for <hi>weeping,</hi> as well as <hi>working?</hi> Yes; look for This; That the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous GOD will make many <hi>ſad Things</hi> to be found among the <hi>Things appointed for you.</hi> This will be, that ſo the work of <hi>Repentance</hi> may be the more powerfully and effectually carryed on. There will be <hi>Need</hi> that you ſhould be ever now and then in <hi>Heavineſs;</hi> without it, the work of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> cannot well be carried on. Of the <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> we read; Pſal. CXXVI. 6. <hi>Each one of thoſe in going forth, does moſtly weeping go; He carries forth the precious ſeed, a little to be ſown.</hi> He meets with many things, which makes him follow the <hi>Plow</hi> with an <hi>heavy Heart.</hi> You muſt not think always to do nothing <hi>Sing</hi> at the <hi>Plow. O Repenting</hi> ones, Never <hi>Dream,</hi> That you ſhall <hi>paſs the time of your ſojourning</hi> here without <hi>Affliction;</hi> Or, That your <hi>few Days</hi> here, will not be <hi>full of Troubles!</hi> A <hi>Dream</hi> in which there would be <hi>diverſe vanities.</hi> What? When your Heavenly Father has told you. <hi>If ye be without Chaſtiſement, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons!</hi> This world, what is it but a <hi>Valley of Bacah?</hi> That is to ſay, of <hi>weeping.</hi> Truly, All your <hi>plowing</hi> will be in the <hi>Valley of Bacah.</hi> Has not your <hi>Faithful</hi> Redeemer <hi>forewarned</hi> you of it? And becauſe of his <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> he willfulfil it. O Diſciples of a <hi>Crucified</hi> Lord; look for the <hi>Creſs.</hi> The <hi>Plow</hi> and the <hi>Croſs</hi> will go together. The things that will call for your <hi>Tears, Lord, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are they? How are the things multiplied, which will trouble you!</hi> Tho' the <hi>ways of Repentance</hi> are on many accounts <hi>ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi> yet there will
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002905_0021_0FE691BC3039F668"/>be ſome <hi>Troubleſome things</hi> in the ways. Tho' you will <hi>ſing in the ways of the Lord;</hi> and the worſt of them are ſweeter than the <hi>Hard ways of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor;</hi> Yet you muſt alſo <hi>weep in the ways.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect many <hi>Troubleſome things,</hi> and when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, be able to ſay, <hi>That which I was afraid of, is come unto me.</hi> And yet, be not <hi>afraid with any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazment!</hi> After the Ground is <hi>plowed,</hi> the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> is drawn over it, that ſo the <hi>work</hi> may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the Face of the Soyl ſo Levelled, as to be fit for what is to be caſt upon it. When we have <hi>Repented</hi> of our <hi>Errors,</hi> there will be the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> of <hi>Affliction</hi> of drawn over us. Yea, our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi> muſt come after another upon us. Tis all, that ſo <hi>Repentance</hi> may hvve have its <hi>perfect work.</hi> It muſt be expected, and it ſhould not be <hi>unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> to us; That our Faithful Redeemer do by much <hi>Affliction</hi> carry on the <hi>good work</hi> of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> after he has <hi>began</hi> it upon us. <hi>Harrowed</hi> with much <hi>Affliction,</hi> O penitent Beleever ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be my Redeemer who will this way bring me to be what I ſhould be!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. Nevertheleſs, hold on, hold out, O RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENTANCE; The <hi>Harveſt</hi> will richly repay thee; <hi>Heaven will make amends for all. Repentance</hi> is nothing, if <hi>Perſeverance</hi> do not <hi>Crown</hi> it. There is a dreadful Denunciation; Luk. IX. 62. <hi>No Man having put his hand to the Plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of GOD.</hi> Oh! Take heed of all <hi>Backſlidings</hi> from good <hi>Beginnings</hi> in <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> And therefore take a due Notice of the leaſt <hi>Beginnings,</hi> that may lead on to ſuch <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings.</hi> Let the <hi>Apoſtates Doon,</hi> cauſe you to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at all Degrees or Symptoms of <hi>Apoſtaſy;</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002905_0022_0FE691BD96AD5BE0"/>Tremble at <hi>ending in the Fleſh,</hi> after you have <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the Spirit.</hi> Hear the tremendous Doom; <hi>If any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Now, that you may <hi>not be wearied nor faint in your Minds,</hi> and that no Temptation to deſert the <hi>Plow</hi> may move you; O commit your ſelves into the hands of a SAVIOUR, who is <hi>able to keep you from falling;</hi> and rely upon Him, to be <hi>kept by His almighty Power, thro' Faith unto Salvation.</hi> But then, Think on the <hi>Harveſt</hi> that is a coming; An <hi>Harveſt,</hi> wherein <hi>every good thing that a Man has done, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord.</hi> Indeed unto them to whom it may be ſaid, <hi>Ye have plowed Wickedneſs,</hi> there will be a proportionable <hi>Reaping</hi> Time; They ſhall <hi>Reap</hi> what their <hi>Iniquity</hi> will bring them to; <hi>Wo to the wicked; for the Reward of his Hands will be given him.</hi> On the other ſide; <hi>Plow</hi> in and by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and look for what will be <hi>Reaped</hi> from it. We read; <hi>He that ploweth ſhould plow in hope.</hi> Go on <hi>Repenting,</hi> and keep the <hi>Plow</hi> always going: But ſtill do it, in <hi>hope</hi> of a Time coming, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Thy Work ſhall be rewarded, ſaith the Lord. Hope</hi> for ſomething infinitely better than what has been in any Country called, <hi>Plow-Money;</hi> Yea, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better than <hi>our Land yielding its Increaſe</hi> unto us.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Finally; The Work of the <hi>Plow</hi> is in the <hi>Earth;</hi> In the Motions of it, he who drives the <hi>Plow,</hi> muſt often look down upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> into the <hi>Earth.</hi> And that the Work of <hi>Repentance</hi> may be carried on, it will be of great Advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, to look down unto the <hi>Earth,</hi> whither, O Man, <hi>Thou art going! Thou art art going!</hi> Look
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002905_0023_0FE691BDB60CAF68"/>unto the <hi>Earth,</hi> O ye <hi>Sons of Earthly Man,</hi> and you will ſee, what will have loud Exciters, and ſtrong Incentives, to <hi>Repentance</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Beholding of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which the <hi>Plow</hi> digs into, Think; <hi>I was fetch'd out of the Earth by the Great GOD, who formed all things.</hi> How much may this Meditation do, To <hi>Humble</hi> you, and <hi>Abaſe</hi> you, and lay you in the <hi>Duſt</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and cauſe you to count your ſelves no better than a poor Clod of animated <hi>Earth,</hi> before the GOD of Heaven, who is the <hi>Lord GOD Omnipotent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; Beholding of the <hi>Earth</hi> which the <hi>Plow</hi> goes into, Think; <hi>In the Earth I have my Grave waiting for me, where I know not how ſoon I may be lodged.</hi> How much may this Meditation Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you, to <hi>Make haſte</hi> in that <hi>Repentance,</hi> which muſt be diſpatch'd before you <hi>ſleep in the Duſt,</hi> or elſe nothing on <hi>Earth</hi> can keep you from an <hi>Hell</hi> for ever to be trembled at.</p>
            <p>My Friend, Smell to the <hi>Earth.</hi> 'Tis a very <hi>wholeſome Scent.</hi> It will contribute to the Work of <hi>Repentance</hi> wonderfully.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>Plow</hi> in it Opetations. And upon the whole, what ſhall I ſay unto you?</p>
            <p>A King of <hi>England,</hi> was doubtleſs well pleaſed with the Town, where the People preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſome hundreds of <hi>Plows</hi> before him. Among all thoſe <hi>Plows,</hi> there was none compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto <hi>This;</hi> nor can there be a more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Preſent unto the Glorious One, who is <hi>King over all the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been counted a memorable Thing; That among the old <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mans,</hi> they ſometimes fetch'd a Man from the <hi>Plow,</hi> and one that was owner
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002905_0024_0FE691C2D7B41D80"/>of no more than <hi>Four Acres</hi> neither, and ſet him at the head of the Commonwealth. Chriſtian, Keep at this <hi>Plow,</hi> and GOD will one Day <hi>Raiſe thee out of the Duſt, and fetch thee out if the Dunghil, and ſet thee with Princes, even with the Princes of His People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done. The <hi>Plow</hi> has done its Work, and the <hi>Fallow-Ground</hi> is well <hi>broken</hi> up, if the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD finds now a <hi>free paſſage</hi> into your Hearts. And, Oh! May your Hearts be now ſo <hi>opened,</hi> by the Lord, that in whatever <hi>Word</hi> He comes unto you, your <hi>conſenting Hearts</hi> may ſay, <hi>Welcome art thou, O Lord, and welcome is every Word of thine, unto me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of it, as a very Improper Thing; Amos V. 12. <hi>Will one plow upon a Rock?</hi> Sinful Soul, Tho' thy <hi>Heart</hi> be like a <hi>Rock,</hi> Yet, Oh! Let not the <hi>Obduration</hi> continue, and let not all the Exhortations to <hi>Repentance,</hi> be but a <hi>plowing upon a Rock.</hi> But let thy <hi>Relenting Heart,</hi> at leaſt come ſo far, as to beg it of thy Exalted SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, whoſe Office it is; Do thou give me both Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did indeed ſay, <hi>I have done.</hi> But I know not how to part with my <hi>Plow-man,</hi> until I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a little Notice of ſomething in his Hand, by which the Creatures which draw his <hi>Plow</hi> for him, are Exagitated. He carries a GOAD in his Hand.</p>
            <p>We read of a Champion, Judg. III. 31. <hi>He ſlew ſix hundred Men with an Ox-Goad.</hi> We may gueſs a little at the ſhape of that <hi>Ox-Goad,</hi> and how fit a Tool it was for ſuch an Execution, from what is related by Modern Travellers concerning the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002905_0025_0FE69133DC6472A8"/>in thoſe parts of the World. They tell us, That in <hi>plowing</hi> the <hi>Husbandmen</hi> uſe <hi>Goads</hi> of an extraordinary ſize. They are <hi>eight Foot</hi> long, and at the upper end, <hi>ſix Inches</hi> in Circumference. They are armed at the leſſer end, with a ſharp Nail, for the driving of the <hi>Oxen;</hi> and at the other end, with a ſmall Spade, or Paddle of <hi>Iron,</hi> ſtrong and maſſy for cleanſing of the <hi>Plow,</hi> from the clay that encumbers it in working. In ſuch a <hi>Goad,</hi> behold, a better Weapon than a <hi>Sword,</hi> for a <hi>Shamgar</hi> to employ upon his <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I ſhall obſerve upon it is; There are ſo many <hi>Goads,</hi> in the <hi>lively Oracles</hi> of GOD, for our <hi>Excitation</hi> and <hi>Inſtigation</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and a life of PIETY. We read, Eccl. XII. 11. <hi>The words of the Wiſe are as Goads.</hi> And ſuch are the <hi>Words</hi> of our GOD by which we are to be <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</hi> Alas, why do we no more find them ſo! How ſtupid a thing art thou, O Man, if thou doſt not feel ſuch <hi>pungencies?</hi> But then, the dealings of GOD with thee in his <hi>Providence,</hi> what are theſe alſo, but ſo many <hi>ſtimulations</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and a Life of PIETY? If they move thee not, O dull Soul, and if thou do not conform unto them, there is that Voice from Heaven, unto thee on them, Act. IX. 5. <hi>It is hard for thee, to kick againſt the Goads.</hi> Oh! do not by thy Dilatory proceedings in the <hi>Life of GOD,</hi> provoke him to multiply the <hi>uneaſy ſtrokes</hi> of his <hi>Goads</hi> upon thee.</p>

            <p>The WORD of GOD, in the Promulgation of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is a <hi>Seed</hi> which finds in the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man a very <hi>different Soyl</hi> when it is caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; A <hi>Soyl</hi> which the <hi>Word</hi> has very <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Bad and Good Effects upon.</p>
            <p>We are enriched with a GOSPEL, which is by our SAVIOUR in his explaining of his own <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> called, <hi>The Word of the Kingdom.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Word</hi> which Proclaimes a Glorious CHRIST, as the <hi>King upon the Holy Hill of Zion,</hi> who is <hi>Lord of All,</hi> and <hi>has all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Word</hi> which brings the <hi>Law</hi> of this great <hi>King</hi> unto us, and promiſes unto them that Follow and Obey him, the Glories of an Heavenly <hi>Kingdom,</hi> at his <hi>Appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Word,</hi> whereof, O <hi>Bleſſed People</hi> that we are, we hear the <hi>Joyful Sound,</hi> ſome conſiderable things are to be now declared unto us.</p>

I. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD falling on the Heart of Man, is like a <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Corn,</hi> which the Earth has from the Husbandman <hi>caſt</hi> and <hi>ſown</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>You need not be told, That the Man who hears the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, and indeed every Man on the Face of the <hi>Darth,</hi> may be compared unto the <hi>Earth.</hi> You are ſufficiently appriſed of it, That the <hi>Body</hi> of Man, came out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and again goes into it. The devout <hi>Job,</hi> ſitting on the <hi>Earth,</hi> call'd it, His <hi>Mother;</hi> And ſitting in his <hi>Mothers</hi> Lap, he confeſſed; Job I. 21. <hi>Naked came I out of my Moehers Womb, and naked ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither.</hi> This <hi>Mother</hi> of Man, may well be allow'd a <hi>Figure</hi> of Man. Let it not offend thee, <hi>O proud Man,</hi> if the Term of, <hi>A Clod of Earth,</hi> be put upon thee.</p>
            <p>But what I am to tell you, is, On what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Corn</hi> (or of any <hi>Plant</hi>) reſembles the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> that is preached unto them, who <hi>dwell on the Earth.</hi> The Accounts are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>Is there a ſort of <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Seed</hi> of a <hi>Plant?</hi> Our SAVIOUR, the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> has told ns; Joh. VI. 63. <hi>The Words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit and they are Life.</hi> O the fair and ſweet Things, which pullulate from theſe <hi>Lively Oracles!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Seed</hi> muſt be <hi>ſown,</hi> or the <hi>Fruit</hi> will be none: If it be kept in the <hi>Granary,</hi> it will never <hi>Fructify.</hi> It is the <hi>ſpeaking</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> that is the caſting of the <hi>Seed.</hi> We read, 1 Theſſ. II. 16. It muſt be <hi>ſpoken</hi> to Men, that they may be <hi>ſaved.</hi> There is ordinarily no <hi>ſaving</hi> the Souls of Men, but in the way of the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> the <hi>ſpeaking</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002905_0030_0FE6913407AC8DC8"/>
               <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> unto them. They that are not in the way of it, are not in the ordinary way to be <hi>ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Seed</hi> brings forth a <hi>Grain</hi> like it ſelf; The <hi>Fruit</hi> is <hi>after its kind.</hi> What the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD produces, is what is <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Word.</hi> It is a <hi>Good Word;</hi> and it will <hi>do</hi> us this <hi>Good,</hi> it will make us <hi>Good;</hi> and make us love to <hi>do Good.</hi> It is a <hi>clean Word,</hi> and it will make us to <hi>cleanſe our Way.</hi> It is a <hi>Word of Wiſdom,</hi> and it will make us <hi>wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> Yea, 2 Cor. III. 18. We are <hi>changed</hi> by it, <hi>into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little <hi>Seed</hi> will go a great way: A few <hi>Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> may ſoon cover an huge Tract of Land. Who can ſay, how much a few Hands may do in ſpreading the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD? A <hi>Paul</hi> did it for Thouſands of Miles: From <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> was near Three Thouſand Miles. What a few Men did, as we find in Col. I. 6. <hi>It brought forth Fruit in all the World.</hi> Yea, One Sermon has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Thouſands. And Hundreds of Thouſands have been brought into the Life of GOD, by one little Book; ſuch as <hi>Arndts,</hi> of <hi>True Chriſtianity.</hi> What a <hi>Diſperſion</hi> of Truth, has been made by Two ſuch ſmall <hi>Catechiſms;</hi> as that of <hi>Heidelbergh,</hi> and that of our <hi>Aſſembly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Labour</hi> of the <hi>Sower</hi> will have no <hi>Succeſs,</hi> without the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of the Lord, upon the <hi>Seed.</hi> It is <hi>Thou, O Lord, that prepareſt the Corn.</hi> The <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman</hi> is an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> if he do not Think ſo, and own it. The Miniſtry of the <hi>Word,</hi> will be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, except it <hi>receive a Bleſſing from GOD.</hi> We are informed; 1 Cor. III. 7. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but GOD
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002905_0031_0FE691CAD63A8570"/>that giveth the Increaſe.</hi> The <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> proceeds not from him that brings it, or from the skill with which he brings it; but from the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT of GOD working in it. Let <hi>Iſaac ſow his Land,</hi> and if the <hi>Lord Bleſs him,</hi> he will <hi>receive an hundred fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally; The <hi>Seed</hi> will not preſently ſpring up, at the <hi>firſt ſowing</hi> of it; No, <hi>Behold, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waits for the precious Fruit of the Earth.</hi> Nor does the Miniſtry of the <hi>Word,</hi> preſently ſee all the Effect that it is to ſee. The <hi>Word</hi> may ly for ſome while under Clods, in many an unconcerned Soul. GOD by ſome occurence in his Providence, may bring to Remembrance a <hi>Word</hi> heard ſome while ago, and then it operates. Yea, it may ſo fall out, as in Joh. IV. 37. <hi>That ſaying is true, One ſoweth and another reapeth.</hi> Oh! Let <hi>Parents</hi> be often dropping ſome <hi>Word of GOD</hi> upon their <hi>Children; In the Morning ſow thy Seed; and in the Evening ſlack not thy Hand;</hi> A long while hence, it may be, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou ſhalt thy ſelf be <hi>ſleeping in the Duſt,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> that ſeems to have been left <hi>there,</hi> ſhall have its Efficacy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seed</hi> you ſee; But, who the <hi>Sower?</hi> Be ſure, The <hi>owner</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> is the principal <hi>ſower</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi> It is the <hi>Word</hi> of CHRIST; and it is He that <hi>ſows</hi> it. The <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> is the <hi>Bleſſed Husbandman,</hi> who <hi>Tills the Ground,</hi> and <hi>ſows</hi> the <hi>Field which the Lord has bleſſed.</hi> But then he has his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who do the part of <hi>Sowers</hi> under Him. Theſe are they who may ſay, as in 1. Cor. IX. 11. <hi>We have ſown unto you ſpiritual Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May our GOD Help us, That we may bring you none but the <hi>pure Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word;</hi> Pick and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002905_0032_0FE691CD32E1C1C0"/>Cleanſe the <hi>Seed</hi> in our <hi>Studies;</hi> and not bring you the <hi>Chaff</hi> or <hi>Husks</hi> of our own <hi>Brains;</hi> or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious <hi>Darnel</hi> of unſcriptural <hi>Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May we bring you alſo the <hi>whole Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word;</hi> And ſo honeſtly diſpoſe of the <hi>Seed</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto us, that we may balk no <hi>Truth,</hi> but be able to ſay, <hi>I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the Counſel of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may we ſtill ſee to it, that we <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Sowe</hi> to the Advantage of our <hi>Maſter:</hi> And all we do be aimed at this; That we may ſee you <hi>Glorifying</hi> of our Lord, and <hi>Glorified</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>Brethren, Pray for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rather, in as much as our Calling is no <hi>eaſy Calling.</hi> The <hi>Sweat</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> not more eaſy than the <hi>Sweat</hi> of the <hi>Brow.</hi> The Calling of an <hi>Husbandman</hi> is a <hi>painful Calling.</hi> That Man is not worthy the Name of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who takes not as much pains as an <hi>Husbandman.</hi> Our Name, is Mat. IX. 38. that of, <hi>Labourers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>Sower</hi> with the <hi>Field.</hi> But I know not how to diſmiſs this matter, without ſome <hi>Reflection</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>Confeſs, O People that have the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD offered unto you, how <hi>Neceſſary</hi> it is, that this Word ſhould be diſpenſed unto you. It is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a very diſmal Deſolation; Jer. I. 20. <hi>I will cut off the Sower.</hi> In what a deplorable Condition were you, if the <hi>ſowing</hi> ſhould utterly fail? If you ſhould have no <hi>Preaching,</hi> you would have no <hi>ſowing;</hi> and if <hi>This</hi> fail, you ſoon fall under the Terribleſt <hi>Famine</hi> in the world; Even That; Amos. VIII. 11. <hi>Not a Famine of Bread, but of hearing the words of the Lord.</hi> What, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your <hi>ſtarved</hi> Souls, if the <hi>Bread of Life</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:002905_0033_0FE691CD533BEF58"/>ſhould be deny'd you? The <hi>Bread of Life</hi> will be gone, when there are none to <hi>ſowe</hi> the <hi>Seed of Life.</hi> A Country without the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD and CHRIST and <hi>Salvation</hi> in it, is a rueful Country: 'Tis all <hi>Winter</hi> there, They ſee no <hi>Seed time;</hi> They are <hi>Deſtroy'd for the lack of Knowledge.</hi> Oh! <hi>If the Goſpel be hid from us, we are a loſt People!</hi> But ours is not ſuch a <hi>Country.</hi> Our GOD has <hi>given his Word</hi> unto us; <hi>Praiſe the Lord!</hi> And give to his <hi>Word,</hi> a <hi>Fruitful Entertainment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of a Time when, and a Place where, a <hi>Cab of Doves Dung</hi> was rated at <hi>Five pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> What we render <hi>Doves Dung,</hi> I ſuppoſe, may mean rather the <hi>Offals,</hi> or the <hi>Refuſe,</hi> of the <hi>Corn,</hi> which they commonly gave to their <hi>Pigeons;</hi> That <hi>Coarſe Grain,</hi> which was the vile <hi>Remains</hi> and <hi>Sweepings</hi> of the <hi>Floor.</hi> Surely, 'Tis a better ſort of <hi>Seed,</hi> that is generally caſt upon the Fields in this Country; 'Tis the <hi>fineſt of the Wheat;</hi> where is there what exceeds it?</p>
            <p>But then, <hi>Receive</hi> it Readily. <hi>Retain</hi> it Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. <hi>Improve</hi> it Suitably. In all the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> make ſuitable Returns to Heaven for it. It was once a ſad Complaint; <hi>Maſter, Didſt not thou ſowe good Seed? Whence then are theſe Tares?</hi> Oh! Let there not be cauſe of this Complaint; <hi>Lord, A good Seed has been caſt upon us: But whence then, this Profaneneſs, this Intemperance, this Diſhoneſty? Whence theſe Abominable Impieties and Iniquities?</hi> GOD forbid, that ſuch <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> ever ſhould be found in a <hi>Soyl,</hi> that a good <hi>Seed</hi> has been <hi>ſown</hi> upon!</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Heart</hi> of Man under the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, proves a very <hi>Different Soyl</hi> to the <hi>Seed</hi> that is caſt
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002905_0034_0FE691D3A8DC8E58"/>upon it: Various are the <hi>Effects</hi> which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD has upon them that hear it. For the Illuſtration and Confirmation of this Obſervation, our SAVIOUR has deſcribed the <hi>Hearers</hi> of his <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Effects</hi> of it on them that <hi>Hear</hi> it, under the Figure of no leſs than <hi>Four Soyls:</hi> Whereof <hi>Three</hi> diſappoint the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> but the <hi>Fourth</hi> proves as he would have it. And indeed, among them that hear the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, it is well if <hi>One in Three</hi> entertain it as they ought to do. There is an <hi>High-way Ground,</hi> and a <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> and a <hi>Thorny Ground,</hi> and at laſt a <hi>Good Ground,</hi> which the <hi>Seed</hi> is caſt upon. Each of theſe will now call for a Succeſſive Contemplation.</p>
            <div type="section">

               </head>
               <p>We are informed, Firſt, That ſome who hear the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, prove like an <hi>High-way Ground,</hi> when the <hi>Seed</hi> is caſt upon it: An <hi>High-way Ground,</hi> which being much <hi>Troden</hi> on, the <hi>Fowls of Heaven</hi> do <hi>ſteal away the Seed</hi> that falls upon it. In the Land of <hi>Judaea,</hi> their <hi>Corn-fields</hi> uſually had <hi>High-ways</hi> thorough them; and this is what the Diſcourſe of our SAVIOUR is Alluſive to. Our SAVIOUR has thus explained it; <hi>Theſe are they by the High-way; where the Word is ſown, but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the Word that was ſown in their Hearts.</hi> When he elſewhere ſays of this Hearer, <hi>He hears the Word, and underſtandeth it not,</hi> the Greek Word ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imports an <hi>Unattentive</hi> Hearer, than the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Ignorant:</hi> Or one whoſe Heart will not <hi>go with</hi> what he hears.

                  <hi>Word,</hi> whoſe <hi>Guiſe</hi> and whoſe <hi>Fate,</hi> is to be now ſet before us.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Devils, like the Fowls of the Air, come and catch the Word of GOD our SAVIOUR, from thoſe Hearers, whoſe Hearts are like the HIGH-WAY GROUND, where that good Seed of the Word is trod under Foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have now ſuch Inſtructions as theſe, to be thankful for.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The <hi>Devils,</hi> which fly about this <hi>Air,</hi> under the command of a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>wicked One,</hi> who is called SATAN, are very fitly Reſembled unto the <hi>Fowls of the Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Curſed Spirits,</hi> are called, Pſal. XCI. 3. <hi>Fowlers:</hi> Becauſe they Enſnare, and they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the poor Children of Men, as the Children of Men themſelves, do the ſilly <hi>Birds,</hi> which they have a deſign upon. A ſeaſonable and profitable <hi>Meditation</hi> for any of you, when you are upon that <hi>Recreation.</hi> But then, they are <hi>Fowls</hi> too. The <hi>Fowls</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi> have indeed their lodging in the ſame Element. The <hi>Devils</hi> are, Eph II. 2. <hi>The Power,</hi> or Army, <hi>of the Air.</hi> And, Eph. VI. 12. <hi>Spiritual Wickedneſſes</hi> in thoſe <hi>High Places.</hi> Here theſe <hi>Unclean Birds</hi> will be Neaſted, until our Lord JESUS CHRIST ſhall deſcend with flaming Fire, to make this <hi>Air</hi> become the Seat for that <hi>City of

               <p>Can we tell the Number of the <hi>Fowls?</hi> There are more than Five Hundred ſpecies of them; The Individuals are Thouſands, and Myriads, and Millions; How Numberleſs? But the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Devils,</hi> may, for ought we know, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that of the <hi>Fowls.</hi> It ſeems, that a Demon who moleſted one poor Man in the Goſpel, had no leſs than a <hi>Legion</hi> at hand under his Ordering, like ſo many <hi>French Dragoons,</hi> to ſeize him and vex him.</p>
               <p>What can emulate the <hi>Swiftneſs</hi> of the <hi>Fowls?</hi> Yea, but the <hi>Eagles haſtening to the Prey</hi> are not ſo <hi>ſwift,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Fowls</hi> of a ſtronger Wing, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> when coming down to prey upon us. The <hi>Devils</hi> will convey themſelves from one ſide of the Earth to the other, doubtleſs, as faſt as the Earth it ſelf can whirl about upon its <hi>Axis.</hi> Or as our Lord ſaw the <hi>Devils</hi> falling like the <hi>Lightening,</hi> why mayn't we ſuppoſe 'em flying like the very <hi>Lightning?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally; The moſt <hi>miſchievous Fowls,</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Emblem of the <hi>Devils,</hi> who delight in <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</hi> What are the <hi>Devils</hi> but <hi>Birds of prey?</hi> The Bible calls them, <hi>Foul Spirits,</hi> and, <hi>filthy and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Birds.</hi> When we read, Mat. XIII. 19. of, The <hi>Wicked One catcheth away, what is ſown in the Heart,</hi> there is a Greek word uſed, which implies, that the <hi>wicked One</hi> is an horrid <hi>Harpye</hi> to the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>But, O ye <hi>Souls in peril;</hi> ſince you have ſuch perillous <hi>Fowls of the Air</hi> continually fluttering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you; Hearken, Hearken to the kind Calls of

               <p n="2">II. Wherever the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is diſpenſed, there the <hi>Devils</hi> will immediately come to <hi>ſteal</hi> the good <hi>Seed</hi> of that <hi>Word,</hi> from the Hearts which it is caſt upon.</p>

Even in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, and where the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is diſpenſed, we muſt look to meet with <hi>Devils;</hi> and when the <hi>Sons of GOD</hi> come to <hi>preſent themſelves before the Lord, Satan will alſo come among them.</hi> You are to <hi>Watch</hi> againſt your never-weary, never-ſleeping <hi>Adverſary,</hi> not only in your <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and in your <hi>Travelling,</hi> and in your friendly <hi>Converſations,</hi> but in your <hi>Devotions</hi> too.</p>
               <p>Be yet more particularly adviſed of it; That the <hi>Devils</hi> are very particularly deſirous, to hinder that good <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, from taking <hi>Root</hi> in your Hearts. The <hi>Word of the Kingdom,</hi> tends to reſcue the Souls of Men from the <hi>power of Darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Satan,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Tranſlate</hi> them into the <hi>Kingdom of the Son</hi> of GOD. It is the Word of a SAVIOUR: It is the <hi>Goſpel of our Salvation.</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> are grievouſly diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD; It gives 'em a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Alarum;</hi> They are afraid leſt it prove the

                  <hi>Power of GOD unto the Salvation</hi> of them that ſit under it; They ſuſpect the loſing of ſome Slave or other from their <hi>Empire,</hi> by the verticordious Power of it. They ſurmiſe, the <hi>Prey</hi> will be <hi>taken from the Mighty,</hi> and the <hi>Lawful Captive be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Sinners,</hi> is a <hi>Vexation</hi> of <hi>Devils.</hi> Their <hi>Malice</hi> cannot bear it, that while they are <hi>Damned,</hi> any of Mankind ſhould be <hi>Saved.</hi> Our <hi>Heaven</hi> adds Oyl to the Flame of the <hi>Hell,</hi> from whence the <hi>Smoke of their Torment aſcends for ever and ever.</hi>

               <p>And then, finally, Be adviſed of This; There are many <hi>ways,</hi> by which the <hi>Devils</hi> do <hi>catch up</hi> the good <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> when your Hearts have it falling upon them.</p>
               <p>What theſe <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> of Souls, and <hi>Hinderers</hi> of all that is Good, would be at, is, To ſpoil our <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> to the <hi>Word</hi> of our GOD and SAVIOUR But how is it, that the <hi>Enemy does This!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do it, by injecting of Impertinent and Unſeaſonable <hi>Thoughts</hi> of <hi>other Things</hi> into our Hearts, when we ſhould be <hi>Thinking</hi> on the <hi>Word</hi> of our GOD. What is the <hi>way of the Serpent on the Rock</hi> in this, and how 'tis that the <hi>Devils</hi> convey Thoughts into our Minds; This is a <hi>Thing too wonderful</hi> for me; 'tis <hi>what I know not.</hi> But the <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> is what I <hi>know,</hi> and am certain of. The <hi>Devils</hi> are <hi>Wandring Spirits,</hi> and they have a Faculty to throw <hi>Wandring Thoughts</hi> into our <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi> When the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is caſt upon us, it may be ſome <hi>Filthy Thoughts,</hi> or ſome <hi>Angry Thoughts,</hi> or, at leaſt, ſome <hi>worldly Thoughts,</hi> will then be caſt in, and carry away our Minds from what they ſhould be upon. Our GOD may ſay
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002905_0039_0FE691362868BDE8"/>of us; Ezek. XXXIII. 31. <hi>They ſit before thee as my People, they hear thy Words, but their Heart goeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Covetouſneſs.</hi> While our GOD is tendering his <hi>Word</hi> unto us, the <hi>Devils</hi> throw in the <hi>Images</hi> of a <hi>Bargain,</hi> or a <hi>Journey,</hi> and ſome contrivance for our <hi>worldly Advantage,</hi> or, perhaps, what is yet more <hi>Baſe</hi> than ſo: And while we think on theſe things, the good <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> is picked away moſt unaccountably. If the Meſſenger of GOD, ſhould ſuddenly ask of ſome, <hi>What was the laſt Seed of the word caſt upon you?</hi> They muſt with Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion own, <hi>I did not Regard what it was.</hi> Thus the <hi>Devils</hi> have ſnatched it away. <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> make the <hi>Word</hi> of our SAVIOUR to be <hi>in vain</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto us. O my Hearers, <hi>What are you Thinking on?</hi> If upon Recollection you find, that your Thoughts are at any time gone away from the <hi>word,</hi> whereof you ſhould be more diligent Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, think with Horror upon it; <hi>Some Devil is now at work upon me!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agaid, They do it, by <hi>prejudicing</hi> our Hearts againſt the <hi>Word</hi> of our GOD, or the Diſpenſers of it. Sometimes, the good <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> itſelf is not liked. Either the <hi>Proud Men</hi> ſay to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt Falſly.</hi> Or, ſomething in the <hi>manner</hi> of ſpeaking it, is not pleaſing. But oftner, 'Tis the <hi>Seeds-Man,</hi> that is not liked. The <hi>Devils</hi> would fain have the <hi>Feet</hi> of them who <hi>Preach the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> to be not <hi>Beautiful:</hi> but have <hi>wrong ſteps</hi> charged upon them, to fill our Minds with <hi>Prejudices</hi> againſt them. Not only would the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> bring the Hearers, to that <hi>Contempt</hi> of thoſe who come unto them, <hi>What is it this Babler ſays?</hi> But alſo that <hi>Hatred</hi> of them; 1 King. XXII. 8.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002905_0040_0FE6913D45D8AC70"/>
                  <hi>I hate him.</hi> It is a potent Engine, that the <hi>Devils</hi> have, to take away the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> from our <hi>Hearts,</hi> when they have made our Hearts to dislike the <hi>Hands</hi> which throw it upon us. 'Tis done ſometimes by more <hi>Immediate Suggeſtions,</hi> which fill the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men with <hi>Grudges</hi> againſt thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of the <hi>Word,</hi> from whom they might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have the greateſt Benefit. Many have a <hi>Diſtaſte</hi> for ſuch; and can give no <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it. But the <hi>Spirit that works in them,</hi> can give the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; is</hi> the <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Sometimes 'tis done, by the <hi>Tools</hi> of Ungodly <hi>Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Pens;</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> never want Venemous <hi>Defamers,</hi> and Scandalous <hi>Libellers,</hi> and Peſtilent <hi>Scoffers,</hi> to dreſs up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of GOD in <hi>Bear-skins,</hi> and throw them out unto the Dogs. Theſe <hi>Black birds of Hell,</hi> do mightily prevent the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> from getting well into the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the poiſoned People. Who ſets them to <hi>work?</hi> Even, he that will pay them their <hi>Wages.</hi> To ſuch Emiſſaries of the wicked One, the Spirit of GOD ſays, <hi>O Full of all Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, Thou Child of the Devil, Thou Enemy of all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs!</hi> Chriſtians, when ſome <hi>Slanderers</hi> are talking with you, or when ſome Virulent and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive <hi>Pamphlets</hi> are before you, you may do well to think, <hi>The Devil now deſigns upon me!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more; They do it by making us <hi>Drowſy</hi> and <hi>Sleepy,</hi> when the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD ſhould have the Reſpects of a wakeful Attention paid unto it. When the beſt Preacher in the World, was caſting the <hi>Seed,</hi> we find one; A&amp;. XX. 9. <hi>Fallen into a deep Sleep.</hi> Who <hi>Rocqued</hi> the <hi>Cradle,</hi> I pray? From a Man that is <hi>Aſleep,</hi> any thing may be taken away. When the <hi>Devils</hi> have lulled us <hi>Aſleep,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:002905_0041_0FE691D92B085B80"/>they may, and they do, take away from our Hearts, the good <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi> There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a wholeſome <hi>Leſſon,</hi> many an uſeful <hi>Counſil,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a needful <hi>Caution,</hi> which might get into our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and ſtick there. But the <hi>Devils</hi> have chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us thereof, by laying us faſt <hi>Aſleep,</hi> at the time that they were uttered. Oh! That we were more on our Guard! There may indeed be ſome <hi>Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> and <hi>Heavineſs</hi> of <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> which may ſometimes betray very Godly People into this Miſcarriage. The <hi>Spirit</hi> would be <hi>willing</hi> to have it otherwiſe, and groans under the <hi>Diſtempered Fleſh</hi> which indiſpoſes us. We have a compaſſionate SAVIOUR, who in this caſe <hi>pitties</hi> us. At the ſame time we ſhould not Pardon and Indulge our ſelves; or ſhow any <hi>Pity</hi> to our own <hi>Irregularity.</hi> But when People can ſet themſelves to <hi>Sleep</hi> in the <hi>Dreadful place,</hi> which <hi>is the Houſe of GOD and the Gate of Heaven;</hi> and make a Trade of <hi>long Naps,</hi> when they are in the <hi>ſpecial Preſence</hi> of a GOD that <hi>will be ſanctified in all them who draw near unto Him;</hi> how poorly is the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> exerciſed in them! Or can they think, that the great GOD will hold them <hi>Guiltleſs,</hi> who ſo <hi>take his Name in Vain?</hi> Awake, my Friends, Awake; And let us Charitably jog, and pull, and <hi>waken</hi> one another; The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> of Hell are upon you! A <hi>Satanic Opium</hi> is adminiſtred unto you, by thoſe Fiends of Darkneſs; who have a Plot upon you, to deprive you of a <hi>Word,</hi> that might <hi>Save your Souls.</hi> Alas, How many in our Congregations, very ſinfully and fooliſhly ſnore away their <hi>Sabbaths!</hi> And might, if they were not faſt <hi>Aſleep,</hi> often hear their SAVIOUR upbraiding of them, <hi>What?</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:002905_0042_0FE6913D624FC0A0"/>
                  <hi>Can't you watch one Hour with me?</hi> Oh! That they would <hi>ſtir up themſelves,</hi> and beg their Neighbours kindly to <hi>watch</hi> over them, and <hi>waken</hi> them, and as often as they are <hi>overtaken with the Fault,</hi> think; <hi>How can I bear Satan thus to Rob me, of that which is the Life of my Soul!</hi> This I ſay, <hi>Awake, what meaneſt thou, O ſleeper; Hearken to thy GOD!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. An <hi>Highway Ground</hi> are the <hi>Hearts</hi> of thoſe, who permit the <hi>Devils</hi> to ſteal the good <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> from them, in their Hearing of it. An Elegant Similitude! For,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seed</hi> that falls on the <hi>Highway,</hi> does not <hi>ſink</hi> into the <hi>Earth,</hi> but ly on the top of it. There are Hearers of the <hi>Word,</hi> who are too unmindful of our SAVIOUR's Direction; Luk, IX. 44. <hi>Let theſe ſayings ſink down into you.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> has no more than a <hi>Superficiary Touch</hi> upon them. It may inform their <hi>Heads,</hi> but their <hi>Hearts</hi> are not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, not moved by it, not changed by it.</p>
               <p>Again; The <hi>Seed</hi> that falls on the <hi>Highway,</hi> is not <hi>look'd after.</hi> There are Hearers of the <hi>Word</hi> who don't <hi>look after</hi> what has fallen upon them, to ſee what comes of it; but it is with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to That; Jam. I. 23, 24. <hi>He is an Hearer of the Word, and not a Doer; He goes his way, and ſtraightway forgets.</hi> They do not <hi>Ruminate</hi> on the <hi>Word</hi> they have heard; their <hi>Hearts</hi> don't recall any thing of it; but they carry toward it, as if they had never been concerned with it.</p>
               <p>Moreover; <hi>High-ways</hi> are <hi>common Roads;</hi> They are ways that ly <hi>common</hi> and <hi>open</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> for every Paſſenger. The <hi>Hearts</hi> of many that hear the <hi>Word,</hi> are not as <hi>Gardens encloſed;</hi> but they are
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002905_0043_0FE691D94C300A78"/>the Walk of <hi>Satan;</hi> the Print of his <hi>Cloven Foot</hi> is to be ſeen upon them: Nothing, tho' ever ſo Evil, is kept out of them. For this Cauſe, the Denomination of the <hi>Gentiies,</hi> who in Matth. XXII. 10. are called, <hi>The High-Way,</hi> may be put upon them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly; In the <hi>Highways</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> that is caſt by <hi>Hand</hi> is caſt under the <hi>Foot;</hi> It is Trampled on. Verily, There are Hearers of the <hi>Word,</hi> of whom we read; Heb. X. 29. <hi>They have trodden under Foot the Son of GFD.</hi> Be ſure then, they <hi>Tread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot</hi> His <hi>Word;</hi> They <hi>Trample</hi> on the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of it. There may this Account be given of them; <hi>They Deſpiſe His Word, until the Wrath of the Lord ariſe againſt them, and there is no Remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot go off this <hi>Highway Ground,</hi> without making at leaſt theſe Two Remarks upon it.</p>
               <p>Firſt. Under whoſe Malignant Influence, do you think, muſt they be, that frequently and needleſsly <hi>Abſent</hi> themſelves from the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD our SAVIOUR, when they might enjoy the Diſpenſations of it? If it be <hi>Satan</hi> that <hi>ſteals</hi> the <hi>Good Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> from the <hi>Way</hi> on which it falls, doubtleſs, it muſt be <hi>Satan,</hi> who <hi>ſteals</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the <hi>Way</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi> He who does <hi>Catch</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> from us, is he who does <hi>Keep</hi> us from the <hi>Word.</hi> The Jews gave this as a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Bad Neighbour,</hi> Tis, <hi>One who don't come to the Synagogue.</hi> If there be ſuch a <hi>Bad Neighbour</hi> in the Town, we ſee, what is the <hi>Bad Spirit</hi> that makes him ſo. It is noted of <hi>Origen,</hi> That in his Vigorous Homilies, he Reproved no Crime ſo much, as that of <hi>Abſence from the Holy Aſſemblies.</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:002905_0044_0FE6913F6ABED348"/>This Crime I now Reprove, with telling you, whom you ſerve and pleaſe in the committing of it; The <hi>Devils!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be, the moſt Criminal are at this time, <hi>out of Hearing.</hi> Wherefore, let ſuch as wiſh well to them, carry them home ſomething from the place where they ſhould have been. Ask them to read that awful Scripture; Joh. VIII. 47 <hi>He that is of GOD, hears the Words of GOD; you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear them not, becauſe you are not of GOD.</hi> If they plead, They have not <hi>Cloathes</hi> fine enough; Ask them, whether they had not better come with <hi>mean Cloathes,</hi> where they may have the <hi>Garments of Salvation</hi> put upon their Souls, than remain <hi>Wretched, and Miſerable, and Poor, and Blind, and Naked,</hi> as they are? Ask them, Whether they muſt not ſhortly be ſhrowded in a <hi>Winding-Sheet,</hi> and their <hi>Naked Souls</hi> will not then wiſh, that a pretence of <hi>Mean Cloathes</hi> had not kept them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that <hi>Hate Inſtruction.</hi> If they profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you, <hi>They Read a Chapter in</hi> Job: Turn them to Job. XXIII. 12. <hi>I have eſteemed the Words of His Mouth more than my Neceſſary Food.</hi> Ask them, Whether <hi>they</hi> can ſay ſo; and what they think will be the portion of them, who can't ſay ſo?</p>
               <p>Secondly. What is to be done, for our Defence from the <hi>Fowls of the Air?</hi> What, that the Infae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of the <hi>Highway Ground,</hi> may not be ours, in our <hi>Hearing</hi> the Word of our GOD?</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Theſe two Things to be done.</head>
               <p>The Firſt; In our <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> Oh! let us check the <hi>Roving</hi> of our Mind. Whatever

                  <hi>Improper Thoughts</hi> would preſs in upon us, chaſe them away; There is the <hi>Devil</hi> in them! Deal with them as our Patriarch once; Gen. XV. 11. <hi>When the Fowls came down, upon the</hi> Sacrifices, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram drove them away.</hi> If <hi>Improper Thoughts</hi> go to intrude, or beſpeak an Admiſſion, Repel 'em, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe 'em, Rebuke 'em; Say, <hi>I am doing a great work, ſo that I cannot come down: Why ſhould the work ceaſe, while I leave it, and come down to you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second; Let our <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> be filled with our <hi>Praying</hi> to our Lord. Oh! let ſuch <hi>Echo</hi>'s paſs from us; Pſal. XXVII. 8. <hi>Seek my Face; My Heart ſaid upon it, Thy Face Lord, I will ſeek.</hi> Upon the <hi>Myſteries</hi> unfolded, ſay, <hi>Lord, I accept this, as a Faithful Saying.</hi> Upon <hi>Follies</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſay, <hi>Lord, let thy warned Servant be kept from this Folly!</hi> Upon <hi>Duties</hi> propounded, ſay, <hi>Lord, Help me to do this Duty.</hi> Upon the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> let your Heart ſay, <hi>Lord, let this be my portion.</hi> Upon the <hi>Curſes</hi> of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> let your Heart ſay, <hi>Lord, I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> This one PROPOSAL, ſhould be more to you, than a <hi>Golden Wedge of Ophir.</hi> You ſecure the <hi>Seed</hi> from the <hi>Fowls of the Air,</hi> if it be complied withal.</p>

               <head>The <hi>Stony Ground.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>We are informed, Secondly, That ſome who hear the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, prove like a <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> when the <hi>Seed</hi> is caſt upon it: A <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> on which if the <hi>Seed</hi> has any Effect, yet it has no laſting ones. Our SAVIOUR thus gives us to <hi>underſtand the Parable, and the Interpretation; The Words of the wiſe, and His Dark Sayings,</hi> are by
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002905_0046_0FE6912CD57C1388"/>Himſelf thus Interpreted. <hi>Theſe are they which are ſown,</hi> (that is to ſay, They that receive the <hi>Seed</hi>) on <hi>Stony Ground, who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladneſs: And have no Root in themſelves, and ſo endure but for a time; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when Affliction or Perſecution ariſeth for the words ſake, immediately they are offended.</hi> The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Goſpel <hi>ſown</hi> upon Hearts that are like the <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> is, you ſee, firſt, very <hi>commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and comfortable; then, very <hi>miſerable</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable.</p>
               <p>The Admonition to be now proſecuted, is This.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In ſome Hearers of the word, whoſe Heart is like the Stony Ground, that Good Seed of the Word may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with ſome ſeeming Faith and Joy; But in a Time of Temptation, they and their Faith and their Joy, do quickly and ſadly wither away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Proſecution of it, let theſe <hi>Inſtructions</hi> find ſome Entertainment with you.</p>
               <p n="1">I. A <hi>Stony Ground</hi> is that which a <hi>ſinful Heart,</hi> may be too juſtly compared unto. Inheed, the <hi>Heart</hi> of every Man, in his Fallen and Corrupt Nature, is as <hi>hard</hi> as a <hi>Stone; Hard</hi> like the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Milſtone.</hi> And many do by <hi>Cuſtome</hi> add unto that <hi>hardneſs of Heart,</hi> which is by <hi>Nature</hi> in them. 'Tis called, Ezek. XI. 19. A <hi>Stony Heart.</hi> In a <hi>Stone</hi> there is a cloſe Faſtning, and Knitting, and Combining of the parts together, whereby it is made ſtrong to reſiſt, whatever would from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out act upon it. Such a <hi>Stone</hi> is this <hi>Heart</hi> of ours, &amp; ſo does it <hi>Reſiſt,</hi> the Eſſays of Heaven to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Our GOD may ſay of us; as in Zech.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002905_0047_0FE6913F8BB87D00"/>VII. 12. <hi>They made their Hearts hard as an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant-Stone, leſt they ſhould hear the Law.</hi> No <hi>Stone</hi> can be more <hi>Inſenſible;</hi> No <hi>Stone</hi> can be more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible,</hi> than this wretched <hi>Heart</hi> of ours under all the means of Good that are employ'd upon it. And as we read, Prov. XXVII. 3. <hi>A Stone is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy:</hi> Even ſuch alſo is this <hi>Heart</hi> of ours; There is no <hi>moving</hi> of it. It is as addicted unto the <hi>Earth,</hi> as the <hi>Heavy Stone,</hi> which by its <hi>weight</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend unto the <hi>Earth.</hi> It will <hi>mind Earthly Things;</hi> and not eaſily be <hi>moved</hi> from the wickedneſs of tending to the <hi>Earth</hi> as the <hi>Center</hi> of it. Be ſure, a <hi>Stone</hi> is no good Soyl to <hi>Sow</hi> upon. But is our <hi>unfruitful Heart</hi> any better? Tho' the <hi>good Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> falls upon it, there is little <hi>good Fruit</hi> commonly obtained of it.</p>
               <p>Oh! That we did every one more <hi>know</hi> this <hi>Plague of our own Heart! Feel</hi> thy <hi>Stony Heart,</hi> O ſerious Penitent. Thy <hi>Feeling</hi> of it, and thy <hi>Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> bitterly and grievouſly under it; <hi>Alas, my hard Heart! My hard Heart!</hi> This would be the firſt Symptom of the <hi>Hardneſs</hi> going off. That horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſeaſe of the <hi>Stone</hi> in the <hi>Wheel broken at the Ciſtern,</hi> would not be a greater matter of Horror to us, than the <hi>Stone</hi> in our <hi>Heart,</hi> if the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>Stone</hi> did not ly in our not <hi>Feeling</hi> of what we have cauſe to be moſt concern'd about.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Some Hearers of the <hi>Word</hi> whoſe <hi>Hearts</hi> are like <hi>Stones</hi> under it, yet may with ſome <hi>Faith</hi> and ſome <hi>Joy</hi> ſeem to Receive the <hi>good Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> that falls upon them.

               <p>Firſt; There is a <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>Falſe-hearted</hi> Hearers of the <hi>Word</hi> may pretend unto. We read, Luk. VIII. 13. <hi>For a while they believe.</hi> A True <hi>Juſtifying Faith</hi> will be for more than <hi>a while;</hi> By its <hi>Uniting</hi> the Beleever to his Redeemer, it brings him into thoſe Hands, from whence nothing ever can pull him away. The meer <hi>Stony Ground</hi> has not this <hi>Faith</hi> growing in it. But there is a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Faith</hi> may look like a <hi>Juſtifying Faith;</hi> and meer <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> may have a <hi>Weed,</hi> that ſhall ſeem this <hi>Herb of Grace.</hi> A <hi>Falſe-Hearted</hi> Hearer of the <hi>Word,</hi> may yield ſome <hi>Aſſent</hi> unto the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Word:</hi> Which indeed the very <hi>Devils</hi> do, with <hi>Trembling</hi> at it. Yea, he may profeſs to yield ſome <hi>Conſent</hi> unto it. Every <hi>Baptiſed</hi> Perſon is a <hi>Profeſs'd Servant</hi> of GOD. But, alas, how many under the <hi>Livery</hi> of CHRIST in their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> have their Souls <hi>Unbaptiſed,</hi> Unpurified, Unſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. Indeed, if a Man give a Real and Hearty <hi>Conſent</hi> unto the <hi>Methods of Grace</hi> in our Salvation by a Glorious CHRIST, ſuch a Man ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Saved and Happy. But a <hi>ſincere Conſent</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:002905_0049_0FE691446D2864F0"/>is one thing, and a <hi>profeſs'd Conſent</hi> is another. Some do <hi>Profeſs</hi> to <hi>Conſent</hi> unto the <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD, and yet continue in the <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity.</hi> Behold, A Tragical Example; Act. VIII. 13 <hi>Simon himſelf believed alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; There is alſo a <hi>Joy</hi> which <hi>Falſe-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Hearers of the <hi>Word</hi> may attain unto. We read, Mat. XIII. 20. Such an one, <hi>Hears the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it.</hi> There is the <hi>Joy</hi> of a diſtreſſed Soul finding in an Alſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But there is a <hi>Flaſhy Joy,</hi> which may look very like that <hi>Sacred Joy.</hi> A <hi>Falſe-hearted</hi> Hearer of the <hi>Word,</hi> may have ſome <hi>Delight</hi> in the Exerciſe of <hi>Hearing</hi> itſelf; may <hi>love to Hear</hi> ſuch a Man. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had ſome ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on his Miniſtry. Yea, he may have ſome <hi>Delight</hi> in ſome doing of ſomething of what he hears. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had ſome Followers that were none of the beſt; of whom it is reported; Joh. V. 35. <hi>Ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoice in his Light.</hi> Many may find it for their Secular Advantage to comply with ſome things, which they <hi>hear</hi> in the Word of GOD. There are <hi>Loaves!</hi> Thus, at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> very many People were <hi>glad</hi> of that <hi>Word</hi> which decried the Abominations of <hi>Popery.</hi> The Gentry became enriched with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey-lands,</hi> and the Peaſants were delivered from the Tyranny of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and were taught how to come at the <hi>Pardon</hi> of their Sins, without being

                  <hi>Prieſt-ridden</hi> into cruel <hi>Penances</hi> for it. But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Ancient Prophecy, <hi>many,</hi> yea, the moſt, <hi>Cleave to the</hi> Reformation <hi>only with Flatteries;</hi> Their Hearts don't like the Maxims, which it muſt live upon!</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> that <hi>ſeem to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice</hi> it, will meet with a <hi>Time of Temptation,</hi> to <hi>try</hi> whether they have <hi>indeed received</hi> it. We read, Luk. VIII. 13. <hi>A Time of Temptation comes upon them.</hi> When the <hi>Seed</hi> has been <hi>ſown</hi> upon the Ground, the <hi>Sun</hi> will be up, and fall with <hi>ſcorching Beams,</hi> upon it. A fit Emblem of the <hi>Temptation,</hi> which they that <hi>Hear,</hi> and ſeem to <hi>like,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, muſt look to meet withal.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There will be the more general <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Adverſity,</hi> to try the <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>perſeverance</hi> of them that ſeem to Receive the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD. We read, Mat. IV. 17. <hi>Affliction ariſeth.</hi> Many may have the Vanity to expect little <hi>Affliction,</hi> when their <hi>ways</hi> are <hi>once directed for keeping the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of GOD.</hi> O vain Dream! When our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR has expreſsly forewarned us, <hi>In the world ye ſhall have Tribulation!</hi> But, by <hi>Adverſity,</hi> there will be a <hi>Trial</hi> made of us, whether we really Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>word</hi> of GOD as we ſay, we do. <hi>Self-denial</hi> is what the <hi>word</hi> of GOD in the firſt place, indiſpenſably calls for; Tis, the <hi>Firſt Leſſon</hi> of the <hi>word.</hi> When <hi>Adverſity</hi> comes, it lays the <hi>Croſs</hi> on us. It is now <hi>Tried,</hi> how we can bear it, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we can patiently <hi>deny</hi> our ſelves of every thing at the Call and for the ſake of, our Lord. If under <hi>Adverſity</hi> we ſuitably, quietly, fruitfully bear the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and forego what we muſt part
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002905_0051_0FE69146C399A950"/>withal; then we have Received the <hi>word</hi> of GOD aright. But if under <hi>Adverſity,</hi> we grow weary of ſerving our Lord, and of waiting on Him, and of ſitting under His Diſcipline; then the <hi>word</hi> of GOD was never well received in our Souls. Oh! that being <hi>Tried we may come forth as Gold;</hi> And by <hi>Learning the ſtatutes</hi> of GOD from it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly; There will be the more ſpecial <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> to try our <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> We read, Mat. XIII. 21. <hi>Perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word. Cain</hi>'s Club walks about, unto this very Day; and we have a fair praemonition; <hi>All that will live Godlily in CHRIST JESUS ſhall ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> Until the ſecond Coming of our great GOD and SAVIOUR, the World will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee a Day, wherein a Man may be an <hi>Holy Man,</hi> and ſuffer nothing for being ſo. For, <hi>Satan</hi> will not be <hi>Bound,</hi> until the ſecond Coming of the Lord. And until <hi>Satan</hi> be <hi>Bound,</hi> we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that he will ceaſe to give Trouble unto all that <hi>Love the Lord JESUS CHRIST in ſincerity.</hi> The <hi>Third Chapter</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> will never ceaſe to operate, until we come to the <hi>Twentieth Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Where the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of the <hi>Hand</hi> is Reſtrained, and wicked Men have not their Tools to work withal, yet the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and the Methods to expreſs much <hi>Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> much <hi>Averſion,</hi> will never fail. But as in the Days of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> even <hi>ſo it is now.</hi> The genuine Children of GOD, muſt be <hi>hated,</hi> and <hi>mocked,</hi> and <hi>wronged,</hi> by the <hi>Children of the wicked one.</hi> By this
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002905_0052_0FE6914CDC05E3A0"/>
                  <hi>Perſecution</hi> there will be a <hi>Trial</hi> made of us; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do throughly Receive the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, and will by no means part with it; <hi>Hold faſt what we have received.</hi> It is <hi>Tried</hi> what Metal we are made of. If we can't bear to be Vilified and Ridiculed, for being ſtrictly Conſciencious, we have not yet Received the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD. If we had rather commit a <hi>Sin</hi> againſt the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, than incur a <hi>Scoff</hi> on the ſcore of our keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Word,</hi> Ah! Woful Soul, Thou haſt never yet Received it. But, if we can encounter <hi>Hard Meaſures</hi> for our Fidelity to the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, and will <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>word,</hi> whatever it <hi>coſt</hi> us, Then indeed we have <hi>Received the Truth in the Love of it.</hi> Oh! That in the <hi>Fiery Trial,</hi> we may be found, what ſhall be for <hi>Praiſe and Honour and Glory at the Appearing of the Lord!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Falſe-hearted</hi> Hearers of the <hi>Word,</hi> will wretchedly <hi>wither,</hi> when <hi>Temptation ſcorches</hi> them. Not having the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Sap</hi> of a good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in them, to feed that PIETY which they ſeem to have, they <hi>wither,</hi> they <hi>wither!</hi> Yea, <hi>while they are yet in their Greenneſs, and not cut down, they wither before any other Herb: So are the Paths of all that forget GOD, and the Hypocrites hope ſhall periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be enquired; What is the <hi>withering</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Corn of the <hi>Stony Ground</hi> is obnoxious? It muſt be Anſwered; It is the <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> of theſe <hi>Falſe hearted</hi> ones, thro' prejudice at the <hi>Right ways of the Lord.</hi> In Two of the Evangeliſts we read, <hi>They are Offended;</hi> In the Third we read, <hi>They fall away.</hi> Tis no rare thing, for <hi>Hypocrites</hi> to prove <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> Our SAVIOUR had ſome Diſciples,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002905_0053_0FE6914CF8008088"/>who <hi>went away,</hi> and <hi>walked no more with Him.</hi> The Primitive Churches, had thoſe who <hi>went out from them,</hi> not being truly <hi>of them.</hi> All Ages have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Falſe-hearted</hi> ones often come to a <hi>wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> even in their very <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> They Renounce the <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> with which they once flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Field of the Church. Or, if not ſo, yet inſtead of ſtanding up for GOD, and CHRIST, and Holineſs, they become Formal, Carnal, Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Creatures, and <hi>caſt off the thing that is Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They come to a <hi>withering</hi> in their <hi>Affection.</hi> They <hi>leave their firſt Love:</hi> Their <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi> to the <hi>Appointments,</hi> to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of GOD, all vaniſhes; and all their old <hi>Zeal</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Yea, they come to a <hi>withering</hi> of the <hi>Gifts</hi> that once adorned them. They can't <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>ſpeak</hi> as once they could. Their Parts are ſo <hi>withered,</hi> that every one may plainly ſee, <hi>The Man is not what once he was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at laſt it comes to that; Job XXVII. 8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when GOD ſhall take away his Soul?</hi> All the <hi>Seed</hi> caſt on the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and all the <hi>ſhow</hi> of Good iſſuing from it, comes to nothing.</p>
               <p>Some Reflection muſt be made upon theſe things. Tho' the <hi>Stony Ground</hi> yields no <hi>Fruit</hi> unto the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> let us reap ſome <hi>Fruit</hi> from the <hi>Stony Ground</hi> before we leave it.</p>
               <p>Beware, Beware, O my Hearers, that what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Religion</hi> may have been made upon you, do not <hi>wither</hi> in <hi>Apoſtaſy.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD has doubtleſs raiſed ſome good <hi>Motions,</hi> &amp; ſome good

                  <hi>Practices</hi> in many of you. For GOD's ſake, let them not <hi>wither.</hi> Your <hi>Prayers</hi> in your <hi>Cloſets,</hi> and with your <hi>Houſhoulds;</hi> your Cares to <hi>do Good</hi> upon your <hi>Children,</hi> and among your <hi>Neighbours;</hi> your <hi>watch</hi> over your whole Converſation: your <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> for Communion with GOD in His Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; If theſe things do <hi>wither</hi> in <hi>any Man, My Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Wherefore there are Three Things to be earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſs'd upon you. And tho' it be <hi>Stony Ground</hi> that I have to deal withal, yet we will ſee what the Mighty <hi>Hammer that breaks the Rocks to pieces,</hi> will do upon it.</p>
               <p>Firſt; Tho' you are never ſuch a <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> Yet, Oh! be prevailed withal to beg it of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious GOD, that He would mercifully take away from you the <hi>Heart of Stone.</hi> Is it the <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> that yields nothing but <hi>withering Fruit?</hi> Yet, Oh! Let ſo much <hi>Fruit</hi> be found upon the moſt Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately <hi>Stony Ground</hi> among you. Go to a Glorious CHRIST, with doleful Complaints about that <hi>hard Heart</hi> of thine; and plead with the Lord His Promiſe; Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, Be concerned, O you that have the <hi>Good Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> falling on you, that it may come to have a good and a deep <hi>Root</hi> within you.

This is, <hi>The Root of the Matter;</hi> This, <hi>the Root of the Righteous.</hi> May you be <hi>Rooted in the Love of GOD,</hi> then all will be well. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD has taken <hi>Root,</hi> when it gives a Change and a Turn, and a <hi>Godward Biaſs</hi> to the Soul. But, how to come at this! Aſſuredly, 'tis obtain'd, yea, 'tis begun, in looking to GOD for it. Oh! <hi>Ask</hi> it of a GOD, who <hi>gives this Wiſdom</hi> to them that <hi>Ask</hi> it. And importunately make that ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Pſal.

               <p>Thirdly; I know not how to give over <hi>plowing</hi> on the <hi>Stony Ground,</hi> until I have gained thus far upon my Hearers; Bring your ſelves to a <hi>Trial,</hi> whether you have under the <hi>good Word</hi> of GOD, ever yet arrived unto that <hi>good Work</hi> of GOD, which is beyond what any meer <hi>Stony Ground</hi> has had the Experience of: Come to a <hi>Trial,</hi> whether the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD has ever yet produced that <hi>Work</hi> in you, which will endure the <hi>Trial;</hi> and which being <hi>Tried</hi> will never <hi>fall away.</hi>

               <p>We are informed, Thirdly; That ſome who hear the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, prove like a <hi>Thorny Ground,</hi> when the <hi>Seed</hi> is caſt upon it: A <hi>Thorny Ground,</hi> in which the <hi>Seed</hi> is <hi>choked</hi> at ſuch a rate, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Effects that are propoſed for it. Our SAVIOUR thus Interprets this Article of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; <hi>Theſe are they which are ſown,</hi> (or, do receive the Seed) <hi>among Thorns; ſuch as hear the Word, and the Cares of this World and the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, and the Luſts of other things entring in choke the Word, and it becometh unfruitful.</hi> The Sin of our Father <hi>Adam</hi> has brought that Malediction on the <hi>Earth</hi> out of which he was taken; <hi>Thorns it ſhall bring forth unto thee.</hi> So, <hi>Spinas ac Tribulos, Maledictum parturit Arvum.</hi> And indeed, there is now no part of old <hi>Adam</hi>'s World, which has not <hi>Thorns</hi> enough to render it uneaſy to us. But the worſt ſort of <hi>Thorns</hi> are thoſe whereof the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> has now adviſed us: And whereof, let us now take this Admonition.</p>

                  <hi>The Things of this World, and the Luſts of Men after theſe Things, are thoſe Thorns, which do often Choak and Kill and Spoil the Efficacy which that Seed of Grace, the Word of GOD ſhould have upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read, Prov. XXVI 9. <hi>At a Thorn goes up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hand of a Drunkard ſo is a Parable in the Mouth of Fools.</hi> They had no <hi>Needles,</hi> but uſed <hi>Thorns</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Needles.</hi> A <hi>Drunken</hi> Man going to uſe a <hi>Needle,</hi> he miſapplied it; he ſticks the <hi>Needle</hi> into his <hi>Hand</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Cloth;</hi> he wounds himſelf with the <hi>Needle</hi> inſtead of doing what ſhould be done. 'Tis to be hoped, we ſhall not now ſo miſapply what we read of the <hi>Thorns</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> that it will be a <hi>Parable in the Hand of Fools.</hi>

               <p>And, here, firſt, It is Remarkable: How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> are to one another! <hi>How Readeſt thou?</hi> — Jam. IV. 4. <hi>The Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of this World is Enmity to GOD. The World,</hi> ſince the Fall of Man, is very much under the Management and Government of, <hi>Our Adverſary the Devil.</hi> And the depraved <hi>Heart</hi> of Man ſince the Fall, is very much indiſpoſed for making ſuch a right uſe of <hi>This World,</hi> as may be for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of GOD.

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002905_0060_0FE6915E71E33D80"/>comes to paſs, that the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> are forever claſhing with one another; And, <hi>If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> If this <hi>World</hi> have our <hi>Hearts,</hi> 'tis very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Word</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Again; What are the <hi>Thorns</hi> on the <hi>Earth,</hi> but the Fruits of the <hi>Curſe.</hi> Poſſibly, there would have been <hi>Thorns,</hi> if Man had not finned: They may be <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to us. But the <hi>ſuper-abounding</hi> of <hi>Thorns,</hi> This is moſt certainly from the Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Curſe</hi> of GOD, which Mans Hunger after For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit has brought upon him. It is a Threatening upon a <hi>Vineyard</hi> in ill Terms with Heaven, <hi>There ſhall come up Briars and Thorns in it.</hi> But, Oh! What a <hi>Curſe</hi> from GOD, is there upon us, in the <hi>worldly Luſts</hi> which our Hearts are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd withal! I tell you truly, a Man cannot be more <hi>Curſed,</hi> and more <hi>Damned,</hi> than by being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly given up unto them; and under ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation as That; Pſal.

               <p>Thirdly. <hi>Thorns</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> are they <hi>profitable?</hi> No, they are <hi>pernicious,</hi> if thy are <hi>prevailing</hi> there. Can you <hi>Feed</hi> on <hi>Thorns;</hi> or <hi>Build</hi> with <hi>Thorns;</hi> or, will <hi>Thorns</hi> be a laſting <hi>Fuel</hi> for you? No, you call them, as the Bible does, <hi>Grieving Thorns.</hi> And <hi>worldly Luſts,</hi> I pray, what are they good for? It is demanded, Rom. VI. 21. <hi>What Fruit have ye of thoſe things?</hi> Oh! Be ſenſible, that <hi>Sin</hi> is good for nothing in the World. Its <hi>works</hi> are <hi>unfruitful
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002905_0062_0FE6915E94CEACE8"/>works of Darkneſs. Good!</hi> Nay, <hi>worldly Luſts</hi> are forever <hi>miſchievous</hi> Things.

               <p>Fourthly; When the <hi>Thorns</hi> cover our <hi>Fields,</hi> 'tis our <hi>Sloth</hi> which is to be blamed for ſuffering of it. The Man dwells, <hi>At the ſign of the Sluggards Field,</hi> who indulges them. <hi>I went by the Field of the Slothful, and lo, It was all overgrown with Thorns.</hi> And, What ſhall be ſaid of the <hi>Heart</hi> which has <hi>Worldly Luſts</hi> permitted and prevailing in it? That <hi>Heart</hi> is, <hi>The Field of the ſlothful.</hi> When the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> allowed and ſavoured the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and thro' <hi>Idleneſs</hi> forbore the Extirpation of them, GOD ſaid unto them; J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

XXIII. 13. <hi>Know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, They ſhall be Thorns in your Eyes.</hi> This you may <hi>Know for a certainty;</hi> Men might, with the Bleſſing of GOD, very much Extirpate <hi>Worldly Luſts</hi> out of their Souls; Tis from their own <hi>ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Buſineſs</hi> of <hi>Mortification,</hi> that theſe Things that ſhould appear as <hi>Thorns in their Eyes,</hi> are ſo ſwarming in them.</p>
               <p>Filthly. In <hi>Thorns</hi> we ſee <hi>Diſappointments</hi> to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</hi> Tis a Proverb for thoſe that are. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, They Reap Thorns.</hi> The World is full of <hi>Diſappointments;</hi> There are <hi>Diſappointments</hi> that vex us, in all the Concerns, all the Affairs, and all the <hi>Expectations</hi> of <hi>This World.</hi> Whence are theſe <hi>Diſappointments?</hi> They are our <hi>worldly Luſts,</hi> which procure them unto us. Tis <hi>They,</hi> which
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002905_0063_0FE69161DE22AD08"/>upon a <hi>Recollection</hi> brings us to that; Eccl. I. 2. <hi>Vanity of Vanities, Vanity of Vanities, All is Vanity.</hi> Our <hi>worldly Luſts</hi> impoſe upon us, what our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR calls, <hi>The deceitfulneſs of Riches.</hi> They promiſe us a notable <hi>Harveſt</hi> of Satisfaction, from this and that Undertaking or Fruition. But they <hi>Deceive</hi> us; To our <hi>Vexation,</hi> we are <hi>Diſappointed</hi> of the promiſed <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> The Things from which we hoped it, are <hi>Things that ſatisfy not;</hi> There are <hi>Thorns</hi> in the <hi>Harveſt;</hi> They make up the <hi>Harveſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly; <hi>Thorns</hi> are an <hi>Obſtruction</hi> to <hi>Fruitfulneſs;</hi> The Soil that is filled with them, <hi>yields no Fruit:</hi> The <hi>Thorns</hi> do ſuck out the Moiſture, which the more deſirable <hi>Seed</hi> called for. You are aware who ſaid, <hi>Sow not among Thorns.</hi> Our <hi>worldly Luſts</hi> do us this Damage; They render our <hi>Hearts</hi> a Soyl, which the Good <hi>Seed</hi> of the Goſpel, is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfully</hi> caſt upon. Our <hi>worldly Luſts</hi> engroſs that <hi>Conſideration,</hi> which the Goſpel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST ſhould be entertained withal. It is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; 1 Pet.

               <p>O you that <hi>ſerve diverſe Luſts;</hi> How can you bear to have ſuch <hi>Thorns</hi> continually haraſſing of you? Methinks, we ſhould be as uneaſy as they that <hi>ſit upon Thorns,</hi> or as they that lie down on a <hi>Bed of Thorns,</hi> till we are delivered from the <hi>Luſts</hi> of <hi>Indwelling Sin.</hi> O <hi>wretched ones that we are; who ſhall deliver us?</hi>

II. Theſe <hi>Luſts</hi> of Men towards the Things of <hi>This World,</hi> are the Things by which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD falling on the Souls of Men, is rendred <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</hi> It is a rare thing for them that are much concerned in and for the Things of <hi>This World,</hi> or <hi>worldly-minded</hi> ones, to get much Good by the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD. The Things of <hi>This World,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder People from <hi>Hearing</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD. The Opportunities for <hi>Hearing,</hi> eſpecially at the <hi>Lectures,</hi> which are ſet up, that they may not go too many Days together without the <hi>Bread,</hi> which <hi>ſtrengthens the Heart of Man,</hi> theſe are ſhamefully neglected, becauſe like <hi>Martha,</hi> we are <hi>careful and troubled about may things.</hi> Or, Theſe Things hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der People from <hi>Heeding</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, when they <hi>Hear</hi> it. GOD may ſay of them, <hi>They ſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee as my People, and they hear thy words; but their Heart goeth after their Covetouſneſs.</hi> Or, Theſe Things hinder People from <hi>Doing</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, tho' they <hi>Heed</hi> it. So, <hi>They ihat will be Rich, fall into Temptation, and are drowned in Perdition.</hi> But, where is the Fault of all this? It is not in the <hi>Things</hi> themſelves: The Things of <hi>This World</hi> are <hi>Good Things,</hi> when they be not abuſed. No; The Fault is in thoſe <hi>Luſts,</hi> by which our Hearts are Inordinately carried out after theſe Things. Our SAVIOUR having rank'd the <hi>Thorns</hi> into Three Claſſes, <hi>The Cares of this World,</hi> and <hi>The Deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Riches,</hi> and, <hi>The Luſts of other Things,</hi> I find an Invitation to rank my Hearers, into Three Orders, and bring the Solemn Warnings of GOD unto them.</p>

Firſt. There are <hi>Worldly Luſts,</hi> more peculiar to <hi>Poor People,</hi> which hinder the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD from having a good Effect, eſpecially upon that fort of People. The <hi>Cares</hi> that lie upon the Hearts of theſe, are like <hi>Thorns</hi> painfully <hi>piercing</hi> of them; and theſe <hi>Cares</hi> confound them. There is a <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Care</hi> about the Things of this World, which is a <hi>Lawful Care.</hi> But then, there is an <hi>Exceſſive,</hi> a <hi>Diſtracting,</hi> an <hi>Unlawful Care, How to Live,</hi> by which the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>poor People</hi> eſpecially, are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered, and their Souls endangered. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD obliges Men to a <hi>Great Care</hi> on that <hi>Great Point, What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> But the <hi>Care</hi> of <hi>This World,</hi> confines their Thoughts unto that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion; Matth.

The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD lies by <hi>Unread,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Care</hi> of <hi>This World</hi> makes them ſay, <hi>I am not at Leiſure.</hi> The <hi>Firſt and Great Commandment</hi> of the Goſpel, is; To <hi>Believe</hi> on a Glorious CHRIST, and carry a diſtreſſed Soul unto him, with a Recognition of all his <hi>Offices.</hi> Now, if many an one ſhould be asked; <hi>Haſt thou

This <hi>Care</hi> keeps People from going thro' ſuch a <hi>Proceſs of Repentance,</hi> as one would think every one that has any Thoughts of <hi>Death,</hi> muſt immediately come into: The <hi>Care</hi> of living in <hi>This World,</hi> ſo takes them up, and ſo takes them off, that from Day to Day they leave undone, what every <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man</hi> in his Wits would immediately do. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD calls Men to uphold <hi>ſecret Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with GOD, in a <hi>Religious Retirement;</hi> and have a Morning and Evening <hi>Sacrifice</hi> alſo with their Families. But what keeps them from the doing of the Things that are of ſo much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the good of their Souls? 'Tis the <hi>Care</hi> of <hi>This World.</hi> For, ſay they, <hi>We are ſo poor that we can't ſpare the Time from our Buſineſs for the Exerciſes of Religion.</hi> Yea, The <hi>Care of This World</hi> cauſes <hi>Poor People</hi> to do thoſe things, which are <hi>Forbidden</hi> in the Word of GOD, and for <hi>which the wrath of GOD comes on the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> You read of ſuch a thing as That; Prov.

Secondly. There are <hi>worldly Luſts</hi> more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to <hi>Rich People,</hi> which hinder the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD from having a good Effect, eſpecially upon that ſort of People. The <hi>Riches</hi> which fill the Hearts of theſe, tho' they afford no better nor longer Enjoyments than the <hi>Crackling of Thorns under a Pot;</hi> yet theſe <hi>Riches</hi> are moſt Bewitching Things unto them. Awful, Awful is the Warning, which the Lord who has the <hi>Keys of Heaven</hi> in his Hand, has given unto us; Mat. XIX. 23. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, That a Rich Man ſhall hardly Enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Even ſo; A <hi>Rich Man</hi> will <hi>hardly</hi> be affected with the Miſeries of an <hi>Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> Soul, of which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, is a <hi>Roll filled with Lamentation and Mourning, and Wo.</hi> A <hi>Rich Man</hi> will <hi>hardly</hi> Abſtain from thoſe <hi>Liberties,</hi> of which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD requires our <hi>Fleſh</hi> to bear ſome Abridgments and Abatements.

Our Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> never Preach'd more unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, than when he had an Auditory of <hi>Rich Folks,</hi> to Preach the <hi>Word</hi> unto. <hi>Rich Folks</hi> have many <hi>Employments,</hi> many <hi>Diverſions;</hi> If the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD come unto them they ſay like that <hi>Unhappy</hi> Man, <hi>I will hear thee at a more convenient ſeaſon. Rich Folks</hi> have <hi>High Spirits;</hi> They are too ready to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, when it is brought unto them; like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his Voice? Rich Folks</hi> have much of a <hi>Temporal Happineſs</hi> in their hands. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD urges them, to nothing ſo much, as to ſeek after a <hi>Eternal Happineſs.</hi> 'Tis to little purpoſe;

'Tis from what we are here told of, <hi>The Deceitfulneſs of Riches. Riches</hi> tell us, That they will <hi>Defend</hi> us from all Inconveniencies. But they <hi>Deceive</hi> us; They ſignify nothing to deliver thoſe that have them, in <hi>the Day of the wrath of the Lord.</hi> They

Riches</hi> tells us, That they will <hi>ſtay</hi> with us. But they <hi>Deceive</hi> us; They are uſually put into the <hi>Bag with Holes,</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſpeaks of. They <hi>take to themſelves Wings,</hi> and <hi>flee away towards Heaven;</hi> T'were well if the <hi>Hearts</hi> which we ſett upon them did ſo. Tho' we are forewarn'd, that theſe <hi>Riches</hi> will <hi>Cheat</hi> us, yet we believe the <hi>Cheat:</hi> And our <hi>Believing</hi> of the <hi>Cheat,</hi> is the <hi>undoing</hi> of our Soul, and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating</hi> of all the <hi>Good,</hi> that the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD would, if <hi>That</hi> were Believed as it ſhould be, do unto us. One thing more, 'Tis a Thing which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD exceedingly demands of us: and it is a <hi>Frame</hi> which Heaven exceedingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves in the Children of Men; yea, They who have it not, are the <hi>Covetous</hi> whom the <hi>Lord Abhors:</hi> A continual <hi>Dependence</hi> on GOD, and on His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, Favourable, Perpetual <hi>Providence.</hi> There is a Venom in <hi>Riches,</hi> diſpoſing our depraved Hearts, to caſt off their <hi>Dependence</hi> on GOD, and betray them into a vile Imagination, as if, at leaſt, for the ſupply of their more common wants, <hi>They can do well enough without Him.</hi> If they that have their Hearts Inſatiably ſet upon the heaping up of <hi>Riches,</hi> would ſearch their own Hearts, they would find This lying at the Bottom of their <hi>Eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit;</hi> A ſecret Inclination to be Releaſed from their <hi>Dependence</hi> on the <hi>living</hi> GOD, and have a <hi>Dunghil</hi> GOD of their own, at their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

How wretchedly is his <hi>Word</hi> loſt upon you!</p>
               <p>Thirdly; There are many <hi>Luſts</hi> incident unto all ſorts of People, thro' which it is that the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD comes to be without a good Effect upon them: Even thoſe which our SAVIOUR calls, <hi>The Luſts of other things.</hi> But, what <hi>Luſts</hi> are theſe? There are the <hi>Luſts</hi> of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> that hinder Men from hearkening to the <hi>pleaſant Word</hi> of GOD; A <hi>Word ſweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-Comb.</hi> We read in Luk. VIII. 14. of being, <hi>Choked with the pleaſures of this Life, and bringing of no Fruit unto perfection.</hi> The ways recommended in the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, are <hi>pleaſant ways.</hi> But the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> do prejudice and indiſpoſe Men, to thoſe <hi>Narrow ways. Hearts</hi> that are <hi>fat as Greaſe</hi> with the <hi>Pleaſures of ſenſe,</hi> will be utterly <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> of every thing that the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD brings unto them. An <hi>Herod,</hi> will <hi>fear</hi> a <hi>Righteous</hi> and an <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again; There are the <hi>Luſts</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> that hinder Men from <hi>Honouring</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, as they ought to do. Hence our Lord ſaid; Joh. V. 44. <hi>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour that
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002905_0071_0FE69170561624F0"/>cometh from GOD only?</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD calls for all poſſible <hi>Honours</hi> to be paid unto the <hi>Son</hi> of GOD; Yea, That <hi>we Honour the Son as we Honour the Father.</hi> But it exacts many things from us, which according to our Carnal Notions of the matter, we fancy our <hi>Honours</hi> may be impaired by our Submiſſion to. This <hi>Pride</hi> makes Men <hi>aſhamed</hi> of <hi>Confeſſing</hi> a CHRIST <hi>before Men</hi> as the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD bids us to do. It <hi>hardens</hi> our Hearts: and makes us like thoſe <hi>Proud Men</hi> who told the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, That <hi>they would not hearken to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more; The Apoſtle has decided it; Jam. IV. 1. <hi>Whence come Wars and Fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your Luſts?</hi> There are the <hi>Luſts</hi> of <hi>Contention</hi> often getting Head among them that hear the Word of GOD: But then, The <hi>Contentions</hi> will <hi>not obey the Truth.</hi> No, but upon the <hi>Envying and Strife</hi> among them, there follows <hi>Confuſion and every Evil work.</hi> Very fitly indeed may theſ <hi>Luſts</hi> be called, <hi>Thorns:</hi> For, by theſe <hi>Luſts</hi> People keep ſhamefully <hi>Tearing</hi> and <hi>Scratching</hi> one another. Now, 'tis aſtoniſhing to to think, how much the <hi>Succeſs of the Goſpel</hi> is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, where a <hi>Spirit of Contention</hi> is got among a People. <hi>Satan</hi> knows what he does, when he throws in <hi>Bones of Contention</hi> among a People, which embroil them, and enrage them. Inſtead of getting the <hi>Good</hi> that ſhould be gotten by the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, their Thought and their Time, is taken up in doing of <hi>Hurt</hi> unto one another. The <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD becomes as an <hi>Houſe haunted with Evil Spirits.</hi> GOD withdraws from his <hi>Houſe;</hi> yea, <hi>Abhors the Sanctuarp,</hi> and goes far from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:002905_0072_0FE6917197043A28"/>
The <hi>Grieved Spirit</hi> of GOD grievouſly witholds His Influences from His Ordinances there. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is meerly thrown away, among ſuch a <hi>Thorny People.</hi> Indeed, Our SAVIOUR once appeared in a <hi>Thorn-Buſh.</hi> But, When a Church once becomes a <hi>Thorn-Buſh,</hi> embaraſſed with <hi>Contention,</hi> our Lord JESUS CHRIST will grant little appearance of himſelf, to bleſs his <hi>Word</hi> for the good of the People there.

               <p>But I may not leave this <hi>Thorny Ground</hi> without ſome Eſſays of Cultivation upon it. There are two Eſſays to be made.</p>

                  <hi>Lord, who hath Believed?</hi> The complaint may be renew'd at this Day.
<q>
                     <hi>Lord, How few</hi> do, <hi>Turn</hi> and <hi>Live</hi> unto GOD and <hi>Cleanſe their ways</hi> by <hi>taking Heed according to his Word?

                  </q> Now, what is the Cauſe of this?

               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Prayer,</hi> our <hi>Prayer,</hi> unto our GOD; and with an Eye unto a SAVIOUR, who once wore a <hi>Crown of Thorns</hi> for us; This is the Firſt Thing that is called for. Beg it of Him, That for the ſake of <hi>thoſe Thorns,</hi> you may be delivered from theſe <hi>Thorns.</hi> Cry to Him; <hi>Lord, Save me from the Luſts of a worldly Heart! Lord, Let not the Things of this World, hinder the good Effects of thy Word upon us!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But more particularly pray, That the <hi>Thorns</hi> of <hi>Affliction,</hi> by which <hi>this World</hi> is Embittered, may be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> for our being thereby made more Conformable to the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD. Our GOD is <hi>Teaching us by the Thorns of the Wilderneſs,</hi> what it is to <hi>Sin</hi> againſt Him. The Language of theſe <hi>Thorns</hi> is, <hi>Know and ſee, that it is an evil Thing, and a bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy GOD.</hi> Let theſe <hi>Thorns</hi> awaken us to mourn for our <hi>Sin;</hi> and, let it <hi>reach to our Heart,</hi> when we feel what our <hi>Way</hi> and our <hi>Doings</hi> have <hi>procured</hi> unto us. By our Diſtreſſes and our Confinements, our GOD is <hi>Hedging up our way with Thorns.</hi> Let us not be <hi>Angry</hi> at the <hi>Hedge,</hi> but even <hi>Thankful</hi> for it; And <hi>prick'd</hi> by the <hi>Thorns,</hi> let <hi>All the Fruit be, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our Sin,</hi> and bring us to ſay, <hi>I will not offend any more.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Good Hearers of the Goſpel, tho' they are not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Fruitful, yet they all bring forth ſome good Fruit; Yea, they both Increaſe and Perſiſt in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo.</hi>

               <p>'Tis a <hi>Bread of Propoſitions,</hi> that is now to be ſet. before you on the <hi>Table</hi> in the Houſe of our GOD. The <hi>Bread</hi> made, of the <hi>Corn</hi> in the <hi>Good Ground,</hi> is to be Exhibited in the enſuing <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. There are ſome <hi>Good Hearers,</hi> among thoſe whom the <hi>Good Seed</hi> of the Goſpel falls upon. It would be ſad indeed if it ſhould not be ſo! Theſe <hi>Good Hearers</hi> are they of whom our SAVIOUR ſays, Luk. VIII. 15. They have a <hi>Good Heart</hi> in the <hi>Hearing</hi> of it. It were to be <hi>wiſhed,</hi> that <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> which has the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, were <hi>Good Ground.</hi> But this is a Thing more to be <hi>wiſhed</hi> for, than to be <hi>hoped</hi> for. However, ſome of the <hi>Ground</hi> is <hi>Good.</hi> And, <hi>How comes this to paſs?</hi> Truly, The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, falls not upon any <hi>Heart</hi> that is <hi>Good</hi> before the <hi>Word</hi> firſt falls upon it. There is no <hi>Good Heart</hi> in any Hearer of the <hi>Word,</hi> until the <hi>Word</hi> itſelf makes it ſo. <hi>Wo</hi> would be unto us, we ſhould be Damned unto <hi>Eternal</hi> Wickedneſs and Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002905_0081_0FE6917FFA588DD0"/>if the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD ſhould never <hi>do Good</hi> unto us, until we bring a <hi>Good Heart</hi> unto it. Every Man has in him, <hi>An Evil Heart of Unbelief depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the living GOD;</hi> And no Man can give unto himſelf a <hi>Better Heart;</hi> Such and none but ſuch, an <hi>Heart</hi> it is, that we do <hi>at firſt</hi> bring unto the <hi>Good Word</hi> of our GOD. We read, Mic. II. 7. <hi>Do not my Words do good unto him that walks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly?</hi> If the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD ſhould never <hi>do Good</hi> unto any, until they do <hi>walk uprightly,</hi> it would never <hi>do Good</hi> unto any at all! But it <hi>firſt of all</hi> does this <hi>Good</hi> unto us; It makes us <hi>upright,</hi> thro' a <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Heart</hi> produced in us; and it Inclines us and Excites us to <hi>walk uprightly;</hi> And <hi>Then</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows all the other <hi>Good,</hi> which is received from it by them that <hi>walk uprightly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if we Enquire, What are the Characters of a <hi>Good Heart</hi> under the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, Behold, our SAVIOUR himſelf will ſoon ſatisfy that Enquiry.</p>
               <p>Firſt. A <hi>Good Heart</hi> hearing the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, hears it with <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Mat. XIII. 23. <hi>He that received Seed into the good Ground, is he that heareth the Word, and underſtandeth it.</hi> When the Diſciples of our Lord, heard his <hi>Word</hi> with a <hi>Good Heart, He ſaid unto them, Have ye underſtood all thoſe things? They ſay unto Him, Yea, Lord.</hi> We are truly told; Prov. XIX. 2. <hi>That the Soul be without Knowledge, it is not good.</hi> Be ſure, It is not a <hi>good Heart,</hi> that is <hi>without the Knowledge</hi> of thoſe Things, which <hi>to know, is Life Eternal.</hi> When you hear, <hi>who</hi> your SAVIOUR is; What are your <hi>Wants</hi> of Him; What He <hi>has done</hi> for us; What He <hi>will do</hi> for us; And, what
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:002905_0082_0FE6918166E250B0"/>He will have <hi>to be done</hi> by us; Then, as <hi>Philip</hi> asked the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Treaſurer, <hi>Underſtandeſt thou what thou Readeſt?</hi> Thus we are to ask ourſelves, <hi>Do I underſtand what I hear?</hi> If we don't <hi>underſtand</hi> ſomething of thoſe points, our <hi>Ignorance</hi> will prove <hi>the Mother of Deſtruction</hi> unto us. Yea, Being a <hi>People of no underſtanding,</hi> He that <hi>made us will not have Mercy on us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, Secondly; A <hi>Good Heart</hi> hearing the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, hears it with <hi>Affection.</hi> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Mat. IV. 20. <hi>They Hear the Word and Receive it.</hi> We then hear the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD with a <hi>Good Heart,</hi> when we give a good <hi>Reception</hi> to it. A good <hi>Reception</hi> to it, implies a good <hi>Affection</hi> to it. It is the mark of a <hi>Good Heart,</hi> when the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is a <hi>Good Word</hi> unto it. Such a <hi>Good Heart</hi> will ſay; Iſa. XXXIX. 8. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Deſire</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Heart</hi> (which is <hi>only good</hi>) runs out in ſuch Terms as thoſe, <hi>Lord, Thou art Good, and thou doſt Good; O Teach me thy Statutes.</hi> A <hi>Good Heart,</hi> hearing the <hi>Commandments</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> ſays, <hi>This Word is very pure, and therefore, O Lord, thy Servant loveth it.</hi> Hearing the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> it ſays, <hi>I rejoyce in theſe Teſtimonies more than in all Riches.</hi> Hearing the <hi>Threatenings</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> it ſays, <hi>Lord, I am afraid of theſe Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More than this; Thirdly. A <hi>Good Heart</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, hears it with <hi>Retention.</hi> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Luk. VIII. 15. <hi>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard the Word, they keep it.</hi> It is a <hi>Good Heart,</hi> in which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, is <hi>kept,</hi> as it forever deſerves to be; and laid up, as the <hi>Book of the Law</hi> was in the <hi>Ark</hi> of old. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD muſt
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002905_0083_0FE691E9C02F39D8"/>be laid up, as an Invaluable <hi>Treaſure</hi> there. A Man of a <hi>good Heart,</hi> may ſay, with Him; Pſal. CXIX. 11. <hi>I have hid thy word in my Heart.</hi> In a <hi>good Heart,</hi> the <hi>Memory</hi> becomes a <hi>Store-houſe</hi> for the <hi>word</hi> of GOD. The <hi>Evangelized</hi> Soul, ſays, <hi>I will not forget thy word;</hi> and it <hi>gives earneſt heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the things which it hears, leſt at any time it may let them ſlip;</hi> and loſe them, in their <hi>leaking</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and Finally. What is a <hi>good Heart,</hi> but an <hi>honeſt Heart?</hi> So tis explained; Luk. VIII. 15. <hi>An honeſt and a good Heart.</hi> The Term <hi>Honeſt,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>Beautiful.</hi> There is a <hi>Beauty</hi> in <hi>Religion;</hi> and particularly thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein we deal Juſtly, Kindly, and Fairly with our Neighbours; Theſe have a <hi>Beauty</hi> in them. An <hi>Heart</hi> ſincerely Religious, is an <hi>Honeſt,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Beautiful Heart.</hi> The Glorious GOD <hi>looks down from Heaven, and beholds from the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Holineſs and of his Glory,</hi> and with Delight He ſees His own <hi>Beautiful Image</hi> upon it. But moſt particularly, Tis an <hi>Heart</hi> loth to wrong or hurt any Man in the World, and an <hi>Heart</hi> ſet upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Good that ever he can, to all that are about us. This is a <hi>Good Heart,</hi> and there is that <hi>Beauty</hi> in ſuch an <hi>Heart,</hi> that all the World will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to call <hi>Good.</hi> We are to have ſuch an <hi>Heart</hi> as this, in <hi>hearing</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of our GOD.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>What ſhall I do to get ſuch an Heart?</hi> The Anſwer is, Come to the <hi>Word</hi> For ſuch an <hi>Heart,</hi> when you cannot come <hi>with</hi> it. And therewithal, come to the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> who is the Giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſuch an <hi>Heart.</hi> Chriſtian, Addreſs thy SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, with ſuch a Petition as That; Pſal. LI. 10.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002905_0084_0FE691818768F518"/>
                  <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O GOD.</hi> Thy SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR demands, <hi>Give me thy Heart.</hi> Bring it unto Him, and beg of Him, <hi>O my SAVIOUR, My Heart is a Blind Heart, and a Baſe Heart, and an Heart that is deſperately wicked; But ſuch an Heart as it is, I humbly lay it before thee. Oh! Do thou take it, and make a good Heart of it, and then I ſhall in an acceptable manner give my Heart unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. All the <hi>Good Hearers</hi> of the Goſpel, are <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> ones. There will be upon every <hi>Good Hearer</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> thoſe Laudable Things, wherein it may be ſaid, He <hi>bears Fruit.</hi> If a Man ſit under the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, and bring forth no <hi>Fruit</hi> of it, what ſort of a <hi>Ground</hi> is that Man? We are told, Heb. VI. 8. <hi>It is Rejected, nigh unto Curſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion here to be thought upon, is; <hi>What is that Fruit, by which the Good Hearers of the Goſpel, are diſtinguiſhed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fruit,</hi> in general, is, The <hi>Good Effect</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel upon us. Of ſome we read, Col. I. 6. <hi>The Word of the Truth of the Goſpel brings forth Fruit in them.</hi> This is, when we Glorify GOD our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, with ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Repentance,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Purity,</hi> as the Goſpel does oblige us to. A <hi>Good Hearer</hi> of the Goſpel, brings forth ſuch <hi>Fruit</hi> as This; That the <hi>Goſpel of the Grace of God</hi> effectually <hi>teaches</hi> him to <hi>deny all Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and live Godlily, and Soberly, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly in this preſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O our Hearers; <hi>Hearken and Behold!</hi> The <hi>Good Fruit,</hi> expected from the <hi>Good Seed,</hi> which in your hearing the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD there is caſt upon you, muſt be ſeen in ſuch Things as theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:002905_0085_0FE6918866100C90"/>
There muſt be this <hi>Good Fruit</hi> of what you <hi>hear;</hi> That you muſt carry your periſhing Souls unto your Mighty and Only SAVIOUR, Beſeeching of Him, and Relying on Him, to <hi>Reconcile</hi> you unto GOD: Conſenting, That He ſhould by His infinite <hi>Merit</hi> bring you into <hi>Peace</hi> with GOD, and by His Almighty <hi>Spirit</hi> work in you that which is <hi>well pleaſing in the ſight of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There muſt be this <hi>Good Fruit</hi> of what you <hi>hear;</hi> That every Thing which appears to the <hi>Light of GOD</hi> within you, an Evil Thing, muſt be Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to you: You muſt <hi>Abhor</hi> it, <hi>Avoid</hi> it, wiſh and ſeek to be delivered from it: Count a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from it, preferrible to all the Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things of this World.</p>
               <p>There muſt be this <hi>Good Fruit</hi> of what you <hi>hear;</hi> That it muſt be your main Intention to Render and Procure <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> to GOD; and the <hi>Service</hi> of GOD muſt be the chief <hi>End</hi> of your <hi>Actions,</hi> the chief <hi>Sweet</hi> of your <hi>Enjoyments.</hi> You muſt behave yourſelves as having the <hi>Eye</hi> of GOD always upon you: <hi>Do Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>love Mercy,</hi> and <hi>walk humbly with your GOD:</hi> Abound in <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to GOD, and in <hi>Benignities</hi> to Men. Every Day <hi>be in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long;</hi> Every where <hi>do as you would be done unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is <hi>Good Fruit.</hi> O Soul having ſuch <hi>Fruit</hi> as this found upon thee, <hi>Come near</hi> unto thy SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, and receive a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> from Him; and hear Him ſaying, <hi>See, the Smell of this fruitful Soul, is as the Smell of a Field which the Lord hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Syrs, You can't be owned as <hi>Good Hearers</hi> of the Goſpel, if you are not the <hi>Better</hi> for it; more <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:002905_0086_0FE691E9DB807760"/>with GOD by it; more <hi>Conformed</hi> to CHRIST by it; made the more <hi>meet for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Tho' all the <hi>Good Hearers</hi> of the Goſpel, muſt be <hi>Really Fruitful,</hi> yet they are not <hi>Equally</hi> ſo. We read, <hi>They bring forth, ſome Thirty fold, ſome Sixty, ſome an Hundred.</hi> Our SAVIOUR made His Alluſion to the <hi>Grain</hi> then moſt uſual in that Countrey. For tho' <hi>Wheat,</hi> which is the <hi>Beſt Grain,</hi> and affords the <hi>Beſt Bread,</hi> for the Sons of Men, and which by an obſervable Providence of GOD, grows in almoſt all Climates! Will, one Buſhel of it, ſometimes yield, One <hi>hundred and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> yet, I ſuppoſe, the ordinary Increaſe is not above an <hi>Hundred.</hi> Indeed, of our <hi>Indian Corn,</hi> one Grain will produce above a <hi>Thouſand;</hi> and of <hi>Guiny-Corn,</hi> one Grain has been known to produce <hi>Ten Thouſand;</hi> but in <hi>Wheat</hi> it is not ſo. And in this, every <hi>Soil</hi> is not alike <hi>Fertile;</hi> does not yield <hi>alike.</hi> I take notice, that in one Evangeliſt, there is no mention of the <hi>Thirty fold,</hi> and the <hi>Sixty fold</hi> produce. It is only ſaid, Luk. VIII. 8. <hi>The Good Ground bare Fruit an Hundred fold.</hi> This may be to note, That tho' this <hi>Uttermoſt Fruitfulneſs,</hi> be not the <hi>Attainment,</hi> yet it is the <hi>Endeavour</hi> of every Godly Man: And our Good GOD makes a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conſtruction of the <hi>Endeavour,</hi> and <hi>Accepts the willing Mind.</hi> The <hi>Endeavour</hi> of every Godly Man, in Hearing the <hi>Word,</hi> is to bring forth as much <hi>Fruit,</hi> as the moſt <hi>Fruitful Saint</hi> that ever lived. He does not <hi>ſtint</hi> himſelf, as to the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> upon him. He can ſay of the <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Fruitfulneſs;</hi> as in Phil. III. 14. <hi>I preſs toward
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002905_0087_0FE691EB98AE3108"/>the Mark.</hi> Yea, But this, even the <hi>Hundred fold,</hi> is not the <hi>Attainment</hi> of every Godly Man. There is as much Difference between the <hi>Fruits</hi> found in the <hi>Good Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> as between <hi>Thirty</hi> and an <hi>Hundred.</hi> Some good Men are not one Third part ſo <hi>Fruitful</hi> as others are. As we read, 1 Cor. XV. 41. <hi>One Star differs from another Star in Glory:</hi> So, <hi>One Saint</hi> alſo differs from <hi>another Saint</hi> in <hi>Glory.</hi> 'Tis our <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> that is our <hi>Glory.</hi> Our <hi>David</hi> has many <hi>Worthies;</hi> But there is a <hi>Firſt Three,</hi> which all do not come up unto.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the <hi>Good Seed</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> is not <hi>Alike</hi> diſpenſed among the People of GOD. The <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> in ſome Churches, are adminiſtred with more <hi>Light,</hi> and with more <hi>Warmth,</hi> and with more Heavenly Operations than they are in others. It may be Expected, that the <hi>Fruit</hi> will be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. And yet, among thoſe who enjoy the ſame Adminiſtrations, all the truly <hi>Pious</hi> do not bear <hi>Fruit</hi> in a like proportion; and are not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual <hi>Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD it ſelf, aſſures and aſſigns a <hi>Difference,</hi> among them that are the <hi>Good Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi> Thus we find ſeveral Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the <hi>School</hi> of our SAVIOUR. We find, 1. Joh. II. 13. <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Young Men,</hi> and <hi>little Children;</hi> We find, 1. Cor. III. 1. Some that are <hi>Spiritual;</hi> others that are <hi>Carnal,</hi> and <hi>Babes in Chriſt.</hi> We find, Rom. XV. 1. Some that are <hi>Strong;</hi> others that are <hi>Weak,</hi> and have their <hi>Infirmities.</hi> Hence we find, that ſome <hi>Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> are <hi>perfect</hi> ones, in compariſon of others that yet are not in a ſtate of Wickedneſs. We read, Jam. III. 2. <hi>If any Man offend not in Word, the ſame is a perfect
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002905_0088_0FE691EBB56D75B0"/>Man.</hi> It means not, that he is <hi>Abſolutely perfect,</hi> but that he is in the <hi>Higheſt Form</hi> of Chriſtianity. The Man who rarely, if ever, lets fall a <hi>Word,</hi> that another Man may have cauſe to blame him for, is this <hi>perfect Man.</hi> Yea, we find ſome that are <hi>None-ſuch</hi> ones; and are ſo applauded, <hi>Many have done virtuouſly, but thou excelleſt them all.</hi> So we read of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2. King. XVIII. 5. <hi>There was none like him.</hi> So we read of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2. King. XXIII. <hi>Like unto him there was none.</hi> So we read of <hi>Timothy;</hi> Phil. II. 20. <hi>No Man like-minded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, In the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> all the <hi>Really Fruitful,</hi> are not <hi>equally</hi> ſo. No; We read, Heb. V. 12. Of ſome, that may be <hi>Teachers;</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that need one to <hi>Teach</hi> them the <hi>firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of the <hi>Oracles of GOD:</hi> Of ſome that are <hi>of full age,</hi> and have <hi>ſtrong Meat belonging</hi> unto them; and of others that <hi>uſe Milk,</hi> and are <hi>unskilful in the Word of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Fruits</hi> of a True <hi>Faith;</hi> ſome can have it ſaid of them, <hi>I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi> To others it may be ſaid, <hi>O ye of little Faith.</hi> In the <hi>Fruits</hi> of a True <hi>Love,</hi> ſome can have it ſaid of them, <hi>They have loved much.</hi> To others it may be ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt not the Firſt Love.</hi> In points of <hi>Holy Living,</hi> it may be ſaid of ſome, <hi>They do that which is Right in the ſight of the Lord, yet not like David;</hi> nor like a Man wholly <hi>after the Heart of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. Some <hi>Good Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> are deſigned of Heaven to be prepared by the <hi>Word,</hi> for Greater, Higher, Nobler <hi>Services</hi> than others are. Of one that was to have a <hi>Charge over Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> we read, Neh. VII. 2. <hi>He was a faithful
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:002905_0089_0FE69188856D2130"/>Man, and feared GOD above many.</hi> GOD intends theſe and thoſe for <hi>ſingular Services;</hi> and ſo he will make them <hi>Fruitful Men above many,</hi> and ſuch as his <hi>Word</hi> ſhall bring to more of his <hi>Fear,</hi> than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are brought unto. There are ſome, who are like <hi>Paul,</hi> to do more for GOD in a way of <hi>Active Obedience,</hi> than others. There are ſome, who are like <hi>Job,</hi> to do more than others for GOD in a way of <hi>Paſſive</hi> Obedience. Now, ſuch as the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD ſhall do but little good upon, theſe will not be furniſhed for what he will have ſome be call'd unto. There muſt be ſome who ſhall <hi>Excell</hi> in <hi>Fruitfulneſs,</hi> becauſe of ſome <hi>Excellent Work,</hi> which GOD has intended for them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. All the truiy <hi>Fruitful Hearers</hi> of the Goſpel, will <hi>Increaſe</hi> in their <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Fruit</hi> on the <hi>Good Ground,</hi> we read, Mar. IV. 8. <hi>It ſprang up, and Increaſed.</hi> That <hi>Obedience</hi> to GOD, which his <hi>Word</hi> brings any Perſon to, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a <hi>growing Obedience,</hi> and they that are in it will <hi>Wax ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> If there be no <hi>Growth</hi> in our PIETY, we may ſuſpect the <hi>Truth</hi> of our PIETY. We find, Joh. XV. 2. <hi>That which bears Fruit,</hi> muſt and will <hi>bring forth more Fruit.</hi> When we firſt begin to bring forth <hi>Fruit</hi> unto GOD, there is as the Apoſtle ſaid unto ſome of old, <hi>Something lacking in it.</hi> But our GOD will have it Proceed, and Improve, and <hi>Increaſe</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Degrees; It ſhall ſee an <hi>Increaſing of GOD.</hi> A <hi>Sincere</hi> and <hi>New-born</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> Child of GOD, will be a <hi>Growing</hi> one. Of the <hi>Faithful</hi> and the <hi>Fruitful,</hi> we read, Hoſ. XIV. 5. <hi>He ſhall grow as the Lilly;</hi> of which they ſay, It <hi>grows</hi> as long as it
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:002905_0090_0FE69189A5E9C3C8"/>
                  <hi>lives.</hi> If we be <hi>Rooted</hi> in Him, who is our GOD and our Life, His Intereſt will be continually <hi>Growing</hi> in us.</p>
               <p>O Hearer of the <hi>Word,</hi> come under a <hi>Trial</hi> that is now to be paſſed upon thee.</p>
               <p>If thou art a <hi>Fruitful Hearer</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> thou wilt be upon the <hi>Increaſe</hi> in thy <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Fruitful Hearer</hi> of the Word, will <hi>Increaſe</hi> in his <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with the Glorious CHRIST, who is the very <hi>Sum</hi> of all the <hi>Word.</hi> It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 2. Pet. III. 18. <hi>Grow in the Grace and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He ſees more and more <hi>Glory</hi> in a lovely JESUS; <hi>How great his Goodneſs and his Beauty!</hi> He has more and more ſenſe of the <hi>Miſeries,</hi> which without a CHRIST he lies expoſed unto: And he becomes more and more ſenſible of the <hi>Alſufficiency</hi> in a CHRIST for the Relief of all his <hi>Miſeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Fruitful Hearer</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> will <hi>Increaſe</hi> in his <hi>Ability</hi> to Repel <hi>Temptations</hi> to Sin againſt the <hi>Word.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> can't ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> prevail upon him, as once he could. He can more <hi>eaſily</hi> Deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of thoſe <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> with which the <hi>Devil</hi> allures Men into Folly. The Variety of <hi>Conditions</hi> thro' which he paſſes; he more <hi>eaſily</hi> bears them, and more <hi>eaſily</hi> avoids the Errors incident unto them, He is leſs enchanted with <hi>Proſperity:</hi> It proves not ſuch a <hi>Dalilah,</hi> to lay him aſleep in ſinful ſtupefactions. He is leſs diſturbed with <hi>Adverſity:</hi> He gains in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> which keeps him from <hi>Fainting</hi> in the <hi>Day</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fruitful Hearer</hi> of the Word, will <hi>Increaſe</hi> in his awful Reſentments of the <hi>Everlaſting Inviſibles,</hi> whereof we are adviſed in the <hi>Word.</hi> He becomes
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:002905_0091_0FE69189C62DECA8"/>more Awed by the Apprehenſion of <hi>GOD knowing the way that he takes.</hi> He becomes more afraid of <hi>Grieving the Holy SPIRIT of GOD,</hi> by any Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. He becomes more lothe to diſoblige the <hi>Good Angels,</hi> and gratify the <hi>Evil</hi> ones, by any Miſbehaviours. He is more Swayed by the Hopes of the great Recompence, in the <hi>ſpiritual Bleſſings</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly places;</hi> and he is more affected with <hi>the Terror of the Lord;</hi> a <hi>Deſtruction from GOD</hi> is more of a <hi>Terror</hi> unto him.</p>
               <p>Finally. A <hi>Fruitful Hearer</hi> of the Word, will <hi>Increaſe</hi> in the <hi>Conformity</hi> of his whole <hi>Converſation</hi> to the <hi>Word.</hi> He becomes more full of <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on <hi>Things pertaining to the Kingdom of GOD:</hi> More frequent, and more fervent in <hi>Supplications</hi> to the <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> He becomes a greater <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer;</hi> and more abounding in the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which <hi>GOD is well-pleaſed withal.</hi> He makes notable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, in a <hi>Cleanſing from all Filthineſs of the Fleſh and of the Spirit;</hi> and carrying on <hi>Holineſs</hi> towards <hi>Perfection in the fear of GOD.</hi> The <hi>Sanctification</hi> of his <hi>whole,</hi> ever. <hi>Spirit, and Soul, and Body,</hi> is carried on, thro' <hi>the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hearken, <hi>O Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word:</hi> A <hi>Non-profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> under the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD; Oh! 'Twould be a Black Token of <hi>Death</hi> upon you!</p>
               <p n="5">V. We cannot be <hi>Fruitful Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> except we alſo <hi>perſiſt</hi> in our <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi> Of the Hearers who are <hi>Good Ground,</hi> we read; Luk. VIII. 15. <hi>They bring forth Fruit with Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, what is intended in this <hi>Patience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt; There is no <hi>Fruitful Hearer</hi> of the Word, but what ſhall be <hi>Tried</hi> by ſome <hi>Affliction,</hi> whether he will continue to bring forth <hi>Fruit,</hi> or no; And
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:002905_0092_0FE691F30AC6F8E0"/>be <hi>Tried</hi> what <hi>Fruit</hi> it is, that he does bring forth unto GOD. There is no Diſciple of the Lord who died on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> but what has a <hi>Croſs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him. The firſt <hi>Maxim</hi> that our Lord lays down for every Diſciple, is, Mat. XVI. 24. <hi>Let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me. Patience</hi> is a Vertue diſpoſing us to Love, and Serve, and Obey, our SAVIOUR under the <hi>Croſs.</hi> There is no <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> without ſome <hi>Affliction:</hi> Indeed, with the Choſen of GOD, the more <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> the more <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi> The Name of the Believer, is <hi>Ephraim;</hi> Inaſmuch as GOD makes him <hi>Fruitful in the Land of his Affliction.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are to <hi>Run with Patience,</hi> thro' all that is <hi>before us.</hi> Look for it, O Believer; Look for <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi> to try thy <hi>Patience.</hi> And let this be taken, as one Intimation here doubtleſs given by our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR; A Man may not be eſteemed a <hi>Fruitful</hi> Man, until he be a <hi>Patient</hi> one. You muſt be People <hi>of Sorrows and acquainted with Griefs:</hi> You muſt meet with <hi>Bereavements,</hi> meet with <hi>Injuries,</hi> meet with <hi>Reproaches:</hi> As being under a <hi>Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> you muſt ſuffer one Dolorous <hi>Pang</hi> after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuffer ſuch a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of them, that one ſhall no ſooner be a little over, but another will come on; until the <hi>Mercyſtroke</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> open an Outgate for you. Now, How do you <hi>Bear</hi> theſe Things? If you Bear them with <hi>Patience,</hi> then you <hi>Bear Fruit with Patience.</hi> Man, If thou haſt a <hi>Froward</hi> Soul, thou haſt not a <hi>Fruitful</hi> one!</p>
               <p>Secondly. Nor was any one ever a <hi>Fruitful Hearer</hi> of the Word, but ſuch as did continue to bring forth <hi>Fruit</hi> unto the end. As we are told, Pſal. XCII. 11. <hi>They ſhall ſtill bring forth Fruit in
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:002905_0093_0FE69191C550A820"/>old Age.</hi> Even ſo, <hi>They ſhall ſtill bring forth Fruit until the very Period of their Lives.</hi> The <hi>Harveſt</hi> of that <hi>Fruit</hi> which we are to yield, will not come, until the World to come. With <hi>Patience</hi> then, we muſt hold on, and hold out, yielding <hi>Fruit</hi> as long as we are in this World. <hi>Perſeverance; Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance!</hi> This is that <hi>Patience,</hi> with which we are to <hi>bring forth Fruit</hi> unto GOD. An <hi>Apoſtate</hi> Sinner, was always an <hi>Unfruitful</hi> Sinner. The <hi>Good Fruits</hi> of ſuch an one, were never any other than meer <hi>Shows</hi> of Good. Soul, Haſt thou Begun to be <hi>Fruitful?</hi> O Tremble at a <hi>Degeneracy</hi> from hopeful Beginnings. If thy <hi>Goodneſs</hi> be what ſoon <hi>paſſeth away,</hi> the Glorious GOD, as in a Deliberation what Vengeance to take upon it, ſays, <hi>What ſhall I do unto thee? What ſhall I do unto thee?</hi> It is a Terrible Thing that He will <hi>do unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, We are come to, <hi>The Concluſion of the Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are now determined, What is the <hi>Good Soil,</hi> and that which alone may look for <hi>Good,</hi> and will come to <hi>Good,</hi> and which <hi>brings forth Fruits meet</hi> for the Cultivation uſed upon it, and <hi>receiveth Bleſſing from GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Deſirable Thing</hi> whereto you are now to be Exhorted, is This; Oh! Become ſollicitous, that you may under the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, be as the <hi>Good Ground, Fruitful</hi> from the <hi>Seed</hi> caſt upon it; Become Importunate for the <hi>Good Heart</hi> which may make you and prove you to be ſuch <hi>Good Ground</hi> before the Lord.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this EXHORTATION, there are three <hi>Counſils</hi> from GOD, yea, <hi>Charges,</hi> to be in the Name of GGD, earneſtly preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:002905_0094_0FE69191E025BC80"/>
Firſt. <hi>Examine</hi> your ſelves, O all you that are our <hi>Hearers,</hi> Examine your ſelves, what <hi>Fruit</hi> the Goſpel has had with you; What <hi>Fruit</hi> you have heard the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD withal. The GOD of Heaven, who does require <hi>Fruit</hi> from the <hi>Soil,</hi> and the <hi>Soul,</hi> on which He has beſtowed the <hi>Seed</hi> of His <hi>Word,</hi> He does alſo Enquire, what is the <hi>Fruit</hi> of all His Tillage. He ſays; Luk. XIII. 7. <hi>Behold, I come, ſeeking Fruit.</hi> But now, Enquire of thy ſelf, O Hearer of the Goſpel; Enquire Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, Thoroughly, Impartially; <hi>What Fruit has the Word of GOD my SAVIOUR produced in me; and what am I the Better, under and after my Enjoyment of the Glorious Goſpel?</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> wherein the <hi>Wrath of GOD has been Revealed from Heaven, againſt all Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> Enquire, whether the <hi>Fruit</hi> of it has been ſeen, in your being Reclaimed from all <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> which <hi>Converts the Soul,</hi> and <hi>makes wiſe the Simple,</hi> and <hi>Rejoices the Heart,</hi> and <hi>Enlightens the Eyes,</hi> Enquire, whether the <hi>Fruit</hi> of it has been ſeen, in your having a <hi>Soul Converted,</hi> and <hi>made Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Rejoiced,</hi> and <hi>Enlightened</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>There are eſpecially <hi>Four Queſtions</hi> which I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently urge you to Retire and ponder on.</p>
               <p>Queſt. I <hi>Have I ever yet had Experience of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation from the Word of Truth? And has the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, by His Word ſo Quickned me for Living to Him, and given ſuch a New Biaſs to me, as to make a New Creature of me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. II. <hi>Is there no Evil which the Word of GOD has rebuked me for, yet left unreformed with me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:002905_0095_0FE691F342FB8CC0"/>
Queſt. III. <hi>Is there no Duty which the Word of GOD has convinced me of, yet left unperformed with me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. IV. <hi>Have I left nothing undone, which is neceſſary to be done, that my dying Hour may not be fearfully uneaſy to me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwers to theſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> will ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, how Defective you may ſtill be in your <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> under the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD. I beſeech you to take theſe important <hi>Queſtions</hi> into a juſt Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Secondly. You muſt become <hi>United</hi> unto your SAVIOUR, by <hi>Believing</hi> on Him, that ſo the Goſpel may have its <hi>Fruit</hi> with you; and that ſo you may not be numbred among them, of whom it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>The Word preached does not profit them.</hi> The very Firſt and Main <hi>Fruit</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to be demanded of you, is This; Give your ſelves up to your SAVIOUR, and be willing to be <hi>found in Him.</hi> This is the Firſt Thing to be propoſed and purſued in order to all further <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> Remember, That you never will be <hi>Fruitful,</hi> until you are firſt united unto your SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, by Repairing to Him for all Good, and by Believing on Him, who tells us, Joh: XV. 5. <hi>Without me, you can do nothing.</hi> The <hi>Good Works,</hi> which are the <hi>Fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> commanded of GOD; Remember this; They are not Things to be done by an <hi>Unrenewed Mind,</hi> and a Soul not yet <hi>United</hi> unto our SAVIOUR. Tis <hi>Faith</hi> which is to do all theſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> and yield all theſe <hi>Good Fruits.</hi> It muſt be the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> which does them all, yields them all. The <hi>Firſt Thing</hi> to be propounded with you, is, To fly unto
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002905_0096_0FE6919358ECAD20"/>a Glorious CHRIST, and beg of him to make you <hi>his own,</hi> and comply with all his <hi>Offers of Grace:</hi> More particularly, Ask of him, Truſt in him, that by Him <hi>living in you,</hi> you may <hi>be made perfect in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work.</hi> Chriſtian, Thy SAVIOUR ſays unto thee, <hi>From me is thy Fruit found.</hi> Let it be the <hi>Echo</hi> from thy Soul unto him; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, by thee acting in me, let me be made a Soyl fruitful unto GOD.</hi> I wiſh the People of GOD were aware of it; The want of ſuch <hi>Divinity,</hi> in our Sermons, has proved almoſt the loſs of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> under them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Be <hi>Prayerful</hi> that you may be <hi>Fruitful.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Prayer</hi> it ſelf is no little part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> that is called for. <hi>Prayerleſs</hi> ones, beſure are <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> ones. There appear no <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> until that ſprouts up; Act. IX. 11. <hi>Behold, He prays.</hi> This, This is to be one ſpecial Article of our <hi>Prayer; My GOD, Beſtow thou the Bleſſings of a fruitful Soul upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, more particularly, <hi>Pray</hi> over the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, wherewith you are <hi>Highly favoured</hi> of the Lord. Before your <hi>Hearing</hi> of it, make that <hi>Prayer, Lord, Let thy Word find my Heart prepared for it.</hi> After your <hi>Hearing</hi> of it, Think, <hi>What freſh matter of Prayer have I now been minded of?</hi> In <hi>Hearing,</hi> turn all you <hi>Hear</hi> into <hi>Prayer,</hi> as much as ever you can: Send up your Wiſhes tied unto the <hi>Arrows</hi> of <hi>Ejaculatory Prayer;</hi> ſend them up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as thick as you can. <hi>Fruitful, Fruitful</hi> will that <hi>Earth</hi> be, which in this way obtains the <hi>Sweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon it.—</p>
               <p>But I may not forget one Advice more to be introduced before I leave you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:002905_0097_0FE691F4948E4888"/>
Our COMPANY will be a Thing of more than a little Conſequence to our PIETY. Our <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> in all the <hi>Good Works</hi> of PIETY, will very much depend on the <hi>Company</hi> with which we chuſe to be moſt <hi>Familiar.</hi> A Grand Maxim of Wiſdom, and of the beſt <hi>Husbandry,</hi> is, <hi>Forſake the Fooliſh and live.</hi> We have read of one whoſe <hi>Field</hi> was in a Bad Condition, He got it by being <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt</hi> thoſe who were not as they ſhould be.</p>
               <p>For the Inculcation of this <hi>Caution,</hi> I will ſet before you <hi>Two Laws,</hi> which the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael</hi> gave to His People concerning the <hi>Ancient Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Law was; Deut. XXII. 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt not Plow with an Ox and an Aſs together.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Animals that are of ſo unequal a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> was doubtleſs a <hi>Magical Rite,</hi> invented by the Devil to be uſed by Men, in Token of their Dependence on him for <hi>Fruitful Fields.</hi> There can be no Reaſon but <hi>Magic</hi> found for ſuch an improper <hi>Conjugation. Homer,</hi> and all the World, have decried the Nonſenſe and Folly and <hi>Madneſs</hi> of it; and it was look'd upon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to proclaim <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> a <hi>Madman.</hi> But the Devil ſingularly delights in <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and in all Contradiction to the <hi>GOD of Order.</hi> The <hi>Ox</hi> was a Sacrifice to the <hi>Dii Superi;</hi> the <hi>Aſs,</hi> a Sacrifice to the <hi>Dii Inferi.</hi> Both ſorts of Deities were <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally</hi> called upon, when theſe were in the <hi>Yoke together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, was there nothing elſe deſigned in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this <hi>Diabolical Sacrament?</hi> The Jews in their <hi>Baal-Hatturin</hi> tell us, There was this thing Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically taught us in it, <hi>That the Righteous and the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002905_0098_0FE691938316D520"/>Wicked ſhould avoid Commerce with one another.</hi> Yea, <hi>Bochart</hi> is of the Opinion, that our Apoſtle did allude unto this very <hi>Law,</hi> when he forbids our being <hi>unequally yoked with Unbelievers.</hi> Chriſtian, It will marvellouſly creeple thee, to be <hi>yoked</hi> with <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> and with ſuch as indeed will <hi>Draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way</hi> than what thy Soul tends unto.</p>
               <p>Another Law was; Lev. XIX 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſow thy Field, with a mingled Seed.</hi> No doubt, the Original of this Injunction was this; There was, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us, a Superſtition of the <hi>Zabians,</hi> to ſow <hi>Barley</hi> and <hi>Raiſins</hi> together, that they might procure to their <hi>Fields,</hi> a ſingular Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and Felicity. Our <hi>Selden</hi> finds among the Old <hi>Athenians,</hi> what a little reſembles it. The old <hi>Idolaters</hi> joined a <hi>Male</hi> God, and a <hi>Female</hi> in their Acknowledgements. And <hi>Varro</hi> writing, <hi>De Re Ruſtica,</hi> directs this, to obtain a Succeſs for their Tillage. Thus the vain <hi>Idolaters,</hi> looking on the god of the <hi>Vine,</hi> as a <hi>Male,</hi> and the god of the <hi>Grain</hi> as a <hi>Female;</hi> they would by the Rice of a <hi>Mixed Seed</hi> unite them, that ſo they might have a <hi>lucky Vintage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Methinks, I ſee a further Intent in this <hi>Law.</hi> There have been <hi>Two Seeds</hi> in the World, ever ſince the <hi>Third Chapter</hi> of <hi>Geneſis; Two Seeds</hi> very different from one another. Syrs, Theſe <hi>Two Seeds</hi> will never do well together. Let them them keep at a due Diſtance from one another. The <hi>Work of GOD</hi> in your Souls will not thrive, if you do not <hi>ſave your ſelves from the untoward Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> As for them who are evidently a <hi>Seed of Evil doers, and Children that are Corrupters,</hi> the Voice from Heaven to you is; <hi>Come out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002905_0099_0FE6929D728EA468"/>them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and I will receive you; yea, I will be a Father unto you; and ye ſhall be my Sons and my Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally; Methinks, The <hi>Husbandry</hi> of <hi>Aſhes,</hi> may here agreeably enough have ſome Notice taken of it.</p>
               <p>When we read; Pſal. CXLVII. 16. <hi>He ſcatters the Hoar-froſt like Aſhes,</hi> it ſeems Alluſive to what was done by the ancient <hi>Husbandmen.</hi> We often find it in Books of <hi>Agriculture,</hi> a Receit for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of <hi>Ground</hi> that has been ſpent, or worn out. There is a <hi>Salt</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> which is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Aliment or Nutriment; and the more of that <hi>Salt</hi> there is in any thing, the better <hi>Dung</hi> it will yield for the producing of a <hi>fruitful Soil.</hi> Now that <hi>Salt</hi> remains in the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of the <hi>Plants,</hi> after the <hi>Fire</hi> has done its part upon them. We ſee our <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> ever now and then burning little Heaps of Rubbiſh here and there on their <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plough'd Ground. Virgil</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a Practice diverſe times in his <hi>Georgicks.</hi> In all probability the <hi>Hsbandmen</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo too. They ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Aſhes</hi> here and there on their <hi>Fields;</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they caſt <hi>Aſhes</hi> on their <hi>Dunghills,</hi> where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diluted by the <hi>Rains,</hi> the <hi>Salt</hi> very deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated them; and rendred them fitter to be ſpread afterwards upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>But now, What I would be at, is, To employ the <hi>Husbandry of Aſhes,</hi> for the producing of a <hi>fruitful Soul.</hi> And it is to be managed by ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and frequent <hi>Meditations</hi> on Two <hi>Heaps of Aſhes</hi> which we are all deeply concerned in. Such <hi>Meditations</hi> are the moſt <hi>Fertilizing</hi> Things that
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:002905_0100_0FE64697CEB434B8"/>can be imagined; It will be a <hi>fruitful Soyl,</hi> that ſhall be impregnated with them.</p>
               <p>Firſt. <hi>Meditate,</hi> O Dying Man, on the <hi>Aſhes,</hi> which thy <hi>Grave</hi> will ſhortly reduce thee to: <hi>Duſt and Aſhes!</hi> Often take a View of thy <hi>Fleſh</hi> as <hi>Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated</hi> in the <hi>Grave.</hi> And Think, <hi>What will all this World be to me, when I am laid up in the duſty Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe appointed for all the Living!</hi> Think; <hi>What have I to do, that I may with Courage and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort go down unto the Chambers?</hi> The <hi>Fruits</hi> of ſuch Thoughts will be Wonderful!</p>
               <p>Secondiy. <hi>Meditate</hi> very much on the <hi>Aſhes</hi> which will cover the Face of the Earth, when the <hi>Flames</hi> that are now quickly to be looked for, have done their part upon it. If the <hi>coming of the Son of Man in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> which cannot mean any other than His <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Viſible</hi> Coming, muſt be at and for the Deſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> (Papal) Monarchy, which muſt be given up to <hi>Burning Flames!</hi> If the <hi>Second coming</hi> of our Lord, which will be in <hi>Flaming Fire,</hi> muſt be at and for the Perdition of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> who has now run thro' his Period of <hi>Twelve hundred and ſixty Years;</hi> If the promiſed Felicities for the Church upon <hi>Earth,</hi> take not place before the <hi>New Earth;</hi> And, if the <hi>New Earth</hi> arrive not before, but muſt be brought in by, the <hi>Conflagration</hi> which will make a dreadful Havock <hi>on the Earth, and the Works</hi> that are in it; Then, we know not how ſoon the <hi>Earth</hi> muſt undergo the tremendous Revolution, which the XXIV. Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecies, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Inſpired Oracles, have deſcribed and foretold unto us.

            <p>A Moſt awful Judgment of GOD! If we take it <hi>Figuratively</hi> or <hi>Literally,</hi> tis a moſt awful Judgment of GOD.</p>
            <p>At a <hi>Vintage</hi> of old, their Uſage was to have Songs of Mirth and Joy; In the <hi>Vineyards</hi> there would be Singing, with glad Shouts and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. But behold here, a Song over the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of GOD, which is <hi>Carmen Lugubre;</hi> a very Mournful one, and fitted for Sighs and Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Church of GOD is very fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto a <hi>Vineyard.</hi> His Church among the Jews, was now become a <hi>Degenerate Vineyard.</hi> The <hi>Impieties</hi> abounding in that Church, were <hi>Sowre Grapes,</hi> which very poorly anſwered the Divine
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:002905_0104_0FE6927A2FF2A498"/>Cultivation, that had been employed upon the <hi>Vinerard.</hi> The Glorious GOD is introduced, as expreſſing His juſt Reſentments upon the <hi>Ill Fruits</hi> found in a People that had been ſo richly Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. One of the Puniſhments threatned unto the <hi>Unfruitful Vineyard,</hi> is in this Article; <hi>I will command the Clouds, that they Rain no Rain upon it.</hi> The Interpretation of the <hi>Parable,</hi> and of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in it, which I find in the Writings of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> when I <hi>ſeek Underſtanding from them,</hi> is to this purpoſe;
<q>It was accompliſhed, when GOD ſent away His <hi>Apoſtles</hi> from the Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Diſobedient <hi>Jews,</hi> unto the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> when the Offers of the Goſpel were no longer diſpenſed as they had been unto that Rejected People, but the ſaving Inſtructions and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Heaven, were witheld from them; which they have now been for many Ages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> which is now to <hi>diſtill as the Rain</hi> upon us, will be This.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the Glorious GOD commands His Clouds to ſhed no RAINS upon a People, tis a terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that whereof ſuch a forſaken and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy People ſhould be very ſenſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ Tis firſt in the <hi>Figurative Senſe</hi> of it, that we will take the <hi>Terrible Judgment</hi> into our ſerious Conſideration. Tis in the witholding <hi>Evangelical Bleſſings</hi> from a Land, that GOD <hi>commands</hi> the <hi>Clouds,</hi> to diſtil <hi>no Rains</hi> upon it. This is now to be conſidered as a Judgment of a very ſad Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: O our dear People, not yet viſited with it, I hope, you will apprehend it ſo, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly deprecate it!</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:002905_0105_0FE646A3C8A97FB0"/>
I. We will enquire, firſt; <hi>When</hi> may a People have it ſaid of them, That GOD <hi>commands the Clouds</hi> to diſtil <hi>no Rain</hi> upon them?</p>
            <p>In general; Tis when a People have not the <hi>Miniſtry of the Goſpel,</hi> to bring them home unto GOD.</p>
            <p>By the Rain here ſpoken of, tis agreed among Expoſitors, That <hi>Coeleſtis Doctrina,</hi> or, Heavenly Inſtructions are intended. It is well known, That in the Hebrew Language, both the <hi>Raining</hi> of Heaven, and the <hi>Teaching</hi> of Heaven, are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Terms that come from the ſame Root. Even the Margin of the Bible in our Tranſlation, gives us a notable intimation of This; at Joel II. 23. <hi>He hath given you the former Rain.</hi> In your Margin tis, <hi>A Teacher of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Sacred Scriptures, we find the <hi>Teachers of Truth,</hi> reſembled unto the <hi>Clouds</hi> of Heaven. To theſe there may be applied that Word, Iſa. LX. 8. <hi>Who are theſe, that fly as a Cloud?</hi> No wonder then, that the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, which is taught by theſe, is reſembled unto <hi>Rain.</hi> Theſe are they who may ſay, Deut. XXXII. 2. <hi>My Speech ſhall diſtil as the ſmall Rain upon the tender Herb, and as the Showers upon the Graſs.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>Firſt; When the Glorious GOD beſtows not Able and Faithful Miniſters of His Goſpel on a People, then He <hi>commands the Clouds</hi> to diſtil <hi>no Rain</hi> upon them. The more Uſeful <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, are ſometimes <hi>taken away</hi> from a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Perhaps <hi>Perſecution</hi> Baniſhes them, or Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them; The <hi>Tail of the Dragon</hi> ſtrikes them down from Heaven. Or, the ordinary Courſe of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:002905_0106_0FE646A3D9DC0A78"/>
               <hi>Mortality</hi> takes them off, without Succeſſors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on. The <hi>Teachers</hi> are no more to be <hi>ſeen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their being <hi>removed</hi> into the <hi>Dark Corner</hi> of the Grave. The <hi>Clouds</hi> that ſhould have <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the <hi>Word of Life</hi> upon a People, are blown out of <hi>the</hi> World, when they have no <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to be the Diſpenſers of the Goſpel unto them. Yea, a People may have pretended <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and yet have this <hi>Curſe</hi> upon them. They may have <hi>Men in Black,</hi> that yet ſhall be <hi>no Divines,</hi> nor any better than ſo many <hi>Chemarims</hi> unto them: Or, Men that <hi>wear Garments only to deceive:</hi> And, Men that being the <hi>Corruption of the Beſt Thing,</hi> are <hi>the worſt Thing</hi> that can be; Mankind has a <hi>Tranſcendent Peſt</hi> in ſuch <hi>Diſſemblers</hi> and <hi>Stage players.</hi> Of ſuch we read, Jude 12. <hi>They are Clouds without Water.</hi> A People may have, <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>Erroneous,</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Miniſters;</hi> and ſuch as diſtil no <hi>Rains</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on the Souls of the People, but rather inſtil <hi>Poiſon</hi> into them. There are <hi>Miniſters</hi> who are meer <hi>Good-for-nothings:</hi> Their chief Talent lies at making of <hi>Chriſtleſs Chriſtians.</hi> If they ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sloth ſo far as to do ſomething like <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> an hundred times in a Year, there is not one right <hi>Goſpel Sermon</hi> among all their Harangues. They are ſuch Bunglers at <hi>Praying,</hi> that it would ſhamefully expoſe them, to put them upon it. Their <hi>Converſations</hi> are ſo Mean, ſo Vain, ſo Licentious, that the <hi>Blind lead the Blind,</hi> when the People are ſo left of GOD, as to follow them: <hi>Unſavoury Salt, fit only to be trodden under Foot of Men!</hi> Ah, Miſerable People! GOD witholds <hi>Clouds</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Rain,</hi> from ſuch a People. Nay, He <hi>Rains Brimſtone on their Habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:002905_0107_0FE6927B921A71F8"/>
More than ſo, Secondly; When a People that ſit under <hi>Good Miniſters,</hi> do <hi>get no Good</hi> by them; then GOD <hi>commands the Clouds</hi> to diſtil no <hi>Rain</hi> upon them. The Holy SPIRIT of GOD giving <hi>Efficacy</hi> to His Word, is likened aptly enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Rain.</hi> It may be ſaid of Him therein, as Hoſ. VI. 3. <hi>He ſhall come unto us as the Rain; as the latter and former Rain unto the Earth.</hi> People may have <hi>Miniſters</hi> that ſhall be Fat <hi>Clouds,</hi> and full of <hi>Rain.</hi> But, if GOD leave this People, without any <hi>Impreſſions of Grace</hi> from His Holy SPIRIT, by His <hi>Word</hi> in the Mouth of ſuch <hi>Miniſters,</hi> here is a People not <hi>Rained</hi> upon. A People may have Excellent <hi>Miniſters;</hi> ſuch as are truly <hi>Men of GOD,</hi> and, <hi>Able Miniſters of the New-Teſtament:</hi> And yet, the People may <hi>go on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes.</hi> The <hi>Miniſters</hi> may be, <hi>Burning and Shining Lights;</hi> And yet, the People remain <hi>in Darkneſs,</hi> and never <hi>know the things of their Peace.</hi> The <hi>Miniſters</hi> may be <hi>Good Men,</hi> and zealous for GOD; And yet, the People not by their Means <hi>turned unto the Lord.</hi> All the Pains taken by the <hi>Miniſters</hi> with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are loſt upon them. The People continue the <hi>Children of Unperſwadeableneſs,</hi> tho' the <hi>Miniſters</hi> do all they can for the <hi>perſwading</hi> of them to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> on CHRIST, and <hi>Repent</hi> of Sin, and lead <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> Lives. The Holy SPIRIT of GOD, affords not His <hi>Efficacy</hi> to make all Effectual. The curſed Mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> are not left ſo much without <hi>Rain,</hi> as the Souls of ſuch a People.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We will Enquire, next; What will be the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Judgment;</hi> and what there
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:002905_0108_0FE646AB44EAE170"/>is, that ſhould make it appear <hi>Terrible</hi> unto us?</p>
            <p>Firſt. When the <hi>Clouds</hi> diſtil no <hi>Rains</hi> on the Souls of Men, the <hi>worſt Famine</hi> that can be, will follow upon it. There will follow that <hi>Famine;</hi> Amos VIII. 11. <hi>Not a Famine of Bread, nor a Thirſt for Water; but of hearing the Words of the Lord. A Bodily Famine</hi> is a Judgment, than which there is none more dreaded among the Children of Men. The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had cauſe enough to put the Denomination of, <hi>The Evil,</hi> upon it. When the Glorious GOD is going to <hi>ſpend His Arrows</hi> on a ſinful World, He comes to an Extremity in this; <hi>I will ſend the evil Arrows of Famine upon them.</hi> O Diſmal Caſe! Wherein the Torture is Intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Men devour their own Fleſh; Women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Infants at their Breaſts; A lingring Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brings a fierce Rage, and a ſlow Death, upon the Miferables! How pathetically is it ſet forth; and how Lamentably! Lam. IV. 9. <hi>They that be ſlain with the Sword are better of it, than they that be ſlain with Hunger; for theſe pine away ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en through for want of the fruits of the Field.</hi> But now, they that are <hi>ſlain with a Famine of Bread and a Thirſt for Water,</hi> are <hi>better of it, than they that are ſlain</hi> with a <hi>Famine of hearing the Words of the Lord.</hi> For theſe <hi>pine away in their Sins;</hi> They are <hi>ſtricken through for want of the Fruits</hi> that are to bring and keep their Souls in Life; They go down to Eternal Burnings; Weeping and Wailing and Gnaſhing of Teeth, in a <hi>Deſtruction from GOD,</hi> is what they are eternally damn'd unto.</p>
            <p>Secondly. To enjoy the <hi>Clouds</hi> which diſtil <hi>Rains</hi> on our Souls, tis an <hi>High Favour</hi> of Heaven. Then tis a <hi>Sore Judgment</hi> of Heaven, to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:002905_0109_0FE646AB5337E430"/>of ſuch Enjoyments. If People ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go many <hi>Difficulties,</hi> yet the <hi>Clouds</hi> diſtilling <hi>Rains</hi> on their Souls, would make amends for their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Circumſtances. Thus we read; Iſa. XXX. 20. <hi>Tho' the Lord give you the Bread of Adverſity, and the Water of Affliction, yet thine Eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers.</hi> But, Ah, Abandoned People! If your <hi>Eyes</hi> can ſee no <hi>Teachers,</hi> you are worſe of it, than any ſcarcity of <hi>Bread</hi> or of <hi>Water</hi> can render you. They are a <hi>Bleſſed People,</hi> who have the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, with the <hi>Ordinances of Heaven</hi> which it leads them to. An <hi>Undone People</hi> then they that have none of theſe things. When this <hi>Good Part</hi> is <hi>taken away,</hi> the <hi>Beſt Thing</hi> a People can have, is <hi>taken away.</hi> They have then the <hi>worſt Thing</hi> that can be befalling of them. The People are <hi>lifted up to Heaven</hi> that are made partakers of ſuch Heavenly Priviledges, as the <hi>Clouds</hi> diſtilling <hi>Rains</hi> on their Souls. Tis then a meer <hi>Hell upon Earth,</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of them. In the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD Men <hi>Eat the Food of Angels.</hi> When this <hi>Food</hi> is denied them, they are condemn'd and confin'd unto the <hi>Serpents Food,</hi> and have their Souls <hi>filled</hi> with nothing but what leaves them forever <hi>Empty;</hi> nothing but the <hi>Duſt of the Earth.</hi> We read, Pſal. LXXIX. 15. <hi>Bleſſed is the People that know the Joyful Sound.</hi> But then, Oh! the <hi>Curſes</hi> that are poured out upon a People, who know nothing of the <hi>Joyful Sound!</hi> All the <hi>Curſes</hi> that ever Mount <hi>Ebal</hi> roar'd withal, and enough to make a very <hi>Dreadful Sound!</hi> He was a Man of Right Sentiments, who ſaid, <hi>I have eſteemed the Words of thy Mouth more than my neceſſary Food.</hi> Then, if the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD be taken away, tis as bad as if our <hi>neceſſary Food</hi> were taken away.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:002905_0110_0FE6927BAFB10F88"/>
               <hi>Wandring Souls,</hi> Tis by the <hi>Perfect Law</hi> of GOD, that you are to be <hi>Converted. Simple Souls,</hi> Tis by the <hi>Sure Teſtimony</hi> of GOD, that you are to be <hi>made Wiſe. Dejected Hearts,</hi> Tis by the <hi>Right Statutes</hi> of GOD, that you are to be <hi>Rejoiced. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Minds,</hi> Tis by the <hi>pure Commandment</hi> of GOD, that you are to be <hi>Enlightened.</hi> What a <hi>Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to be deprived of all this <hi>Bleſſedneſs!</hi> What a <hi>Wrath unto the uttermoſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. Tis a <hi>Judgment</hi> that <hi>goes not alone.</hi> If the <hi>Clouds</hi> diſtil no <hi>Rains</hi> on the Souls of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, GOD has taken away the <hi>Signs</hi> of His <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preſence</hi> from among them; They may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan themſelves, <hi>We ſee not our Signs,</hi> when there is <hi>no more any Prophet</hi> among them. The Lord Himſelf comes, where the <hi>Showers of His Word</hi> come. Hence, when the <hi>Showers</hi> of the Goſpel are departed from a People, the Lord Himſelf is <hi>departed</hi> from them. <hi>This is the Burden from the Lord,</hi> upon them, <hi>I will even forſake you, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But, Oh! What a <hi>Word</hi> is That! Hoſ. IX. 12. <hi>Wo to them when I depart from them!</hi> And now, What enſues? All manner of <hi>Evil;</hi> And this Account of it, <hi>The Lord is not with us, and therefore all this is befallen us.</hi> A People ſo forſaken of GOD, muſt needs grow an <hi>Ungodly People. Satan</hi> has his <hi>Throne</hi> among them. From that <hi>Throne of Iniquity</hi> there iſſue out moſt venemous Operations. The People are all of them <hi>Captives</hi> to the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Prey of the Terrible Ones.</hi> GOD now <hi>makes Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>it is Night,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Pit <hi>creep forth,</hi> and the old Lions roar after their <hi>Prey,</hi> and the famiſhed People become a <hi>Prey</hi> unto them. Their Character is That; <hi>Fooliſh,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:002905_0111_0FE646AE9CC1E870"/>Diſobedient, Deceived, ſerving diverſe Luſts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another.</hi> O Rueful Condition! What <hi>Suburbs of Hell</hi> are we falling into! The People deſtitute of the <hi>Deſirable Showers,</hi> are as <hi>Unloving</hi> as they are <hi>Ungodly,</hi> and are a <hi>continual Dropping</hi> to one another. The People make themſelves to one another like the <hi>Bitter Waters,</hi> which the <hi>Star</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Wormwood,</hi> fell into; and become Grievous <hi>Judgments</hi> upon one another. At the ſame time, they <hi>Ripen</hi> for all the <hi>Judgments</hi> of GOD, and <hi>Open</hi> the Floodgates for them, and have no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of eſcaping them. Tis with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Report, 2 Chron. XV. 3, 5, 6. <hi>They were without a Teaching Prieſt, and without Law; And in thoſe times, there was no Peace, for GOD vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with all Adverſity.</hi> Ah, Forlorn People; <hi>Sitting in Darkneſs, and in the Region of the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But from theſe Things, let us make ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A People that have the <hi>Clouds</hi> of Heaven diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilling Evangelical <hi>Rains</hi> upon them, ſhould be Thankful to Him, who <hi>Covers the Heavens with Clouds, and who prepareth Rain for the Earth.</hi> It is the Glorious GOD, who <hi>Commands</hi> His <hi>Clouds,</hi> to diſtil His <hi>Rains</hi> upon them, O our Evangelized People; It is He, who <hi>by watering wearies the thick Cloud,</hi> and cauſes the <hi>Rain to come for His Land, and in Mercy.</hi> On ſuch an Occaſion a People are ſo called upon; <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> I call to Mind a Paſſage; Pſal. LXXXIV. 6. <hi>The Rain fills the Pools.</hi> My little Skill in Philology, finds, many Hebrew Words are ſo ſignificant, that without any Danget
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002905_0112_0FE646AEAF6842D0"/>or Damage, we may ſuppoſe a further Senſe in them, than what is at firſt obvious. This Paſſage particularly may be read thus, <hi>The Teacher is filled with Bleſſings.</hi> O People Travelling to <hi>Zion,</hi> You often meet with ſuch a Thing: A <hi>Teacher</hi> that is <hi>full of Bleſſings;</hi> A <hi>Cloud</hi> from and by which, the Bleſſed GOD <hi>Showers</hi> down a <hi>Poure</hi> of Bleſſings upon you. Is there a Countrey any where under the Cope of Heaven at this Day, <hi>Richer</hi> on this regard, than this <hi>poor</hi> Countrey? Behold, Thy Denſe <hi>Clouds,</hi> O People <hi>known</hi> above the moſt of the <hi>Families of the Earth,</hi> Charg'd <hi>Clouds,</hi> from whence much of a Glorious CHRIST comes down, <hi>like Rain upon the mown Graſs,</hi> like <hi>Showers that water the Earth.</hi> Yea, we read, Job XXXVII. II. Of, <hi>Bright Clouds;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Clouds</hi> that have <hi>Rainbows</hi> in them. There are <hi>Candidates</hi> for the Work of GOD in our Churches, which are ſuch <hi>Bright Clouds;</hi> Young Men of growing <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> and of ſettled <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> to do all the Good that ever they can. Theſe carry <hi>Rainbows</hi> with them, and comfortable <hi>Tokens,</hi> that our Churches will not as yet be overwhelmed in a General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. O Churches that ſo <hi>find Life and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Favour of the Lord;</hi> Give Thanks, give Thanks to our Aſcended JESUS, who <hi>gives theſe Gifts unto Men,</hi> and at the ſame time, <hi>ſends a plentiful Rain,</hi> by which He <hi>confirms His weary Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions among thoſe which they call, <hi>The Fortunate Iſlands,</hi> one that is called, <hi>Pluviaria,</hi> becauſe of the agreeable <hi>Rains</hi> which it is bleſs'd withal. Our Land may on the beſt Accounts be called, <hi>Pluviaria;</hi> None more happily <hi>Rained</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!</p>

               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:002905_0113_0FE69283A11DE3D8"/>
It becomes us now to do what may be done, that the <hi>Clouds</hi> of Heaven diſtilling Evangelical <hi>Rains,</hi> may be always afforded unto us; and that we may never ſuffer a <hi>Famine of the Goſpel,</hi> from the <hi>Clouds</hi> deſiſting to <hi>Rain</hi> upon us. The <hi>Three Years and an half</hi> in which it <hi>Rained not</hi> in the Days of <hi>Elias,</hi> were a Type of the <hi>Twelve Hundred and ſixty Years,</hi> which make <hi>Three Years and an half</hi> of <hi>Prophetical Days,</hi> that the Romiſh Antichriſt is to famiſh the Nations. This Period being upon its Expiration, We may be in more hopes than ever, that if due Means be uſed, we ſhall obtain the <hi>Rains</hi> that are to be wiſhed for. It is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that when our <hi>Elders give up the Ghoſt,</hi> our People ſhall yet know where to <hi>ſeek the Meat,</hi> that ſhould <hi>relieve their Souls.</hi> In order to this;</p>
            <p>Firſt; The <hi>Clouds</hi> that bring the <hi>Rains,</hi> are to be fairly dealt withal. Indeed, if the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel are Men of no <hi>Merits.</hi> I am not aware of any <hi>Reſpects</hi> due to them. If they be <hi>Fooliſh</hi> and <hi>Selfiſh</hi> and <hi>Slothful</hi> Men, I know not why they ſhould be Reſpected above other Men. If they are no better than <hi>Idol Shepherds,</hi> O Churches of GOD, Get rid of them as faſt as you can. If they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly Miſcarry, let not their <hi>Coat</hi> be a Shelter for their Miſcarriages: It aggravates 'em! Well, But if Miniſters have the True <hi>Spirit of the Goſpel</hi> in them, and keep within the <hi>Commiſſions</hi> and the <hi>Directions</hi> of it, then in Abuſes offered unto them, it may in ſome ſort be ſaid, <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> are abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. GOD will call home His Injured <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,</hi> and there come none after them, like thoſe that went before them. Yea, It comes to that; 2 Chron. XXXVI. 16, <hi>They mocked the Meſſengers
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:002905_0114_0FE646B7C05C6C28"/>of GOD, and miſuſed His Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt His People, ſo far that there was no Remedy.</hi> Sometimes a People are bleſſed with <hi>Miniſters</hi> who are Heavenly and Luminous <hi>Clouds</hi> over the Aſſemblies of <hi>Zion: Miniſters</hi> that are <hi>the Beauty</hi> and the <hi>Defence</hi> of the Churches; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> that are conſpicuouſly full of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and of <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> They diſcharge all their <hi>Offices,</hi> with great <hi>Capacity,</hi> with great <hi>Activity,</hi> with great <hi>Fidelity.</hi> They ſtudy to <hi>do Good,</hi> and they do abundance of <hi>Good.</hi> They are <hi>Tender Fathers</hi> to their Flocks; <hi>Praying</hi> for them, <hi>Watching</hi> for them, glad of all Opportunities to be uſeful unto them; Scattering their <hi>Alms</hi> and their other Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, like the Showers of Heaven among them. Of ſuch <hi>Miniſters,</hi> I was going to ſay, <hi>Make much of them.</hi> Without recalling that Word, I will ſay, <hi>Make Nothing of them.</hi> One of the Beſt among them ſaid, 2 Cor. XII. 11. <hi>I am Nothing.</hi> If they are what they ſhould be, you cannot more oblige them, than to ſee you looking thro' the <hi>Clouds,</hi> up to the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> who makes them to be all that they are. They will count, that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carry it ſo well towards them, as when you take them to be <hi>Nothing</hi> but what their Glorious LORD makes them to be; and aſcribe unto their LORD, the whole <hi>Glory</hi> of all the Good you find in them, and from them. Nevertheleſs, I may not leave unquoted thoſe Words of our Apoſtle, 1 Theſſ. V. 12. <hi>We beſeech you, Brethren, to know thens who Labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and eſteem them very highly in Love for the ſake of their Work.</hi> Yea, Let the <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the Breaſt of the People, now do the part of
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:002905_0115_0FE646B7CEEA3CC0"/>a <hi>Preacher;</hi> And, O <hi>Conſcience,</hi> Do thou Declare! —Is it not pity that ſuch Benign <hi>Clouds</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould be miſuſed? <hi>Pity,</hi> they ſhould have their Spirits broken with Oppreſſive Neceſſities? <hi>Pity,</hi> they ſhould be Reproached and Slandered, and inſulted with many Indignities? <hi>Pity,</hi> that any <hi>prevailing Party</hi> ſhould load them with ſuch Expreſſions of Averſion for them, as may compel them to mourn before the Lord; <hi>A Bad-ſpirited People have killed me; have haſtened my Death upon me!</hi> The GOD of <hi>Zacharias</hi> may <hi>look upon</hi> ſuch Things, and not only <hi>take away</hi> the Bleſſings, but alſo ſay, <hi>Let no more ſuch Clouds diſtil my Rains upon ſuch a People!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But inaſmuch as there is very much <hi>Sacriledge</hi> committed in the Countrey, and many well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, do not receive a proper and a decent <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Q. I.

            <p>Q. II While you do not <hi>Communicate</hi> what may be Needful for the Support of your <hi>Teachers,</hi> how can you ſtand before that plain Command of GOD your SAVIOUR; Gal.

            <p>Yea, Tho' your Miniſters have a <hi>Ten times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Office</hi> than the <hi>Ancient Levites,</hi> yet would they not in much leſs than a <hi>Quarter part</hi> of what was allow'd unto the <hi>Levites,</hi> reckon a very <hi>competent Allowance</hi> made unto them?</p>

            </p>
            <p>[It was forbidden Deut. XXV. 4.

The Intention of the Prohibition, is, That we ſhould make much, even of the <hi>Brute Creatures</hi> that ſerve us. But it intends alſo, That we muſt learn to be <hi>Kind</hi> as well as <hi>Juſt</hi> unto all that are employ'd for our Good. Now this Law is <hi>Twice</hi> quoted in New Teſtament; and it is both Times for this purpoſe, To ſhew, that it is the <hi>Duty</hi> of a People, to give their Miniſters a <hi>Comfortable Maintainance.</hi>]</p>
            <p>I hope, I have ſaid enough. I may now go on to ſay,</p>
            <p>Secondly. When the <hi>Clouds</hi> diſtil <hi>Rains,</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> ought to be anſwerable. Shall I tell you, who the People are, that are in hazard of having the <hi>Clouds commanded,</hi> that they ſhould convey no <hi>Rains</hi> unto them? Tis the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> that brings forth no <hi>Fruits,</hi> but <hi>Sowre Grapſs.</hi> The <hi>Sowre Grapes</hi> of <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> abounding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People that have the Goſpel, theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Salutiferous <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Rains</hi> to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from them. We are ſo warned of GOD; Heb. VI. 7, 8. <hi>The Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, and bears Thorns and Briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing; whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> People hear the Word of GOD from time to time; and they get no Good by it; They are nothing the better for what they hear; The Word is not Embraced, not Obeyed, not Complied withal. If People won't <hi>Hearken</hi> to the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, they ſhall not have the <hi>Hearing</hi> of it. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is preached among a a People; But, Few <hi>Sinners</hi> are <hi>Converted from the Error of their ways.</hi> And, if any are Converted, they ſhow but very <hi>Dull Marks</hi> of their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

As our Lord ſaid unto His Apoſtle; Act. XXII. 18. <hi>Make haſte, and get thee quickly out of Jeruſalem; for they will not receive thy Teſtimony concerning me.</hi> Thus does the Great GOD now ſay to the <hi>Clouds,</hi> which diſtil His <hi>Rains</hi> with ſo little profit upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Make haſte, and come away from a People that hates to be Reformed. O my Word, Thou ſhalt ſtay no longer, where they will not receive thy Teſtimony.</hi>

The <hi>Clouds</hi> of Heaven diſtilling Evangelical <hi>Rains</hi> upon us, we ſhould not be ſatisfied without the <hi>Heavenly Influences</hi> coming with and in the <hi>Rains</hi> upon our Souls.

LV. 10, 11. <hi>As the Rain cometh down from Heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth,—ſo ſhall my Word be, that goeth forth out of my Mouth.</hi> Oh! that we may feel <hi>this Word</hi> fulfilled unto us! Our Goſpellized People; The <hi>Clouds</hi> of Heaven have long been ſhowring down the <hi>Rains</hi> of the Goſpel upon you. But, Oh! What the <hi>Influences</hi> of the <hi>Glorious Goſpel!</hi> What the <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> which it has brought you to!</p>
            <p>I will deſcribe to you, a Soul that feels the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Showers</hi> upon it. Examine what <hi>Experiences</hi> you have had of ſuch <hi>Influences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis a Soul <hi>happily Rained</hi> upon, that is come heartily to ſay; <hi>Great GOD, Thou ſhalt be my GOD and my Portion, and if I may live unto thee, I have all my Deſire!</hi> Heartily to ſay; <hi>O my Lovely SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR,

            <p>But the EXHORTATION, ſhall at length come to us, in that Abridgment which <hi>Hoſea,</hi> that long lived Miniſter has given us, not only by his own Sermons, for about fourſcore Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alſo of all the Sermons preached by all the Prophets that were ſent unto the Ancient People of GOD. You thus have it, Hoſ. X. 12. <hi>Tis time to ſeek the Lord, until He come and Rain Righteouſneſs upon you.</hi> Behold what now falls from the opened <hi>Bottles of Heaven</hi> upon you.</p>
            <p>O you that have the <hi>Clouds</hi> of Heaven over you; Be aſſured of this; Your Great SAVIOUR will come with a Bleſſed <hi>Rain of Righteouſneſs,</hi> upon them that <hi>Seaſonably ſeek</hi> for ſuch a Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The Thing to be <hi>ſought</hi> for, is; That we may, by the <hi>Faith</hi> of it, come to have the perfect and peerleſs <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of what our SAVIOUR did in conformity to the <hi>Law</hi> which is the <hi>Rule</hi> of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:002905_0122_0FE691FDA32CA768"/>
               <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as our <hi>Surety,</hi> may be imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us for the <hi>Juſtification of Life:</hi> And then, that our SAVIOUR would <hi>Sanctify</hi> us, as well as <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> us, and <hi>lead us in the Paths of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now to apprehend, That when our SAVIOUR communicates of Himſelf and His <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> in His <hi>Word,</hi> unto our Souls, there is in the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf, a ſweet <hi>Rain</hi> from Heaven falling upon us. We ſhall ſoon make the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude very apparent. For, Does the <hi>Rain</hi> make the Earth <hi>Fruitful?</hi> O our Goſpellized People, We hope, we hope, you can ſay, That you find the <hi>Word</hi> of your SAVIOUR do ſo. The <hi>Rain,</hi> Does it <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Refreſh</hi> the Earth? Doubtleſs, many of you can bring in this Teſtimony for the <hi>Word</hi> of your SAVIOUR, <hi>Lord, By this thou haſt Quickened me!</hi> But then, The <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which our SAVIOUR has to beſtow upon them, who attend upon His <hi>Word</hi> for it, This alſo may be compared unto the <hi>Rain,</hi> and the Compariſon is a very Apt one. Shall we ſay? None but GOD can give the <hi>Rain.</hi> We are ſo taught of GOD; Jer. XIV. 22. <hi>Can the Heavens give Showers? Art not thou He, O Lord our GOD? Therefore we will wait upon thee, for thou haſt made all theſe things.</hi> All <hi>Other Cauſes</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Rain,</hi> are but <hi>Second Cauſes.</hi> This is very ſure; None but GOD can give <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> unto us. Tis, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of GOD.</hi> If our SAVIOUR had not been GOD as well as Man, He could never have <hi>brought in</hi> for us, that <hi>Everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> wherein we may appear before GOD. And none but an Almighty GOD could ever do for us, thoſe Things, which are done when <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is convey'd unto us. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:002905_0123_0FE691FDC41228F8"/>'tis a Conſtellation of <hi>Miracles!</hi> When a <hi>Sinner</hi> is made <hi>Righteous,</hi> the <hi>Blind</hi> ſees, the <hi>Lame</hi> walks, the <hi>Dead</hi> comes to Life; <hi>Stone</hi> is turn'd into <hi>Fleſh;</hi> a <hi>Wolf</hi> is chang'd into a <hi>Lamb.</hi> The Holy SPIRIT, who does theſe things,— <hi>O Lord, Thou art Great, and thou doeſt wondrous Things, and thou art GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi> Again; The <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>Rain;</hi> How feelingly is This confeſſed with us? A <hi>Drought</hi> ſoon brings us to thoſe Ejulations; Joel I. 19, 20. <hi>O Lord,— The Fire hath devoured the Paſtures of the Wilderneſs, and the Flame has burnt all the Trees of the Field: The Beaſts of the Field cry alſo unto thee.</hi> But then, the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is nothing ſhort of That. Soul, <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is laid upon thee, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of thy SAVIOUR, and <hi>wo unto thee if thou do it not.</hi> There is a <hi>Fire</hi> that will <hi>devour</hi> thee, and a <hi>Flame</hi> that will <hi>burn</hi> thee up, if thou be a Stranger to it. Once more; The <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of the <hi>Rain;</hi> Who once ever diſputed this? 'Tis elegantly deſcanted on; Pſal. LXV. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Thou viſiteſt the Earth, and watereſt it; thou greatly enricheſt it with the River of GOD, which is full of Water;— Thou makeſt it ſoft with Showers; Thou crowneſt the Year with thy Goodneſs, and thy Pathes drop Fatneſs.</hi> But the <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> is yet more to be accounted of.

            <p>In fine; What remains is This. O you that <hi>follow after Righteouſneſs.</hi> PRAYER, PRAYER, to GOD your SAVIOUR for it; This is the

There is yet one thing more to be ſaid. The <hi>preſent Time</hi> is of all the moſt <hi>proper Time.</hi> We muſt be ſo perſwaded; 2 Cor.

            <p>Was it poſſible for me to ſay this, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing a moſt ſolemn Admonition unto our <hi>Young People?</hi> Children, Be you admoniſhed of This.

You Read, [For, I hope, you every Day Read in the Book, which tells you of him, even, the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which are <hi>able to make Children wiſe unto Salvation!</hi>] of one, of whom it is related, <hi>While he was yet Young, he began to ſeek after GOD.</hi> GOD brought that <hi>Young Man</hi> into His <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and made him one of the <hi>Beſt Men</hi> in the World. I adviſe you to think on thoſe two Paſſages, in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Firſt, a pious Father laid that Charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Son; 1 Chron. XXVIII. 9. <hi>My Son, ſerve the GOD of thy Father; If thou ſeek Him, He will be found of thee.</hi> The Devout Son kept in his Mind
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:002905_0126_0FE692064C0E1328"/>that Charge of his Father. Anon, with an Eye to it, he wrote that ſtrain of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. VIII. 17 <hi>They that ſeek me early, ſhall find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Son, Mind the Charge GOD now laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</p>
            <p>¶ But we will now take into our conſideration, the <hi>Terrible Judgment</hi> in the <hi>Literal ſenſe</hi> of it. And what is now to be obſerved, is; That when the Glorious GOD <hi>commands</hi> the <hi>Natural Clouds</hi> to <hi>Diſtil no Rains</hi> upon a Land, His Judgment upon the Land ſhould have a ſerious Notice taken of it.</p>
            <p>It is what theſe <hi>Remarks</hi> are to be made upon.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Clouds</hi> are <hi>Created</hi> by GOD, and when they diſtil <hi>Rains,</hi> 'tis becauſe they are <hi>commanded</hi> by Him to do it. The <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the <hi>Clouds</hi> and their diſtilled <hi>Rains,</hi> is not here to be enlarged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tis enough to ſay, The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> will tell you, That a <hi>Cloud</hi> is a Collection of little, but concave, <hi>Globules,</hi> which therefore aſcend unto that Heighth, wherein they are of <hi>equal Weight</hi> with the <hi>Air;</hi> where they remain ſuſpended, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til by a Motion in the <hi>Air,</hi> they are Broken, and ſo come down in drops, that make our <hi>Miſts</hi> or <hi>Showers.</hi> But it is the <hi>Religion</hi> of theſe <hi>Watry Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,</hi> with which we are now to be entertained. <hi>Reaſon</hi> tells us, That there is a GOD of Infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> who is the <hi>Creator</hi> of the World. Theſe parts of the World then muſt needs be the <hi>Creatures</hi> of that Glorious GOD. But let us hear what <hi>Scripture</hi> teaches us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:002905_0127_0FE6920667CE8570"/>
The <hi>Book</hi> of GOD and of <hi>Truth,</hi> has taught us, That the <hi>Clouds</hi> are the <hi>Creatures</hi> of GOD. So we read; Joh. XXVI. 8. <hi>He bindeth up the Waters in His Thick Clouds, and the Cloud is not rent under them.</hi> So we read; Job XXXVII. 15. <hi>GOD cauſes the Light of His Cloud to ſhine.</hi> The <hi>Clouds</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, The <hi>Chariots</hi> of GOD, and, The <hi>Chambers</hi> of GOD; and, The <hi>Treaſures</hi> of GOD; and the <hi>Stories</hi> which are <hi>built</hi> by GOD. Of our GOD we read; Pſal. CXLVII. 8. <hi>GOD covers the Heavens with Clouds; and prepareth Rain for the Earth.</hi> The Pagans called their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Nubicoga;</hi> He that <hi>Orders the Clouds.</hi> We challenge the Name for our JEHOVAH; Of whom we read, <hi>He commands the Clouds from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, This Book of His, has taught us, That the <hi>Rains</hi> too are the <hi>Creatures</hi> of GOD. So we read; Job V. 10. <hi>GOD giveth Rain upon the Earth, and ſendeth Waters upon the Field.</hi> So we read; Job XXXVI. 27, 28. <hi>GOD maketh ſmall the drops of Water, they pour down Rain according to the Vapour thereof: Which the Clouds do drop, and diſtil upon Man abundantly.</hi> We are accordingly informed, That GOD is the <hi>Father of the Rain;</hi> and, That GOD <hi>makes a Decree for the Rain.</hi> When the <hi>Rain</hi> falls, there cometh to paſs that thing; Pſal.

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. When GOD <hi>commands</hi> the <hi>Clouds,</hi> to diſtil no <hi>Rains,</hi> it is a <hi>Judgment,</hi> that Men ſhould be affected withal. A long want of <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Rains,</hi> or, the promiſing Appearance of <hi>Clouds</hi> from time to time going over without <hi>Rain;</hi> This is a very affecting <hi>Judgment</hi> of Heaven upon a ſinful World. A DROUGHT is a ſore <hi>Judgment</hi> of GOD!</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>Judgment</hi> that is often threatned among the Effects of the Divine Diſpleaſure: A <hi>Judgment</hi> of great Note among the Threatnings of GOD. Thus you read, Lev. XXVI. 19. <hi>I will puniſh you, and I will make your Heavens as Iron, and your Earth at Braſs.</hi> Thus you read; Deut. XI. 17. <hi>The Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:002905_0129_0FE692852E06C2B8"/>Wrath kindled againſt you, and He ſhut up the Heaven that there be no Rain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, a <hi>Drought</hi> is a Plague, wherein a check is given to the <hi>Ordinary Courſe of Nature.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Hand</hi> of GOD that gives the Check; the Hand of an angry GOD. The <hi>Burning Anger</hi> of GOD is diſcovered in it. The <hi>Lord GOD calls to contend by Fire,</hi> in the <hi>Judgment.</hi> There is the <hi>Indignation of GOD,</hi> proclaim'd againſt a Land, when the <hi>Land</hi> is <hi>not Rain'd upon.</hi> The Great GOD was offended; And then came this <hi>Judgment;</hi> Hag. I. 11. <hi>I called for a Drought upon the Land, and upon that which the Ground bringeth forth, and upon Men, and upon Cattel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that in which a <hi>Drought</hi> proves a fearful Plague, is, The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of it. A <hi>Scarcity</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: Yea, the <hi>Famine;</hi> Than which, what is there more to be trembled at? Perhaps <hi>Drink</hi> for Man and Beaſt, may grow ſcarce, by a <hi>Drought</hi> going on to Extremity. Be ſure, <hi>Food</hi> will do ſo. Thus we read; Jer. XIV. 3, 4. <hi>Their Nobles have ſent their little ones to the Waters, they came to the Pits, they found no Water; they returned with their Veſſels empty; they were aſhamed and confounded; and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Heads: Becauſe the Ground is chapt, for there was no Rain in the Earth, the Plowmen were aſhamed.</hi> Thus we read; Amos IV. 7, 8. <hi>I have witholden the Rain from you, when there were yet three months to the Harveſt; and I cauſed it to rain upon one City, and I cauſed it not to rain upon another City: One piece was rained upon; and the piece whereupon it rained not, withered.— So two or three Cities wandred unto one City to drink Water; but they were not ſatisfied.</hi> The <hi>Vegetable World</hi> cannot ſubſiſt, except the <hi>Showers</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But let us make a ſew brief <hi>Inferences,</hi> from what has been thus Remark'd unto us.</p>
            <p>Firſt. When the <hi>Clouds</hi> do diſtil <hi>Rains</hi> upon us, our <hi>Thankful Praiſes</hi> to the Glorious GOD are called for. My Brethren, Let our <hi>Praiſes</hi> go up in a greater Plenty than any <hi>Vapours,</hi> to the <hi>GOD of all Grace,</hi> who now opens and empties the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Heaven</hi> upon us. We read; Act XIV. 17. <hi>He left not Himſelf without a Witneſs, in that He did us Good, and gave us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seaſons filling our Hearts with Food and Gladneſs.</hi> The <hi>Showers</hi> of Heaven then beſpeak from us
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:002905_0131_0FE6920CB0CC4388"/>theſe Thankful Confeſſions; <hi>Great GOD; Thou art a good GOD! Oh! How much ought we to love and ſerve the GOD, who does good unto us, in giving us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seaſons!</hi> Verily, The <hi>Showers</hi> are worſe thrown away, than thoſe that fall upon the <hi>Rocks,</hi> if they produce not ſuch Conſequences from us.</p>
            <p>But, Secondly. When the <hi>Clouds</hi> refuſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Rains</hi> upon us, the Glorious GOD requires the Diſpoſitions of <hi>Repentance</hi> from us. It is GOD who <hi>commands the Clouds</hi> to diſtil no <hi>Rains</hi> upon us, when we undergo ſuch a Calamity. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us now, with <hi>Repenting Minds,</hi> humbly to enquire, <hi>what Controverſy the Holy One may have with us, in ſuch a Calamity?</hi> And, <hi>what Iniquity it may be, that ſuch a Puniſhment is inflicted for?</hi> 'Tis true; No People under the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are under ſuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> for <hi>External Proſperity,</hi> upon Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws of GOD, as the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were, under the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation. The Bleſſed GOD has not promiſed unto any People now, That if they will not ſcandalouſly <hi>Break His Covenant,</hi> they ſhall ſee no <hi>Unfruitful Seaſons.</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may have the <hi>Showers</hi> of Heaven, and other ſuch Bleſſings denied unto them, and be <hi>brought low thro' Oppreſſion Affliction and Sorrow;</hi> And yet be able to ſay, <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſely in thy Covenant.</hi> We ſee it, at this very Day. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have leaſt of all paid <hi>reſpect unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of GOD, yet have not the feweſt <hi>Showers</hi> of Heaven upon them. Nevertheleſs, when <hi>Showers</hi> are witheld, it is <hi>frequently,</hi> it is <hi>commonly,</hi> a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> upon a <hi>Land,</hi> for having <hi>ſinned grievouſly</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:002905_0132_0FE6920E32BF8808"/>when <hi>Water-ſprings are turned into Dry-ground,</hi> and <hi>a Fruitful Land into Barrenneſs,</hi> it is uſually, for <hi>the Wickedneſs of thoſe that dwell therein.</hi> 'Tis, as we read; Deut. XXVIII. 15, 23, 24. <hi>If thou wilt not hearken unto the Voice of the Lord thy GOD, Thy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that is over thy head ſhall be Braſs, and the Earth that is under thee ſhall be Iron; The Lord ſhall make the Rain of thy Land Powder and Duſt.</hi> Wherefore, under ſuch <hi>Fiery Rebukes</hi> of our GOD, we ſhould Loathe and Judge our ſelves for our <hi>Miſcarriages.</hi> Of theſe, there is eſpecially <hi>One,</hi> that is a very <hi>Comprehenſive One;</hi> That is to ſay, Our <hi>Unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> our <hi>Unfruitfulneſs!</hi> How <hi>Pertinently,</hi> but how <hi>Penitently,</hi> may this <hi>Reflection</hi> be made on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion! <hi>Lord, We bring forth little good Fruit of the Cultivations which thou doſt employ upon us. How fitly, how juſtly, how wiſely, are an Unfruitful People pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Unfruitful Seaſons!</hi> Methinks, I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear the <hi>Angel of the Waters</hi> making his Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Thou art Righteous, O Lord, becauſe thou haſt judged ſo!</hi> It becomes us to <hi>find out</hi> our <hi>Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> to <hi>Bewail</hi> them, to <hi>Reform</hi> them; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto the great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our SAVIOUR for the Pardon of them. Syrs, Our <hi>Main Work</hi> at ſuch a time, is, To ſeek <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with GOD. Oh! For Good Terms with the Great KING, from whoſe Countrey it is, that <hi>our Countrey is nouriſhed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. When we would have the <hi>Clouds</hi> to diſtil <hi>Rains</hi> upon us, what ſhall we do, what can we do, but look up to the Glorious GOD for the <hi>ſupply</hi> of what is wanting unto us? Both the <hi>Former Rain</hi> and the <hi>Latter Rain</hi> is that for which our Glorious GOD is to be look'd unto: The
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:002905_0133_0FE6920E572308E0"/>
               <hi>Former Rain,</hi> to ſoften the Ground before the <hi>Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Seed;</hi> The <hi>Matter Rain,</hi> by which the Corn in the Blade is brought on to <hi>Earing</hi> and <hi>Harveſt.</hi> We have a Promiſe to plead for it, Iſa. XXX. 23. <hi>He ſhall give the Rain of</hi> [or, for] <hi>thy Seed, that thou ſhalt ſow the Ground withal, and Bread of the Increaſe of the Earth, and it ſhall be fat and plenteous.</hi> Our GOD can <hi>command the Clouds,</hi> to diſtil what <hi>Rains</hi> He pleaſes upon us. Our Main concern is with a GOD, who <hi>commands Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Direction which our GOD has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us; Zech. X. 1. <hi>Ask ye of the Lord Rain in the time of the latter Rain; ſo the Lord ſhall make bright Clouds, and give them Showers of Rain, to every one Graſs in the Field.</hi> And in purſuance of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, there is a Notable Thing, which I am to mind you of. In the <hi>Covenant</hi> which our Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous GOD, after the Flood, made with our Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Noah,</hi> who was <hi>to Comfort us concerning our Toil, and the Work of our Hands, becauſe of the Ground which the Lord had curſed;</hi> there is a Promiſe of <hi>Regular Seaſons,</hi> [Perhaps better than what were before the <hi>Flood;</hi>] wherein <hi>Seaſonable Rains</hi> are comprehended. It may be partly with relation to that <hi>Covenant,</hi> that we read; Pſal. XXXVI. 5. <hi>Thy Mercy, O Lord, is in the Heavens; they Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reacheth to the CLOUDS.</hi> When we want <hi>Rain,</hi> we ſhould do well in our Supplications to plead that COVENANT of our GOD. It may be, if it were more in Uſe with us, to plead that CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENANT, the <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of our GOD, would bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the CLOUDS more diſplay'd before us. My Friends, Our Invitations and our Excitations, to
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:002905_0134_0FE69213FA4F0080"/>our <hi>Supplications,</hi> are Numberleſs. Among theſe, we have what is very cogent and pungent, when it pleaſes the Holy One, to ſend a ſevere <hi>Drought</hi> upon us. How Wicked, and how Woful, are the <hi>Prayerleſs,</hi> at ſuch a Time, when <hi>our GOD</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits Himſelf as a <hi>Conſuming Fire</hi> unto us! <hi>O Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ones,</hi> what a Share have you in procuring the Deſolation, whibh we are in danger of, while you will do nothing for the preventing of it? Our Buſineſs at ſuch a Time, is, To <hi>look above the Clouds,</hi> unto a Merciful GOD, who <hi>Numbers the Clouds in Wiſdom,</hi> and who can <hi>ſtay the Bottles of Heaven.</hi> Of this GOD, we are told; He is One, whoſe <hi>Faithfulneſs reacheth to the Clouds.</hi> It may be, a GOD of ſuch <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> will deal with us, according to the <hi>Word on which he has cauſed us to hope;</hi> Even, that Word; <hi>If I ſhut up Heaven, that there be no Rain, and my People humble themſelves, and pray and ſeek my Face, and turn from their wicked Ways, Then will I hear from Heaven, and heal their Land.</hi> We muſt come this Day to that Reſolution; Jer. XIV. 22. <hi>Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles, that can cauſe Rain? Or can the Heavens give Showers? Art not thou He, O Lord our GOD? Therefore we will wait upon thee: For thou haſt made all theſe things.</hi> It was demanded of old, <hi>Canſt thou lift up thy Voice to the Clouds, that abundance of Waters may cover thee?</hi> No; Let us <hi>Lift up our Voice</hi> to the GOD, who <hi>commands</hi> the <hi>Clouds.</hi> 'Tis He alone who can <hi>ſend abundance of Waters</hi> from thence upon us. He will not ſo <hi>hide Himſelf in a Cloud,</hi> that our <hi>Prayer ſhall not paſs through</hi> it, and come unto Him.</p>
            <p>I have done, The <hi>Sermon</hi> of this Day, comes to you as one of the <hi>Clouds,</hi> from whence the <hi>Rains</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:002905_0135_0FE692141990D490"/>of Heaven have been diſtilling upon you. But, <hi>Clouds diſtilling of Rains</hi> often bring <hi>Thunder</hi> with them. The <hi>Showers</hi> of this Day ſhall go off in <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning.</hi> We ſhall conclude with a COROLLARY, that ſhall carry <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Surely, The <hi>Wicked</hi> that ſhall be turned <hi>into Hell,</hi> and <hi>all they that forget GOD,</hi> muſt ſee very direful Circumſtances. Miſerable they, on whom GOD <hi>Commands the Clouds</hi> to diſtil no <hi>Rains.</hi> But, Oh! how miſerable they, who go down to the <hi>Fires</hi> that <hi>Burn in the Foundations of the Mountains!</hi> My Neighbours, If any of you <hi>Dy in your Sins,</hi> you go to a place, where GOD <hi>Commands the Clouds</hi> to diſtil no <hi>Rains</hi> upon the Miſerables. Alas, your Lot muſt be in ſuch an horrid Land as That; Iſa. XXXIV. 9, 10. <hi>The Streams thereof ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Pitch, and the Duſt thereof into Brimſtone, and the Land thereof ſhall become burning Pitch; It ſhall not be quenched Night nor Day, the Smoke thereof ſhall go up forever.</hi> In that place, GOD from His <hi>Clouds,</hi> being <hi>Terrible from his Holy places,</hi> only ſends down <hi>Hail ſtones and Coals of Fire,</hi> and burning Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts. In that place, the <hi>Tormented</hi> in vain wiſh for a <hi>Drop of Water</hi> to cool their Anguiſh. There, the <hi>Wicked</hi> are made <hi>as a Fiery Oven,</hi> by the <hi>Hot Anger of GOD;</hi> And the <hi>Smoke of their Torment aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends forever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! Be <hi>perſwaded,</hi> Immediately to get into the <hi>Peace of GOD;</hi> Immediately to <hi>flee from the Wrath to come;</hi> Immediately to lay hold on the JESUS, who <hi>delivers</hi> from it. Be <hi>perſwaded, Knowing the Terror of the Lord!</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Propoſition alſo ſhall not be diſmiſsed, without a Pertinent and Important <hi>Admonition.</hi> Can we tell of no way ſo far to cure our <hi>Averſion</hi> for <hi>Death,</hi> as to take away the <hi>Violence</hi> of the <hi>ſtroke,</hi> which the <hi>Sithe</hi> muſt give unto us?

Yea, <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, O Sithe, coming to deliver me from the Hand of all mine Enemies, and from the Hand of Sin! Welcome, O Killer, and yet, O Comforter! Welcome, O Thou cutter of the Knot, upon the Diſſolving of which I go to my Father. When it is cut off I fly away to the ſweet Manſions of my Fathers Houſe. Oh!

Yea, <hi>any Man</hi> may do ſo. The <hi>greateſt,</hi> the <hi>ſtrongeſt,</hi> the <hi>youngeſt</hi> may do ſo; and often does it. The <hi>Death</hi> of People may be <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> in this regard, that it <hi>ſurprizes</hi> them, even when they fancied, <hi>Goods laid up for many Years,</hi> and could perhaps impiouſly ſay of a Thing they <hi>thought nothing</hi> of, <hi>I thought no more of it than of my dying Day:</hi> They are <hi>ſurprized,</hi> with the <hi>Bow-ſtring</hi> ſerved upon them.

Such a <hi>Quick Motion</hi> of the <hi>Sithe,</hi> will render ſuch an <hi>Admonition</hi> as This to be infinitely Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. It is not to be ſaid, That a Man ſhould <hi>Live every Day, as if he knew it were to be the Day of his Death;</hi> But this muſt be ſaid, We ſhould <hi>Live every Day, as not knowing, but that it may be the Day of our Death.</hi> It was propounded among the <hi>Remarkables</hi> of the Chriſtian Life; 2.

When we <hi>Pray,</hi> Think, <hi>I may die ſuddenly, and this may be the laſt Time of my calling upon GOD.</hi> When we <hi>Hear,</hi> Think, <hi>I may die ſuddenly, and this may be the laſt Sermon that ever I ſpall be inſtructed from.</hi> When the <hi>Sabbath</hi> arrives, Think, <hi>I may die ſuddenly, and be gone before another Sabbath.</hi> And, when we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with our <hi>Friends,</hi> Think, <hi>I may die ſuddenly, and this may be my laſt Converſation with them.</hi> Chriſtian, So <hi>Number thy Days,</hi> as to look for no Number of Days.

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:002905_0159_0FE6923546090F28"/>comes in His Kingdom, after the Fall of <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> when His People ſhall be the <hi>Branch of His Planting, the Work of His Hands, that He may be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi> But the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of every Godly Man, are to be conſidered in it. And it is purticularly conſiderable, That his <hi>Bleſſings</hi> are as much in his <hi>Godlineſs</hi> it ſelf, as in any Article whatſoever. <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> is <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> Tis among the ſingular <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of a <hi>Godly</hi> Man; That he ſhall be a <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Man; He ſhall bring forth <hi>Fruit</hi> unto GOD; He ſhall be a <hi>Tree,</hi> whereof it may be ſaid, [For ſo it ſhall be readd,] <hi>Whatſoever it does bear, ſhall proſper very well.</hi> The <hi>Fruit</hi> ſhall not be loſt.</p>
            <p>But in the Text now before us, Behold, An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Property of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> which will be found with the Godly Man. It will be <hi>Seaſonable Fruit.</hi> He will <hi>bring forth Fruit in the Seaſon thereof.</hi> We read, Eccl. III. 11. <hi>GOD hath made every thing beautiful in the Seaſon thereof.</hi> Come now, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a <hi>Tree</hi> which GOD has made <hi>Beautiful in its Goodneſs; Its Top is among the Thick Boughs; All the Trees in the Garden of God may envy it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fruit</hi> I am now to bring forth, I hope, not <hi>unſeaſonably</hi> for your Entertainment, and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be This.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fruits of PIETY brought forth in the ſeaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are the Endeavour and the Character of a Godly Man; Yea, in ſuch ſeaſonable Fruits there very much lies the Bleſſedneſs of Real Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Thing that I am to do, is to tell you, what are the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are to be found in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> and the <hi>Character</hi> of a Godly Man. But
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:002905_0160_0FE692384C4090F0"/>have I not already ſaid, <hi>The Fruits of PIETY?</hi> You are to be told in one Word, The <hi>Acts</hi> of PIETY are the <hi>Fruits</hi> to be expected from us. When the Glorious One ſays, Luk. XIII. 7. <hi>I come ſeeking Fruit:</hi> The Things which He <hi>ſeeks</hi> are the <hi>Acts</hi> of PIETY, wherewith GOD is to be <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in all our ways.</hi> When we are directed, <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf unto Piety,</hi> tis a Direction unto <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi> To yield <hi>Obedience</hi> unto GOD, is to bring forth <hi>Fruit</hi> unto Him. There are <hi>Fruits</hi> in all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to that <hi>Rule,</hi> which GOD has given us, That we may <hi>Glorify</hi> Him, and <hi>Enjoy</hi> Him for ever. It is preſcribed unto us, Prov. XXIII. 17 <hi>Be thou in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long.</hi> This will be to <hi>bring forth Fruits unto the Lord, all the Day long.</hi> The <hi>Fruits</hi> required of us, are all thoſe Points, wherein the <hi>Fear of God</hi> is to be exerciſed. The <hi>Acts</hi> wherein we <hi>live</hi> unto GOD, and mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it our Deſign to ſerve and pleaſe Him; are the <hi>Fruits</hi> required of us. The <hi>Acts</hi> wherein we prove that we <hi>Love the Lord our GOD with all our Hearts,</hi> and <hi>Love our Neighbours as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> are the <hi>Fruits</hi> required of us. The <hi>Acts</hi> wherein we render <hi>Glory to GOD in the higheſt,</hi> and expreſs <hi>Good Will towards Men,</hi> are the <hi>Fruits</hi> which our GOD has required of us.</p>
            <p>But the main Thing that I am to do, is, To Enquire what are the <hi>Seaſons</hi> for our <hi>Fruits,</hi> and what are the <hi>Fruits,</hi> with which the ſeveral <hi>Seaſons</hi> are to be accommodated. I hope, it will be a <hi>Word in Seaſon.</hi> And how <hi>Good</hi> will ſuch a <hi>Word</hi> be, if it be well-hearken'd to?</p>
            <p>We read, Eccl. III. 1. <hi>To every thing there is a Seaſon, and a Time to every purpoſe under Heaven.</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:002905_0161_0FE692386A1210B8"/>Truly, To every <hi>Fruit</hi> there is a <hi>Seaſon;</hi> and a <hi>Time</hi> for every thing that is to be done in our way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in purſuance of our <hi>Purpoſe</hi> to come to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. There are the <hi>Fruits</hi> of PIETY, for which we have a <hi>Seaſon</hi> every Day, at the Hour of our <hi>Daily Sacrifices.</hi> The <hi>Devotions</hi> wherein we hear GOD ſpeak to us, and GOD hears us alſo ſpeak to Him; The <hi>Devotions</hi> wherein we <hi>Read</hi> the Word of GOD, and ſeek the Face of GOD, and <hi>Commune with our own Hearts;</hi> What are theſe, but ſo many <hi>Fruits of Piety?</hi> Firſt, there is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Cloſet;</hi> So preſcribed, Mat. VI. 6. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy Door, Pray to thy Father who is in ſecret.</hi> And then, there is the <hi>Religion of the Houſhold;</hi> So preſcribed, Col. IV. 2. <hi>Maſters, continue in Prayer, and Watch in the ſame with Thanſgiving, Together with</hi> ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto you. Now theſe <hi>Fruits of Piety,</hi> in every <hi>Morning,</hi> and in every <hi>Evening,</hi> we are to find a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for them. The People of GOD had of old their <hi>Morning Sacrifices,</hi> and their <hi>Evening Sacrifices.</hi> Our <hi>Devotion</hi> are <hi>Spiritual Sacrifices accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to GOD by JESUS CHRIST.</hi> In theſe <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> doing the part of <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto GOD, we are to have both our <hi>Morning Sacrifices,</hi> and our <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices.</hi> In the <hi>Morning,</hi> there is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for us to Retire, and Feed upon ſome <hi>Truths</hi> wholeſome to be taken, as we may ſay, next our Hearts; and then do like him who ſaid, <hi>My Voice thou ſhalt hear in the Morning, O Lord; In the Morning I will direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> In the <hi>Morning</hi> there is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for us,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:002905_0162_0FE6923EAD5E8C38"/>to call our <hi>Domeſticks</hi> together, and after we have alſo fed them with ſomething from the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> hereupon to do like him, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>He feared GOD with all his Houſe, and prayed unto GOD always.</hi> In the <hi>Evening</hi> there is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to Repeat ſuch Devotions; and Renew our Viſits unto Heaven. Yea, Some will oftener in a Day than ſo, find a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for Addreſſes to Heaven, with ſome of theſe <hi>Devotions.</hi> He did ſo, who could ſay; Pſal. XV. 17. <hi>Evening, Morning, and Noon will I pray and cry aloud.</hi> But in the <hi>Evening,</hi> for the cloſe of all, and that we may <hi>lie down in Peace, and ſleep,</hi> and be aſſured of <hi>dwelling in ſafety,</hi> have we not a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to Reflect on the <hi>Favours</hi> we have received in the Day, and be Thankful for them? A <hi>Seaſon,</hi> to Reflect on the <hi>Errors</hi> we have committed in the Day, and be humbled for them? A <hi>Seaſon</hi> to Reſign our ſelves and our All, into the Hands of our SAVIOUR, and by ſome Act or other, put it out of Doubt, that we are in good Terms with Heaven, and in ſafety for Eternity?</p>
            <p>But as an Appendix to our Account of the <hi>Daily Devotions,</hi> wherewith we are to <hi>bring forth Fruit in the Seaſon</hi> thereof; Let the <hi>Table</hi> be brought in. It muſt not be forgotten, That when we ſit down at the <hi>Table,</hi> Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to confeſs that the Glorious GOD is the giver of our <hi>Daily Bread,</hi> and that we <hi>live not by Bread alone,</hi> but by the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of GOD upon it. Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for us to <hi>eat and drink for the Glory of GOD,</hi> intending thereby to fit our ſelves for the Work which He has aſſigned us; and Govern our ſelves by the <hi>Rules of Temperance</hi> which GOD has given us.
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:002905_0163_0FE6923EF69217C0"/>Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to think on the <hi>Food which endures to everlaſting Life,</hi> and to <hi>feed</hi> thoſe that are about us, with a <hi>Communication</hi> that may <hi>Edify</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There are the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Piety, for which we have a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> as often as any <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Public Worſhip</hi> are to be attended on. We read, Pſal. XCII. 13. <hi>They that are planted in the Houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our GOD; They ſhall bring forth Fruit.</hi> Verily, as often as we come into the <hi>Houſe of the Lord,</hi> we have a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to <hi>bring forth Fruit</hi> unto our GOD. Yea, We ſhould ſtill come hither with ſuch <hi>Ends</hi> moving of us to come, that our very coming it ſelf ſhould be to <hi>bring forth Fruit</hi> unto our GOD. We have our precious Liberties, to do that thing, <hi>I will bleſs the Lord in the Congregations.</hi> We have eſpecially <hi>One Day</hi> in a Week, allow'd us for this purpoſe. With an Eye to the <hi>Fruits of Piety,</hi> which we have now and here a Seaſon for, our Diſpoſitions are to be thoſe; <hi>My Soul does flame with Thirſt for GOD, ev'n for the Living GOD: When ſhall I come, and when appear before the Face of GOD?</hi> And thoſe, <hi>Lord, Better than a Thouſand is One Day within thy Courts; I on the Threſhold chuſe to keep in the Houſe of my GOD, rather than have my Dwelling in the Tents of Wickedneſs.</hi> When the <hi>Prayers</hi> are made in the Houſe of GOD, Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to accompany the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> and <hi>Petitions</hi> that are offer'd up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD, with a Soul attentively coming into them, and charitably beſpeaking for all the People, a ſhare in the Kindneſſes of <hi>Our Father in the Heavens.</hi> When the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are ſung in the Houſe of GOD, Now is a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> to form ſome
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:002905_0164_0FE692404F25BF20"/>Holy <hi>Note,</hi> and ſome Holy <hi>Wiſh,</hi> from every Verſe, and with <hi>Grace in our Hearts,</hi> make a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody to the Lord.</hi> When the <hi>Sermons</hi> are preached in the Houſe of GOD, Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to <hi>Receive the Truth in the love of it,</hi> and make the <hi>Echo's</hi> of a Conſenting Soul unto all that paſſes in them; and ſend up numberleſs <hi>Ejaculations</hi> unto Heaven; thoſe Ejaculations, <hi>Lord, I own it;</hi> or, <hi>Lord I ask it!</hi> in the Hearing of what is brought from thence unto us. The <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the Lord adminiſtred in the Houſe of our GOD affords us a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> over again to Lament our own <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore a Deliverance from it by the Blood and Power of our Great REDEEMER; and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again <hi>lay hold of the Covenant of GOD</hi> for our ſelves and ours; and alſo to wiſh well unto the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Families of the Neighbourhood. But then, When our SAVIOUR ſets the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD as <hi>Olive-Plants</hi> about His <hi>Table,</hi> Oh! what a <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> have we there to bring forth <hi>all manner of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Fruits unto the Beloved of our Souls!</hi> Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to Admire and Embrace a CHRIST <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſet forth as Crucified before our Eyes;</hi> and be Raviſhed in the <hi>ſweet Meditation,</hi> wherewith Man may now <hi>eat the Food of Angels.</hi> Now is a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> to make all the Sallies of a <hi>Repenting</hi> and a <hi>Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Soul, and a Soul making an Oblation of it ſelf unto GOD in the Flames of Love: O <hi>Spiknard,</hi> Now ſend out thy pleaſant Smell! Now is a <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> to ſtrengthen and confirm the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of an <hi>Heart fixed</hi> for the Ways of GOD. Yea, Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to take the Comforts of all the <hi>very great and precious Promiſes,</hi> which are now <hi>ſealed</hi> unto us, and <hi>Rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of GOD,</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="unknown:002905_0165_0FE6924072C06A98"/>which we ſhall ſee when our Bleſſed JESUS brings us to <hi>ſit in the Heavenly Places with Him.</hi> I will add this one thing more; If <hi>on the Firſt Day of the Week,</hi> there be <hi>Gatherings,</hi> of what <hi>every one has laid by him in ſtore,</hi> out of what GOD has <hi>proſpered</hi> him withal; Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for us to bring the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which <hi>GOD is well-pleaſed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Now ſay, <hi>Gracious GOD, Wilt thou accept this little Quitrent, which confeſſes, that I owe my All un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee!</hi> Even the Widows <hi>Two Mites</hi> are <hi>Good Fruits</hi> unto GOD. But, when I ſaid, <hi>We have one Day in a Week,</hi> thus to <hi>draw near</hi> unto the GOD, whom it is <hi>good for us to draw near</hi> unto, I did not ſay All, that might be ſaid. For we have our <hi>Lectures</hi> too; In which we have a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for thoſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> that our GOD looks to find in the <hi>Fields of Zion.</hi> What <hi>Fruits</hi> may we both taſte, and yield, if we made a due Reſort unto thoſe <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of GOD? Verily, The <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Faithful, at the Lectures, would not be ſo ſcandalouſly Thin, as they generally are, if Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were more careful to <hi>bring forth Fruit in the Seaſon thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. There are <hi>Fruits</hi> of PIETY, for which we have a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> very often when we come into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Company.</hi> The <hi>Tongue</hi> of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto a <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Fruits</hi> which it brings forth unto them that are about him. And thus we read; Prov. XII. 14. <hi>A Man ſhall be ſatisfied with Good, by the Fruit if his Mouth.</hi> Be ſure, <hi>Fruitleſs Viſits</hi> are Things which will be avoided by the <hi>Wiſe</hi> Men, who take the <hi>way that is Above.</hi> When we are upon the <hi>Viſiting</hi> Account,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:002905_0166_0FE692479176D728"/>ſhall not we do well to think, <hi>What Fruit, even what Good, may this Viſit afford a Seaſon for?</hi> The <hi>Viſiters</hi> that are ſo kind as to come unto us, may awaken the like Thoughts in our Minds. If the <hi>Company</hi> which we come into, be <hi>Superiour</hi> to us, Now is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for us to <hi>get Good</hi> by them. We may, by <hi>Queſtions</hi> prudently propoſed, put them upon bringing forth <hi>Fruit,</hi> for our Inſtruction. But if we are more on the level with our <hi>Company,</hi> we have more commonly, Now a <hi>Seaſon</hi> to <hi>do Good</hi> unto them. Let us now ſhun the <hi>Raw Fruits</hi> of Impertinences; the <hi>Sowre Fruits</hi> of Controverſies; the <hi>Stinking Fruits</hi> of an Obſcaene and <hi>Rotten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> Our <hi>Conferences</hi> ought always to have a Tendency to ſomething that is <hi>Good.</hi> Now is a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> as for the <hi>Diſpatch</hi> of the Affairs which we come upon, ſo for them that <hi>Fear the Lord</hi> ſo to <hi>ſpeak unto one another,</hi> that they need not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if their Talk be found <hi>written</hi> in a <hi>Book of Remembrance</hi> before the Lord. Chriſtians, When you are together, do Good unto one another; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> one another; <hi>Quicken</hi> one another; <hi>Comfort</hi> one another. Do your Beſt, that you may be the Better for one another. Now and then propoſe it, <hi>What Good may be done before we part?</hi> Oh! what <hi>Fruit</hi> would be brought forth <hi>in the Seaſon</hi> thereof, if Good Men when they come together, would more ſee to it, that their <hi>coming together</hi> may be <hi>for the Better and not for the Worſe!</hi> But I know, what I ſay will have little Notice taken of it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. There are <hi>Fruits</hi> of PIETY, for which we have a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> when the Buſineſs of our <hi>Temporal Calling</hi> is in its Proſecution. Every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> muſt
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:002905_0167_0FE69247AC1971A8"/>be able to make a ſuitable Reply, to the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory once put unto the Sons of <hi>Iſrael; What is your Occupation?</hi> It is directed, 1. Theſſ. IV. 11. <hi>Study to do your own Buſineſs.</hi> Indeed This Thing it ſelf, is to bring forth <hi>Fruit in the Seaſon</hi> thereof: When a Man minds and plies his <hi>own Buſineſs</hi> in the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof.</hi> The <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of the <hi>Perſonal Calling,</hi> wherein a Man deſerves well of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> and accordingly demands upon it; This is part of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> that ſhould be found upon us. For which cauſe every Man that is employ'd in any <hi>Buſineſs</hi> which is of uſe to <hi>Humane Society,</hi> may challenge what that Maxim of Religion has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for him; <hi>Honour all Men.</hi> The very <hi>Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow</hi> is to be with Reſpect look'd upon. But then, O Chriſtian, Wilt thou not bring forth <hi>Fruit</hi> unto GOD as well as unto <hi>Man,</hi> in the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of thy <hi>Perſonal Calling?</hi> And wilt thou not be at work for <hi>Heaven,</hi> in what thou haſt to do upon <hi>Earth?</hi> How Nobly, how Bravely, how Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, and with what <hi>Songs in the Houſe of thy Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage</hi> will the work proceed, if it may be ſo! Truly, Now 'tis a <hi>Seaſon</hi> for thee, to bring a <hi>Right Principle</hi> into its Operation, and think, <hi>Becauſe GOD my SAVIOUR has ordered this Buſineſs for me, Therefore 'tis that I will now Cheerfully do what my Hand finds to do.

            <p>A <hi>Day of Patience</hi> for <hi>one Year more</hi> is then obtained for a <hi>Barren Fig-tree.</hi> After the utmoſt Hazard of Deſtruction, for a <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> of <hi>Three Years,</hi> an Interceſſion is made, for <hi>one year more,</hi> to be allow'd. It was begg'd, <hi>Lord, Let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone this Year alſo:</hi> that ſo a further Cultivation might be employ'd for the Cure of the offenſive <hi>Barrenneſs.</hi> But, Behold the Conſequence to be expected of the Grant thus made for <hi>Thu Year alſo.</hi> A Thing highly worthy to be deeply conſidered by us; To be ſo at all times; But very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſo, on a Day, when we ſee the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of a <hi>New Year</hi> granted unto us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>whole World</hi> had been very <hi>Barren</hi> of good Men, and of good Things, for no leſs than <hi>Three</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="unknown:002905_0178_0FE69251A895A9E8"/>Thouſands of Years. In the <hi>Fourth,</hi> our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR made Interceſſion for Mankind, which had hitherto ſtood as a <hi>Barren Fig tree.</hi> Upon this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion the Great GOD ſtaid unto the End of the <hi>Fourth.</hi> But then our SAVIOUR Himſelf was brought forth, and the Effuſions of the Holy SPIRIT upon Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kind, then produced thoſe other <hi>Fruits,</hi> for which the World ſtands unto his Day.</p>
            <p>In making this Obſervation, I do not ſay, That I have made an Expoſition of the Parable now before us. But I will obſerve, That our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR being thus brought forth, we have here ſet before us, in a Parable, ſome of the precious <hi>Fruits,</hi> which the Church of GOD has found, in Him and from Him, who is indeed the <hi>Tree of Life.</hi> Our Lord had newly warned the Jews, That if they did not <hi>Repent,</hi> they muſt <hi>periſh.</hi> Now, ſince it might be Enquired, How and why they muſt <hi>periſh,</hi> we have here in a Parable, an Anſwer to that Enquiry. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Song had compared the <hi>Land</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> unto a <hi>Vineyard.</hi> Our SAVIOUR, not without ſome Alluſion to that S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, <hi>there is Hope of the Tree; tho' it be cut down, it ſhall ſprout again, and the Tender Branches thereof will not ceaſe.</hi> 'Twil do ſo at the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> But the Compariſon may be carried on, unto more of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity. O Man, <hi>Thou art the Tree</hi> Every Perſon under the Means of Grace may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto a <hi>Fig-tree.</hi> The Flight which our Fallen
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:002905_0179_0FE69258AC4EF8C8"/>Parents preſently made unto a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> for their Cover and Relief, has added unto our Claim for the Reſemblance. Every Perſon who does not improve in PIETY under the Means of Grace, may be compared unto a <hi>Barren Fig-tree.</hi> But the Danger of ſuch <hi>unfruitfulneſs!</hi> The Doom of <hi>Cutting down</hi> is paſſed upon the <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> after an Expectation excended for <hi>Three Years</hi> to ſee <hi>Fruit</hi> upon it. And Interceſſion is made, for <hi>One Year more</hi> of Expectation. The Conſequence of what ſhall be found upon the Expectation to be ſtill kept for <hi>This Year alſo,</hi> is here declared unto us. And an awful DOCTRINE ſhall introduce yet a fuller Declaration of it.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>When the too-unfruitful Children of Men, have one Year more of the Divine Patience obtained for them, it is of the laſt Conſequence, what Fruit ſhall in This Year be found upon them.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Let us, my Brethren, <hi>begin the Year,</hi> with ſome Admonitions of PIETY, which may be of uſe to us <hi>every Day of the Year,</hi> or, every Day that the <hi>GOD of our Life</hi> ſhall pleaſe to allow us in the Year.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Good Fruit</hi> is to be expected from all that have the means of growing Wiſer and Better, employ'd upon them: A <hi>Good Fruit</hi> of ſuch means. The Voice of GOD, Oh! Voice more than any Thunder to be trembled at! — is this, <hi>Behold, I come ſeeking for Fruit!</hi> People whom GOD places under the means of becoming what they ſhould be, ought to be a <hi>Fruitful People.</hi>

But what is the <hi>Fruit</hi> that is to be looked for? PIETY does in one Word, expreſs the <hi>Fruit</hi> which GOD expects from us all. PIETY and a <hi>Growth</hi> in PIETY. The <hi>Fruit</hi> looked for, is found in the Progreſs of a <hi>Soul Returning to GOD.</hi> GOD our Maker, has imprinted on our Soul, a <hi>Tendency</hi> for a <hi>Return</hi> to Him: In His Goſpel, He does direct and Aſſiſt this <hi>Natural Tendency.</hi> We do in the ways of Sin <hi>Depart</hi> from Him, unto <hi>Creatures.</hi> We <hi>Return</hi> to GOD in the PIETY, which Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers our Obligations to our GOD that made us, and Endeavours to find That in <hi>Him,</hi> which we vainly ſought in <hi>Creatures.</hi> Juſt ſo much Progreſs as we make in this <hi>Return to GOD,</hi> juſt ſo much <hi>Fruit</hi> is to be found upon us. To <hi>Live</hi> unto GOD; This is to bring forth <hi>Fruit</hi> unto Him. Every Act of that <hi>Life,</hi> which lies in ſeeking and ſerving, and pleaſing of GOD, is part of the <hi>Fruit</hi> which is required from us. Or, to uſe another Term for it: <hi>Good Fruit</hi> is found in every Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the <hi>Will</hi> of GOD. <hi>All manner of precious Fruits are laid up for the Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Will you hear the <hi>Good Fruit</hi> expected from you? My Hearers, Give Attention to the Demands of Heaven upon you. 'Tis demanded, That you Repent of <hi>Sin,</hi> and Believe on CHRIST, and give yourſelves up unto GOD. It is demanded, That you place your <hi>Love,</hi> and your <hi>Hope,</hi> and your <hi>Joy,</hi> in the Great GOD, and <hi>walk with Him,</hi> and have <hi>your Eye,</hi> continually unto Him and be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Hu Eye</hi> upon you. It is demanded, That you be <hi>Diligent</hi> in your Callings, and <hi>Ingenuous</hi> in your Dealings, and <hi>Uſeful</hi> unto your Neighbours.</p>
            <p>It is demanded, That you carry it well in your ſeveral <hi>Relations,</hi> and ſo treat your ſeveral <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> as to <hi>Adorn the Doctrine of GOD your SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR.</hi> It is demanded, That you pay ſuitable <hi>Acknowledgements</hi> unto GOD under His various <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> unto you: And, finally, That you place not your <hi>Happineſs</hi> in <hi>This World,</hi> but in the Enjoyments of that <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> where GOD ſhall be <hi>All in All.</hi> Verily, you are <hi>unfruitful,</hi> if ſuch Things as theſe be not found upon you. Be ſure; An Unregenerate Sinner is a <hi>Dead</hi> Thing; a <hi>Tree</hi> that has no <hi>Good Fruits</hi> at all upon it. A

Yea, After <hi>Three Years</hi> of looking for <hi>Good Fruit,</hi> there is often <hi>One Year</hi> more obtained, that it may be ſeen, what <hi>Good Fruit</hi> may be found upon us.</p>
            <p>One Thing to be Remarked is, That the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Tree,</hi> is an <hi>Offence</hi> unto the Glorious GOD. Of an <hi>Unfruitful</hi> Thing, we read, Heb. VI. 8. <hi>It is nigh unto curſing.</hi> Alas, The <hi>Unfruitful</hi> have the <hi>Wrath of GOD abiding</hi> on them. The <hi>Unfruitful</hi> are they with whom <hi>GOD is Angry every Day. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs</hi> is the Grand Crime, for <hi>which the Wrath of GOD comes on the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> Even ſo provoking a Sight unto Heaven is a <hi>Barren Tree,</hi> that it is a Wonder the Fate of the <hi>Tree</hi> in the Viſion of the Chaldean Emperour comes not upon it; A Wonder, that an <hi>Holy Watcher</hi> coming down from Heaven do not <hi>cry aloud,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Hew down the Tree.</hi> But yet it is Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That the <hi>Patience</hi> of the Glorious GOD bears <hi>One Year after another,</hi> with the <hi>Barren Tree.</hi> So is that Word fulfilled; Iſa. XXX. 18. <hi>The Lord waits that He may be Gracious.</hi> The <hi>Ax</hi> is indeed lifted up The <hi>Barren Tree</hi> is ready for the ſtroke of the <hi>Ax.</hi> But there is obtained a Liberty for the <hi>Barren Tree,</hi> to ſtand yet <hi>One Year more.</hi> And how is it obtained? A Seaſonable <hi>Interceſſion</hi> comes in
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:002905_0183_0FE6925A4B2A90F8"/>to obtain it; <hi>Lord, Let it alone this One Year alſo.</hi> So <hi>One Year more</hi> is added unto the <hi>Day of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> The Enquiry may be; Whoſe <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is it, that prevails on this Occaſion? Be ſure, No <hi>Interceſſion</hi> can ſignify any thing for a Sinner, without That of our SAVIOUR. 'Tis our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, who is our <hi>Interceſſor.</hi> Tis He, of whom we are told, Heb. VII. 25. <hi>He ever lives to make Interceſſion for us.</hi> And indeed, an <hi>Authoritative Interceſſion</hi> can be made by none but Him. The <hi>Day of Patience</hi> indulged unto <hi>Reprobates,</hi> even This, is owing to our SAVIOUR. Our SAVIOUR <hi>Intercedes,</hi> that GOD may be Glorified, by length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening out the <hi>Day of Patience,</hi> to thoſe who after all will be <hi>Children of Wrath.</hi> The <hi>Pity,</hi> the <hi>Pity,</hi> in the Heart of the Bleſſed JESUS, for them, does move Him to <hi>Intercede</hi> for a <hi>Day of Patience</hi> to them. And then, for the <hi>Elect</hi> of GOD; The <hi>Day of Patience</hi> proves a <hi>Day of Salvation</hi> for them. Tis as we read, 2 Pet. III. 15. <hi>The Longſuffering of our Lord is Salvation.</hi> The Elect of GOD are for a while, and ſome of them for a long while, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With reſpect unto this <hi>Year,</hi> there is the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of their SAVIOUR for them: <hi>Let them ſtand this Year alſo.</hi> A Sinner that by long <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> has expoſed himſelf to <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> is by the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of our SAVIOUR, preſerved from it.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. That you may be <hi>ſpared this Year alſo,</hi> yea, as not knowing whether you ſhall be ſo, or no, Begin the <hi>Year</hi> with ſuch <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> that ſome <hi>Good Fruit</hi> may even <hi>This Day</hi> be found upon you. Your <hi>Good Fruit</hi> muſt not be put off, as what may <hi>one Year more</hi> be ſtaid for. I do vehemently <hi>This Day</hi> preſs for ſuch Things as theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt; O all you Unconverted ones, <hi>This Day, This Day,</hi> Turn to GOD; and Reſign yourſelves up to the Conduct of your SAVIOUR. Too long, Ah, too long, O miſerable ones, you have been under the Condemnation of a <hi>Total Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 'Tis high Time for you, to come unto That; Pſal. CXIX. 59, 60. <hi>I thought on my Ways, and I turned my Feet unto thy Teſtimonies. I made Haſte and I delay'd not to keep thy Commandments.</hi> Oh!
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:002905_0193_0FE6926BFA06E778"/>
                  <hi>Make Haſte,</hi> and Think not of <hi>Delaying</hi> your Turn to GOD, for <hi>one Year more.</hi> 'Tis enjoined upon you, <hi>Immediately</hi> to give up your ſelves unto GOD, with <hi>Sorrows</hi> for your Wandring after <hi>Idols,</hi> and with <hi>Deſires</hi> that you may <hi>not offend any more. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> Receive your SAVIOUR in all His <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> with all His <hi>Benefits. Immediately</hi> Reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Life of PIETY; and ſay, <hi>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. If any of you are Conſcious, of your having hitherto omitted any thing that ſhould have been ſome of the <hi>Good Fruit</hi> upon you, <hi>This Day</hi> put yourſelves into a way that the <hi>Year</hi> may not roll on much further, before you are come unto it. Of This <hi>Good Fruit,</hi> let that Complaint be heard no longer; Jer. XIII. 27. <hi>When ſhall it once be?</hi> This I preſs on thoſe, that have not yet ſet up the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of GOD in their <hi>Families.</hi> And this I preſs on thoſe who have not yet come into the ſacred Fellowſhip at the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord. Yea, I urge for This; That we do every one of us <hi>This Day,</hi> ſtudy ſomewhat upon that Queſtion; <hi>In what points may I become yet more Fruitful unto GOD?</hi> Indeed I can tell no better way to be <hi>ſpared this Year alſo.</hi> It has been an old ſaying; <hi>Fructus Liberat Arborem.</hi> If the <hi>Tree</hi> would <hi>ſtand,</hi> let it <hi>bear.</hi> O <hi>Bearing Tree,</hi> If thou fall <hi>This Year,</hi> it ſhall be only to Tranſlate thee into the <hi>Eden</hi> that is above.</p>
               <p>There are Two or Three Meditations, which I intreat you in the Evening of <hi>This Day,</hi> to give ſome Entertainment to. <hi>Muſe, till the Fire burns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Think This; <hi>Who knows, which are the Trees among us, that are to be cut down this Year?</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:002905_0194_0FE6926C21F9E040"/>It was of old ſaid unto one; Jer.

And, <hi>Lord, Is it I?</hi> So may every one ſay. No one knows, whoſe Lot it will be; whether it mayn't be <hi>his own, To die this Year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; Think This; <hi>If I am cut down before I begin to bring forth Fruit unto GOD, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me?</hi> Tis a terrible Word; Matth. VII. 19. <hi>Every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ewn down, and caſt into the Fire.</hi> O Tremble, Tremble, at the View of the Formidable <hi>Fire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> Look down into the <hi>Devouring Fire, and the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings!</hi> and ſay, <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee, deliver my Soul!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally; Think This; <hi>Tho' I ſhould not be cut down, yet if I do not bring forth good Fruit, I may be as bad as cut down.</hi> I will fay unto you, what will be <hi>as Bad! As Bad</hi> as a <hi>cutting down</hi> will be that Sentence from the Mouth of GOD; Matth. XXI. 19. <hi>Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.</hi> To be <hi>Judicially</hi> given up unto Eternal Blindneſs, and Hardneſs, and Ungodlineſs; O! Tis a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thing. Beware, Beware, leſt this come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Deprecate it wonderfully.</p>
               <p>And now Retire; If you preſently <hi>bring forth Fruit,</hi> Even, <hi>This Day;</hi> for a <hi>To Morrow</hi> muſt not be talk'd of; <hi>Tis well!</hi> But, <hi>if not,</hi>— Then <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter That!</hi>—who can ſay, what is to follow? Oh! Conſider of it.</p>
               <p>I have done. I know not what ſort of a <hi>New Year</hi> others may wiſh you. But I wiſh you a <hi>Pious New Year;</hi> A <hi>New Year</hi> filled with the <hi>Fruits</hi> of

            <p>THE <hi>Joy of Harveſt</hi> is now before us! Here is an <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that never will, never can, miſs of a Glorious <hi>Harveſt!</hi> The <hi>Husbandry</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in the Fields of <hi>Nature,</hi> often miſſes of the <hi>Harveſt</hi> expected by the <hi>Husbandman.</hi> Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy from GOD, has brought a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> and a <hi>Failing</hi> of the <hi>Harveſt</hi> which we have Laboured for.

Joy is withered away from the Sons of Men.</hi> But in the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of PIETY, a Bleſſed and a Joyful <hi>Harveſt</hi> is never miſſed of. We are advsſed from Heaven of it; It ſhall have a <hi>Sure Reward.</hi> The <hi>Reward</hi> of PIETY is the <hi>Harveſt</hi> of it. Of this, the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has here given us this Aſſurance; <hi>Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due ſeaſon we ſhall Reap, if we faint not.</hi> It ſeems,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:002905_0198_0FE6927444CD3B98"/>The <hi>Work</hi> of PIETY may not be without its <hi>Weariſome Difficulties:</hi> Things which our <hi>Carnal Minds</hi> may diſpoſe us to be too ſoon weary of. But, Hold on, Hold out, O <hi>Unwearied</hi> PIETY. There will be an <hi>Harveſt,</hi> wherein thou ſhalt <hi>Reap,</hi> what will be a <hi>Great Reward,</hi> yea, a <hi>Full Reward</hi> of all: The Oracles of our GOD have expreſly called it ſo. But it is a <hi>Seaſon</hi> that muſt be waited for.</p>
            <p>Our Apoſtle is exhorting of the Faithful to ſhake off, yea, <hi>cut off.</hi> (with a juſt <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) the <hi>Falſe Teachers</hi> from whom they ſuffered more than a little <hi>Trouble.</hi> But at the ſame time, he exhorts them to advance a <hi>Liberal Maintainance</hi> for the Orthodox, Diligent, Vigilant <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel. He would have them to beware, leſt they <hi>mocked GOD</hi> in their <hi>Parſimony</hi> on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but aſſerts unto them, that their <hi>Liberality</hi> in this Matter, would not fail of a <hi>Recompence.</hi> There would be a Deſireable <hi>Harveſt</hi> of it. But it is aſſerted in ſuch Terms, as to extend unto the whole Work of PIETY. And now, having that Commiſſion; Iſa. III. 10. <hi>Say ye to the Righteous, that it ſhall be well; For they ſhall eat the Fruit of their Doings:</hi> I will now <hi>execute</hi> it, <hi>ſaying</hi> what I am thus led unto. What I have to ſay, is in this <hi>Admonition</hi> of GOD our SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>Difficulties</hi> the Work of PIETY may be encumbred withal, yet, <hi>Thy Work ſhall be Rewarded, ſaith the Lord:</hi> There will be a <hi>Joyful Harveſt</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The Work of PIETY is, that <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> which has been ſumm'd up in that Wedge
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:002905_0199_0FE648E839A94E88"/>of Gold; Eccl. XII. 13. <hi>Fear GOD, and keep H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Work,</hi> it is ordered by the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of a Sovereign GOD, that it ſhall be attended with <hi>Difficulties;</hi> even ſuch as may render a <hi>Toilſome Husbandry</hi> a Reſemblance of it. That which cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of this Work, is principally the <hi>Self-denial,</hi> which our <hi>Carnal Mind,</hi> makes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be exerciſed, in our doing of it. Our <hi>Fleſh</hi> muſt be croſs'd, and our <hi>Appetites</hi> muſt be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; yea, there are <hi>Enemies</hi> to be Encountred, that are not eaſily to be Conquered; or elſe the Work of PIETY can't be carried on.</p>
            <p>But, GOD will <hi>not forget this Work and Labour of Love.</hi> O PATIENCE, Do thou perſiſt, even to <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> in the work of PIETY; There will be a <hi>Joyful Harveſt</hi> of it. Things muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according unto that Word; Jam. V. 7. <hi>Be Patient, Brethren;— Behold, The Husbandman waiteth for the precious Fruits of the Earth, and hath long Patience for it, until he receive the Early and Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rain. Be ye alſo Patient.</hi> —</p>
            <p>We have Two Enquiries before us. The firſt is, <hi>What will be the Harveſt of PIETY? What the Reward that ſhall be Reap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>The firſt Propoſition.</head>
               <p>Even in <hi>this preſent Life, Laborious</hi> PIETY will ſee ſome <hi>Good Reward of its Labour:</hi> In the midſt of the <hi>Sufferings of this preſent Time,</hi> we ſhall <hi>Reap</hi> ſome <hi>Harveſt</hi> of our PIETY! Before we Dy, we may ſee ſome <hi>Firſt Fruits;</hi> and our PIETY may have ſome <hi>Conſequences,</hi> which may be ſome <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations</hi> to us, for all the <hi>Difficulties</hi> which have diſtreſſed it. In the Work of PIETY we may have thoſe things done for us, which may be a ſort of <hi>Roaſting Ears</hi> to entertain us, by way of <hi>Earneſt</hi> and <hi>Eſſay,</hi> towards the Fulfilment of that Word; Eph.

               <p>It is obſervable; The People of GOD are put unto Conſiderable <hi>Expenſes,</hi> that the <hi>Ordinances of Heaven</hi> may be ſupported in the Churches of the Lord. In theſe <hi>Expences</hi> there is, what our Inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apoſtle here calls, <hi>A ſowing to the Spirit.</hi> There follows, <hi>Of the Spirit a Reaping of Life Everlaſting.</hi> This will be ſome <hi>Harveſt</hi> of it. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Godly Man, who is <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Bountiful</hi> in theſe <hi>Expenſes,</hi> will be moſt likely to profit under the <hi>Means of Grace;</hi> moſt likely to flouriſh with ſuch <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> as will bring on <hi>Everlaſting Life.</hi> The Good of the <hi>Word;</hi> verily, 'Tis more to be valued than the Good of the <hi>World.</hi> GOD will bleſs thee with a <hi>Profitable Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Obſervation akin to This, may be made; The more <hi>Pains</hi> any Take, and the more <hi>Travel</hi> or <hi>Hardſhip,</hi> they paſs through, that they may wait upon GOD in His Inſtitutions; The more does our Gracious GOD often grant unto ſuch Devout Souls, of <hi>Communion</hi> with Himſelf in them. They are well-paid for their <hi>Pains,</hi> in what of GOD they meet withal. There will be an Immediate <hi>Harveſt!</hi> The <hi>Rain</hi> with which they have been Weather beaten, is requited in the <hi>Rain</hi> of the Heavenly <hi>Doctrine,</hi> falling ſweetly on their Souls. The <hi>Cold</hi> which has pinched them, is requited in the <hi>Heavenly Warmth,</hi> with which they find their Souls invigorated. Or, If they leave any <hi>Pleaſant Company,</hi> for the ſake of ſecret Interviews with Heaven, they meet with ſuch <hi>Pleaſures</hi> in the
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:002905_0202_0FE6476D29095348"/>Company of GOD, that they can teſtify, <hi>An Hour in the Cloſet is better than a thouſand elſewhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover; Chriſtian, under Afflictions from the Hand of GOD, <hi>Let Patience have its perfect Work.</hi> There will be this <hi>Harveſt</hi> of it; The <hi>Conſolations of GOD,</hi> which are <hi>not ſmall,</hi> ſhall fill <hi>thy</hi> Contented Mind. With much <hi>Submiſſion</hi> bear the Death of thy <hi>Off-ſpring;</hi> Thy GOD will have this <hi>Mourners Cordial</hi> ready for thee; <hi>I give my Son unto thee! Thou art one of my Children!

               <p>Again; Under <hi>Injuries</hi> from the Hand of Man; Take no <hi>Perſonal Revenge;</hi> Be <hi>Full of Goodneſs;</hi> and even <hi>overcome Evil with Good:</hi> Seek not that which <hi>Fleſh and Blood</hi> may call <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> There will be this <hi>Harveſt</hi> of it.

                  <hi>Sealing</hi> SPIRIT of GOD will power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſay unto thee, <hi>Be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi> The <hi>Tranquility</hi> of Soul, which thou ſhalt enjoy in the ſenſe of thy own <hi>Pardon</hi> from GOD, while thou doſt generouſly <hi>Pardon</hi> the Worm that has wronged thee; This, This will be the trueſt <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally; A Furious and Fiery Aſſault of <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> 'tis no eaſy thing to Reſiſt it. To gratify a <hi>Temptation,</hi> appears the moſt agreeable thing in the World unto a Man, who has the <hi>Blinding
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:002905_0203_0FE6476D414E2AE0"/>Force</hi> of it upon him. There is no little <hi>Difficulty,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>How ſhall I do this Wickedneſs, and Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD?</hi> But now, the <hi>Harveſt</hi> will be this. There is a marvellous <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> of Soul, wherewith a <hi>Victory</hi> over <hi>Temptation</hi> uſes to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied. O <hi>Bleſſed Overcomer,</hi> thou ſhalt find a thouſand times more Delight in <hi>Conquering</hi> of a Temptation, than thou couldeſt have had in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi> to it. Thus is there accompliſhed, that Word concerning the <hi>Maxims</hi> of PIETY; Pſal. XIX. 11. <hi>In keeping them there is great Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, Secondly; The Work of PIETY may <hi>Reap</hi> ſome <hi>Harveſt,</hi> even in the <hi>Temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of this World. In the Work of PIETY, we are called often to part with ſuch Things, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and we count <hi>our Intereſt:</hi> But the Work is often <hi>Rewarded</hi> in thoſe very Things. Our GOD will not ſuffer us to be <hi>Loſers,</hi> in <hi>thoſe very Points</hi> wherein we offer to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Another Catalogue of <hi>Remarkable Things,</hi> is now to be hearken'd to.</p>
               <p>Behold, The <hi>Harveſt!</hi> O <hi>Well-doer, Truſt</hi> thy GOD in the way of <hi>Well-doing:</hi> Thou ſhalt be no <hi>loſer</hi> by thy <hi>Truſt in GOD.</hi> A wondrous Thing fell out, in the Land of <hi>Iſrael!</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt go up <hi>Thrice</hi> a Year unto the <hi>ſtated Feſtivals.</hi> They ran a great <hi>Venture</hi> in what they did. They left their <hi>Families</hi> expoſed unto the Enemies that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded them. Who ſhould now protect their <hi>Families?</hi> They had a Glorious Protector. GOD undertook their Protection; and ſaid, Exod. XXXIV. 24. <hi>No Man ſhall deſire thy Land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy GOD.</hi> They were to <hi>Truſt</hi> GOD with all they had; and
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:002905_0204_0FE6476EB4AE2908"/>GOD <hi>kept</hi> all they had. When we have plain <hi>Duty</hi> lying before us, let us do our <hi>Duty,</hi> and let us <hi>truſt</hi> GOD with the <hi>Event</hi> of it. The <hi>Event</hi> will be far better than if we had <hi>ſhunn'd</hi> the <hi>Duty,</hi> becauſe we <hi>fear'd</hi> the <hi>Event.</hi> The <hi>GOD of Truth</hi> loves to be <hi>relied</hi> upon. We never fare ſo well, as in the way of <hi>Reliance</hi> upon GOD. The <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reprover</hi> afterwards finds more <hi>Favour</hi> than the <hi>Fawning Flatterer.</hi> Sacrifice thy <hi>Friends,</hi> O Man of GOD, in thy <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> againſt Miſcarriages. GOD will multiply thy <hi>Friends.</hi> It may be, He will make the Rebuked and Cenſured <hi>Offenders</hi> themſelves to become thy <hi>Friends.</hi> Eminent <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> of the Lord, often run deſperate Riſques in and for their brave <hi>Confeſſions.</hi> But how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>trangely have the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of GOD been often provided for! Turned out of their Livings, the <hi>Sixth</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Matthew</hi> has made Proviſion for them; They have lived upon it.</p>
               <p>Behold, The <hi>Harveſt!</hi> Be very <hi>Bountiful,</hi> O thou <hi>Deviſer of Good,</hi> in thy Oblations for <hi>Pious Uſes;</hi> Thou ſhalt loſe nothing, but be Enriched by thy <hi>Bounties.</hi> To <hi>lay out</hi> will be to <hi>lay up.</hi> What a <hi>Judas</hi> calls, <hi>A Waſte,</hi> thou ſhalt find far from ſo. We are ſo inſtructed; Eccl. XI. 1. <hi>Caſt thy Bread-Corn on the moiſt Ground; for thou ſhalt find it after many Days;</hi> Or, In a multitude of Days. For, <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſiders the Poor, the Lord ſpall preſerve him, and keep him alive.</hi> No <hi>Uſury</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that of <hi>Lending to the Lord.</hi> GOD <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pays</hi> them who do it, with unaccountable <hi>Additions</hi> to their Poſſeſſions. While Men <hi>do Good</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi> they find, that they <hi>Scatter</hi> and yet <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> They find that while they <hi>Honour the Lord
