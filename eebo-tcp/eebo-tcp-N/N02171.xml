            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the <hi>READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Conduct of Divine Providence in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs the Publication of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermon, was thus; One that heard it Preach'd, asked the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> for a Copy, who expreſſed his willingneſs to grant it. He that heard it Preached was ſoon after in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſeveral <hi>Miniſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons,</hi> unto whom upon Repreſentation made of ſaid Sermon, and propoſal for a Collection for the Printing of it, It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with; whereupon Addreſs was made to the Worthy Author for a Copy and obtained it of him. The Lord in mercy Reward the Author according to his pains &amp; good will for Publick Good thereby; &amp; the Perſons at whoſe expence the Impreſſion was made, having expended of their Subſtance in ſo good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> a way of leading men to the honour of God. The known Eminence of the Author and the Reading the Enſuing Sermon will Commend it to you. The Singularity of it is that it brings Error under view, that you may be alarumed &amp; ſhun it, &amp; Truth that you may Embrace it and keep it. It aims at the Advancing Good Preaching, which being done it tends to advance Good Hearing, which being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, Hearers do advance unto, &amp; in Faith &amp; Piety. The Scope is Sublime, the Matter is Pertinent: Preachers are Directed as to the matter manner and End of Preaching, &amp; Hearers are Directed to try the matter of Preaching and to Determine what is Sound. It leads to the preparing of Preachers and Hearers to rejoice together in the Day of Accounts
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002585_0003_0FDB14F96F96FFA8"/>
Another Remark that I will make to you of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe, is, that it Imitates the Method that CHRIST our great Shepherd took for the Reforming the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which was that <hi>John</hi> ſhould write to the Angels or Paſtors of the Churches, That they might firſt ſee their own Defaults &amp; be awakened to amend themſelves, and thereupon be prepared &amp; animated to Reprove, to Reform their People. Miniſters being Orthodox and Fervent in Preaching, Prudent in their Conduct, &amp; Exemplary in their Converſation, are Excellent Bleſſings to a Place. Have you plenty of Good Preaching? You are highly favoured of God, you have the means of making the beſt Gains; Bleſs GOD for it, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem your Preacher highly in Love for his Works ſake, If you are under Dull Preaching, take heed of a froward Mouth and wrangling Carriage. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your Preacher is ſuch as God's Providence hath carved to you; and remember that GOD is able to give to you help in that matter. Lament it before GOD, &amp; Pray Night &amp; Day for your Preacher, that the LORD will enlarge him with Grace and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Gifts; and do what you can to Advantage him in his great Work.</p>

In order to his incouragement (in caſe of diſorders by Stubborn Perſons) ſay to him, as <hi>Shechaniah</hi> did to <hi>Ezra,</hi> Ezra 10.4 <hi>Ariſe, for this matter belongeth unto thee, we alſo will be with thee: be of good Courage</hi>— And look into his Outward ſtate, if it be low, diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, ſow more Liberally of your Earthly things, in order to his help &amp; in order unto &amp; in hope of Reaping more plentifully of his Spiritual good things. Moreover, Intreat him as a Father, to ſtrive &amp; Pray for Enlargement in his work. Don't enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch low tho'ts of him as to neglect to improve
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002585_0004_0FDB154E37AC7100"/>
him as your Spiritual Counſellor &amp; Guide, to help in difficult and darkſom Caſes, and to Spiritual Fruitfulneſs and to the pleaſure of Piety. Try what Improvements will do, to your own and his advantage, As the Improvement of a Bodily Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is the way of increaſing his Skill, ſo is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of a Spiritual Phyſician. Look that in your Converſe or Viſits, you be not too prolix or tedious, ſo as to occaſion his or your miſpence of &amp; loſs of Time.</p>
            <p>If by the Reading a Paſſage in the Enſuing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to this purpoſe, <hi>That it is frequent with Perſons that have attained to Converſion, to know the Time of their Converſion</hi>; Your Soul ſhould be caſt into a darkſom dejected Caſe, becauſe altho' you have thought you had been Converted, now you fear you was deceived, becauſe you don't know the Time of your Converſion. Then</p>
            <p n="1">1. Don't hang in doubt about the Life of Grace that you are called unto. Don't quiet your ſelf with a thinking that it is Likely that you are Converted. But;</p>
            <p n="2">2. Commune with your ſelf. Search your Heart, Try your ſtate; that you may find whether there hath not been the acting of Faith, of Repentance, Love to God &amp; Chriſt, &amp; love to Fellow-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Conſider whether you have not experienc'd that God hath ſhed abroad His Love in your Heart by His Holy Spirit. And if after your Care to find a reaſon for a Good Hope, you are doubtful whether your Reaſon thereof be good, get the Judgment of an Experienced Miniſter, whether the reaſon of your Hope is good. If you can find no ſign of Grace, but do find reaſon to believe, and do verily believe, that a Saving Change hath never been wrought in you. Then</p>
            <p n="1">1. Lament, bewail your Caſe before GOD, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh! Wretched Perſon I am, who ſhall deliver
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002585_0005_0FDB155279F3AD98"/>
me from the Body of this Death? I am Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Poor, Blind and Naked.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve that your help is to be found in GOD. He tells you, Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in Me is thy help found.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Pray earneſtly that the Holy Ghoſt may come unto you &amp; Convince you of Sin, Righteouſneſs and Judgment; that he will make the Law your School-maſter: That ſheweth to you your Condemned Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed ſtate. The want of a thorough Work of the Law is the unhappineſs of a great part of Profeſſors. You muſt earneſtly Employ your ſelf in Reading or Hearing &amp; Meditating of the Doctrine of God's Righteous Law, &amp; in making particular Application of the Sentence &amp; Curſe of it to your ſelf. Read and Meditate of the Doctrine of the work of the Holy Spirit preparatory to Faith Seek for the Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Powerful Operation of GOD to attend the means of Convincing you of your Sinfulneſs, Vileneſs and Nothingneſs, as to Meriting Favour from GOD.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Watch, Pray and Wait, Night and Day, that GOD will make His Mercy known to you, in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into you His Spirit of Grace and Supplication. Patiently wait upon Him in His appointed ways, to know a Time of a Lively Faith on CHRIST, a Time of Repentance or of Love to GOD, and to Fellow-Chriſtians, ſo as to know a Time of your Converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas the Uſe of Notes in Preaching, is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by ſuch a worthy Father in our Iſrael</hi>; I wiſh it may extend to Correct or Prevent the uſe of Notes ſo as to <hi>carry along the Finger with the Line,</hi> as hath been Practiſed by ſome, <hi>a deſpicable way,</hi> like Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Spelling. And it will be well Improved by others that <hi>do uſe Notes</hi> in a leſs Degree, by their being led to an Examination of their Practiſe, and to a faulting themſelves, if it be through a want of Care
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:002585_0006_0FDB15536A4336C0"/>
and Pains; but <hi>if the Uſe of Notes</hi> be from a being Conſcious of a <hi>weakneſs of Memory,</hi> by their being led to an humble Uſe of them, &amp; an Obſervation of the neceſſity thereof, that their Hearers may not loſe much of the benefit of their <hi>Studying</hi> for them. If Notes muſt be uſed, let there be a due Care not to depend ſo on them as to hinder Geſture in Preaching and an holy Inſpection of the Congregation: Let there be Endeavours to attain in a good Degree, to the ſcope of our Reverend Leader and Father, <hi>viz.</hi> the Emendation or Bettering of our Preaching. Our Indebtedneſs to him for the enſuing Diſcourſe and other Fruits of his Labours, Extant for Publick Benefit, is to be acknowledged: May we Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Receive and well Improve them, and he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive anſwerable Reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Deſire &amp; Prayer is, that the Bleſſing of</hi> CHRIST <hi>may attend the following Labour of his Servant, to advancement of the Spiritual Proſperity of his People and the Honour of his Name,</hi> viz. <hi>of CHRIST our Glorious Redeemer; and that he will be with his</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <hi>of his Goſpel always even to the End.</hi>

                  <p>The Scribes and the Phariſees ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN theſe Words is a Direction given by Chriſt unto the People: Where we have</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Foundation of the Rule, The Scribes &amp; Phariſees ſit on <hi>Moſes</hi> Seat. Some take this as ſpoken of the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim, who were the Succeſſors of Moſes and the Seventy Elders of Iſrael. Poſſibly that may be a miſtake, for ſeveral of the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim were not Phariſees. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.3. For the chief Prieſts did belong to that Society, <hi>Act.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002585_0008_0FDB15572F5E9E10"/>
4.6. And they are ſaid to be Sadducees; but by Scribes &amp; Phariſees I underſtand the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Teachers among the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Prieſts and Levites were more eſpecially Devoted to the ſtudy of the Law; Deut. 33.10 <hi>They ſhall teach Jacob thy Judgments, and Iſrael thy Law</hi>—. Yet others that were Learned in the Law, were made uſe of to Inſtruct the People, &amp; were choſen to be Rulers of the Synagogues. The Phariſees were of any Tribe, <hi>Paul</hi> who Was of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was a Phariſee by Education, as he tells Act. 23.6. — <hi>I am a Phariſee, the ſon of a Phariſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the Rule given, What they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do. This muſt needs be underſtood with that Limitation, when they Teach according to the Mind of God. Sometimes they taught for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, &amp; then it was Sinful &amp; Dangerous to obſerve their Directions. If the Blind lead the Blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14. The Doctrine is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> There may be a great deal of good Preaching in a Country, and yet a great want of good Preaching.</p>
            <p>It is a felicity to a People when there is good Preaching in the Land, yet there may in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002585_0009_0FDB155BBAEFE7E8"/>
the ſame Land, be great want of good Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some things that are very uſeful may be plainly and fully taught, and other things that might be as uſeful may be Neglected; many ſound Principles in Religion may be Taught, and other things that are of great Concernment unto Souls may be omitted. Miniſters don't ſufficiently do their Duty, if they Preach many ſound Truths, and do it convincingly and with good affection, if they do it with great clearneſs and evidence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they neglect other things that are needful to Salvation. And ſo it falls out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that men that make many good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, are very defective in Preaching ſome other things that they ought to Preach.</p>
            <p>I ſhall clear this in Three Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the Scribes and Phariſees in Iſrael. They taught the People that there was only One God the Maker of all things; and were great Enemies to the Idolatry that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were guilty of, before the Babyloniſh Captivity; as the Scribe owned to Chriſt, Mark. 12.32. <hi>Well, Maſter, thou haſt ſaid the truth: for there is one God, and there is none other but he.</hi> They taught many Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that men muſt love God &amp; believe his Word; that they muſt be Juſt &amp; Chaſt and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002585_0010_0FDB155CC7517960"/>
men of Truth, and were very ſtrict in the Obſervation of the Sabbath: They limitted men how far they might go on the Sabbath. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.12. We read of a Sabbath days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. They taught truly the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Dead: Act. 23.7, 8. The Phariſees diſſented from the Sadducees, <hi>the Sadducees ſay there is no Reſurrection, nor Angel nor Spirit, but the Phariſees confeſs both.</hi> They taught that the Meſſiah was to come; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans themſelves received that Doctrine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.25 They were very punctual in teaching Circumciſion &amp; the Ceremonies of the Law of Moſes, about Sacrifices, Tythes, and Legal Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>But they were very faulty in Preaching in other particulars: They were ignorant of the Doctrine of Regeneration, So Nicodemus, Joh. 3.4. he ſays, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old?</hi> They taught that the firſt motions of Luſt, if the Will did not conſent, were not Sins. As we may gather from Rom. 7.7. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, I had not known Luſt, except the Law had ſaid thou ſhalt not Covet. And from Mat. 5.27, 28. <hi>It was ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not commit Adultery. But I ſay whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery in his heart.</hi> They taught alſo that dangerous Doctrine of Justification by Works, Rom. 10.3. <hi>They went about to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002585_0011_0FDB155DF844F3F8"/>
their own Righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. 9.2.3 <hi>They ſought it as it were by the works of the Law:</hi> They taught the People that in caſe they devoted their Eſtates to the Temple, they need not relieve their Fathers or Mothers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.4, 5; 6. And above all they taught that JESUS of Nazareth was not the Meſſiah, brought many Objections againſt Him; As that He came out of Galilee, was a Glutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man and a Wine bibber, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. A friend of Publicans and Sinners: They Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached Him that by the Devil he caſt out Devils: and they were very dull in their Preaching, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the Papiſts. They teach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity truly, and the Attributes of God: So the Doctrine of the Incarnation of CHRIST, and that He died for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and is at the Right hand of God: They teach the Doctrine of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of Heaven and of Hell, and many Moral Rules.</p>
            <p>But they Preach a multitude of falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines with theſe Doctrines, that are perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the Souls of men: They teach men to ſeek the pardon of their Sin by afflicting their Bodies, by Pilgrimage &amp; paying a ſum of Money: They teach many horrible things with reſpect to their Pope, that he has power
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002585_0012_0FDB1563B0E61100"/>
to forgive Sin, to diſpenſe with inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Marriages; that he has power over all the Churches and may diſpenſe with the Laws of GOD; that he is infallible: They teach the Doctrine of Image-worſhip, aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Second Commandment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They teach Prayer to Saints departed, the Unlawfulneſs of Prieſts Marriages, the Doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Juſtification by Works, a conditional Election, the power of Free-will, falling from Grace, and Hundreds of other Erroneous Doctrines: They do indeed ſubvert the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of the Arminians. Many of them Preach very profitably, about GOD and the Perſon of CHRIST, about Juſtification by Faith and Univerſal Obedience, about the Day of Judgment &amp; of Eternal Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>But there is a great deal of want of good Preaching among them: They decry all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Decrees of Election and Reprobation, making the Decrees of God to depend on the foreſight of Repentance or Impenitence; they aſſert Univerſal Redemption, as if Chriſt died to make all men Salvable: They deny the Propagation of Sin, ſaying men become ſinners by Imitation: They hold a Power in Man to withſtand the Grace of GOD; that after GOD has done His work, it is in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002585_0013_0FDB1564A5CB9150"/>
power of Man to refuſe to be Converted: They don't acknowlege the ſervitude of man to Sin, but hath power with that aſſiſtance that God affords, to Convert himſelf: They deny the Doctrine of Perſeverance. Theſe things draw a great train of Errors after them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reaſon of the Doctrine</hi> is, Becauſe ſome Preachers are men of Learning &amp; Moral <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and they have drunk in ſome Errors, &amp; they want Experience. Learning and Morality will qualify men to make many good and profitable Sermons, much for the Edification of the Hearers. Learning qualifies men to clear up many Principles of Religion; and a Moral diſpoſition may fit men zealouſly to Reprove vicious Practices: But men may be Learned men, yet drink in very Corrupt Doctrines. Learning is no ſecurity againſt Erronious Principles: The Phariſees and Sadducees were men of Liberal Education, yet leavened with many falſe Principles: Mat. 16.6 <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Phariſees &amp; Sadducees.</hi> &amp; ver. 12. <hi>Then underſtood they that he bid them not beware of the leaven of bread; but of the doctrine of the Phariſees &amp; of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees.</hi> Learning will not cure thoſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Heart that do expoſe men to falſe Opinions; Learning will not cure the Pride &amp; Conceitedneſs of mens Hearts. Men
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002585_0014_0FDB1565A3205AF8"/>
of Learning may lean too much to their own Underſtanding. Men of Learning may be led aſide by Reading Erronious Books. Learned Education will not deliver men from Carnal Reaſon: Men of corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are very inclinable to imbibe bad Principles: Men of Learning may be blind men. Chriſt ſays of the Phariſees, <hi>They be blind, leaders of the blind,</hi> Mat. 15.14. Moſt of the Errors in the world in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have been hatched by men of Learning. <hi>Arius, Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> were Learned men: Errors in Religion have been generally the Off-ſpring of great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, have been propagated by them. And men may be Moral men that have no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the work of God upon their hearts. Men may be Zealous men againſt Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Whoredom, that have no Saving Knowledge of Chriſt. Many Moral men have no Communion with God; no Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Saving Change in their own Souls. Men may be very Moral &amp; have no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a work of Humiliation, or being bro't off from their own Righteouſneſs, or a work of Faith; of the difference that is between the Common and Special work of the Spirit; of the difference between Saving &amp; Common Illumination, of the working of the heart under Temptation, of the way wherein godly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002585_0015_0FDB156B1ED16F50"/>
men are wont to find Relief. Every Learned &amp; Moral man is not a Sincere Convert, &amp; ſo not able to ſpeak exactly and experimentally to ſuch things as Souls want to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in. It is as with a man that has ſeen a Map of a Country, or has read a great deal about it; he can't tell the way between Town and Town, and hundreds of particular Circumſtances, as a man that has Travelled or Lived there is able to do. Experience fits men to Teach others. A man that has himſelf had only a common work of the Spirit and judges it ſaving, is very unfit to judge of the State of other men. Men Would not put their Lives into the hands of an unskilful Phyſician, or truſt their Ship with an unskilful Pilot, or an intricate Caſe depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Law with an unskilful Lawyer.</p>
            <p>USE, I. <hi>Of Examination,</hi> Whether it be not thus in this Country? It is notoriouſly known by thoſe that are acquainted with the ſtate of the Chriſtian World, that tho' there be many eminent Truths taught, yet there is a great want of good Preaching; whence it comes to paſs, that among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors a ſpirit of Piety runs exceeding low. But it is proper for us to take notice how it is among our ſelves; and tho' it be very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there is a great deal of good Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002585_0016_0FDB156C263C6FD8"/>
in the Land, and the way of Salvation is Preached with a great deal of plainneſs &amp; power, and many men are very faithful to declare all the Counſel of God; yet there may be cauſe of Lamentation, that there is a great deal wanting in ſome places: Some may be very much to blame in not Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they ought to do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If any be taught that frequently men are ignorant of the Time of their Converſion, that is not good Preaching.</hi> Some are of that Opinion, and its like they may drink it in from their Miniſters. This is a deluſion, and it may do them a great deal of hurt; it hardens men in their Natural Condition. <hi>Paul</hi> knew the time of his Converſion; <hi>At Midday, O King, I ſaw a Light from Heaven, above the brightneſs of the Sun,</hi> Act. 26.13. Men are frequently at a loſs whether their Converſion were true or not; but ſurely men that are Converted muſt take ſome notice of the Time when God made a Change in them: Converſion is a great change, from darkneſs to light, from death to life, from the borders of deſpair to a ſpirit of faith in Chriſt. As for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Converſation, there is ſometimes little difference; men might carry very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But as to the frame of mens Hearts, there is a very great difference. Formerly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002585_0017_0FDB156FE97E0E18"/>
they were under the reigning power of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Goſpel, when Converted they receive it as a Divine Truth; before they were Converted they were under a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation, now they have Peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt. Men are generally a long time ſeeking Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, labouring to get an intereſt in Chriſt; and it would be much if when God reveals Chriſt to them, they ſhould not take notice of it when the change is made; Ten to one but Conſcience will take notice of it. When a Seaman comes into the Harbour, when a Priſoner is pardoned, when a Victory is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, when a Diſeaſe is broke, it would be much if men ſhould take no notice of them. Converſion is the greateſt change that men undergo in this world, ſurely it falls under Obſervation. The Prodigal knew well enough the time of his return to his Fathers houſe: The Children of Iſrael knew the time of their paſſing over Jordan.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If any be taught that Humiliation is not neceſſary before Faith, that is not good Preaching.</hi> Such Doctrine has been taught privately and publickly, and is a means to make ſome men miſtake their condition, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy when they are miſerable: For men muſt be brought off from their own
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002585_0018_0FDB15716CA24500"/>
Righteouſneſs before they be brought to Chriſt. Men that think they have any thing to appeaſe the Wrath of God and ingratiate themſelves, will not accept the Calls of the Goſpel in Sincerity. While People have a Foundation to build upon, they will not build upon Chriſt. A Self-righteous ſpirit is quite contrary to the Goſpel: If men be Self-righteous men, they will not judge it fair for God to caſt them off. Men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Juſtice of God, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the meer Mercy of God. Men that lay claim to Heaven from their own Works, will not depend on that Plea that Chriſt has given his life a Ranſom for many, and has Redeemed us from the Curſe being made a Curſe for us. Multitudes of men are ruined by building upon a Sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Men muſt ſee their Malady, before they ſee their Remedy. Men muſt be led into the Underſtanding of the badneſs of their Hearts &amp; the ſtrictneſs of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will be convinced of the Preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt. Men that can heal their own Conſciences, will not come to Chriſt for healing. Men muſt be driven by neceſſity indeed before they come to Chriſt. Tho' men feel great terrors and live a tormented Life, yet they will not come to Chriſt, till driven out of themſelves. Men muſt feel
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002585_0019_0FDB15755C99EE10"/>
themſelves dead in ſin, in order to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; Rom. 7.9. <hi>Sin revived, and I died.</hi> Men muſt ſee themſelves poor &amp; miſerable, wretched &amp; blind and naked, before they receive that Counſel of buying of Chriſt gold tried in the fire, and white raiment, <hi>Rev</hi> 3.17 18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When men don't Preach much about the danger of Damnation, there is want of good Preaching.</hi> Some Miniſters Preach much about moral Duties and the bleſſed Eſtate of godly Men, but don't ſeek to awaken Sinners &amp; make them ſenſible of their danger; they cry for Reformation: Theſe things are very needful in their places to be ſpoken unto; but if Sinners don't hear often of Judgment and Damnation, few will be Converted. Many men are in a deep Sleep and flatter themſelves as if there was no Hell, or at leaſt that God will not deal ſo harſhly with them as to <hi>Damn</hi> them. Pſal. 36.2. <hi>He flattereth himſelf in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</hi> They need to be told of the Terrors of the Lord, that they may flee from Wrath to come: A little matter will not ſcare men, their hearts be as hard as a ſtone, as hard as a piece of the nether milſtone, &amp; they will be ready to laugh at the ſhaking of the Spear. Miniſters muſt give them no reſt in ſuch a condition: They muſt pull
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002585_0020_0FDB1577678DEE48"/>
them as Brands out of the burnings. It is well if Thunder and Lightning will awaken them; They had need to fear that they may work out their Salvation with fear &amp; tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Miniſters are faulty when they ſpeak to them with gentleneſs, as <hi>Eli</hi> rebuked his Sons. Chriſt Jeſus often warned them of the danger of Damnation: Mat. 5 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>9, 30. <hi>It is better that one of thy members ſhould periſh, &amp; not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell.</hi> Mat 7.13. <hi>Broad is the gate &amp; wide is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat.</hi> Mat. 13.42 <hi>The Angels ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> So alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41, 46. This for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Chriſt knew how to deal with Souls, and <hi>Paul</hi> followed His Example. Men need to be terrified and have the arrows of the Almighty in them that they may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Miniſters ſhould be Sons of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men had need have Storms in their hearts, before they will betake themſelves to Chriſt for Refuge: When they are pricked at the Heart, then they will ſay, What muſt we do to be Saved? Men muſt be fired out of their worldlineſs and ſloth: Men muſt be driven as <hi>Lot</hi> was out of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Reaſon will govern men in other things; but it is Fear that muſt make them diligently to ſeek
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002585_0021_0FDB157C1AD8D550"/>
Salvation: If they be but thoroughly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their danger, that will make them go to God and take Pains.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>If they give a wrong account of the nature of Juſtifying Faith, that is not good preaching.</hi> Juſtifying Faith is ſet forth in the Scripture by many figurative Expreſſions; Coming to Chriſt, Opening to Him, ſitting under his Shadow, flying to Him for Refuge, building on Him as on a Foundation, feeding on Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Expreſſions do imply not only an act of the Underſtanding, but alſo an act of the Will, accepting of Him, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Him. This Doctrine is deſpiſed by ſome, and Faith in Chriſt is ſaid to be only a Perſwaſion of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion. This is the way to make multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Carnal men ſecure, and to flatter themſelves as if they were in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: They ſay they are no Heathens, nor Turks, nor Papiſts, nor Jews, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Eternal Son of God, they hope they are Believers; but multitudes of People have ſuch a Faith that will fall ſhort of Eternal Life: Joh. 2.23, 24 <hi>Many believed in his name, when they ſaw the miracles that he did; but Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them.</hi> Joh. 12.42, 43. <hi>Among the chief rulers many believed on him, but becauſe of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002585_0022_0FDB743C89637140"/>
the Phariſees they did not confeſs him.</hi> The Faith of ſome men is only a Perſwaſion from their Education: As Heathens do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Religion of their Fore-fathers by Tradition, ſo theſe do receive the Chriſtian Religion from Hear-ſay. But Juſtifying Faith is wrought in men by the mighty Power of God; 2 Theſſ. 1.11. <hi>That he would work in you, the work of faith with power.</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20. <hi>And what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power; which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead?</hi> By Juſtifying Faith, men anſwer the Calls of God, relinquiſhing their own Righteouſneſs, place their Dependance only on the Mediation of Chriſt; Heb. 6.18 <hi>They flee for refuge, to lay hold on the hope that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</hi> Juſtifying Faith is a living Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that Sanctifies men; Act. 15.9. <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying their hearts by faith.</hi> Many men have a common Perſwaſion of the truth of the Goſpel, that are utterly deſtitute of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But true Juſtifying Faith is always accompanied with an Holy Life. Where there is Faith, there is every other Grace: Act. 26.18. <hi>Sanctified by faith that is in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>If any do give falſe Signs of godlineſs, that is not good Preaching.</hi> Signs of Grace are of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002585_0023_0FDB74404D2138A8"/>
two ſorts: Some are Probable, and they muſt be ſpoken of only as Probable; a Score of them may make the thing more Probable, but don't make it Certain: Probabilities make no Demonſtration; Probable Signs are not Concluſive. There are two Errors in laying down Signs; one is when thoſe things that may flow from Common Principles, as natural Temper, natural Conſcience, fear of Hell, falſe Imaginations, are given as ſure Signs of Grace: But thoſe things that may flow from Common Principles, don't truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between Saints &amp; Hypocrites; As a good Converſation, ſavoury Diſcourſe, zeal againſt Sin, ſtrong religious Affections, ſorrow for Sin, quietneſs under Afflictions, delight in Ordinances, ſuffering for Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From ſuch looſe Signs People are in danger to take up a falſe Perſwaſion of their godlineſs. Such Signs are full of Deluſion; and many men do bleſs themſelves who are in a miſerable Condition. Such probable Signs may be, where there be certain Signs of the contrary. Men are apt to flatter themſelves, and when they hear ſuch Signs, they are ſtrengthned in their carnal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. There is no infallible Sign of Grace, but Grace. Grace is known only by intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: All the External Effects of Grace may flow from other Cauſes. Another Error is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002585_0024_0FDB744139A17E88"/>
when men are too ſtrict in their Signs; As when they give that as a Sign, that there is a conſtant care to glorify GOD, and a continual living upon JESUS CHRIST, and a conſtant watchfulneſs againſt the workings of Corruption. There is no godly man but has at times ill frames of ſpirit: <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had ſo. When <hi>David</hi> committed Adultery, he had not a due care to glorify God; nor <hi>Jonah</hi> when he was in a Fret, nor the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> when he was as a Beaſt before God, nor <hi>Paul</hi> when he was led into Captivity by the law of ſin that was in his Members. There is no godly man that can comfort himſelf with ſuch Signs as theſe: It is well if godly men do ſee now and then the workings of a ſpirit of Grace: Grace is many times under Hatches and inviſible.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>If any teach men to build their faith about the Divine Authority of the Scripture upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Signs, that is not good Preaching.</hi> There be many probable Arguments for the Authority of the Sacred Scriptures; As the Eminency of the Penmen, and they have had a mighty Efficacy to make a change in the Hearts of men; it is ſaid there were many Miracles wrought for the confirmation of the Doctrine of them; there has been an
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002585_0025_0FDB7442DCDA42D0"/>
accompliſhment of many of the Predictions in them. Theſe Arguments are prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating and do outweigh all Objections that are brought againſt the Authority of them: Theſe Conſiderations may well ſtrengthen the Faith of the People of God; but theſe things cannot be the Foundation of our Faith: it is only the certain Knowledge of their Authority, that can be the foundation of Faith or any other Grace. Men cannot believe them to be infallibly true upon probable Arguments: Probable Arguments muſt be looked on but as Probable and not Convincing. Men muſt have infallible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for loving God and believing His Word; the foundation of Believing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scripture, is the manifeſtation of the Divine Glory in them. There is a Self-evidencing Light in the Works of God: The Creation of the world ſhews God's Power and God-head, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. It is impoſſible that the World ſhould be made by any but an infinite God. So there is a Self-evidencing light in the Word of God; there are ſuch things Revealed there as can be made known by none but God: 1 Cor. 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Thoſe Eternal Rewards that are
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002585_0026_0FDB74444AD83EC0"/>
ſpoken of in the Scripture, thoſe perfect Rules that are laid down there, thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that are given of the Mercy of God, and the Juſtice of God, manifeſted in the way of our Salvation, would never have entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, if it had not been Revealed by God; Men would never have thought of ſuch a way of Salvation, if it had not been declared by God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>If men preach for ſuch Liberties as God doth not allow, that is no good Preaching.</hi> There are many licentious Liberties that are taken by Men, in their Apparel, in their Drinking, in their Dancing and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, and in their Diſcourſes upon the Sabbath, and in their Dealings with one another; and if Miniſters either vindicate or connive at them, they don't Preach as they ought to do. Some men are but lax Caſuiſts, and they take too great a Liberty themſelves, &amp; ſo do their Wives &amp; Children, and they are afraid to anger men by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving ſome particular Evils that men are addicted to, that do prevail in the Land: The Phariſees were ſuch Caſuiſts; Mat. 5.43. <hi>Ye have heard it hath been ſaid of old, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</hi> Men ſhould be ſolemnly Warned againſt all evil Carriages; and if this be omitted, it gives
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002585_0027_0FDB7445D75626D0"/>
great increaſe to Sin in the Land. God complains of ill againſt Teachers for not Reproving Sinners; Iſa. 56.10. <hi>They are ignorant &amp; blind, dumb dogs that cannot bark.</hi> If men were duely Reproved for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, that would be a means to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them: Jer. 23.22. <hi>If they had ſtood in my counſel I had cauſed my people to hear my words; then they ſhould have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.</hi> Faithful Preaching would be beneficial two ways; one way as it would cut off occaſions of anger, and prevent thoſe ſins that bring down the Wrath of God on the Land; we ſhould enjoy much more Publick Proſperity: The other is, that it would deliver men from thoſe Vicious Practiſes that are a great hindrance to Converſion. As long as men live in ways of Intemperance, Injuſtice, and unſuitable Carriages on the Sabbath, it will be a great impediment to a thorough work of Converſion.

Humane Inventions in Worſhip; that would if they could, defend the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that would retain ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies that are aboliſhed, and practiſe other Humane Appointments. <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> was Condemned not only for Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi>; but for appointing a time of Worſhip in his own heart, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.32, 33. So it is noted as an imperfection, in the Reformation of <hi>Aſa, Jehoſhaphat</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>: That the high Places were not taken away. This is ſpoken of as a great ſign of Hypocriſy; Iſa. 29.13. <hi>This people draw near me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips; but have removed their heart far from me: and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men.</hi> When men impoſe ſuch Ceremonies, they uſurp a Power that God has not given them. It is God's Prerogative to appoint in what ways we ſhall Worſhip Him: And men therein go quite beyond the bounds of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Men therein impute <hi>imperfection</hi> and <hi>defect</hi> to the Ordinances of God, as if they cou'd teach him how it is fit that he ſhou'd be Worſhipped; and they preſume on a Bleſſing without a Promiſe: Mat. 15.9. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men.</hi> This is a way to make men Formal in their Worſhip; the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002585_0029_0FDB7448C7D595B0"/>
of Ceremonies eats out the heart of Religion, and makes a People Degenerate. Men that <hi>multiply Ceremonies,</hi> are apt to content themſelves with the <hi>Form</hi> without the <hi>Life.</hi>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is the late Practice of ſome Miniſters, in Reading their Sermons, Commendable?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There be ſome Caſes wherein it may be tolerable. Perſons through Age may looſe the ſtrength of their Memories, &amp; be under a Neceſſity to make uſe of their Notes; but ordinarily it is not to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Conſider 1. <hi>It was not the manner of the Prophets or Apoſtles. Baruch</hi> read the Roll that was written from the Mouth of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>; but <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was not wont to read his Propheſies. It was the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> to read the Scriptures in the Synagogues; but after that it was their way to Inſtruct &amp; Exhort men, not from any written Copy: Act, 13.15. <hi>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent to them, ſaying, Men and brethren, if ye have any word of Exhortation for the People, ſay on.</hi> This was according to the Example of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.17, 20. It was ordered in <hi>England</hi> in the Days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, <hi>That Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002585_0030_0FDB744A5E5EA880"/>
ſhould Read Printed Homilies in Publick</hi>: And there was great neceſſity of it, for there was not One in Ten, that were able to make Sermons But it has been the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worthy men both here and in other Places, to deliver their Sermons without their Notes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Reading of Sermons is a dull way of Preaching.</hi> Sermons when Read are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with Authority and in an affecting way. It is Propheſied of Chriſt, Mic. 5.4. <hi>He ſhall ſtand and feed in the Strength of the Lord, in the Majeſty of the Name of the Lord his God.</hi> When Sermons are delivered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Notes, the looks and geſture of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, is a great means to command Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; ſtir up Affection Men are apt to be Drowſy in hearing the Word, and the Livelineſs of the Preacher is a means to ſtir up the Attention of the Hearers, and beget ſuitable Affection in them. Sermons that are Read are not delivered with Authority, they ſavour of the Sermons of the Scribes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.29. Experience ſhews that Sermons Read are not ſo Profitable as others It may be Argued, that it is harder to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Rhetorical Sermons, than meer Rational Diſcourſes; but it may be Anſwered, that it is far more Profitable to Preach in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002585_0031_0FDB744BD63B6BE8"/>
of the Spirit, than with the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Words of mans wiſdom.</p>
            <p>USE, II. <hi>See the Reaſon why there is ſo little Effect of Preaching.</hi> There is much good Preaching, and yet there is want of good Preaching. There is very good Preaching in <hi>Old England,</hi> yet there is great want of good Preaching, eſpecially among the Conformiſts: And there is very good Preaching in <hi>New-England,</hi> and yet there is ſome want of good Preaching; eſpecially in ſome places: And this is one Reaſon that there is no more good done. There is a great fault in Hearers, they are not ſtudious of the mind of God; they are Enemies to the goſpel: And when Chriſt Himſelf Preached among them, many did not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it. Yet ſome Preachers are much to blame, and tho' they do Preach profitably many times, yet they have great cauſe to be Humbled for their Defects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For hence it is that there is ſo little Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> There is great Complaint in one Country and in another, that there be few Converted; it is apparent by mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Lives &amp; their unſavoury Diſcourſes. This is one Reaſon, there is a great deal of Preaching that doth not much Promote it, but
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002585_0032_0FDB744D5572A578"/>
is an hindrance to it. To tell men that <hi>they may be Converted tho' they don't know the time</hi>: To teach that <hi>there is no need of a work of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation to prepare them for Chriſt</hi>; and that <hi>Faith is nothing elſe but a Perſwaſion that the Goſpel is true,</hi> is the very way to make many Carnal men hope that they are Converted. It makes other Preaching very ineffectual: It makes them think that it is needleſs to ſtrive for Converſion. Such Preaching hardens men in their Sins: The want of dealing plainly with men is the reaſon, why there is ſeldom a noiſe among the <hi>Dry Bones.</hi> In ſome Towns there is no ſuch thing to be Obſerved for <hi>Twenty Years together.</hi> And men continue in a ſenſeleſs condition, come to Meeting &amp; hear Preaching, but are never the better for it. In ſome Towns godly men are very thin ſown. Moſt of the People are in as bad a condition as if they had never heard the Goſpel: Go on in a ſtill way, following their worldly Deſigns, carry on ſomewhat of the Form of godlineſs, but mind little but the World &amp; the Pleaſures of this Life. The Scribes did not Preach with Authority, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.29. And they <hi>entred not into the Kingdom of God themſelves, and they that were entring in they hindred.</hi> Such Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not mighty <hi>to the pulling down of ſtrong
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002585_0033_0FDB744EDB71D548"/>
Holds.</hi> Converſion-work will fail very much where there is not Sound Preaching.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence many men that make an high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, lead <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſanctified Lives</hi>: They are not dealt <hi>Plainly with</hi>; and ſo tho' they Profeſs high, they Live very Low: They are not dealt <hi>Roundly with</hi>; and they believe they are in a good Eſtate, and Conſcience ſuffers them to Live after a Corrupt manner. Some of them live a Proud and Voluptuous Life, and they are not Searched as they ſhould be. If they were told their own, that would keep them from ſaying that <hi>they were Rich and increaſed in goods,</hi> and had <hi>need of nothing</hi>: If they were <hi>rebùked Sharply,</hi> that might be a means <hi>to make them Sound in the Faith,</hi> Tit. 1.13. It might make them not only to Reform, but lay a better Foundation for Eternal Life, than ever yet was laid. <hi>Paul</hi> was very thorough in his work, &amp; wherever he came he had the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.29.</p>
