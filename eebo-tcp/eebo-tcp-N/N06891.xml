            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AFTER the many excellent Sermons that have been preached and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the members of your body, on the Propagation of <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, through the untutored parts of the earth, the preſent publication may be thought to argue ſome degree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. And this conſideration, added to the difficulty of ſaying any thing new or intereſting, on a ſubject ſo fully handled by many of the brighteſt ornaments of our
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:008737_0004_1030A43BF2A8EEE0"/>
church, would have deterred the author from letting the <hi>firſt Part</hi> of this Diſcourſe appear in print; if, on the other hand, he had not been encouraged therein, by the expreſs deſire of his brethren who heard it, and the Hopes that his ſituation in <hi>America</hi> may have enabled him to place ſome particular points in a light, perhaps, ſomewhat new.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to the <hi>ſecond Part,</hi> it may be thought a very needleſs labour to attempt a proof—That the intereſts of Chriſtianity will be advanced, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the intereſts of Science. But it hath been the author's misfortune, in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the latter, to meet with men, who ſeeming to conſider the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Knowlege and <hi>free</hi> Enquiry as unfriendly to their illiberal Syſtem, have ſet themſelves up, with rage almoſt <hi>Gothic,</hi> to ſtiffle the infant Sciences here. For this reaſon, he thought he could not do a better
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:008737_0005_1030A43EDF4D6D80"/>
ſervice than endeavour to ſhew them at large that they were, in effect, waging war, not only with every thing elegant and uſeful in life, but even with the extenſion of our <hi>Common Chriſtianity</hi> and the beſt intereſts of our ſpecies! And if, in the proſecution of this deſign, he hath been led into a more particular Analyſis of the ſciences than ſome may judge needful in a diſcourſe of this kind, he hopes the circumſtances of the caſe will be his plea.</p>
            <p>HE cannot conclude without taking this opportunity of expreſſing his gratitude to the venerable ſociety in general, for the honor done him by their body; and to ſundry illuſtrious Members in particular for the countenance and protection ſhewn him, at a time when their countenance and protection ſtood him in much ſtead.</p>

            <p>"IF you would make the ſoul of man great and good (ſays a ſublime<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Burnet in his Theory.</note> writer) give her large and extenſive proſpects of the immenſity of God's works, and of his inexhauſted Wiſdom and Goodneſs."</p>
            <p>NOW, thoſe divine attributes of Wiſdom and Goodneſs are no where more gloriouſly diſplayed than in the Goſpel-diſpenſation, and in thoſe marvellous Revolutions and Workings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which the Almighty has performed, and will yet perform, for the Salvation of mankind, and the final extenſion of his Son's kingdom to the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:008737_0008_1030A447F44BF468"/>
WELCOME, therefore, thrice welcome the holy Scriptures, thoſe living oracles of God, which can lend a clue to our meditations, and conduct them, by divine Grace, thro' theſe awfully improving ſubjects. Here is the "Myſtery which was hid from ages and from generations, but which God at length manifeſted to his Saints, with a promiſe that the riches of the glory thereof ſhould be made known among the Gentiles."<note n="*" place="bottom">Coloſſians i. 26, 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS latter part of the Goſpel-diſpenſation, which relates to the final converſion of the Gentiles, even <hi>to the uttermost parts of the earth,</hi> is that which, by the words of my text, and the preſent occaſion of our meeting, I am more immediately led to conſider. And, in doing this, I ſhall, by divine aſſiſtance, purſue the following Method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I SHALL endeavour to ſhew, from the general voice of Prophecy—That it is the gracious purpoſe of God, in his own good time, to bring the Heathen around us to the knowlege of his bleſſed Goſpel, thro' the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I SHALL make ſome remarks on the preſent ſituation of things on this continent with reſpect to the Goſpel-oeconomy, and the probability of a ſpeedy accompliſhment of the Prophecies which relate to the final converſion of the nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:008737_0009_1030A44ADFBFCEC0"/>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> FROM this view of things, I ſhall offer an humble Addreſs to you, my Brethren, who are employed as inſtruments in the hand of God for carrying on this great work of Converſion, by the Preaching of the Goſpel in places that heretofore "ſat in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death!"</p>
            <p>YOU ſee here, what a large field is opened; and would to God that I were endued with gifts and powers ſufficient to acquit myſelf therein agreeable to your expectations. But I know the vaſt, the glorious importance of the ſubjects propoſed; and I feel my own weakneſs. I beſeech you, therefore, to ſend forth your prayers for me to the throne of grace, that theſe ſubjects may not ſuffer in my hands; and that I may be enabled to ſpeak as becomes one called to the preſent office.</p>
            <p>I AM, in the <hi>First place,</hi> then, to conſider the general voice of prophecy, with reſpect to the Converſion of the Heathen around us. And among many other illuſtrious predictions of this event, the words of my text, and the verſes preceeding it, are full and ſtrong.</p>
            <p>"WHY do the Heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?—Yet have I ſet my king upon my holy hill of Sion.—Thou art my ſon; this day have I begotten thee. Aſk of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008737_0010_1030A44E23A9EDB8"/>
and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion." The meaning of which is, according to all the commentators—</p>
            <p>THOU art my ſon Jeſus! This day have I anointed thee king over all the world, which thou haſt purpoſed to <hi>redeem.</hi> Go on; compleat the great eternal ſcheme, and thereby eſtabliſh for thyſelf a kingdom of everlaſting holineſs. In vain ſhall the nations rage. In vain ſhall their proud leaders, Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Phariſees and rulers of Iſrael, combine themſelves againſt thee. In vain ſhall they ſeek to dethrone thee, to cut thee off from the earth, and to cruſh thy kingdom in its birth. My eternal purpoſes are fixed. The right hand of my power ſhall be thy ſtrength and guide. It ſhall defeat all the machinations of thy enemies, and raiſe thee even from the habitations of the dead, to thine inheritance in the manſions of glory. There ſhalt thou dwell for ever, and whatever thou ſhalt aſk of me thou ſhalt receive, till the Heathen become thine inheritance, and the very ends of the earth thy poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>HEREIN we ſee a moſt ſtriking Prediction concerning the propagation and final extenſion of Chriſt's kingdom to the very remoteſt nations of the world. And indeed there is a beautiful
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008737_0011_1030A4511129D838"/>
harmony among all the prophetic writers, relative to the ſame event.</p>
            <p>THE venerable Patriarch Jacob, in bleſſing his ſon Judah, gives an early intimation thereof; and tells him that the ſceptre ſhould not depart from his family till the immortal SHILOH ſhould come, who was to erect an everlaſting kingdom, unto <hi>whom</hi> the <hi>gathering of the people was to be.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Geneſis xlix. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT of all the Prophetic writers, the ſublime Iſaiah ſeems to have been favored with the fulleſt view of the Goſpel-ſtate, from the very birth of the Meſſiah to that glorious period, whereof we are now ſpeaking, when the "kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt."

            <p>To the ſame purpoſe ſpeaks the prophet Jeremiah, in his ſixteenth chapter. Intending to reproach the Jews for their abſurdity in apoſtatizing from the true God, after they had once known him, he tells them that, to their great diſgrace, a time would come when the very Heathen themſelves, who had never heard the name of God, would come to him even from the <hi>uttermost parts of the earth;</hi> and confeſs that the gods which they had worſhipped were no gods at all, but that they and their fathers had inherited Lies from the beginning, and put their truſt in things that profited not.</p>

lies and vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. Shall a man make gods unto himſelf, and they are no gods?"</p>
            <p>LET us hear alſo the prophet Daniel.<note n="†" place="bottom">Daniel ii. 44.</note> "The Lord God of heaven ſhall ſet up a kingdom which ſhall break in pieces and conſume all thoſe kingdoms (i. e. the four monarchies) and it ſhall ſtand for ever and ever.<note n="‡" place="bottom">vii. 13, 14.</note> Behold, one like the ſon of man came with the clouds of heaven, and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people and nations and languages ſhould ſerve him."</p>
            <p>IN like manner ſpeaks Malachi. "From<note n="*" place="bottom">Malachi i. 11.</note> the Riſing of the Sun to the Going-down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name ſhall be great among the Heathen." All which is confirmed, with the utmoſt ſolemnity by the angel's ſound in the revelation, and the great voices from heaven, declaring—</p>
            <p>"THAT the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever."<note n="§" place="bottom">Rev. xi. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now, although theſe Prophecies may, in part, have had their completion, by the vaſt rapidity
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008737_0015_1030A45D06383190"/>
with which the Goſpel ſpread itſelf into almoſt every known corner of the old world, ſoon after our SAVIOUR's Aſcenſion into heaven, yet, methinks, it is impoſſible that they ſhould ever have their full accompliſhment without the converſion of the Indian Natives around us, and the propagation of Chriſt's kingdom to the remoteſt parts of this continent. We have many of the ſtrongeſt arguments to induce this belief. For, in the firſt place, none of theſe Texts, which I have read, put any ſhorter limit to the ſpreading of the Goſpel than the Ends of the Earth, and from the Riſing of the Sun to the Going-down of the ſame. And ſecondly our Saviour himſelf, that laſt and greateſt of all the Prophets, has expreſly told us that "Jeruſalem<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxi. 22.</note> ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Now Jeruſalem is ſtill trodden down by the Gentiles, and<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Newton's Diſſertations N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. XX.</note> conſequently their times are not yet fulfilled.</p>
            <p>WE believe, therefore, on the moſt ſolid principles, that there is reſerved by Providence ſome future period or criſis in the Goſpel-oeconomy, for a more remarkable and final <hi>fulfilling of the Gentiles, even to the ends of the earth;</hi> and that it is the great and gracious purpoſe of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008737_0016_1030A460380527F0"/>
God, in that day, to manifeſt himſelf to the 'Heathen around us, and bring them to the knowlege of his bleſſed Goſpel, thro' the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;" which was the firſt thing I propoſed to ſhew.</p>
            <p>BUT here Infidelity uſually urges the following queſtions, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>IF ſuch be the intention of God, and ſo great the efficacy of his Goſpel; what muſt become of thoſe who have ſat ſo long in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death? And why does he ſo long delay the accompliſhment of his own eternal promiſes?</p>
            <p>REVERENCE to the ſupreme Lord of heaven and earth, it might have been hoped, would have ſecured the advocates of the Chriſtian Revelation againſt queſtions of ſuch high preſumption. For who ſhall ſay unto the Almighty, what doſt thou? Or what man, of mortal deſcent, ſhall hope to unfold thoſe ſecret reaſons of divine conduct, which eternal wiſdom hath not thought fit to reveal?</p>
            <p>AS for us, we ſhall only reply in general that as "Thoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Romans ii. 12.</note> who have ſinned in the Law ſhall be judged by the Law, ſo thoſe who have ſinned without the Law <hi>[if they periſh]</hi> ſhall periſh without it." As the ſpirit of God hath not
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008737_0017_1030A463775E3990"/>
thought fit to declare how far the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of CHRIST will be applied to thoſe who never heard of his name, we muſt not preſume to be wiſe above what is written. The nations that ſit in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death muſt be left to God's <hi>uncovenanted</hi> Mercies, to judge them according to the meaſure of Knowlege and Light which they have received. The Tribunal of the Almighty is erected upon infinite Wiſdom, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Goodneſs—and infinite Wiſdom, Juſtice and Goodneſs cannot commit Error or Wrong!</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to the ſecond queſtion—"Why doth the Almighty ſo long delay the accompliſhment of his own gracious promiſes?" We muſt anſwer much in the ſame general manner. Known unto God, and him alone, are all his counſels from the foundation of the world. Some Conjectures, however, we may humbly offer on this head, without incurring the charge of preſumption.</p>
            <p>EXCEPT in extraordinary caſes, the ſupreme Being ſeems to conduct all his operations by general laws; and, both in the Natural and Moral world, the advances to Perfection are gradual and progreſſive. The Law and the Prophets, which were of old, were but a faint and myſterious Revelation of the will of God, compared to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008737_0018_1030A46662800418"/>
full blaze of the Goſpel, whereby his <hi>whole</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xx. 27.</note> 
               <hi>council</hi> ſhone forth at laſt to mankind. The Lord ſpoke once in thunders and lightnings from Mount Sinai,<note n="†" place="bottom">Exodus xix. 16.</note> but now leaves the converſion of nations to the ordinary methods of his providence. God did not give the Chriſtian revelation itſelf, till the<note n="‡" place="bottom">See ſome fine remarks on this head by Dr. Robertſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the celebrated author of the hiſtory of Scotland, in his ſermon before the ſociety in Scotland for propagating Chriſtian Knowlege.</note> Roman ambition had brought almoſt the whole <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to a kind of ſimilarity of language and manners, and had opened ſuch an intercourſe between diſtant nations, as made that one of the moſt favorable periods for ſpreading a new Religion. Countries were now acceſſible that had before been unknown; and univerſal peace, added to univerſal ſubjection to one common Empire, gave the diſciples of Chriſt and firſt preachers of the Goſpel a great advantage in travelling from Clime to Clime.</p>
            <p>NOW, who knows but almighty wiſdom may have predetermined a period ſimilar to this, in the ſituation of affairs in this New World, for ſpreading his glorious Goſpel to the remoteſt parts of it?</p>
            <p>AND the conſideration of this leads me to the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008737_0019_1030A46954B1D230"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> head of my diſcourſe; which was "to make ſome remarks on the ſituation of things on this Continent, with reſpect to the Goſpel-oeconomy, and the probability of a ſpeedy accompliſhment of the Prophecies which relate to the <hi>fulfilling of the Gentiles,</hi> and final Converſion of the Nations."</p>
            <p>AND here what a ſeries of remarkable circumſtances claim our moſt devout attention? Reaſoning upon <hi>moral</hi> as upon <hi>natural</hi> things, what a beautiful analogy ſhall we find among all the operations of divine Providence?</p>
            <p>THE Sun, the glorious Luminary of Day, comes forth from his chambers of the <hi>East,</hi> and, rejoicing to run his courſe, carries Light and Heat and Joy thro' the nations to the remoteſt parts of the <hi>West,</hi> and returns to the place from whence he came. In like manner it doth appear that the Light of the glorious Goſpel is to proceed, till it hath carried one bright Day over all the habitable world; and then will come the end of things. The inſpired Writers, we have already ſeen, love to ſpeak of the propagation of Chriſtianity, under this figure; as proceeding from the <hi>Riſing</hi> to the <hi>setting</hi> of the Sun; and this courſe we find it has purſued.</p>
            <p>IN the primitive ages of Simplicity, the firſt indications of Divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will were given to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008737_0020_1030A46C91660E48"/>
               <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of mankind in the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts of the world, by God himſelf, converſing with them face to face, as they tended their flocks, or journeyed on from paſture to paſture. This was the <hi>Dawn</hi> of things. Soon afterwards followed the Law, and then the Prophets, advancing nearer and nearer to a full and perfect Revelation, till at laſt it broke forth in its <hi>Meridian</hi> glory, by the coming of the ſon of God, at that period already re erred to, when the ſituation of the world had prepared the way for its more effectual reception. The Wiſdom of God was viſible in all this; and ſoon did the Chriſtian Religion ſpread itſelf <hi>Westward,</hi> till it reached the vaſt Atlantic ocean, and the Iſles of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> where the poſterity of Japhet dwelt.</p>
            <p>NOW among theſe Iſles, or places on the Ocean, or Weſtern parts, as they are indifferently phraſed, GREAT-BRITAIN, our Mother-country, that <hi>ultima Thule</hi> of the ancients, bore a principal figure. Early was the Goſpel preached in her, if not by the Apoſtles themſelves, yet certainly by ſome of their followers, in their days, and before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>There is ſome probability that the goſpel was preached in Great-Britain by St. Simon the apoſtle, there is much greater probability that it was preached there by St. Paul; and there is abſolute certainty that it was planted there in their Days.

HERE the matter reſted. This was the <hi>first</hi> State of the Goſpel-progreſs. To the Weſtward of Britain the ancients ſeem to have known nothing. They conſidered theſe iſlands as the ends of the world; and extenſive as the Roman empire was at our Saviour's coming, this American continent, more extenſive than it all, lay entirely hid from their knowlege, and ſeems to have been reſerved as the ſtage of a <hi>ſecond</hi> remarkable period in the Goſpel-progreſs. Not a veſtige, therefore, of Chriſtianity was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated hither, till after it had kept poſſeſſion of the Old World, in various forms and under various corruptions, for at leaſt fifteen centuries. But, at the expiration of that period, it pleaſed God to open the way to the diſcovery of new countries, which likewiſe opened the way to the eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel in them. For it is obvious to remark, that the nations, which were raiſed up for this purpoſe, were thoſe among whom Chriſtianity was openly profeſſed, and conſequently they carried their religion along with them. Being likewiſe ſuperior to all the reſt of the world in the arts of Commerce and every improvement of civil life, they were the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008737_0022_1030A47133F77B68"/>
fitteſt to explore new ſettlements, conciliate the affections of the natives, and puſh their diſcoveries to the greateſt extent. This they did with remarkable zeal and ſucceſs; and, tho' it muſt be confeſſed that they have made uſe of the advantages which they enjoyed, chiefly for the ſecular purpoſes of extending their Empire and Commerce, yet they have not been altogether negligent of the propagation of the ſacred Religion which they profeſs.</p>
            <p>IN this divine work, our Mother-country, one of the pureſt branches of the Chriſtian-church, always foremoſt in every pious and humane undertaking, has ſignally exerted herſelf. In her, even in an age wherein Chriſtianity hath loſt much of its influence on the lives of men, many public Societies have been formed, and noble contributions made, with the glorious view of extending the Knowlege of God over this vaſt untutored Continent. At the head of theſe is juſtly placed that venerable <hi>ſociety, incorporated for propagating the goſpel in foreign parts,</hi> in whoſe ſervice moſt of you, my brethren, have the Honor to be employed, and for promoting whoſe pious deſigns we are now voluntarily aſſembled together. This auguſt and venerable body conſiſts of the principal dignitaries of our
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008737_0023_1030A476A87C22C0"/>
church, ſundry of the prime nobility of the nation, and many other pious perſons of every degree. It has ſubſiſted for near fourſcore of years, and, by the providence of God, has been remarkably enabled to ſupport the great and <hi>growing</hi> expence incident to ſuch an undertaking.</p>
            <p>TWO objects have moſt worthily employed the attention of this Society; the <hi>first</hi> to provide for the adminiſtration of religious ordinances among our own Coloniſts themſelves, who have hitherto been generally too thinly ſettled to be able to ſupport a regular miniſtry without ſuch aſſiſtance; and <hi>ſecondly</hi> to win over the Heathen-natives to the knowlege of God, and a firm attachment to our national intereſt. Theſe two deſigns, however much evil men may ſtrive to ſeparate them, muſt neceſſarily go hand in hand. Should the Society employ themſelves wholly to the buſineſs of converting the Indian natives from Heatheniſm, while they ſuffered their own colonies to degenerate into a ſtate little better than that Heatheniſm itſelf, the attempt would be equally vain and unjuſt. For it would be to little purpoſe for us to ſend out Miſſionaries among them to perſuade them to embrace our Religion, unleſs the fruits and "Light of our Religion ſhould ſo ſhine before them, that they

            <p>THE ſupport, therefore, of Chriſtianity among ourſelves, and the propagation of it among our Heathen Neighbours, are but different parts of the ſame undertaking; and tho' we have not hitherto had any great ſucceſs in the latter, yet it is our duty to continue our beſt endeavours. For who knows either the particular time when, or the means by which, the Lord may be pleaſed to accompliſh his own divine Promiſes?</p>
            <p>THE Converſion of nations has often, before now, been brought about when but leaſt expected; and by means which, to human foreſight, ſeemed the leaſt probable. One ſingle Savage, fully convinced of the Truth of Chriſtianity, and truly animated by its ſublime ſpirit, may perhaps, thro' the power of the living God, at ſome future period, be rendered an Apoſtle to the reſt, and an inſtrument of turning thouſands from the ways of Darkneſs and the "power of Satan, to the marvellous light of Chriſt, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith that is in Him."<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxvi. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

INNUMERABLE methods, beſides this, are in the providence of that God, whoſe power who ſhall tell? And it is impoſſible but, in his own appointed time, he muſt give the promiſed bleſſing to the pious endeavours which are continually uſed for the propagation of his Goſpel in this Weſtern world.</p>
            <p>MANY obſtacles, which formerly lay in the way of this great work, ſeem now to be almoſt entirely removed. We were, heretofore, but a ſmall people, poſſeſſing an inconſiderable ſpot of this Continent. Our acceſs to the heathen nations was difficult and dangerous. Our knowlege of their country was but very limited; and the arts of our buſy enemies had ſown many prejudices among them to our diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>BUT now the caſe is much altered. We are become a great and growing people; extending, and likely to extend, our, empire far over this continent. The preſent war, which we ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted mortals conſidered as one of the greateſt evils, is like to be productive of the beſt of conſequences. With the deepeſt adoration, we behold the hand of Providence in it. A ſeries of unlooked-for ſucceſſes has bleſſed our arms, for which we and our poſterity, throughout all generations, ought to offer up continual Hymns
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008737_0026_1030A47FD044FE48"/>
of gratitude and praiſe to the Giver of all victory. The Proteſtant intereſt in America has now received ſuch ſignal advantages, and obtained ſuch ſure footing, that we truſt neither the machinations of its inveterate enemies, nor even <hi>the gates of hell</hi> itſelf, ſhall ever prevail againſt it. Our credit with the Indian natives begins to ſtand in a high point of light. A more thorough knowlege of their country and manners is obtained than ever we had before. Strong fortifications are fixed, which will always facilitate our acceſs to them. The attention of all ranks of men is now more turned to the proſecution of our intereſts on this continent than ever was known at any former period; and if it ſhall pleaſe God to direct the hearts of our Rulers to a Peace which may in any degree be anſwerable to our former ſucceſſes, then will be the time when we may expect to ſee Chriſtianity propagated to advantage.</p>
            <p>BY our connexions with our Mother-country, and the productions of our own happy climate, we are the only people of all the European nations, ſettled in America, that are able to feed the Hungry and cloath the Naked. When our enemies ſhall be confined within their due bounds, we ſhall thus have obtained a more natural and laſting dominion over the Heathen

It was firſt printed in London, and being on the ſame text with this diſcourſe is now added as a <hi>second</hi> and finiſhing <hi>Part</hi> thereof, with the alteration only of a few ſentences of the introduction.</note> diſcourſe delivered at that time is in your hands, and the arguments there adduced, added to thoſe now laid before you, will be ſufficient to eſtabliſh the "probability of a ſpeedy accompliſhment of the prophecies which relate to the final Converſion of the nations;" which was my <hi>ſecond</hi> Head.</p>
            <p>I proceed, therefore, in the <hi>last place,</hi> "from this view of things, to offer an humble Addreſs to

you, my brethren, who are employed as inſtruments in the hand of God, for carrying on this great work of converſion, by the preaching of the Goſpel in places that heretofore <hi>ſat in Darkneſs and the ſhadow of Death.</hi>"</p>
            <p>AND this part of my ſubject I enter upon with that diffidence and humiliation of heart, which become one who is ſpeaking to men of known capacities and integrity; and among whom are ſundry of my ſeniors in the ſacred office of the miniſtry. Beſides this, a ſeries of neceſſary avocations hath, for ſome years paſt, drawn a conſiderable part of my attention from the immediate ſtudy of that Divine Science, which both duty and inclination would induce me chiefly to cultivate; and nothing but your expreſs injunctions, added to a perſuaſion that it will not be neceſſary for me to ſay much on this ſubject, could give me the Freedom to proceed.</p>
            <p>IS it ſo, then, my brethren, that God hath choſen the Britiſh nation, above all others, to ſettle the moſt important part of this continent? Hath he proſpered their arms, and extended their empire in the moſt ſignal manner, thro' a ſeries of hazardous events? Doth he ſeem to have purpoſed through us the extenſion of his everlaſting goſpel to the ends of the world,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008737_0030_1030A48C0607BB50"/>
and are you charged with the miniſtration of that bleſſed Goſpel, and ſeverally capable of contributing ſomewhat, under divine aſſiſtance, to the haſtening of that happy period, wherein "the Knowlege of the Lord ſhall cover the whole earth as the waters cover the ſea?" Are theſe things ſo; and can we ever be without the moſt animating motives to ſupport and encourage us in ſo great a work, how inconſiderable ſoever the temporal advantages may be, which are annexed to the diſcharge of it? Conſidered in this light, how divinely important does your MISSION appear? Whilſt others are propoſing, and juſtly propoſing, to themſelves the Palm of high renown, for bravely ſubduing and maintaining a rich and ſpacious country for the name of Britain and Liberty, we may conſider ourſelves, even in a ſtill higher light, as ſubduing it to the name of CHRIST, and adding it to his everlaſting Kingdom! compared to this, the glory of temporal conqueſts and foundations is but unſubſtantial air, and ſhort-lived renown.</p>
            <p>IN ſo noble a work, therefore, the conduct of that firſt of <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, our illuſtrious predeceſſor in the buſineſs of preaching the <hi>Goſpel</hi> among uncultivated nations, ought to be our rule and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008737_0031_1030A48DA65BBB90"/>
model. "When it pleaſed God, ſays he, to reveal his Son in me, <hi>that I might preach him among the Heathen,</hi> immediately I conferred not with fleſh and blood." This zealous ſervant of Chriſt had formed a juſt idea of the work he had undertaken, and conſidered it as a field wherein he was to encounter many difficulties, and reap but few worldly advantages. He therefore propoſes to himſelf advantages of a more durable nature, and ſtrives to raiſe himſelf above this world, and all its clogs and attachments. For this end, he holds daily intercourſe with the Father of Spirits, and was frequent in prayer and meditation. And certainly if ever men ought to be ſerious, humble, abſtracted from worldly embarraſſments, and dependent upon divine aſſiſtance in any office or truſt in this world, it ought to be in the Exerciſe of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> and diſpenſation of the glorious Goſpel; for who is of himſelf ſufficient for theſe things?</p>
            <p>BUT together with Seriouſneſs, Prayer, Meditation, and dependence upon God, an ardent Zeal and Fervor of Spirit are moſt neceſſary qualifications. In any undertaking, where the world has but few advantages to ſollicit perſeverance, nay where many inconveniencies muſt neceſſarily be ſurmounted, it is well for a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008737_0032_1030A48F58459F80"/>
man to have within himſelf a fervent principle of action. Indeed, indifference in the diſcharge of any duty is a great error, but in things of the higheſt moment it is unpardonable. It was a ſevere rebuke to one of the churches, that ſhe was luke-warm; for which ſhe was threatened to be ſpued out.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. iii. 15.</note> "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou wert cold or hot," ſaith the ſpirit of God to her. Whoever conſiders the immenſe value of human ſouls; whoever is impreſſed with a juſt ſenſe of our preſent degeneracy; whoever contemplates the vaſt goodneſs of God, and believes the Goſpel to be the produce of the greateſt Love which heaven could ſhew, or a corrupt world receive—muſt needs be inanimate indeed, not to glow with an unquenchable ardor for its univerſal extenſion to all the ſons of men!</p>
            <p>TOGETHER with zeal for Religion, "pure and undefiled before God and the father,"<note n="†" place="bottom">James i. 27.</note> a zeal for Civil Liberty, its inſeparable companion, will be truly commendable. It is the peculiar glory of the Britiſh Nation to ſtrive not only to enlighten, but to ennoble, the Human Race; not only to break aſunder thoſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Fetters which the Dominion of ANTICHRIST hath
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008737_0033_1030A492473640A0"/>
eſtabliſhed over the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, but likewiſe <hi>to let the oppreſſed go</hi> FREE, and to ſtrike off thoſe <hi>bodily</hi> Fetters under which ſo great a part of the human Species groans.</p>
            <p>IN ſo righteous a cauſe, it becomes the Miniſters of God's Word, which is founded on Liberty both of Body and Mind, to ſtand among the warmeſt Champions; and therefore ſhould ever another period come, when a cruel enemy is advancing to rob us of all that we account dear and ſacred, let us <hi>cry aloud and ſpare not.</hi> Being placed on the walls of our Sion, and glowing ſublimely with the ſpirit of Goſpel-truth and Freedom, let us be earneſt with our country, as we have been heretofore, warning, exhorting and animating all around us to "play the men for the people and cities of our God."<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. x. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is agreeable to the injunctions of our benevolent ſuperiors in ſuch caſes delivered to us. We are charged to enforce Loyalty, public Spirit, Submiſſion to juſt government, and the Payment of neceſſary tribute and taxes. Deſigning men may inſinuate, as they have done, that this is going beyond our ſphere, and they may oppoſe and injure us by every device in their power. But ten thouſand ſuch attempts and inſinuations ought not to deter us from our duty.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008737_0034_1030A49536699890"/>
Our Civil and Religious rights are inſeparably connected; and whatever hurts or deſtroys the former, muſt, in the iſſue, hurt or deſtroy the latter.</p>
            <p>BUT further, to a commendable Zeal in every thing praiſe-worthy, we muſt add Prudence and Decorum of conduct; and, above all, a generous Spirit of <hi>Forbearance, Toleration,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to our Proteſtant brethren of other denominations. Theſe are Duties peculiarly incumbent on the Miniſters of ſo benevolent a Religion as that of JESUS, and ſo generous a Church as that of <hi>England.</hi> Matters of Conſcience come not under human cognizance. The catholic and free ſpirit of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> religion diſdains to erect a tyranny over the minds of men, or to reign over uninformed zeal. Religion can be founded on nothing elſe but every man's private conviction. 'Tis to God, in the end, that we muſt all anſwer; and from our own conſciences, in the mean time, that we muſt receive remorſe or ſatisfaction. Another man cannot interfere, nor feel for us, nor judge for us, in this matter.</p>
            <p>ONE thing further is abſolutely neceſſary for us as Miniſters of God's word; and that is great care and induſtry in the compoſition of our Sermons. We have many eyes upon us; and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008737_0035_1030A49AB4745840"/>
certainly it is treating a ſenſible audience with a very great degree of diſreſpect, for any man to ſtep into a pulpit to entertain them with what bears all the marks of want of Study and Care.</p>
            <p>"IT is an unſeaſonable piece of Vanity (ſays a learned<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </note> prelate of our church) for any preachers to offer their own crudities, till they have well digeſted and ripened them. I wiſh the Majeſty of the Pulpit were more looked to, and that no ſermons were offered from thence, but ſuch as ſhould make the hearer both wiſer and better."</p>
            <p>WE do, however, readily acknowlege that a man vitally good, much with God, rich in grace, fervent in ſpirit, a maſter of literature and expreſſion, powerful in Eloquence, and, above all, <hi>mighty in the Scriptures,</hi> may be well warranted, as circumſtances may require, to ſpeak without any immediate ſtudy or preparation. But, in a general way, this method argues ſo much want of care and deference; it is withal ſo dangerous in its uſe; and theſe divine Gifts mentioned above fall ſo ſeldom to the ſhare of any one man, and it is moreover ſo eaſy to miſtake or ſubſtitute the wild Ebullitions of a heated Imagination; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Phariſaical Pride, in their room, that our church ſuppoſes no preaching of this ſort. And whatever a man of the moſt extraordinary graces and talents may be able to do in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditated manner, he will certainly do much more by ſtudy, meditation and accurate compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>GREAT care is alſo requiſite in the choice of our ſubjects. The whole circle of Goſpel-truths is before us; but ſome require to be more frequently preſſed home than others. Subjects of Litigation, however, and points of Controverſy, are to be avoided; unleſs in times of extremeſt danger, when Fundamentals and Eſſentials may be attacked.</p>
            <p>SOME men there are who, in their <hi>preaching,</hi> betray a marvellous Littleneſs of Genius, and Barrenneſs of matter. They are ever upon minute diſtinctions, Party-Shibboleths, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing definitions, and nice modes; ten thouſand of which, if put in the balance with true Religion, and the <hi>weightier matters of the Law,</hi> would not weigh a ſingle grain, eſpecially when attended (as they generally are) with Revilings and Curſings and <hi>Anathemas</hi> againſt all others differing the leaſt in perſuaſion, to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

very eſſence of <hi>Christ'</hi>s Goſpel, and height of religious perfection. We may well ſuſpect ſuch men to be but Smatterers in the Divine Science of Religion, much like thoſe bold Pretenders in the other ſciences, who finding it a work of hard labor to obtain a thorough knowlege of their profeſſion, or, peradventure, not having the capacity for it, are therefore obliged to hide their own ignorance and ſupply the want of real ſkill, by arrogant pretenſions to ſome new diſcovery, or an affected ſingularity in the treatment of ſome common points.</p>
            <p>BUT not ſo the man of comprehenſive knowlege. Not ſo the Preacher who has a clear and glowing view of his Maſter's religion in general. He will not endeavour to divide and perplex mankind by vain and inſignificant diſtinctions, but to unite and animate them all in the exerciſe of true vital and evangelical piety. He will not multiply notions, or delight to dwell on triffles, that tend to ſow animoſities and create confuſions among the ſame Species; but to enforce univerſal Virtue, and light up the lamp of heavenly Charity, to adorn and gild this gloomy vale of life.</p>

Being, together with a maſculine devotion of heart, by approaching in frequent acts of contemplation to the fountain of all grace; and what he himſelf <hi>is,</hi> he will ſtrive to make others <hi>be.</hi> When he ſteps into the pulpit, he will carry no ſchemes or views thither with him that are ſhort of his Maſter's Glory. He will appear as one ſtanding in the preſence of the great Jehovah, glowing for the good of his ſpecies, and impreſſed with the vaſt conſequence of eternity.

            </p>
            <p>BUT, in his more ſolemn addreſſes, when he finds it more particularly neceſſary to reluminate the dying ſpirit of Freedom and Religion here on earth; or when the glorious proſpects of a better world, or the awful myſteries of Redeeming Love, are his theme, he will then be great indeed! He will ſeem all on fire. His very face will ſpeak a ſoul of rapture. He will be borne along with a winged ardor of Genius, pouring forth a torrent of ſacred Eloquence, which ſome will call <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> but, if it muſt be called ſo, it will be the noble <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> of Truth and Reaſon—a pure and tranſcendent flame, bearing all down before it, and burning ſtill clearer and ſtronger to the very laſt—</p>

               <q>

            </epigraph>
            <p>A full explanation of this text, compared with ſundry others, that foretel the final Converſion of the Heathen, and ſeem to have a particular reference to our ſituation on this Continent, hath been already attempted.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY, we obſerved, was firſt revealed in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts of the world. Like the ſun, there it roſe; and, like him, advancing <hi>Westward</hi> through the nations, diffuſed light and love and joy, wherever it came. At length, it croſſed the vaſt Atlantic;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008737_0041_1030A4AA4945FA48"/>
and, in the ſettlement of theſe colonies, a way was opened for adding a large inheritance to the Kingdom of Jeſus, in the remoteſt parts of the <hi>West.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS true that no great progreſs hath hitherto been made in this work. There is yet an immenſe depth of this continent, whoſe forlorn inhabitants never had any opportunity "to hear the glad tidings of ſalvation;" and, of thoſe who have been bleſt with ſuch an opportunity, few, very few, have turned a liſtening ear to the joyful ſound.</p>
            <p>BUT "<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Corinth. i. 20.</note> the Promiſes of God in Chriſt are all Yea and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>en." A careful examination of his revealed word hath thoroughly fixed our belief that the time will come, when the Heathen around us ſhall be gathered into his fold, under the great ſhepherd and biſhop of ſouls. Nay many auſpicious circumſtances in the preſent ſituation of things on this continent, already enumerated, give us reaſon to expect that the accompliſhment of this event is now not far remote. And oh! What a triumphant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is this, to thoſe who believe the Goſpel of Jeſus "to be the power of God unto ſalvation?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:008737_0042_1030A4AD4EA26DF0"/>
NOW, one of thoſe circumſtances, which was but ſlightly mentioned before, I have at preſent the moſt favorable opportunity of conſidering more at large. It is "the ſpirit which diſplays itſelf, through theſe American colonies, for the founding ſeminaries of Learning; and the great influence which the advancement of the Sciences has on the advancement of Chriſt's Goſpel.</p>
            <p>IN order to do juſtice to this ſubject, it will be neceſſary to give ſome account of the Human Sciences, as well as of the ſublime Science of Chriſtianity; to ſhew the ſubſerviency of the former to the advancement of the latter, and thereby to engage your continued favour and protection of this infant ſeminary. And that I may proceed with the greater preciſion and clearneſs, l ſhall recur to firſt principles.</p>
            <p>IF we conſult the conſtitution of our nature, we ſhall find ourſelves, in every purſuit, actuated by the deſire of Happineſs, and determined to account every thing more or leſs valuable, as it contributes more or leſs to that end.</p>
            <p>HAPPINESS, however, is a complex thing, compounded of many ingredients; and the road to attain it has its labyrinths and windings, not to be travelled, but with caution and foreſight.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008737_0043_1030A4B2CC0408D8"/>
For man, being made up of ſoul and body, ſuſtains a double relation, and is capable of a double kind of pleaſure; there being a variety of objects ſuited to the variety of his affections, paſſions and tempers, when in their ſound moral ſtate. His Happineſs, therefore, muſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently depend on making a right eſtimate of theſe objects, and maintaining this ſound tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of conſtitution; ſo as to purſue each of them with a degree of force commenſurate to their reſpective values, or tendencies to give pleaſure.</p>
            <p>HENCE, then, whatever enables a man to make a right eſtimate of things, and to frame his conduct agreeably, muſt be conſidered as an engine of his happineſs, and is to be valued proportionably. It follows, therefore, that thoſe reſearches which bring him acquainted with himſelf, the ends, uſes and meaſures of his ſeveral powers and movements, together with the ends and uſes of the various objects with which he ſtands connected, muſt be a main ſpring of his happineſs; and, in this view, may be denominated his <hi>true Wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>first and great Philoſophy;</hi> or that glorious Syſtem of Knowlege, which gives him his chief pre-heminence over the brutes, and exalts him to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008737_0044_1030A4B48731C430"/>
the ſupreme perfection and higheſt enjoyment of his nature!</p>
            <p>OTHER Sciences may have their uſe, as matters of ornament or amuſement. But whenever they interfere with this grand Science of Life and Manners, they are to be diſregarded as empty triffles; ſubjects at beſt but of vain curioſity, or unavailing ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>I SHALL, therefore, endeavour to diſtinguiſh the True from the Falſe, the ſpurious parts of Knowlege from thoſe of genuine growth, by pointing out to you the eſſential branches of this great Maſter-ſcience. In doing this, let us never loſe ſight of the fundamental principle already laid down, namely that every part of knowlege, (humane knowlege I ſpeak of) derives its value from its tendency to inform us—</p>
            <p>"Quid ſumus, et quidnam victuri gignimur—" What we are, and whither deſtined; what our conſtitution and connexions; and what our duties in conſequence thereof.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER ſets out on this enquiry will, in the firſt inſtance, be ſtruck with the vaſtneſs of the undertaking, and the inſufficiency of his own abilities. Human nature, and the various natures around it, are a copious ſubject. Life
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008737_0045_1030A4B629D8C4C0"/>
is ſhort, and each man's own experience too ſcanty to trace for himſelf the relations and fitneſs of things; to examine into all Moral and Phyſical Qualities; and, from thence, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Rules of Conduct, and aſcertain the true Path of Happineſs. Like a traveller in a ſtrange country, he will, therefore, be glad to enquire his way of others; and make all poſſible uſe of the experience of thoſe who, with honor and ſucceſs, have travelled the path of life before him. He will endeavour to avail himſelf equally of the good and bad fortune of thoſe whoſe courſe is finiſhed, and ſtrive to bring all Antiquity under Contribution to him for wiſdom.</p>
            <p>BUT how could this be done, if there were not ſome method of preſerving, and poſſeſſing ourſelves of, the experience of others? And here we ſee the uſe of Languages and Writing. Nevertheleſs an acquaintance with all ſorts of languages would be almoſt as difficult an acquiſition, as the particular examination of all ſorts of things. Hence then, it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Learned to fix on ſome Univerſal Language or Languages, as the grand channel or inſtrument of conveying their experiences, obſervations and concluſions, concerning the conduct of life and the truth of things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:008737_0046_1030A4BBB7664040"/>
NOW Greek and Latin have been choſen for theſe purpoſes, on ſeveral ſubſtantial accounts. For, not to mention that many of the nobleſt productions of ancient genius were originally written in theſe languages, it is to be obſerved that dead languages are more durable, and leſs fluctuating, than living ones; and, beſides this, living nations, jealous of each other, would think it too great a mark of diſtinction to chuſe the language of any particular nation among them, as the grand channel of knowlege and experience.</p>
            <p>WE ſee, then, that an acquaintance with what is called the Learned Languages is ſtill juſtly conſidered as a part of liberal education, and a neceſſary introduction to the Sciences. For, tho' words, abſtractly conſidered, cannot in themſelves add to our knowlege, yet as the Means of Conveying and acquiring knowlege, they will be ſtudied by all thoſe who, to their own experience, would add the experience of thoſe who have lived in former ages; or, living in the preſent, can no otherwiſe reader the fruits of their enquiries uſeful to mankind, than by Language and Writing.<note n="*" place="bottom">The author found it neceſſary to be thus particular in explaining the uſe of the Learned Languages; ſome regarding them as a needleſs part of education, and others conſidering them as all the education neceſſary to a ſcholar: Opinions equally prejudicial to the advancement of Sound Knowlege. Under this head, it is obvious that he means to include Hiſtory, both natural and civil; i. e. whatever can be obtained from the Experience of others.</note>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:008737_0047_1030A4BF07914568"/>
NEVERTHELESS, a perſon, who knows himſelf endued with reaſon and underſtanding, will not be content to take his knowlege entirely at ſecond hand. On ſubjects ſo important as the nature and fitneſs of things, and the Summum Bonum of man, he will not rely wholly on a Hiſtorical knowlege, founded on the Experience and Teſtimony of others; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much his labors may be ſhortened thereby. He will think it is his duty to examine for himſelf, and to acquire a Moral and Phyſical knowlege; founded on his own Experience and Obſervation.</p>
            <p>THIS is what we call Philoſophy in general; comprehending in it the knowlege of all things Human and Divine, ſo far as they can be made the objects of our preſent enquiries. Now, the genuine branches of this Philoſophy, or great ſyſtem of practical Wiſdom, together with the neceſſary inſtrumental parts thereof, may be included under the following general heads; it appearing to me that the nature of things admits of no more.</p>
            <p n="1">1. LANGUAGES, &amp;c. which have been
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008737_0048_1030A4C332920B80"/>

            <p n="4">4.

intellectual pleaſures, reſulting from a juſt taſte for polite Letters, and a true reliſh for the ſprightly Wit, the rich Fancy, the noble Pathos, and the marvellous Sublime, ſhining forth in the works of the moſt celebrated Poets, Philoſophers, Hiſtorians and Orators, with beauties ever pleaſing, ever new.</p>
            <p>THIS laſt mentioned part of literary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, like the firſt, I grant, is to be conſidered rather as an Inſtrument, than a Branch, of Science. But if the above definition be juſt, you will not wonder that we ſeparate it from Languages, as being of much higher nature than they; and even place the ſtudy of it after all the other Sciences, ſeeing they are neceſſary and ſubſervient to its perfection.</p>
            <p>THE materials of every work muſt go before the work itſelf; and Compoſition, from one's own ſtock, can hardly be begun before Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and the Sciences have enriched the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ripened the judgment and furniſhed the Materials or Topics.</p>
            <p>WERE any further arguments neceſſary to juſtify this diſpoſition of Rhetoric and Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I might quote the authority of the greateſt maſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Longinus.</note> which antiquity can boaſt. In the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008737_0050_1030A4C904DFB228"/>
beginning of his inimitable Treatiſe on the Sublime, he does not propoſe his noble precepts of fine writing to raw youths, to be read with the rules of grammar, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that is (as I underſtand the words) "men converſant in public life," who have laid a foundation in the Sciences, and whoſe buſineſs it is now become to Think, Speak, Write and Act for the General Good.</p>
            <p>THESE are the capital branches of Human Science, as taught in every liberal inſtitution; and were there no connexion between them and the knowlege of Chriſt's religion, or did we ſtop ſhort at the former without bringing them home to the latter; we ſhould then indeed be building up to ourſelves ſtructures of emptineſs on foundations of rottenneſs. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ever Sciences, ſo liberal as thoſe mentioned above, tending ſo directly to elevate and enlarge the mind, ſhould be at enmity to the divine Science of Chriſtianity, and the great myſtery of Godlineſs; that ſublimeſt ſyſtem of Philoſophy, into which even the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſire to be further initiated! A little learning, as a great<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon.</note> genius expreſſes it, may indeed make men mad; but large draughts
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008737_0051_1030A4CBF33F7608"/>
thereof ſobers them again. Such an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the ſciences, as is deſcribed above, will be ſo far from damping the ardor of religious knowlege, that it will be more and more inflamed thereby; which is a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument of the ſtrong and immediate connexion between them.</p>
            <p>WERE it neceſſary to be particular on this head, I might mention the example of the greateſt and beſt Philoſophers of every age; who have always been the moſt devout men. Far from being puffed up with the pride of human Learning, or "aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt," they have made it their glory, and acknowlege it to contain the only infallible rules of their conduct in this life, and the only foundation of their hope in that which is to come. It is ſaid of the great Sir Iſaac Newton, that, tho' he entered further into the depths of Philoſophy than ever mortal before him, yet he accounted the Scriptures of God to be the moſt ſublime Philoſophy; and never mentioned his Creator's name without an awful pauſe of adoration, wonder and ſelf-abaſement!</p>
            <p>THE further we puſh our enquiries into nature, the more we ſhall be convinced of the greatneſs of its author, and the inſufficiency of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008737_0052_1030A4CDE2CA2890"/>
unenlightened Reaſon. We ſhall find many things of the utmoſt importance for us to know, which yet will baffle all our efforts, and elude our moſt eager reſearches. The creation and various revolutions of the world; the fall and redemption of man; the laſt judgment and an immortality to come; are ſubjects in which no human wiſdom could inſtruct us, unleſs the Lord had been pleaſed to reveal himſelf concerning them.</p>
            <p>AND yet what is all the Philoſophy in the world compared to a knowlege in theſe points? Where is its ſublimity, or what is its ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy to us, if it affords us no infallible rule of duty at preſent, and no ground of hope hereafter? If it leaves us in the dark concerning our own original, the means of ſalvation from ſin and miſery, and the immortal ſtate of our ſouls in the untried periods of eternity?</p>
            <p>WHAT joy, then, muſt it yield a ſincere Enquirer, to be ſufficiently informed upon theſe important ſubjects, by a revelation from God himſelf? Can he neglect or deſpiſe ſuch an awful ſyſtem? Or will he not rather take it to his boſom, ſearch into its depths, and reverence it as "containing the words of eternal life," and being the richeſt legacy which heaven could give, or earth receive?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:008737_0053_1030A4D35A7F3FB8"/>
SUCH a Revelation and ſuch a Legacy are the Scriptures of God. In all the ſimplicity of truth and beauties of majeſty, they deliver thoſe rules by which we are to live here and be judged hereafter. Containing doctrines the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and exalted, precepts the moſt humane and important, a ſtile the moſt rich and perſuasive, abounding in all the variety of tropes and figures, and "ſharper than a two-edged Sword," the ſcriptures are calculated to ſeize and purify the affections; to enlighten and exalt the underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to alarm and rouſe the conſcience; to confirm our hopes and remove our fears; to baniſh ſuperſtition and caſt down the idols of the nations; to mitigate lawleſs power and humanize the rage of barbariſm; and to call men off from a vain dependence on external ceremonies to a truſt in the Living God, obedience to his moral laws, repentance for paſt offences, an acceptable and manly devotion of heart, a longing after immortality, an union with the divine nature, and an exaltation to the life of angels and felicity unſpeakable!</p>
            <p>EVERY thing which human reaſon would deſire to know is fully brought to light in the Goſpel. Here the Origin, Connexions and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008737_0054_1030A4D4F8D23FD8"/>
Duties of man are amply deſcribed! Here his departure from his firſt Innocence and rectitude, the degradation of his nature, and all the marvellous workings of omnipotence to reclaim and ſave him, are diſtinctly recorded! Here we ſee the Prophets propheſying for his ſake, the old world drowned, another fitted up, and laſt of all the Lord of Glory deſcending from heaven, to accompliſh the amazing Plan of Redemption, and reſtore him to divine favour! Here alſo Life and Immortality are brought to light, and the Future diſplayed! Here the ſolemnity of the laſt Judgment, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing ſcenes of the general Conſummation, are laid before us! Here Death is diſarmed of his Sting, and the Grave of Victory! Here the gates of immortality are ſet open—and Oh! what an unutterable weight of Glory beyond—</p>
            <p>SAY, then, ye Wiſe Ones of the earth! ye Sages, ye Philoſophers, or by whatever other names ye would be called! ſay now, what is the amount of your knowlege, if it reſolves you not on ſuch ſubjects as theſe? Can an acquaintance with human Science render you indifferent to ſuch an exalted ſyſtem of heavenly Wiſdom as this? Surely not. The one will only inflame your thirſt for the other, and make you purſue
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008737_0055_1030A4D6AE3E93C8"/>
it as the finiſhing and moſt durable part of the whole.</p>
            <p>"FOR, whether there be Tongues, they ſhall ceaſe; or whether there be Knowlege, it ſhall vaniſh away." This vain world itſelf, all its gay ſcenes, every thing that we account wiſe or curious in it, ſhall come to an end and pleaſe no more. But the ſublime ſubjects of the Goſpel will ſtill be New. They will be the object of our endleſs enquiries, and conſtitute a Philoſophy, the Marvellous of which eternity cannot exhauſt, not the longeſt period of duration bring to decay.</p>
            <p>AND now, having ſhewn the ſubſerviency of Human Science to the advancement of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and that a liberal education is a means of ſpreading a thirſt for heavenly wiſdom; what need I add more to beſpeak your continued favour and protection of this Seminary? Surely it cannot be indifferent to us, whether the knowlege of Chriſt and his bleſſed Goſpel ſhall be ſpread over this continent, or not? Surely it cannot be indifferent to us, whether our own children ſhould be bred up in ignorance; or whether they ſhall ſhine in every moral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, the glory of their country and a light to the world around them? We muſt know the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:008737_0056_1030A4DAE1511938"/>
relation in which we ſtand to them, and the account which we ſhall one day be required to give of their tender years.</p>
            <p>FOR whatever buſineſs a man may be deſigned, a liberal education will not only prepare him for that, but alſo for a life of general virtue.—If intended for the noble Profeſſion of the Law, to be the protectors of the innocent and the advocates of juſtice; the beſt foundation will be a love of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and a thorough knowlege of the laws of nature, and general rights of mankind. If for the ſervice of the ſtate, the ſame will hold good. The man beſt acquainted with the nature of civil government, the juſt bounds of authority and ſubmiſſion, and the univerſal principles of equity and virtue, will always be the ableſt Politician and firmeſt Patriot. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if intended to follow the healing art of Phyſic, the knowlege of Mathematics and the various branches of Natural Philoſophy, will be the beſt introduction. If propoſed for the Miniſtry of the bleſſed Goſpel, every human Science ought to lend its aid, and kindle a love of wiſdom.</p>
            <p>IF other arguments were neceſſary to induce you to the cultivation of knowlege and the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008737_0057_1030A4DDD2FE6958"/>
ſupport of ſuch uſeful ſeminaries as this, I might diſplay to you the wonderful change which the Sciences have produced in the ſtate of every country, where they have been received. Tho' they have not been able whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eradicate Tyranny, yet they have always checked and mitigated its influence; inſpiring humanity, love of moral excellency, and every ſofter virtue.</p>
            <p>BUT why ſhould I bring inſtances from other countries, when one of the moſt illuſtrious is before our eyes? This poliſhed and flouriſhing City! what was it fourſcore years ago? Even its foundations were not then laid; and in their place was one depth of gloomy wilderneſs! This very ſpot, this Seat of the Muſes—where I have now the honour to ſtand, the preaching the Goſpel of Jeſus, ſurrounded with men excelling in every valuable accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and youths riſing after their great example—had I ſeen it then, what ſhould I have found it? A ſpot rank with weeds perhaps, or the obſcure retreat of ſome lawleſs and gloomy ſavage!</p>
            <p>O GLORIOUS change! O happy day! that now beholds the Sciences planted where bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity was before! that now ſees this Reſtitution
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008737_0058_1030A4E0C6786AF8"/>
at length brought to ſuch perfection, as to extend the Laurel to its firſt worthy ſons! how ought ſuch advances in knowlege to rejoice every heart among us; but eſpecially thoſe whoſe pious labors have contributed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently to that end.</p>
            <p>OH! heaven born Wiſdom, and thou divine Science! proceed, ſtill proceed! let other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries ſuch as this riſe, where other deſarts now extend; and, beyond theſe, let others and ſtill others riſe, thro' the remoteſt depths of this continent; till Chriſt's kingdom is made u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, and "the Heathen be given him for an inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion!"</p>
