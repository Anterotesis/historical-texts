            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not, in your little rambles, ſeen the ſkipping lambs looking inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently gay, and ſporting by the ſide of their dams? It delighted you to ſee them thus happy, and enjoying themſelves in the cheerful ſunſhine; but perhaps at other times, you have ſeen the tender creatures expoſed to ſtormy winds, or pinching froſt; your little hearts have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied them, and been ready to fear that the ſeverity of the winter would deſtroy them. In this diſtreſſed ſituation, how delightful to ſee the kind ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd come to their relief, gather them together, and lead them to a place of ſhelter and ſafety!</p>

ſuch as you are, he calls his lambs.</p>
               <p>He calls you lambs, becauſe, like them you are young, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and helpleſs; and like them you fly to others for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and protection.</p>
               <p>You are but of yeſterday, and know but little: little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the God that made you, of the Saviour who came to redeem you. You know little of the world in which you live, or of that world in which you are to live for ever. You ſtand in need of daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, both in the concerns of your ſoul and body; but your compaſſionate ſhepherd has
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047686_0007_10243DE41D1A8BD8"/>
promiſed, that he will feed his flock; he will feed you with the ſincere milk of his word, that you may grow thereby.</p>
               <p>He has ſaid, Aſk and ye ſhall receive, ſeek and ye ſhall find.</p>
               <p>Are you at a loſs what to aſk? Aſk, above all things, his favour, which is life: and his loving kindneſs, which is better than life. Aſk him to teach you more of himſelf, of his greatneſs, and goodneſs, that you may love him more, and ſerve him better.</p>
               <p>You are not only ignorant, but like the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047686_0008_10243DE705F8C730"/>
protection. You are expoſed to many dangers that you know nothing of: there are many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders to which your infant years are liable, and a thouſand accidents to which your tender frames are expoſed.</p>
               <p>How happy, amidſt all this weakneſs and dangers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that your kind ſhepherd has promiſed to gather you in his arms, and carry you in his boſom.</p>
               <p>Your parents do much for you, and you have reaſon to thank God for them. But <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> your kind ſhepherd, can do much more, he can ſupply all your need; in ſickneſs he can

ſave you, and in death deliver you; he can make you happy in this world, and happy for ever.</p>
               <p>Often think, children, how much love and compaſſion are contained in thoſe delightful words: He ſhall gather them in his arms, and carry them in his boſom. You know what it is to be folded in the fond arms of a compaſſionate father, and to hang on the breaſts of a tender mother.</p>
               <p>How often have they wiped away your tears, and eaſed the little ſorrows of your hearts? and while you are enjoying their love and affection, think,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047686_0010_10243DED78E15B08"/>
thus has my kind ſhepherd promiſed to fold me in his arms. How condeſcending in him to notice ſuch an ignorant and helpleſs creature as I am! What an honour to be called one of his lambs! How ſafe I am under his protection! He is Almighty, and none can pluck me out of his hands. The Lord is my ſhepherd; I ſhall not want any thing that is good for me.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I deſire to be one of the lambs that thou wilt gather in thy arms, and carry in thy boſom. I am ignorant, but I come to thee that I may be taught.—I am weak and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,

But I muſt tell you the whole of this pleaſing ſtory.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Jeſus</hi> was employed, as uſual, in teaching the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude who came to him, ſome pious parents brought their children to <hi>Jeſus</hi> that he might bleſs them. His diſciples, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of encouraging, rebuked thoſe who brought them; but when <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaw it he was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven; and he took them up in his arms and bleſſed them.</p>

Good children are humble, modeſt, and teachable, and ſo muſt all good people be. In heaven there are none who are proud, conceited, or ill-natured. In that world the ſaints are all lovely and amiable, ſuch as you children ought to be, and ſuch as you muſt be, if you would live with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his heavenly kingdom.</p>
               <p>Heaven is full of love; God himſelf is love; his ſaints dwell in love: and can you, children, expect to go to that world of love, if you do not love God, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and one another? If you are proud, malicious, or ill-natured, do you think
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047686_0016_10243DFB36E6B3E8"/>
that <hi>Jeſus</hi> would ſay, of ſuch as you is the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? No, theſe are the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And would you wiſh to live for ever with thoſe who are full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, pride, and anger? who hate God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and one another? no; we hope better things of you. You wiſh to be holy; for God is holy: to be modeſt and humble; for <hi>Jeſus</hi> was meek and lowly; to be loving and kind, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> may be able to ſay, of ſuch as you is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>How delightful muſt it be to thoſe who brought the children

to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to ſee them in the arms of their compaſſionate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? And there is nothing, my little friends, that your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parents ſo much wiſh for, as to ſee you coming to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for life and ſalvation. Though he is now in heaven, the arms of his love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion are ſtill open to receive you. He can beſtow upon you every bleſſing you ſtand in need of, both for ſoul and body; he can bleſs you in this world, and bleſs you for ever.</p>
               <p>Your pious parents have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready put you into the arms of this compaſſionate Saviour, and devoted you to his ſervice; and

               <p>YOU have heard children, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> your kind ſhepherd, while he was here upon earth, folded the lambs in his arms, and carried them in his boſom; and as he was now about to leave this world, and go to his Father, it was natural he ſhould be concerned about his flock—what would become of his ſheep and his lambs: he was going
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:047686_0021_10243E0920E41EC8"/>
to leave them in a world full of difficulties and dangers; he was afraid they might meet with ſtrange ſhepherds who would not care for the flock, nor lead them into good paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that they would be like ſheep having no ſhepherd.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Jeſus</hi> was thus caring for his ſheep, he looked round up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his diſciples, and fixing his eyes upon <hi>Peter,</hi> who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to love him better than the reſt, he ſaid unto him, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> ſon of <hi>Jonas,</hi> loveſt thou me? He ſaid unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee, He ſaith unto him, Feed my lambs, <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid unto him
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:047686_0022_10243E0C32FA6A40"/>
the third time, <hi>Simon,</hi> ſon of <hi>Jonas,</hi> loveſt thou me, <hi>Peter</hi> was grieved, becauſe he ſaid unto him the third time, Loveſt thou me? And he ſaid unto him, Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee, <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid unto him, Feed my ſheep.</p>
               <p>Why, my little friends, does <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſo often queſtion <hi>Peter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his love to him? he knew that <hi>Peter</hi> did indeed love him; but he was willing to try <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> love, and to ſhow how much he loved you, the lambs of his flock. Doeſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed love me, <hi>Peter?</hi> ſhow thy love to me by feeding my
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:047686_0023_10243E0E9442B4E0"/>
ſheep; feed my lambs; feed them with the ſincere milk of my word, that they may grow thereby; tell them, though I leave this world, and go to the Father, that I ſtill love them; that I go to prepare a place for them, that where I am, there they may be alſo; that I will come again, and receive them unto myſelf; that they ſhall never periſh; and that none ſhall pluck them out of my hands. Not only <hi>Peter,</hi> but all the miniſters of the goſpel, are ſhepherds, ſent by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to take care of his flock: and he ſays to them, as well as to <hi>Peter,</hi> Feed my ſheep, feed my lambs.</p>
               <p>

Though your miniſters are wiſe and learned, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to inſtruct the young and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; they are content to leave their ſtudies and their learning, that they may teach you the firſt principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the love of God; how you may be happy in this world, and happy for ever in heaven. And will you not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige them by ſeriouſly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their inſtruction, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to grow wiſe unto ſalvation? And, they not only inſtruct you, but they pray for you; they often bear you upon their hearts before God: they pray that you may grow in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:047686_0025_10243E1264F4A5C8"/>
grace, as well as in ſtature, and in favour with God and man; they pray, that the love of God may be ſhed abroad in your hearts, and that you may know and love the God of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>And if they thus kindly pray for you, will you not pray for them, that while they are teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, they may be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves taught of God, and that they may be bleſſed with every ſpiritual bleſſing in <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</hi>

Yes, children, it was <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the friend of ſinners, your compaſſionate Saviour, who was thus cruelly put to death. But you will aſk, why, what evil hath he done? He did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; he was holy, harmleſs, and ſeparate from ſinners: but he was wounded for our ſins, he was bruiſed for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; all we, like ſheep, have gone aſtray, we have turned every man to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed God, children, made us to be holy and happy but like the ſilly ſheep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

have wandered into the way that leads to death and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All mankind have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken God, broken his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and deſerve death.</p>
               <p>In this ſad ſtate, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our compaſſionate Saviour, ſaw us ready to periſh; and, like the good ſhepherd, offered to lay down his life for the ſheep; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we ſhould periſh, he would bear our ſins in his own body upon the croſs, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all our guilt.

And he ſaid, Lo! I come to do thy will, O God! and now having loved his own, he loved them unto the end; he loved them even unto death. Think, children, what he endured for your ſake, for your ſalvation.</p>
               <p>He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter. You cannot think of the innocent ſheep being led to the ſlaughter without pity and compaſſion: and can you read the ſad hiſtory of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's ſufferings and death without ſorrow and love?</p>
               <p>He was ſcourged, he was crowned with thorns, he was buffetted and ſpit upon, he was mocked and reviled, and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:047686_0032_10243E23A0BD0EC8"/>
then crucified between two thieves; and all this he bare like the patient lamb; dumb before his ſhearers, while they were ſtripping the wool from his back. When he was revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he reviled not again; but while his cruel murderers were taking away his life, he ſaid, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</p>
               <p>Now, my little friends, do not your hearts overflow with gratitude and love to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Saviour of ſinners? Has he thus loved you, and will you not love him? Greater love he could not ſhow, than by laying down his life for you,

he had power to ſave his life; with a look he could have ſtruck his enemies to the ground; but how then could the Scriptures be fulfiled? How could God be glorified, and ſinners ſaved?</p>
               <p>Will you not children, for ever hate ſin; becauſe that was the cauſe of his ſufferings and death? Surely the bleſſed God muſt hate ſin, or he would not have given up his dear, his we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <q>
                     <hi>Our Father which art in heaven.</hi>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WILL the great God, who made all things, and who dwells in the higheſt heavens, permit us to call him Father? Yes; theſe are the words that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf hath taught us. When ye pray, ſay, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who art in heaven.</p>
               <p>You have all, my little friends, been taught to ſay, Our Father who art in heaven:
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:047686_0038_10243E3285E3B0C0"/>
but have you been taught who this heavenly Father is? and what he has done for you? and what you muſt do to become his children? When you ſay, Our Father, do you feel ſuch a diſpoſition as a child ought to feel towards a tender father? Do you feel a reverence of him, and a love to him; a ſorrow for having offended him, and a deſire to be his dutiful and obedient children?</p>
               <p>Theſe are the diſpoſitions you ought to feel towards your earthly parents; and much more to your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:047686_0039_10243E341C9E0108"/>
And let me tell you, children, if you have never prayed in this manner, you have never prayed at all. To ſay the prayers only with your lips, is not praying; you muſt pray with your heart, or it is no prayer.</p>
               <p>It is affronting the bleſſed God to call him Father without loving him.</p>
               <p>Though he is in heaven, he ſees and knows all that you think, as well as that you ſay or do; in the darkneſs as well as in the light he ſees you.</p>
               <p>You will not then, children, any more affront the bleſſed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:047686_0040_10243E370F024518"/>
God, by drawing near to him with your lips, while your hearts are far from him? From this time will you not call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with all the duty and love that becomes obedient children? He is a kind and tender Father. Like as a father pitieth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo the Lord pities you.</p>
               <p>It is he who gives you every good thing that you enjoy. It is his flax that clothes you, and his corn that feeds you. It is he who preſerveth you from a thouſand accidents, healeth your diſeaſes, and crowneth you with loving kindneſs and tender mercies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:047686_0041_10243E3892434718"/>
And above all, he has ſent his dear, his well-beloved Son to redeem and ſave you; that you might not periſh, but have everlaſting life. Has your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father been thus kind to you, and will you not love him? Go, children, with al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Do you want food to eat? he who giveth food to the beaſts of the field, will ſeed you alſo. Do you want rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put on? he who cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the lilies of the field, will
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:047686_0042_10243E3B91FB0ED0"/>
much more clothe you. Your earthly parents may be taken from you by death; but your heavenly Father hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</p>
               <p>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? Yea, ſhe may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</p>
               <p>This is the kind language of your heavenly Father; and what ſhould be your language towards him? Should it not be all duty and love? Can you be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Go, like his dear children, and ſay to him, Our Father, who art in heaven, we thank thee, that thou wilt permit us to call thee by that tender, that delightful name; we would come to thee with all that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, love and affection, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thy children. We are grieved that we ſhould offend ſo kind a Father; forgive, we pray thee, the ſins and follies of thy children. May we be holy, for thou art holy; and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as thou, our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, art merciful. We come to thee for all that we want; for food and raiment; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, we pray for a heart to

they are more in number than the ſands upon the ſea-ſhore. They are new every morning, and freſh every evening. You ſhould love him, becauſe he is the greateſt and beſt of Beings, the Father of mercies, and the God of all grace; he is good to all and his tender, mercies are over all his works. You ſhould love him, becauſe he ſo loved he world as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Like as a father pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pities them that fear him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:047686_0048_10243E4B0FE66770"/>
The eyes of the Lord are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</p>
               <p>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good.</p>
               <p>The rich and poor, the old and young, may all join in this delightful ſervice. Let the rich love him, becauſe it is he who giveth them all things richly to enjoy. Let the poor love him, becauſe the poor man crieth, and the Lord heareth him and delivereth him out of all his trouble. Let the old love him, becauſe he is the length of their days. Let the young love him, becauſe he is the guide of their

youth. O love the Lord all his ſaints!</p>
               <p>And is he thus good to you, good to all, and will you not love him with all your ſoul, and with all your mind? Love him above all things; let him have the firſt place in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; think often upon God; think of him when you awake in the morning, and when you lay down at night; when you go out, and when you come in; let every freſh mercy lead your heart to him in gratitude, make you love him more, and ſerve him better.</p>
               <p>And if you love God with all your heart, you will love to
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:047686_0050_10243E5022CEC058"/>
pray to him, and to praiſe him. You will ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Whom have I in heaven, but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</p>
               <p>Lord! lift up thou the light of thy countenance upon me; and this ſhall put more joy and gladneſs into my heart, than when corn and wine increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>A day in thy courts is better than a thouſand elſewhere.</p>
               <p>I had rather be a door-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the tents of ſin and wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>This is the language of the pious ſoul, that loves God

above all things. And if you thus love God with all your heart, will it not grieve you to offend him?</p>
               <p>You would not willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the kind parent or friend you love, much leſs would you ſin againſt that God who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doing you good? If ye love me, ſays <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> keep my commandments.</p>
               <p>Thus, children, you muſt ſhow your love to God. And if you love him with all your heart, you will delight to pleaſe him always: you will do your duty in all things, becauſe it is well-pleaſing to your God.</p>

To love God and praiſe him, will be the work of heaven; and if you would be fit for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you muſt begin this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful work here on earth.

               <p>If you love to pray to God, and praiſe him here, you will think with pleaſure of that world, where you will love him more, and praiſe him better: where you ſhall never be tempted to ſin againſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; but ſhall love and

Go, children, if poſſible, where none can ſee you but God, your heavenly Father, and there pour out your hearts before him, with all the duty and affection of a child; tell him how much you love him for all his goodneſs to you; that you had rather have his favour, the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, than all the good things that this world can give you.</p>
               <p>You may tell him how griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you are, that your giddy hearts are ſo apt to forget him amidſt the follies and vanities of childhood and youth; that you ſo often pray to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:047686_0056_10243E5F6D71BA60"/>
that reverence, love, and affection, which you ought ever to feel for him; that you ſo often read his holy word with careleſsneſs and indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as if it were the word of man, and not the word of God, and that you are not made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and better by it.</p>
               <p>You may lament over the pride, obſtinacy, and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that you ſometimes feel in your hearts, and that you ſtrive ſo little againſt theſe ſins, that you may conquer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them.</p>
               <p>Thus may you humble your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, for all your ſins and follies, and beg, that

for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſake, he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them all; and grant you the aſſiſtance of his good Spirit, to help you to love him more, and ſerve him better.</p>
               <p>It is good, children, to draw near to God, to ſhow forth his loving kindneſs in the morning, and his faithfulneſs every night. Begin every day with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſervice. You cannot ſurely awake in the morning to health, to friends, to every bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life, without thanking the God of your mercies, who giveth you all things richly to enjoy.</p>
               <p>Dare not venture into the dangers and temptations of the

day, without praying that God would be with you, to keep you from ſin, and deliver you from evil. Nor can you ſurely lie down in peace at night, without thanking the kind hand that has kept you from evil, and crowned the day with his loving kindneſs and tender mercies, without aſking forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your heavenly Father for all that you have done amiſs. Thus may you commit yourſelves to his care, through the dangers of the night; for it is God only who can make you to dwell in ſafety.</p>
               <p>Thus, children, you may converſe in ſecret with your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:047686_0059_1023E5454F101FF8"/>
Father; and be aſſured, he who heareth the young ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens when they cry, will hear you when you pray unto him; he ſees in ſecret the feebleſt wiſh of your heart to love and ſerve him; he will remember the kindneſs of your youth, and will reward you openly. Fear not, children, though you ſhould have only a dark corner to pray in, your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſees you there: fear not, though your companions ſhould laugh at you for being ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe about your prayers; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whom you are to fear: fear him who can kill both ſoul and body in hell.</p>

Your heavenly Father ſees when you are aſhamed or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to pray to him. <hi>Jeſus</hi> has ſaid, He who is aſhamed of me, of him will I be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed before my Father and his holy angels; but he who confeſſeth me before men, him will I confeſs before my Father and his holy angels.</p>

               <p>UPON hearing theſe words I doubt not, my little friends, you are all eager to know what this one thing needful is? They are the words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and I will tell you upon what occaſion they were ſpoken.</p>
               <p>It came to paſs as <hi>Jeſus</hi> went about doing good, he entered into a certain village, and a
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:047686_0064_10243D7B58E93668"/>
woman, named <hi>Martha,</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received him into her houſe; and ſhe had a ſiſter, called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who ſat at <hi>Jeſus'</hi> feet, and heard his words; but <hi>Martha</hi> was cumbered about much ſerving, and came to him, and ſaid Lord, doeſt thou not care that my ſiſter hath left me to ſerve alone? Bid her therefore that ſhe help me. And <hi>Jeſus</hi> anſwered, and ſaid unto her, <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> thou art careful, and troubled about many things; but one thing is needful: and <hi>Mary</hi> hath choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that good part which ſhall not be taken away from her.</p>

And now, children, from this ſtory you may learn what the one thing needful is. It is to hear the words of eternal life, and inquire what you muſt do to be ſaved. And though you cannot now ſit at his feet as <hi>Mary</hi> did, while he was here upon earth, yet you may go to him as an humble learner. Like <hi>Mary,</hi> hear his words, and attend to the concerns of your ſouls; and like her chuſe that good part which ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Yes, children, it is a good thing to love God and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the ways of religion are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace. There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked; but great peace have they who love thy law. To pray to God, and to praiſe him is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful employment; to ſhow forth his loving kindneſs in the morning, and his faithfulneſs every night.</p>
               <p>Religion is a good thing: for it teaches us to be good ourſelves, and to do good to all around us.</p>
               <p>The religious child will be a good child; he will obey his

parents, not only becauſe he loves them, but becauſe God has ſaid, Honour thy father and thy mother. And <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has ſaid, Children, obey your parents in all things; he will be merciful and kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his heavenly Father is merciful and kind to all: he will be diligent and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe his Bible tells him he muſt not be ſlothful in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord. In ſhort, he will be a good child, that he may be the child of God, and have God for his father, and his friend for ever. And now, my little friends, muſt not that
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:047686_0069_10243D8877E75B08"/>
be a good thing that will make you thus good and happy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus</hi> has ſaid, this good part ſhall never be taken away from you: your parents and friends may be taken from you by death, but if you are good, God will be your father, and friend for ever. Your riches may be taken away from you; but if you are good, you have better treaſures in heaven; death itſelf cannot take away this good part from you; for you know that the righteous ſhall dwell with God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ever in heaven.</p>
               <p>And now, children, what ſhall I ſay more to perſuade you
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:047686_0070_10243D8AAA38F5C0"/>
to chuſe this good part? Your parents tell you it is the good part; they have found it ſo themſelves, and they wiſh, above all things, to ſee you make the ſame choice. <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſays it is the good part; go to him, ſit at his feet, and ſay to him, Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to whom ſhould we go but unto thee? thou haſt the words of eternal life, teach us what we muſt do to be ſaved; teach us the one thing needful; teach us, like <hi>Mary,</hi> to chuſe that good part that ſhall never be taken away from us.</p>

               <p>WHAT a beautiful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is this of the goodneſs and compaſſion of God! he is good you ſee, even to the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and ſmalleſt of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;

to the beaſts of the field, and the birds of the air; even the ſparrow, the meaneſt of the little feathered tribe, is not beneath his notice.</p>
               <p>The God who made them does not forget to give them their daily bread; numerous as they are, there is food pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them all: the trees are loaded with berries, that the birds may not want food in winter. Your heavenly Father is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. And does he thus feed the fowls of the air? does he thus clothe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lowers of the field? and do ye not think, children,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:047686_0091_10243DC075116F18"/>
that he will much more take care of you? Yes, he has ſaid, Fear not, ye are of more value than many ſparrows; your heavenly Father will much more feed you.</p>
               <p>You are of more value than many ſparrows; for you have ſouls immortal, ſouls that muſt live for ever. When the birds and beaſts die, there is an end of them; but when you, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren die, there is not an end of you; for your ſouls will live after your bodies are dead.</p>
               <p>You are of more value; for you are made for nobler ends than they: you are made to know God, and ſerve him here
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:047686_0092_10243DC37B1CEB58"/>
on earth, that you may dwell with him, and be happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in heaven.</p>
               <p>The ſparrows know not the God who made them, the hand that feeds them; but you, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, can know and remember your Creator; you can love the God who feeds and clothes you; you can pray to him daily for what mercies you want, and give him thanks for what you receive; you can love him as your heavenly Father, and you are ſure that he will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee God has made you a nobler creature than the fowls of the air, or the beaſts of
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:047686_0093_10243DC5B0CA6310"/>
the field; and if he provides for them, he will much more provide for you: fear not, your heavenly Father will not let you want bread to eat, or raiment to put on.</p>
               <p>He who heareth the young ravens when they cry, will much more hear you when you cry unto him. Are you poor? fear not; for the poor man cries, and the Lord hears him, and delivers him out of all his trouble. Are you fatherleſs? fear not; for God is the Father of the fatherleſs. Or have your father and mother forſaken you? fear not; for the Lord will take you up. He knows
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:047686_0094_10243DC734BA1F88"/>
all your wants, and all your fears; nothing can befal you without his permiſſion. Are you ſick? whom the Lord lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he chaſteneth; to ſhow how much your heavenly Father cares for you, he has ſaid, The very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>
               <p>Does your heavenly Father thus care for you, then, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, what have you to fear? You have nothing to fear but ſin; nothing to fear but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing God: to make God angry with you would be ſad indeed; but if you love and ſerve him, you need not fear that he will be angry with you,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:047686_0095_10243DC96C9CF1B8"/>
he is only angry with the wicked, with thoſe who do not love and ſerve him.</p>
               <p>Remember, he expects more from you than from the fowls of the air: God has not given them reaſon, and therefore he expects nothing from them; but he expects that you ſhould love him as your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and be his dutiful and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient children. Go, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thank your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, that he has given you more underſtanding than the beaſts of the field, and made you wiſer than the fowls of heaven.</p>

as he liveth, he ſhall be lent to the Lord.</p>
               <p>From this pleaſing hiſtory, we learn what is the duty of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parents: It is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they receive their children at the hand of God, and to devote them to his fear and ſervice. And, perhaps, ſome of you, my little friends, like <hi>Samuel,</hi> have had a pious mother, who has devoted you to the Lord: They have ſaid in ſome ſuch language as this: For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath granted my requeſt. It is God who hath given it to me, and ſhall not I devote it to him, and to his ſervice?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:047686_0110_10243E830F64CFA8"/>
He hath ſaid, All ſouls are mine; the ſoul of the father, and the ſoul of the ſon; and when he puts this child into my hands, does he not, as it were, ſay, Here is an immortal ſoul that may be happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for ever; bring it up for me and my ſervice.</p>
               <p>And is it poſſible that this dear child, whom I ſo tenderly love, may be made, through my neglect, for ever miſerable? Dreadful thought! But how pleaſing to think, that, with the bleſſing of God upon my endeavours, it may be taught to know the God who made it, to love and ſerve him here, and
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:047686_0111_10243E855B0E6440"/>
to dwell with him for ever and ever. Delightful thought! Soon as its infant tongue can ſpeak, it ſhall be taught the praiſes of its God and Saviour, its little hands be lifted up to the God of its mercies, and its feet taught the way to the houſe of its Creator. O, my God! I deſire not that it may be rich or great in this world; only give it a heart to love and ſerve thee: to thee who gave it to me, would I ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote it, and may it be thine for ever!</p>
               <p>This has been the language of many a pious mother; and we would hope, children, of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:047686_0112_10243E8731E76BD0"/>
ſome of yours. And ſurely you will not diſappoint their pleaſing hopes and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Conſider the many prayers they have put up for you, the many tears they have ſhed upon your account. How can they bear the thought, that their children ſhould be the children of the devil, inſtead of the children of God! Do they love God above all things, and muſt they not deſire that you ſhould love him too? Do they hope to dwell for ever in heaven, and muſt they not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire, that you, their dear children, may be likewiſe
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:047686_0113_10243E8A6AA55008"/>
heirs of that heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</p>
               <p>Children, you never can be thankful enough to God for ſuch parents as theſe; let your behaviour to them be all duty, love, and obedience, and let not their prayers and inſtruction be loſt upon you; go upon your knees, and thank God for all the mercies of your infant years, that you have been ſo early taught to know the God of your mercies, and to call him Father. Pray that your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may have the joy of heart to ſee you love God above all things, and ſerve him with a cheerful heart and willing mind,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:047686_0114_10243E8CB065F808"/>

               <p>Wiſdom is the principal thing; therefore get wiſdom: She ſhall give to thine head an ornament of grace, a crown of glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee.</p>
               <p>You will ſoon find much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:047686_0124_10243EABD8FA6CA8"/>
from books that tell you what ſort of a world this is, and what was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were born into it. You will read with pleaſure the hiſtories of the wiſe and good, that you may learn to be like them; but, children, we wiſh above all things, to ſee you wiſe unto ſalvation. You may know much of the world, and of the works of God, and yet know nothing of the God who made the world, and all things that are in it.</p>
               <p>You may be ſo wiſe as to get riches and honours in this world, and yet be ſo ignorant, as not to know what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you for ever.</p>

You may know much, and yet know nothing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and him crucified, which the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> thought the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſdom of all: in ſhort, you may know much of this world, and yet know nothing of that world in which you are to live for ever.</p>
               <p>Now, children, would it not be ſad, if after all your knowledge, you ſhould know nothing of God, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of heaven, of hell, or of your own ſouls?</p>
               <p>Time here can be but ſhort; and will it not be ſad when death comes, if you ſhould not have God for your friend, and

                  <hi>Jeſus</hi> for your Saviour? Sad indeed, to hear the bleſſed God ſay at laſt, Depart from me, I know you not.</p>
               <p>Thus, children, you ſee that religion is the true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that he only is wiſe, who is wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Will you not then eagerly inquire where you can learn this true wiſdom?</p>
               <p>The text informs you, that it is the holy Scriptures that are able to make you wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: they are the words of God himſelf; for holy men of old wrote as God taught them by his holy Spirit; they are words of eternal life; words
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:047686_0127_10243EB40FDBB140"/>
whereby you may be ſaved. Young as you are, there is much in them that you can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; for they are written for the young as well as for the old, for the unlearned as well as for the learned.</p>
               <p>You will there find many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful hiſtories to entertain and inſtruct you; many amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples to make you wiſe and good.</p>
               <p>The holy Scriptures will tell you much of God, how great, and how good he is; ſo great, that the heaven of heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain him, and yet ſo humble as to dwell in every contrite heart. You will there
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:047686_0128_10243EB5C7E22870"/>
find, that God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting life. That <hi>Jeſus,</hi> your compaſſionate Saviour, came to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt, to call you to repentance, and to ſave you from your ſins. You will there learn, that you muſt be holy if you would be happy for ever; that you are to love God above all things, and to love your neighbour as your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that you muſt be good, and do good to all around you.</p>
               <p>You will there find, that time is ſhort, and that death
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:047686_0129_10243EBA433B29E8"/>
may come at a time when you think not of it; that therefore you muſt watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation; and that your Lord, when he cometh, may find you watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

thereby. Above all, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the compaſſionate lover of ſouls, the great vine-dreſſer in God's vineyard, has nouriſhed you with his word and ordinances, he has drawn you with the cords of love, and he has laid down his life for you, that you might not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>And now, my little friends, ſuppoſe the great huſbandman, after all that he has done for his vineyard, ſhould come and find no fruit upon his vines and his fig-trees? Sad indeed, if he ſhould come, year after year, ſeeking fruit and finding none, after he has done ſo much for
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:047686_0143_10243ED0B1514A38"/>
you. Will he not expect that you ſhould bring forth the fruits of holineſs to the praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God? You who are train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in piety and goodneſs, who have been taught from your earlieſt infancy to know God, to love him, and to ſerve him, to pray to him, and to praiſe him, what do you more than others?</p>
               <p>Conſider how many poor unhappy children there are, whoſe wicked parents have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught them to know the God who made them, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour who died to redeem and ſave them. Will you not pity and pray for them? and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:047686_0144_10243ED3A3A2E108"/>
God expects much more from you. Young as you are, you may bring forth ſome fruit; he expects that you be modeſt, humble, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, obedient to your parents, and loving and kind to all; but perhaps, he has come for one, two, or three years, and found none of theſe fruits: no fear of God, no love to him, no prayer to him, no care about your ſouls, no thoughts of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or of hell. Sad indeed! He waits to be gracious, and yet you will not regard him. Have you not reaſon to fear he will ſay to his vine-dreſſer, Cut it down, why cumbereth
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:047686_0145_10243ED625204D90"/>
it the ground? Remember eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plant that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and how ſoon you may be taken away you know not. Young plants are aften removed, often in mercy taken away from the evil to come; take care that you are not removed in anger, becauſe you bear no fruit. It is ſad, indeed, to be mere cumberers of the ground; to live in the world without being good our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or doing good to thoſe around us; we root ſuch plants out of our garden, and caſt them among the weeds that are to be burnt.</p>
               <p>So at the laſt day God ſhall
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:047686_0146_10243ED90F330978"/>
ſay to his angels, Gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tares; that is, the wicked and unprofitable, and bind them in bundles to be burnt.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed God is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any ſhould periſh; he waits to be gracious; he comes, year after year, ſeeking fruit; and it is not till there is no more hope, that he ſays, Cut it down: he was willing to hope year after year, that it would bloſſom, and bring forth fruit; but, alas! he has been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and he now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the awful ſentence, Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? But ſee, <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:047686_0147_10243EDB368B9B98"/>
the kind vine-dreſſer, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds for you: O! my Father! let it alone this year alſo: true, thou haſt done much for it, haſt borne it with much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience year after year, and ſtill it has been barren and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and there ſeem now but little hope that it will ever bear fruit; but ſpare it one year more; I know not how to give it up; let it alone this year al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: let inſtruction, reproof, and correction, be tried a little longer; perhaps the heart that is now hard may be ſoftened and melt; the temper that is now rough and obſtinate, may become gentle and teachable;
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:047686_0148_10243EDD80A54C68"/>
the diſobedient child may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dutiful and obedient; and the child who ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ripe for deſtruction, be made a child of God, and an heir of the kingdom of heaven. Then it will be well indeed! then there will be joy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for the plant that was dead is alive again, and will flouriſh for ever in the Paradiſe of God.</p>

            <head>REMARKS, Extracted from "an eſtimate of the RELIGION Of the FASHIONABLE WORLD.</head>
            <p>IT is ſeriouſly to be regretted, in an age like the preſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for indifference in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and levity in manners, and which ſtands ſo much in need of lively patterns of firm and reſolute piety, that many who really are chriſtians on the ſobereſt conviction, ſhould not
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:047686_0152_10243EE866AB94F8"/>
appear more openly and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly on the ſide they have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed; that they aſſimilate ſo very much with the manners of thoſe about them (which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they yet ſcruple not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve); and, inſtead of an avowed but prudent ſteadfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought preciſe and over-ſcrupulous; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſeem to diſavow their right principles, by conceſſions and accommodations not ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſtent with them. They often ſeem cautiouſly afraid of <hi>doing too much,</hi> and <hi>going too far;</hi> and the dangerous plea,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:047686_0153_10243EFE1E980BE8"/>
the neceſſity of <hi>living like other people,</hi> of <hi>being like the reſt of the world,</hi> and the propriety of <hi>not being particular,</hi> is brought as a reaſonable apology for a too yielding and indiſcriminate comformity.</p>
            <p>But, at a time when almoſt all are ſinking into the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruption, how beautiful a rare, a ſingle integrity is, let the inſtances of Lot and Noah declare.

            <p>Few indeed of the more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and decent have any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to that degree of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoyment of their own pleaſures. For a formal and ceremonious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the outward duties of chriſtianity may not only be kept up without exciting cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,

but will even procure a certain reſpect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcilable with a voluptuous and diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life. So far many go; and fo far "as godlineſs is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the life that <hi>is,</hi>" it paſſes without reproach.</p>
            <p>But as ſoon as men begin to conſider religious exerciſes not as a decency, but a duty; not as a commutation for a ſelf-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy temper, and a virtuous conduct: as ſoon as they feel diſpoſed to carry the effect of their devotion into their daily life: as ſoon as their principles diſcover themſelves,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:047686_0156_10243EED080B5380"/>
by leading them to withdraw from thoſe ſcenes, and abſtain from thoſe actions, in which the gay place their ſupreme happineſs as ſoon as ſomething is to be <hi>done,</hi> and ſomething is to be <hi>parted with;</hi> then the world begins to take offence, and to ſtigmatize the <hi>activity</hi> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained <hi>inoperative,</hi> and had only evaporated in <hi>words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when religion, like the vital principles, takes its ſeat in the heart, and ſends out ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of life and heat to every part; diffuſes motion, ſoul, and vigour, through the whole

circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the converſation, breaks out into a lively zeal for the honour of God, and the beſt intereſts of mankind: then the ſincerity, or the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of that perſon will become queſtionable: and it muſt be owing to a very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate combination of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances indeed, if he can at once preſerve the character of parts and piety.</p>
            <p>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too ſtrict, or too good. Where there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to appear ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

for the charge of enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm (as there are indeed too often in good people eccentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities which juſtify the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure), we may depend upon it, that it proceeds from ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the judgment, and not from any exceſs in the piety; for in goodneſs there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: and it is as prepoſterous to ſay that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wiſe, too ſtrong, or too heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; ſince the higheſt point in all theſe is only the perfection of that quality which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in a lower degree. There may be an <hi>imprudent,</hi> but there cannot be a <hi>ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant</hi>

goodneſs. An ardent imagination may miſlead a rightly turned heart; and a weak intellect may incline the beſt intentioned to aſcribe too much value to things of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſmall importance.

            <p>And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when their "mint" and "aniſe" are rigorouſly tithed.</p>
