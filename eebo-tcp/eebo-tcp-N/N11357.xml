            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE is not a single Pamphlet, written in North-America, that does not, by some Accident, or other, find its Way, to England. At a Time, when the English News-papers, may probably, be filled with Equipments of Fleets, Embarkations of Armies, &amp;c. the dullest Composition, relating to the Affairs of this Country, will be read there, with Avidity. The Author has therefore thought it proper, to subjoin here, and there, a Note, for the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, of his English Readers. He has occasionally quoted, a few Scraps of Latin, not because, like Panurge, he chooses to speak any Language, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his Mother Tongue; for he abhors Pedantry and Affectation of every Kind: But partly from his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014359_0004_0F91EC7A975432D0"/>
Apprehension of the Tarrers, and Featherers, of the Country, in which he resides; none of whom, he is well assured, were ever bred, at a Latin School: And partly, from Respect, to the female Part of his Readers, for whose Innocence. and Modesty, he has a sacred Regard. At the same Time, left, while the latter acquit his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they should think hardly, of his Morals,â€”he begs Leave to assure them, that Ribaldry, is unknown to that Language. The Philosophers, Poets, and Historians, with whose Names, the Men, are too prone to insult their Understandings, abounding with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which literally translated, would be too foul, for the Mouths, of the most brutal of a modern Rabble.</p>

These Standards were erected perhaps in Imitation of certain well known Signs in Blood-Bowl-Alley of London, and in la Rue D'Enfer of Paris. The Resorts of Bullies, Spies, Informers, Incendiaries, Highwaymen, and Murderers.</p>
            <p>This Custom is not common to all the Publishers of News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Papers; some of the Fraternity, equally malignant in their Designs, and more successful in their Operations, hang out no Sign at all. They are of old established Credit. Their Wine needs no Bush.</p>

Face of numerous Committees, who have taken the same sage Precautions to prevent the Introduction of his Publications into their respective Realms, as if they had been consign'd from Smyrna, or Aleppo, in a Time of a general Pestilence.</p>
            <p>He grows bolder, by Persecution, to the Confusion of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Set of Scriblers, and of an envious Gang of Rivals, who constantly mark him in their News-Papers to the deluded Rabble for Destruction. The Public, is in the Author's Opinion, much obliged to him, and to the good Sense, and Liberality of the Gentlemen of all Parties in that Province, by whom he is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced and employed indifferently, as his Gazetteer, and his Catalogue of Pamphlets testify.</p>

               <hi>Who scowl on Wealth.</hi> P. 5, l. 27.] No Man of common Observation, who has crossed the Atlantic, can have failed to remark, the great Difference between the Manners, of the lower and middling Sort of People in England, and of People of the same Classes here. Altho' those Orders of Englishmen, are not much celebrated for their Civility. The Author, who had often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in certain Countries of Europe, the miserable and abject State of that great and sacred Portion of the human Species; and had seen the insolent, and brutal Abuse of Rank, Titles, and Power, on his first Arrival in North-America, exulted in an Appearance, so honourable to Humanity; he recollected the Observation of a Philosopher, in discovering a Circle exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd on an unknown Shore, where he happened to be ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked; and thought this as sure a Proof of general Felicity, as that of Civility and Science. Jealous tho' he is naturally of his Superiors (and his Superiors are innumerable) he begins to find he was mistaken, and to perceive that there are Pleasures, like the Pleasures of Excess, exquisite but short-lived, and ending in Disease and untimely Death.</p>
            <p>These Men begin to look upon their Superiors as if the Order of the Universe had been inverted in their Favour; as if they were possessed of what naturally belonged to themselves, and were determined to seize the first Opportunity to recover it <hi>Vi et Armis.</hi>

Conduct in general, of the Natives of this Country, who have resided in Europe, or have conversed much with Europeans, and of those who never passed the Limits of their own, or of some neighbouring province. Arts, Sciences, Knowledge, Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments, Wealth, Power, Dignity, are all comparative. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons are frequently mortifying in the extremest Degree to that Vanity, which is inseparable from our Nature: But without it no Man can form a true Estimate of himself, or establish a just Rule of his Conduct. However nauseous the Medicine may be, it is a salutary one. An overweening Conceit of the Importance of this Country, and a very inadequate Knowledge, or a total Ignorance of the Parent Country, are among the fatal Sources of the dreadful Calamities, at this Moment impending over a Part of this Country; may they never extend over the Whole.</p>

There are three or four Pamphlets, said to be written in America, within these twelve Months, by Gentlemen called Whigs. These Gentlemen appear by their Writings to be Men of Sense and Candour. They are Proofs, in the Author's Opinion, how frequently Men are led by Youth, Inexperience, Confinement to narrow Scenes, Want of Leisure, and general enlarged Knowledge, to form false and fatal Conclusions, from the noblest Principles.

The Doctor, it seems, had given Orders, that for the future, no Scholar, should deal with Mother Bat, the Apple-Woman.

She could not afford to sell quite so cheap as Mother Bat. Poor York was very much nettled at these Orders, for he was a very kind hearted Boy, and used to lay out a great Deal of Money upon Oranges and Cheese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes, &amp;c. to treat his Comrades, Moreover Mother Bat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be a near Relation of his Gradmamma: However, he never would have join'd the Scholars if he had not been afraid of the great Boys: He was forgiven upon Condition, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when he thought himself ill-treated by the Praepostors or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he would come and tell his Complaints to the Doctor, and not run up and down as he used to do, telling Stories against him to all the Bargemen, Coblers, Tinkers, Blacksmiths, News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper Carriers, Pedlars, &amp;c. of the Parish.</p>

               <hi>Penn.</hi> P. 14. L. 23.] A Descendant of an illegitimate Son of Admiral Penn, who with Venables conquered the Island of Jamaica. His paternal Relations, according to the benevolent Spirit of their virtuous Ancestor, the celebrated Legislator of Pennsylvania, treated him with as much Kindness, as if he had been legally descended; he was (not long ago) the very best Boy of the College, a plain, modest, amiable, sweet temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Youth; so very innoffensive in his Behaviour, that he was never known to Quarrel with any Body, for he had often heard his Relations, who were excellent examplary Men, remark, that it was preposterous and horrible for Creatures who pretended to be Rational, to be one Moment bowing, scraping, cringing, and flattering, and the next, damning one anothers Bloods for Scoundrels, knocking each others Eyes out, and running one another thro' the Body, for every Trifle. It is said, however, that he is of late very much altered, by keeping Company with Vir. Car. Mar. and Mass. and by the Conversation, during the Holidays, of some Foreign Merchants, ho frequent his Uncles House upon Business, and is grown a Fop, Swears, Drinks, Bullies, and talks of Duels, &amp;c. to the extreme Grief of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Relations. However, as early Impressions are not easily wholly effaced, it is hoped a little gentle Correction, and his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's Remonstrances, may have reclaimed him. His Pique to the Doctor, was for much the same Reason as York's, excepting, that he was not related to Mother Bat; he was uncommonly tall for his Age, of which he was not a little Vain, and would mutter now and then, that the Doctor durst not touch a Hair of his Head, he was a Match for the old Fellow.</p>

very acoomplished, sprightly, sensible Lads, but the sauciest Boys of the whole College, as proud as Lucifer. They were nicknamed by the Rest of the Scholars, your Honour, your Grace, your Majesty. They had been accustomed from their Infancy to wear tawdry Cloaths, to ride in Coaches and fix, to eat and drink what they liked, to be waited upon by a great Number of Servants, whom they saw every Day goaded like Oxen, and beat like Dogs. At College they were pert and idle, and of course much disliked by the Doctor. They were hated by the Dames where they lodged, for they used to Dâ€”n her for an old Bâ€”h, because she did not cure her Bacon with Salt Petre, and put Cinnamon and Mace into her minc'd Pyes. Their Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days were spent at Sadler's Wells, Mary-Bone Gardens, Taverns, and Bâ€”wâ€”y House, where they hectored and swore like the Bellies of the House. At College they distinguished themselves by robbing the Ban-Yards, Quarrelling with the Barge-Men, Forming a Maccaroni Club, Gaming, Drinking, Whoring and talking of New-Market Meetings. Several Reasons were given for their running from the College. They were in Debt to all the Public Houses, Bâ€”wâ€”y Houses, Shopkeepers, Taylors, Pastry Cooks, and Fruit Shops at Windsor: Car. took a Pique to the Usher, and stole behind him one Day as he was going into the School, and with a Piece of blue Crayon slily marked on his Back, R.

Vir. was obliged to run off: His Master it seems, had threatened to Flog him for some Fault or another, if he did not mend his Manners; upon which he had the Impudence to throw a Chaw of Tobacco in his Face, take to his Heels, and call to the Boys to follow him. These young Gentlemen would have been all expelled, if some of their very near Relations, well known to the Doctor, and highly respected by him, as they well deserved to be, had not interecded for him; telling the Doctor, it was pitty to ruin the poor Lads utterly for a few boyish Tricks, which Age and Reflection might make them ashamed of after very severe Correction, and begging hard for Forgiveness, they were permitted to remain at College.</p>

of these Boys will serve for a Description of the rest. They are among the oldest Boys of the School. Their Fathers being often at Sea, or constantly employed in their Farms, had left them in the earlier, Parts of their Life, to the Care and Tuition of their Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, and maiden Aunts, who made them read, every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, some select Chapters of the Old Testament; entertained them in the Winter Evenings, with Stories of the Bloody Queen Mary, the Gun Powder Plot, the Irish Massacre, the Act of Uniformity, &amp;c. Told them what a wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Monster Charles the first was, to let People fetch a Walk, Play at Cricket, and go a Skaiting on the Sabbath. Made him read Prynne's Histrio Mastic, Killing no Murder, &amp;c. Repeated to him the crying Sin of Fornication, Swearing, and taking the Lord's Name in Vain, made him get by Heart, how Mr. Pride, the Drayman, Mr. Hewson, the Cobler, came to be Colonels, Mr. Praise God Bare bones, the Felmonger, a Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Farmer Cromwell, of the Isle of Ely, Lord High Protector of Great-Britain and Ireland. They led him to Church every Sabbath, where he spent five Hours twice a Day, hearing the Minister preach about David's Rebellion against Saul. About Agag, and the Amalakites. Binding Kings in Chains, and Nobles in Fetters of Iron. The glorious Atchievements of Joshua, at the Seige and Surrender of Jericho, the Priests of Baal, &amp;c. Their Fathers were a sagacious Sort of Men, and hearing that Boys sometimes made Acquaintances at Eton, that proved very Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to them when they engaged in Business and the World; sent them there contrary to the Customs of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and of their Relations. These Boys did not appear to be so bad as Car. Vir. and Mar. but some how or other, they were much less beloved by the whole College. They rarely mix'd with the rest of the Boys, if they did, it was only to set them against the Doctor, calling him a cruel, abominable Tyrant; that he design'd to give them harder Tasks, flog them more than ever, and keep them at Eton, all the Holidays. If a Boy happened to take the Lord's Name in Vain, they would give him a Knock in the Face, and tell him the Dâ€”l would carry him to Hell in his Sleep. They never play'd at Cricket, Fives, Leap Frog, or any other Game with the rest. When they bought Apples, they stole into a Corner, and eat them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; if they saw any of the Youngsters with an Orange, or a Cheese-cake, they would snatch it out of his Hand, vow it was theirs, that they had stolen it out of their Pockets; if they dared to complain, they gave him a Kick on the Breech, bid him go and complain to the Doctor, they did not care a Fâ€”t, for the Doctor, the Doctor might Kiss their Aâ€”es.</p>

They had been confin'd several Months to their Chambers, to hard Study, when the Author last heard of them; and were not to be released, till they had publickly acknowledged their Faults on their bare Knees, asked the Doctor's forgiveness; solemnly promised to be good Boys for the future, and received a very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and exemplary Flogging.</p>
            <p>There was at the College, a young Gentleman of the Name of Can. the only Scholar of any Consequence, who was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the Dormer's Arms, because they knew it would have been to no purpose. Can. was a very polite, good natur'd, sprightly young Cavalier, danc'd the best Minuet of any Boy in the School, had rode the great Horse, very brave, and an excellent Fencer; he had lately been remov'd from another public School, where he had been very hardly used, seldom had his Belly full, was flogg'd unmercifully by the Master, Ushers, and Praeposters, for the slightest Fault of Mistake, and kick'd and cuff'd about by all the Servants of the College; of whom he never durst complain, for fear of worse Treatment. Finding this to very different from the School he had left, he conceiv'd a great Affection and reverence for Doctor Barnet, and behaved so modestly, and dutifully, that there never was a single Complaint against him. Can was much liked by the Boys who were acquainted with him, always chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obliging, laughing, singing and dancing, never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining.

He had been many years a Member of a very respectable Club, and was as much esteemed by his Brother Members, and treated with as much Kindness, as any Man. From the Moment that he was seized with this strange, fatal Delirium, he became another Sort of Man, always dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, for ever complaining, that he was shov'd down to the lower End of the Table, had not his Share of Fat, could not get a Bit of the Green, &amp;c. that they were always plotting against him, at the Upper-end of the Table: That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly took Advantage of his occasional Absence, and never waited for his Consent, when they made any new Rules for the Club. When the Reckoning was called for, he would throw down a Half-penny, and swear till he was black in the Face, that it was as good a Guinea, as ever came from the Mint. He would take a common Farmer for a Field-Marshal, a Plowman for a Lieutenant General, a Set of Puppets for Ministers States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Kings; a Wind-mill for some blood-thirsty gigantic Tyrant, and a Flock of harmless Animals, for an Army of the Enemy. He constantly mistook his Friends for his Foes, and his Foes for his Friends; herded with the lowest and vilest of the Rabble, and shunned the Society of his old Companions, the Clergyman of the parish, his Neighbour the Gentlemen Farmer, Squire Question, Squire Tensi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Every Body remembers how he took up his Lodgings one Night at a Hedge Alehouse, and thought himself in a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Castle, dreamt that he was attacked by a furious Giant, jumpt out of Bed, ran to his Sword, attacked a Hogshead of
