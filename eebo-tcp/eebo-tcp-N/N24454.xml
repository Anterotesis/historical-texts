            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Respected Friends, and Fellow-Citizens,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN attempting to commemorate the Birth-day of our country, the glorious nativity of AMERICAN INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE, my mind is deeply impressed with the magnitude of the subject, and the great disproportion between my abilities and my wishes.</p>
            <p>The interesting events, which this occasion presents to our view, have long been the subject of political dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion. Indeed, they will ever afford the most animating field to the Statesman and Historian, as well as the Poet and the Orator, while genius and literature exist, or the love of Liberty and Independence enkindle the fire of patriotism in the American breast.—A theme so interesting can never lose the charms of novelty. A field so extensive; so richly fraught with every nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blessing for its fruit; opening and brightening with the lapse of years, and blooming with increasing fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance to the end of time, can never be barren of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment—never cease to yield an equal harvest of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032367_0003_0FF1FA0CB564ABB0"/>
gratitude and joy. The splendor of such a bright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation of events, all brought to a point in the AME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICAN INDEPENDENCE as their common centre, like the glorious luminary of Heaven, leads the mind of the beholder, dazzled with its lustre, to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same Divine Original. Like that, its beams are diffused in every direction. Its light hath already penetrated the dark abodes of despotism and the bright morning of FREEDOM dawns upon a benighted world.</p>
            <p>To what point in the horrizon, then, shall I first direct your view? Amidst such a vast variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, too interesting to be unnoticed, and yet too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to be recited, by what rule is the selection to be made?—what guide shall direct me in the method of arrangement?—Unversed, as I am, in the science of government and politics—unskilled in the arts of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory—enfeebled by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> indisposition, and straitened for time in preparation; I should have declined the difficult, tho' honourable part assigned me this day, but for the interest I feel in the occasion, and the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive solicitations of those whose requests, with me, have the force of commands. These considerations it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped will candidly limit the bounds of expectation.— Yes, I gather a generous encouragement from the very countenances of my audience; a pleasing confidence that the imperfections of the speaker will be hidden and lost in the importance of his subject. This confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, indeed, arises to assurance, when, in looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me, I behold such a number of tried patriots, who have personally wielded the sword in the bloody contest for American Freedom, and who must ever, on this anniversary festival, experience a superior, I had
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032367_0003_0FF1FA0CB564ABB0"/>
almost said, enviable elevation of sentiment, the most refined participation of the general joy. To such I could freely commit myself, and risque the language of patriotism for acceptance, were I but simply to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them, that this is the Birth-day of American In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence—the sweet, tho' hard-earned reward of all their labors, dangers and wounds, in the cause of our common country.</p>
            <p>To commemorate, with decent expressions of festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and mirth, events of great national importance— such as manifest the distinguishing favor and goodness of Heaven, and, in their effects, are productive of rich and extensive blessings to mankind, is a rational and highly-becoming exercise—an exercise which duty joins with inclination to enforce. This sentiment we are warranted to adopt, both from the examples and precepts on sacred record, and the uniform practice of mankind in all ages and countries.</p>
            <p>And, among all the events which dazzle upon the page of American history, in which is the prosperity of our country more deeply interested, than in the one we are now convened to celebrate? The <hi>FOURTH</hi> OF <hi>JULY</hi> must ever stand foremost on the list of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican festivals. On this day we will annually join our joyful acclamations with those of our brethren throughout the extensive continent. Nor is this all: We will hand down this heroic DECLARATION of INDEPENDENCE, a rich legacy, and firm guarantee to our children's children—the unborn millions of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity shall arise and bless the Day, and every succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation unite to perpetuate the joy.</p>
            <p>Twenty-one years have now elapsed, since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this joyful aera—since those immortal
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032367_0004_0FF1FA0E99E97028"/>
Patriots, the members of the first American Congress, in the face of incensed despotism, and in defiance of the most powerful and warlike nation in Europe—tho' unassisted, unarmed, unallied, and invested with fleets and armies; with that resolution which surmounted every difficulty—with that heroism which braved eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry danger, and with that firmness and fortitude which shocked even our enemies, and astonished the world— after reciting a lengthy catalogue of our sufferings and wrongs—boldly renounced all allegiance to the British Crown, and declared, for themselves and their bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Country, that these (till then) thirteen <hi>Colonies,</hi> WERE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> AND OF RIGHT OUGHT TO BE, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES.—For the support of this important declaration, and that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recede from their purpose, they mutually pledged
"their lives, their fortunes, and their most sacred honor;"
at the same time addressing a solemn appeal to Heaven for the justice of our cause, and the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our injured rights.</p>
            <p>This declaration has been read to you, and, I doubt not, has excited in every breast emotions congenial with those from which they originally flowed; a detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of tyranny; a conscious dignity of the American character; a spark of the immortal fire of <hi>Seventy-six.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the happy enjoyment of the fruits of Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the copious blessings of Liberty, Prosperity and Peace, it is with a mixture of pain and exultation, we look back on the horrors of war, the momentous scenes of danger, difficulty and distress, thro' which we have passed; while in these we recount the price of our blessings, and review the successful struggles of our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032367_0004_0FF1FA0E99E97028"/>
country, in the bloody contest for Freedom and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</p>
            <p>To trace each interesting occurrence in the various vicissitudes of the war, would as far exceed the limits of my ability, as of my time; and, indeed, would be as unnecessary as it is impracticable. So far, however, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is necessary to appreciate the present happiness of our Country, and inspire us with a becoming sense of gratitude to Heaven, we may, we ought to proceed. It is a task, on this occasion, as indispensable as it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: It is a debt we owe to the honor of our Country, and the smallest tribute of praise we can render to the goodness and mercy of our God.</p>
            <p>With the grand outlines of the animating scene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in retrospective view, let us look back to the commencement of the controversy, and glance at a few of the most engaging circumstances, in that series of astonishing events, connected with the final tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Patriotism, that foundation and top-stone in the Temple of Liberty, the INDEPENDENCE of AMERICA.</p>
            <p>From all which, in application to ourselves and our Country, we must readily adopt the devout language of the sweet Singer of Israel, and thankfully acknowledge,
<q>If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may <hi>America</hi> say; if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us. Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth: But we are escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth.</q>

Who but the God of armies, inspired that spirit of military enthusiasm, which at the first effusion of American blood, like an electric shock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pervaded the extensive continent, and fired every breast, from tottering <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,</hi> to beardless <hi>sixteen?</hi>—The Lord God of hosts blew the trumpet, and sounded the alarm of war. The signal was not given in vain—the alarm was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly received. All, of every age and sex, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roused. The whole country was in motion, as if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by one soul.—Innumerable as the leaves of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, the indignant sons of America poured forth in arms to repel the invasions of the enemy, and avenge the blood of their slaughtered brethren. All was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion. All was enterprize. All was courage, while our dearest rights were at stake; and no alternative pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sented us but freedom or chains.—See the hobbling cripple, shouldering his crutch, in defiance of British thunder!—See the tender mother, animating her young sons to battle, with the heroic resolution, to conquer or to die!—See the thickening brigades of school-boys, in the manual exercise of arms by moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in all the military parade of hostile banners, wooden muskets, and the martial music of fife and drum!—See, with transport see, that illustrious character, raised up by Heaven to be the Defender, the Saviour, and the Father of his Country, the great, the immortal Washington,
"whose head is a Senate,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032367_0005_0FF1FA1234E221B8"/>
and whose arm is a Host,"
in obedience to the call of his country, unsheathe his sword in the cause of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and lead forth our undisciplined troops to the field! —See the armies of our haughty enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, plundering and burning many defenceless parts of our country, at length compelled to pile their arms to American bravery, and surrender themselves priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to those whom so lately they affected to despise as cowards and paltroons!</p>
            <p>But I lose myself, and forget my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> while indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleasing review. Sufficient is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to add, that the sacred pledge of perseverance, consecrated by our fathers in Congress, was not forfeited, nor the precious blood and treasure of our country expenced in vain. Protecting Heaven accepted our solemn appeal—the glorious prize for which we contended was won, and the triumph of Liberty rendered complete, by the final restoration and establishment of Peace, upon the broad basis of Independence.</p>
            <p>But, while celebrating the warlike atchievments of our country, and the glorious success of our arms, let us once more look back to the desolating scene of war, and forget not a duty we owe to the memory of the dead. Let us drop the tear of affection and gratitude over the urn of those brave defenders of our rights, MONTGOMERY, MERCER, WARREN, WOOSTER, and the long list of their compatriots, who nobly fell in the field of battle, and sealed our Independence with their blood. Hail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> illustrious shades! Your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's pride and boast! Victims to the rage of tyranny, martyrs in the cause of Liberty, you fell; but how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how enviable your exit! Yours is the bed of glory, tho' sleeping in the dust! Yours the reward of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032367_0006_0FF1FA15E6DF5AE0"/>
renown! Your names shall never die. Your memory, embalmed in the heart of your grateful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, shall be transmitted down, with love and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the latest posterity!</p>
            <p>We now turn from the calamities of war, to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of Peace, and behold our country no longer a field of blood, but a land of peace; the field of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and commerce—a nursery of the arts and scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, an asylum for the oppressed, and at once the envy and admiration of the world.</p>
            <p>Peace, however, brought its dangers, as well as war. Victorious over our enemies in the field, while the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of common danger firmly united our interests and our exertions, our danger next arose from ourselves. That government, which during the war was duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected and implicitly obeyed, by change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances at the return of Peace, became weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficient; and the separate sovereignties of the States were found incompatible with the harmony of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the political happiness of the whole. But, to the disappointment of our enemies, we were preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the threatening danger of Anarchy.</p>
            <p>This important crisis served, in the issue, to prove that America was as capable of enjoying, as of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her rights. By an event unknown in any former age of the world, this memorable aera is distinguished. A revolution of national government, effected in time of peace, by candid consultation, mutual concessions, and voluntary adoption; with the calmness and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of reason and philosophy.—By a convention of our wisest and most enlightened Citizens, delegated from each of the States, a new constitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was formed, proposed to the States, and by them
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032367_0006_0FF1FA15E6DF5AE0"/>
severally examined and adopted. The new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was organized; and, during eight years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of its administration, the unrivalled prosperity of our Country, affords the highest eulogium upon our Federal Constitution.</p>
            <p>The beloved WASHINGTON, by the unanimous voice of the millions of America, is again called from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite retirement, and appears at the head of adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, like the Sun in the midst of the system, the common centre of union and attraction—the common source of light and happiness. In this relation we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recognize this wonderful man as the Saviour of his Country, and behold him as great in the Cabinet, as he was glorious in the Field. The blessing of Peace, procured by his valor and fortitude in the one, has been no less preserved and continued to us, by his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and firmness in the other. No man ever deserved so much of his country. No other man ever displayed such greatness and magnanimity of character, in divesting himself of power; in relinquishing the highest object of ambition and retiring from the chief magistracy of a free people, to the state of a private Citizen.—O Washington! the brightness of thine example, and the superior lustre and dignity of thy character, are too far beyond the reach of imitation, to be ever the objects of envy. Laden with the good wishes, the blessings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the prayers of thy grateful country; thro' the calm evening of thy retirement, mayst thou long enjoy that sublime satisfaction, peculiarly thine own, of seeing the happiness of millions, as the issue of all thy labors, cares and dangers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thro' a life most eminently devoted to the service of thy country.</p>

               </gap>, with that of the European nations, can we my fellow citizens, help realizing the exellency of our free government, and especially the rich and important blessings of Peace? There, for years past, we have beheld the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angel of war raging with the utmost violence, and spreading desolation, rapine and murder; while unnumbered thousands and millions of our fellow-men, in those nations which have been for ages immured in the Bastile of Slavery, are still involved in the shades of ignorance, and groaning under the iron hand of despotism.—But what a happy reverse do we enjoy! And, while hoping in GOD for the continuance of our national peace, what obligations of gratitude to Heaven are we under! what cause of rejoicing is this day presented us! what grounds of daily and constant felicitation does every prospect afford! We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
"eat our bread with cheerfulness, and drink our wine with a merry heart."</p>
            <p>But, my friends, while contemplating the respecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and flourishing state of our nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of our Government, and the excellence of our Constitution, against which, like an immovable rock of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, the intrigues of foreign influence, with the vile plots of internal faction, have dashed their furious waves in vain; and while we duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the merits of those living and departed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, as instruments of our political happiness, who, thro' storms and tempests, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and faction, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us to Independence, Glory and Empire:— amidst such a cluster of dazzling objects, all tending to awaken emotions of national pride: let us carefully guard against the arrogance of prosperity—realize our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032367_0007_0FF1FA1805FDD810"/>

               </gap> every sensation of pleasure by adding gratitude to joy, and dignify the warm sensibility of the Patriot with the exalted virtues of the Christian.</p>
            <p>With this sublime sentiment in our hearts, let us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the mental view towards the extensive landscape of our political happiness, and cast a glance (for a glance is all we can now indulge) upon the present and future prosperity of America, together with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable influence upon the general happiness of mankind.</p>
            <p>This continent which we inhabit, in many striking respects, appears distinguished from every other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world. Here the productions of the earth, and the innate advantages of territorial situation, for agriculture, commerce, and all the arts of peace, are bestowed with a more munificent hand, and lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for superior advances, in every improvement calculated to promote the happiness of man. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the natural world, the animals, trees, rivers, lakes and mountains, we see formed upon a more large and liberal scale. Its habitable territory spreads out to an almost immeasurable extent; while the whole assemblage presents to the contemplation of the astonished behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a theatre for the noblest scenes of Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on which the last and finishing Act of the World's grand drama will be displayed.</p>
            <p>By our civil and religious privileges, we are most happily distinguished from all other nations. The sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our government, by which all our precious rights are guaranteed and secured, is tried and proved. Our present Executive, placed in his important station
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032367_0008_0FF1FA1C816F08F0"/>
by the suffrages of his country, uncombined with the least share of foreign influence in his appointment, is, perhaps, of all men the fittest and best-deserving to succeed a Washington. Of this, his firm and dignified conduct, upon the late trying occasion, gives us the fullest attestation.</p>
            <p>Our public revenue arising from the duties of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post, without recurring to internal direct taxation, is found adequate to the expences of government and the ordinary exigencies of State, together with the payment of our national debt. This, I think, we may with confidence assert, while assured of the fact, that there is now in the federal treasury the sum of 700,000 dollars of unappropriated money, the surplus of every public expenditure.</p>
            <p>The rewards of industry which our country affords, are such as to spread with plenty the tables of the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est class of our citizens.—New and useful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to facilitate the labor of the husbandman and the artist, are continually increasing.—Here genius and literature have ample scope, and the interests of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meet with liberal encouragement.—Here the religion of the Gospel, in its purity, is enjoyed—the rights of conscience duly respected—and <hi>toleration</hi> and <hi>intoleration,</hi> those creatures of a national ecclesiastic establishment, are unknown—are both discarded and despised, as alike absurd, and equally inconsistent with the spirit of a free government.—Here Agriculture and Commerce, the grand pillars of national prosperity, have fixed their favorite seat. The amazing advantages of inland navigation we possess, may soon, by the labor of art, be carried to such a pitch of improvement, as to exceed our present expectations, or conceptions.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032367_0008_0FF1FA1C816F08F0"/>
The benefits resulting will be proportionate. New cities will be seen suddenly starting up in the interior wilds of the country, with the rapidity of this delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful village we inhabit; and these vacant plains, and yonder woody eminence, be all thickly overspread with the elegant mansions of affluence, and stored with the richest treasures of commerce.</p>
            <p>The rapidity of our population stands unexampled in the history of man. Our present ratio of increase is such, and such the extent of our territory yet unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, that, with the continuance of peace, it, perhaps, will be but a moderate calculation, that in <hi>fifty</hi> years hence, the Sun will daily roll over as many United States of America, possessed by as many millions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>And, when we consider the connection of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional prosperity with the general happiness of mankind, already begun, and swiftly progressing towards Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Liberty; how pleasing, how unspeakably ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating is the prospect! Reason, as well as tradition and revelation, leads us to expect a more improved and happy state of human affairs will take place, before the final consummation of all things. The world has been hitherto gradually improving; light and knowledge have been gaining ground; and human life, compared with what it once was, is much the same that a youth approaching to manhood is, compared with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.—The spirit of Commerce is happily calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Author of wisdom, to open an amicable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse between all countries—to soften the horrors of war—to enlarge the field of science and speculation, and induce all men to regard each other as brethren and friends.—In the progress of light and knowledge,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032367_0009_0FF1FA22ABAD0F90"/>
now beaming forth from America, we may contemplate, in a kind of prophetic view, the arrival of that happy period, when peace, and friendship, and brotherly-love, shall pervade the great Family of Man. Our children may see the day, when national differences will forever cease to be decided by the sword—when all the nations of the earth, seeing their rights and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests to be the same, will voluntarily combine to form one GRAND, UNIVERSAL, FEDERAL REPUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIC, founded upon a Constitution copied from that of the United States of America. Happy! thrice happy for the world, in that day, should a WASHINGTON be found to preside!</p>
            <p>How transporting to the heart of every true Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, must be the prospect of so happy a period, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when viewed as ultimately originating in the INDEPENDENCE of <hi>his</hi> Country!—What dignity does it attach to the present Anniversary! What exalted motives of rejoicing in the present happiness, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory of America!</p>
