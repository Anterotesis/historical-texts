            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN an eſſay upon the effects of public puniſhments upon criminals and upon ſociety, publiſhed in the ſecond vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the American Muſeum, I hinted, in a ſhort para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, at the injuſtice of puniſhing murder by death. I ſhall attempt in the following eſſay, to ſupport that opinion, and to anſwer all the objections that have been urged againſt it.</p>
            <p>I. Every man poſſeſſes an abſolute power over his own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and property, but not over his own life. When he becomes a member of political ſociety, he commits the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of his liberty and property to his fellow citizens; but as he has no right to diſpoſe of his life, he cannot commit the power over it to any body of men. To take away life, therefore, for any crime, is a violation of the firſt political compact.</p>
            <p>II. The puniſhment of murder by death, is contrary to reaſon, and to the order and happineſs of ſociety.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It leſſens the horror of taking away human life, and thereby tends to multiply murders.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It produces murder, by its influence upon people who are tired of life, and who, from a ſuppoſition, that murder is a leſs crime than ſuicide, deſtroy a life (and often that of a near connexion) and afterwards deliver themſelves up to juſtice, that they may eſcape from their miſery by means of a halter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The puniſhment of murder by death, multiplies mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, from the difficulty it creates of convicting perſons who are guilty of it. Humanity, revolting at the idea of the ſeverity and certainty of a capital puniſhment, often
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024762_0003_0FCD623C8DF35D88"/>
ſteps in, and collects ſuch evidence in favour of a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as ſcreens him from juſtice altogether, or palliates his crime into manſlaughter. If the puniſhment of murder conſiſted in long confinement, and hard labour, it would be proportioned to the meaſure of our feelings of juſtice, and every member of ſociety would be a watchman or a magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, to apprehend a deſtroyer of human life, and to bring him to puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The puniſhment of murder by death, cheeks the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of univerſal juſtice, by preventing the puniſhment of every ſpecies of murder. Quack doctors—frauds of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds—and a licentious preſs, often deſtroy life, and ſometimes with malice of the moſt propenſe nature. If murder were puniſhed by confinement and hard labour, the authors of the numerous murders that have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would be dragged forth, and puniſhed according to their deſerts. How much order and happineſs would ariſe to ſociety from ſuch a change in human affairs! But who will attempt to define theſe ſpecies of murder, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute offenders of this ſtamp, if death is to be the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the crime after it is admitted, and proved to be wilful murder?—only alter the puniſhment of murder, and theſe crimes will ſoon aſſume their proper names, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſoon become as rare as murder from common acts of violence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The puniſhment of murder by death, has been proved to be contrary to the order and happineſs of ſociety by the experiments of ſome of the wiſeſt legiſlators in Europe. The empreſs of Ruſſia, the king of Sweden, and the duke of Tuſcany, have nearly extirpated murder from their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, by converting its puniſhment into the means of benefiting ſociety, and reforming the criminals who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate it.</p>
            <p>III. The puniſhment of murder by death, is contrary to divine revelation. A religion which commands us to forgive and even to do good to our enemies, can never authoriſe the puniſhment of murder by death. "Vengeance is mine," ſaid the Lord; "I will repay." It is to no purpoſe to ſay here, that this vengeance is taken out of the hands of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, and directed againſt the criminal by the hand of government. It is equally an uſurpation of the prerogative of heaven, whether it be inflicted by a ſingle perſon, or by a whole community.</p>
            <p>Here I expect to meet with an appeal from the letter and ſpirit of the goſpel, to the law of Moſes, which declares, that "he that killeth a man ſhall ſurely be put to death."
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024762_0004_0FCD62404EEECCB8"/>
Forgive, indulgent heaven! the ignorance and cruelty of man, which by the miſapplication of this text of ſcripture, has ſo long and ſo often ſtained the religion of Jeſus Chriſt with folly and revenge.</p>
            <p>The following conſiderations, I hope, will prove that no argument can be deduced from this law, to juſtify the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of murder by death. On the contrary, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arguments againſt it, may be derived from a juſt and rational explanation of that part of the levitical inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are many things in ſcripture <hi>above,</hi> but nothing <hi>contrary</hi> to reaſon. Now, the puniſhment of murder by death, is <hi>contrary</hi> to reaſon. It cannot, therefore, be agreeable to the will of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The order and happineſs of ſociety cannot fail of being agreeable to the will of God. But the puniſhment of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by death, deſtroys the order and happineſs of ſociety. It muſt therefore be contrary to the will of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Many of the laws given by Moſes, were accommodated to the ignorance, wickedneſs, and "hardneſs of heart" of the Jews. Hence their divine legiſlator expreſsly ſays, "I gave them ſtatutes that were <hi>not good,</hi> and judgments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>they ſhould not live.</hi>" Of this, the law which reſpects di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces, and the law of retaliation, which required "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," are remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>But we are told, that the puniſhment of murder by death, is founded not only on the law of Moſes, but upon a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precept given to Noah and his poſterity, that "whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed." In order to ſhow that this text does not militate againſt my propoſition, I ſhall beg leave to tranſcribe a paſſage from an eſſay on crimes and puniſhments, publiſhed by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend mr. Turner, in the ſecond volume of the Mancheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter memoirs. "I hope," ſays this ingenious author, "that I ſhall not offend any one, by taking the liberty to put my own ſenſe upon this celebrated paſſage, and to enquire, why it ſhould be deemed a precept at all. To me, I confeſs, it appears to contain nothing more than a declaration of what will generally happen; and in this view, to ſtand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly upon the ſame ground with ſuch paſſages as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: "He that leadeth into captivity ſhall go into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity." "He that taketh up the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xv, 10.</note>."—The form of expreſſion is exactly the ſame in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024762_0005_0FCD6243C166FE58"/>
each of the texts; why, then, may they not all be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in the ſame manner, and conſidered, not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but as denunciations? and if ſo, the magiſtrate will be no more bound by the text in Geneſis, to puniſh murder with death, than he will by the text in the Revelations, to ſell every Guinea captain to our Weſt India planters; and yet, however juſt and proper ſuch a proceeding might be, I ſuppoſe no one will aſſert that the magiſtrate is bound to it by that, or any other text in the ſcriptures, or that that alone would be admitted as a ſufficient reaſon for ſo extraordinary a meaſure."</p>
            <p>If this explanation of the precept given to Noah, be not ſatisfactory, I ſhall mention another. Soon after the flood, the infancy and weakneſs of ſociety rendered it impoſſible to puniſh murder by <hi>confinement.</hi> There was therefore no medium between inflicting death upon a murderer, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to eſcape with impunity, and thereby to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate more acts of violence againſt his fellow creatures. It pleaſed God in this condition of the world to permit a <hi>leſs</hi> in order to prevent a <hi>greater</hi> evil. He therefore commits <hi>for a while</hi> his excluſive power over human life, to his creatures for the ſafety and preſervation of an infant ſociety, which might otherwiſe have periſhed, and with it, the only ſtock of the human race. The command indirectly implies that the crime of murder was not puniſhed by death in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of ſociety which exiſted before the flood. Nor is this the only inſtance upon record in the ſcriptures in which God has delegated his power over human life to his creatures. Abraham expreſſes no ſurpriſe at the command which God gave him to ſacrifice his ſon. He ſubmits to it as a precept founded in reaſon and natural juſtice, for nothing could be more obvious than that the giver of life had a right to claim it <hi>when</hi> and in <hi>ſuch manner</hi> as he pleaſed. 'Till men are able to give life, it becomes them to tremble at the thought of <hi>taking it</hi> away. Will a man rob God?—Yes—he robs him of what is infinitely dear to him—of his darling attribute of <hi>mercy,</hi> every time he deprives a fellow creature of life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Moſaic law with reſpect to murder, be obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon chriſtians, it follows that it is equally obligatory upon them to puniſh adultery, blaſphemy, and other capital crimes that are mentioned in the levitical law, by death. Nor is this all: it juſtifies the extirpation of the Indians, and the enſlaving of the Africans; for the command to the Jews to deſtroy the Canaanites, and to make ſlaves of their heathen neighbours, is as poſitive as the command which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024762_0006_0FCD62455E8CB1A8"/>
declares, "that he that killeth a man, ſhall ſurely be put to death."</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every part of the levitical law, is full of types of the Meſſiah. May not the puniſhment of death, inflicted by it, be intended to repreſent the demerit and conſequences of ſin, as the cities of refuge were the offices of the Meſſiah?</p>
            <p n="6">6. The imperfection and ſeverity of theſe laws were Probably intended farther—to illuſtrate the perfection and mildneſs of the goſpel diſpenſation. It is in this manner that God has manifeſted himſelf in many of his acts. He created darkneſs firſt, to illuſtrate by compariſon the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of light; and he permits ſin, miſery, and death in the moral world, that he may hereafter diſplay more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the tranſcendent glories of righteouſneſs, happineſs, and immortal life. This opinion is favoured by St. Paul, who ſays, "the law made nothing perfect," and that "it was a ſhadow of good things to come."</p>
            <p>How delightful to diſcover ſuch an exact harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the dictates of reaſon, the order and happineſs of ſociety, and the precepts of the goſpel! There is a perfect unity in truth. Upon all ſubjects—in all ages—and in all countries—truths of every kind agree with each other.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that the common ſenſe of all nations, and particularly of ſavages, is in favour of puniſhing mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by death.</p>
            <p>The common ſenſe of all nations is in favour of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and ſlavery of their fellow creatures. But this does not take away from their immorality. Could it be proved that the Indians puniſh murder by death, it would not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh the right of man over the life of a fellow creature, for revenge we know in its utmoſt extent is the univerſal and darling paſſion of all ſavage nations. The practice moreover, (if it exiſt) muſt have originated in <hi>neceſſity;</hi> for a people who have no ſettled place of reſidence, and who are averſe from all labour, could reſtrain murder in no other way. But I am diſpoſed to doubt whether the Indians puniſh murder by death among their own tribes. In all thoſe caſes where a life is taken away by an Indian of a <hi>foreign</hi> tribe, they always demand the ſatisfaction of <hi>life</hi> for <hi>life.</hi> But this practice is founded on a deſire of preſerving a balance in their numbers and power; for among nations which conſiſt of only a few warriors, the loſs of an individual often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys this balance, and thereby expoſes them to war or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. It is for the ſame purpoſe of keeping up an equality in numbers and power, that they often adopt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive children into their nations and families. What makes
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024762_0007_0FCD62466CC1DAF0"/>
this explanation of the practice of puniſhing murder by death among the Indians more probable, is, that we find the ſame bloody and vindictive ſatisfaction is required of a foreign nation, whether the perſon loſt, be killed by an accident, or by premeditated violence. Many facts might be mentioned from travellers to prove that the Indians do not puniſh murder by death within the juriſdiction of their own tribes. I ſhall mention only one which is taken from the rev. mr. John Megapolenſis's account of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk Indians, lately publiſhed in mr. Hazard's hiſtorical collection of ſtate papers.—"There is no puniſhment, (ſays our author) here for murder, but every one is his own avenger. The friends of the deceaſed revenge themſelves upon the murderer until peace is made with the next akin. But although they are ſo cruel, yet there are not half ſo many murders committed among them as among chriſtians, notwithſtanding their ſevere laws, and heavy penalties."</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that the horrors of a guilty conſcience proclaim the juſtice and neceſſity of death, as a puniſhment for murder. I draw an argument of another nature from this fact. Are the horrors of conſcience the puniſhment that God inflicts upon murder? why, then, ſhould we ſhorten or deſtroy them by death, eſpecially as we are taught to direct the moſt atrocious murderers to expect par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the future world? no, let us not counteract the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God in the human breaſt: let the murderer live—but let it be to ſuffer the reproaches of a guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: let him live, to make compenſation to ſociety for the injury he has done it, by robbing it of a citizen: let him live to maintain the family of the man whom he has mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: let him live, that the puniſhment of his crime may become univerſal: and laſtly let him live—that murder may be extirpated from the liſt of human crimes!</p>
            <p>Let us examine the conduct of the moral Ruler of the world towards the firſt murderer: ſee Cain return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his field, with his hands reeking with the blood of his brother! Do the heavens gather blackneſs, and does a flaſh of lightning blaſt him to the earth? no. Does his father Adam, the natural legiſlator and judge of the world, inflict upon him the puniſhment of death?—No; the infinitely wiſe God becomes his judge and executioner. He expels him from the ſociety of which he was a member. He fixes in his conſcience a never-dying worm. He ſubjects him to the neceſſity of labour; and to ſecure a duration of his puniſhment, proportioned to his crime, he puts a mark or prohibition upon him, to prevent his being put to death,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024762_0008_0FCD6247E4940B50"/>
by weak and angry men; declaring, at the ſame time, that "whoſoever ſlayeth Cain, vengeance ſhall be taken on him ſeven-fold."</p>
            <p>Judges, attornies, witneſſes, juries and ſheriffs, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to puniſh murder by death, I beſeech you to pauſe, and liſten to the voice of reaſon and religion, before you convict or execute another fellow-creature for murder!</p>
            <p>But I deſpair of making ſuch an impreſſion upon the preſent citizens of the united ſtates, as ſhall aboliſh the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and unchriſtian practice. From the connexion of this eſſay with the valuable documents of the late revolution contained in the American Muſeum, it will probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to poſterity. To you, therefore, the unborn genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the next century, I conſecrate this humble tribute to juſtice. You will enjoy in point of knowledge, the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of a day, of which we only perceive the twilight. You will often review with equal contempt and horror, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, ignorance and cruelty of your anceſtors. The groſſeſt crimes ſhall not exclude the perpetrators of them from your pity. You will <hi>fully</hi> comprehend the extent of the diſcoveries and precepts of the goſpel, and you will be acquired, I hope, by its gentle and forgiving ſpirit. You will ſee many modern opinions in religion and government turned upſide downwards, and many new connexions eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed between cauſe and effect. From the importance and deſtiny of every human ſoul, you will acquire new ideas of the dignity of human nature, and of the infinite value of every act of benevolence that has for its object, the bodies, the ſouls, and the lives of your fellow-creatures. You will love the whole human race, for you will perceive that you have a common Father, and you will learn to imitate how by converting thoſe puniſhments to which their folly or wickedneſs have expoſed them, into the means of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and happineſs.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE read a reply ſubſcribed Philochoras, to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the juſtice and policy of puniſhing murder by death, publiſhed ſome time ago in the Muſeum. The author of it has attempted to juſtify public and capital puniſhments, as well as war, by the precepts of the goſpel.—Let not my readers ſuppoſe that this author is a ſceptic—or a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then—or that he is in any degree unfriendly to chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Far from it—he is a miniſter of the goſpel—and a man of a worthy private as well as public character.</p>
               <p>Our author begins his reply by aſſerting, that the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the puniſhment of death for murder, proceeded ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from the ſocinian objection to the great doctrine of the atonement. Here I muſt acknowledge my obligations to our author for having furniſhed me with a new argument in favour of my principles. I believe in the doctrine of the atonement, not only becauſe it is clearly revealed in the old and new teſtaments, but becauſe it is agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reaſon. Life is the product of death, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out every part of the animal creation. Reaſon likewiſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhes the neceſſity of the atonement, for it has lately taught us in the writings of the marquis of Beccaria, that in a perfect human government there ſhould be <hi>no pardoning power:</hi> and experience has taught us that where <hi>certainly</hi> has taken the place of <hi>ſeverity</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, crimes have evidently and rapidly diminiſhed in every country. The demands of the divine law which made the ſhedding of blood neceſſary to the remiſſion of ſin, is a ſublime illuſtration of the perfection of the divine government, and of the love of the Supreme Being to his intelligent creatures. But in the demand <hi>of life</hi> for diſobedience, let the divine law ſtand alone. Men ſtand in a very different relation to each other, from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024762_0010_0FCD624C8A45F970"/>
that which God ſuſtains to men. They are all falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and deficient in a thouſand duties which they owe to each other. They are bound, therefore, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of doing to others, as they would have them do them, to <hi>forgive,</hi> without a ſatisfaction, inaſmuch as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly require the ſame <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> to be exerciſed towards themſelves. To puniſh murder, therefore, or any other crime, by death, under the goſpel diſpenſation, is to exalt the angry and vindictive paſſions of men to an equality with the perfect law of God. It is to place imperfect indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals and corrupted human governments, upon the throne of the righteous judge of the univerſe: nay, more—it is to make the death of Chriſt of no effect; for every time we puniſh murder by death, we practically deny that it was a full expiation for every ſin, and thereby exclude ourſelves from deriving any benefit from it, for he has made the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of injuries, without any exceptions, whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt us in our private capacities, or as members of a community, the <hi>expreſs condition</hi> of our title to the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he has purchaſed for us by his death.</p>
               <p>The arguments againſt the puniſhment of murder by death, from <hi>reaſon,</hi> remain on an immoveable foundation. Our author has <hi>contradicted</hi>—but has not <hi>refuted</hi> one of them. I affirmed in my former eſſay, that the puniſhment of murder by death had been aboliſhed in ſeveral of the European nations. I wiſh for the honour of our author's profeſſion, he had doubted of this aſſertion with more of the meek and gentle ſpirit of a chriſtian. To ſatisfy him upon this ſubject, I ſhall ſubjoin the following extracts from authorities which are now before me.—In the inſtructions to the commiſſioners appointed to frame a new code of laws for the Ruſſian empire, by Catharine II. the preſent empreſs of Ruſſia, I find the following paſſage. I take great pleaſure in tranſcribing it, as the ſentiments it contains do ſo much honour not only to the female underſtanding, but to the human mind.</p>
               <p>"Proofs from facts demonſtrate to us, that the frequent uſe of capital puniſhments, never mended the morals of a people. Therefore, if I prove the death of a citizen to be neither <hi>uſeful</hi> nor <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſociety in general, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute thoſe who riſe up againſt humanity. In a reign of peace and tranquillity, under a government eſtabliſhed with the united wiſhes of a whole people, in a ſtate well fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt external enemies, and protected within by ſtrong ſupports; that is, by its own internal ſtrength, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentiments, rooted in the minds of the citizens, there
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024762_0011_0FCD624DD3904918"/>
can be <hi>no neceſſity</hi> for <hi>taking away the life</hi> of a citizen. It is not the <hi>exceſs</hi> of ſeverity, nor the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the human ſpecies, that produces a powerful effect upon the hearts of the citizens, but the <hi>continued duration</hi> of the puniſhment. The death of a malefactor is not ſo efficacious a method of deferring from wickedneſs, as the example continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, of a man who is deprived of his liberty, that he might repair, during a life of labour, the injury he has done to the community. The terror of death excited by the imagination may be more <hi>ſtrong,</hi> but has not force enough to reſiſt that <hi>oblivion</hi> which is ſo natural to mankind. It is a general rule, that rapid and violent impreſſions upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, diſturb and <hi>give pain,</hi> but do not operate long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>memory.</hi> That a puniſhment, therefore, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable with juſtice, it ought to have ſuch a degree of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity as might be ſufficient to deter people from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the crime. Hence I preſume to affirm, that there is no man who, upon the leaſt degree of reflexion, would put the <hi>greateſt poſſible</hi> advantages, he might flatter himſelf from a crime, on the <hi>one ſide,</hi> into the balance againſt a life <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted</hi> under a <hi>total</hi> privation of liberty, <hi>on the other.</hi>"</p>
               <p>In a Britiſh review for the preſent year, I find a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the code of penal laws lately enacted by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Germany. This enlightened monarch has divided impriſonment into <hi>mild</hi>—<hi>ſevere</hi>—and <hi>rigorous.</hi> For the crime of murder, he inflicts the puniſhment of rigorous impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment—which from its duration, and other terrifying circumſtances that attend it, is calculated to produce more beneficial effects in preventing murders, than all the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have ever taken place in any age or country.</p>
               <p>I derived my information of the abolition of capital pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in Sweden and Tuſcany, from two foreigners of diſtinction, who lately viſited the united ſtates. The one was an Italian nobleman, the other was a captain in the Swediſh navy—both of whom commanded every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and attachment for their abilities and virtues.</p>
               <p>It is true, this happy revolution in favour of juſtice and humanity, in the inſtances that have been mentioned, did not originate in a convocation or a ſynod. It may either be aſcribed to the light of the goſpel ſhining in "darkneſs, which comprehended it not"—or to the influence of ſound and cultivated reaſon—for reaſon and religion have the ſame objects. They are in no one inſtance oppoſed to each other. On the contrary, reaſon is nothing but imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and religion is nothing but perfect reaſon.</p>
               <p>It becomes chriſtians to beware how far they condemn
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024762_0012_0FCD57F001772710"/>
the popular virtue of humanity, becauſe it is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by deiſts, or by perſons who do not profeſs to be bound by the ſtrict obligations of chriſtianity.—Voltaire firſt taught the princes of Europe the duty of religious tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The duke of Sully has demonſtrated the extreme fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of war, and has proved that when it has been conducted with the moſt glory, it never added an atom to national happineſs. The marquis of Beccaria has eſtabliſhed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the abolition of capital puniſhments, and the order and happineſs of ſociety. Should any thing be found in the ſcriptures, <hi>contrary</hi> to theſe diſcoveries, it is eaſy to foreſee that the principles of the deiſts and the laws of modern legiſlators will ſoon have a <hi>juſt</hi> preference to the principles and precepts of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>Our author attempts to ſupport his ſanguinary tenets by an appeal to revelation. And here I ſhall make two preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary remarks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no opinion ſo abſurd or impious, that may not be ſupported by <hi>ſolitary</hi> texts of ſcripture. To collect the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the bible upon any ſubject, we muſt be governed by its <hi>whole</hi> ſpirit and tenor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The deſign of chriſtianity at its firſt promulgation was to reform the world by its <hi>ſpirit</hi> rather than by its poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precepts.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour does not forbid ſlavery in direct terms—but he indirectly bears a teſtimony againſt it, by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to do to others what we would have them in like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to do to us. He did not aim to produce a ſudden revolution in the affairs of men. He knew too well the Power and efficacy of his religion for that purpoſe. It was unneceſſary, therefore, to ſubject it to additional oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a direct attack upon the prejudices and intereſts of mankind, both of which were cloſely interwoven with the texture of their civil governments.</p>
               <p>After theſe remarks, I ſhall only add, that the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. Paul before Feſtus, reſpecting the puniſhment of death<note n="*" place="bottom">"For if I be an offender, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuſe not to die." Acts 25 and 11.</note> and the ſpeech of the dying thief on the croſs<note n="†" place="bottom">"We indeed" ſuffer <hi>"juſtly,</hi> for we receive the due reward of our deeds." Luke 23 and 41.</note>, only prove that the puniſhment of death was agreeable to the Roman law, but they by no means prove that they were ſanctioned by the goſpel.—Human life was extremely
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024762_0013_0FCD62510410B5E0"/>
cheap under the Roman government. Of this we need no further proof than the head of John the baptiſt forming a part of a royal entertainment. From the frequency of Public executions, among thoſe people, the <hi>ſword</hi> was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an emblem of public juſtice—but to ſuppoſe from this appeal to a ſign of juſtice, or from our Saviour's para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the deſtruction of the huſbandmen, that capital pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are approved of in the new teſtament, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as it would be to ſuppoſe that horſeracing was a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian exerciſe, from St. Paul's frequent alluſions to the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic games.</p>
               <p>The declaration of the barbarians upon ſeeing the ſnake faſten upon St. Paul's hand proves nothing but the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe uncivilized people. I deny the conſent of all nations to the puniſhment of death for murder—but if it were true—it only proves the univerſality of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and depravity of man. Revenge, diſſimulation, and even theft, prevail among all the nations in the world,—and yet who will dare to aſſert, that theſe vices are juſt, or neceſſary to the order or happineſs of ſociety.</p>
               <p>Our author does not diſtinguiſh between the ſenſe of juſtice ſo univerſal among all nations, and an approbation of death as a puniſhment for murder. The former is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the finger of God upon every human heart, but like his own attribute of juſtice, it has the happineſs of individuals and of ſociety for its objects. It is always miſled, when it ſeeks for ſatisfaction in puniſhments that are injurious to ſociety, or that are diſproportioned to crimes. The ſatisfaction of this univerſal ſenſe of juſtice by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of impriſonment and labour, would far exceed that which is derived from the puniſhment of death; for it would be of longer duration, and it would more frequently occur, for, upon a principle laid down in the firſt eſſay upon this ſubject, ſcarcely any ſpecies of murder would eſcape with impunity.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſcale of puniſhments by means of impriſonment and labour might eaſily be contrived, ſo as to be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the different degrees of atrocity in murder. For example—for the firſt or higheſt degree of guilt, let the puniſhment be ſolitude and darkneſs, and a total <hi>want</hi> of employment. For the ſecond, ſolitude and labour, with the benefit of light. For the third, confinement and labour. The <hi>duration</hi> of theſe puniſhments ſhould likewiſe be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the atrocity of the murder, and by the ſigns of contrition and amendment in the criminal.</note>

                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:024762_0014_0FCD6252B1349A78"/>
The conduct and diſcourſes of our Saviour ſhould out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh every argument that has been or can be offered in favour of capital puniſhment for any crime. When the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man caught in adultery was brought to him, he evaded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the bloody ſentence of the Jewiſh law upon her. Even the <hi>maiming</hi> of the body appears to be offenſive in his ſight, for when Peter drew his ſword and ſmote off the ear of the ſervant of the high prieſt, he replaced it by miracle, and at the ſame time declared, that "all they who take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword." He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave the crime of murder, on his croſs; and after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, he commanded his diſciples to preach the goſpel of forgiveneſs <hi>firſt</hi> at Jeruſalem, where he well knew his murderers ſtill reſided. Theſe ſtriking facts are recorded for our imitation, and ſeem intended to ſhow that the Son of God died, not only to reconcile God to man, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile men to each other. There is one paſſage more, in the hiſtory of our Saviour's life, which would of itſelf overſet the juſtice of the puniſhment of death for murder, if every other part of the bible had been ſilent upon the ſubject. When two of his diſciples, actuated by the ſpirit of vindictive legiſlators, requeſted permiſſion of him to call down fire from heaven to conſume the inhoſpitable Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, he anſwered them "the Son of man is not come to <hi>deſtroy</hi> men's <hi>lives,</hi> but to <hi>ſave</hi> them." I wiſh theſe words compoſed the motto of the arms of every nation upon the face of the earth. They inculcate every duty that is calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſerve—reſtore—or prolong human life. They mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate alike againſt war—and capital puniſhments—the objects of which are the unprofitable deſtruction of the lives of men. How precious does a human life appear from theſe words, in the ſight of heaven! Pauſe, legiſlators, when you give your votes for inflicting the puniſhment of death for any crime You fruſtrate, in one inſtance, the deſign of the miſſion of the Son of God into the world, and thereby either deny his appearance in the fleſh, or reject the truth of his goſpel. You moreover ſtrengthen by your conduct the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the deiſts and ſocinians againſt the particular doctrines of the chriſtian revelation. You do more—you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a bloody fragment of the Jewiſh inſtitution. "The Son of man came not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> men's lives, but to <hi>ſave</hi> them." Excellent words! I require no others to ſatisfy me of the truth and divine original of the chriſtian religion, and while I am able to place a finger upon this text of ſcripture, I will not believe an angel from heaven, ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024762_0015_0FCD62568159A848"/>
he declare that the puniſhment of death for <hi>any</hi> crime was inculcated, or permitted by the ſpirit of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that a man who has committed a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, has diſcovered a malignity of heart, that renders him ever afterwards unfit to live in human ſociety. This is by no means true in many, and perhaps in moſt of the caſes of murder. It is moſt frequently the effect of a ſudden guſt of paſſion, and has ſometimes been the only ſtain of a well ſpent or inoffenſive life. There are many crimes which unfit a man much more for human ſociety, than a ſingle murder, and there have been inſtances of murderers who have eſcaped or bribed the laws of their country, who have afterwards become peaceable, and uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety. Let it not be ſuppoſed that I wiſh to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate by this remark, the enormity of murder. Far from it. It is only becauſe I view murder with ſuch ſuperlative horror, that I wiſh to deprive our laws of the power of perpetrating and encouraging it.</p>
               <p>Our author has furniſhed us with a number of tales to ſhow that the providence of God is concerned in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner in detecting murder, and that the confeſſions of murderers have in many inſtances ſanctified the juſtice of their puniſhment. I do not wiſh to leſſen the influence of ſuch vulgar errors as tend to prevent crimes, but I will venture to declare, that many more murderers eſcape diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, than are detected, or puniſhed. Were I not afraid of treſpaſſing upon the patience of my readers, I might mention a number of facts, in which circumſtances of the moſt trifling nature have become the means of detecting theft and forgery, form which I could draw as ſtrong proofs of the watchfulneſs of providence over the property of individuals, and the order of ſociety, as our author has drawn from the detection of murder. I might mention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, likewiſe, of perſons in whom conſcience has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced reſtitution for ſtolen goods, or confeſſion of the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the puniſhment which was inflicted for theft. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and knowledge always keep pace with each other, both with reſpect to divine and human laws. A party of ſoldiers in the duke of Alva's army, murdered a man and his wife with ſix children. They roaſted the youngeſt child, and dined upon it. One of them after dinner clapped his hands together, and with great agitation of mind cried out "good God—what have I done?"—What? ſaid one of his companions—"why" ſaid the other "I have eaten fleſh in lent time." Here conſcience kept pace with his degrees of knowledge. The ſame thing occurs upon different occaſions
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024762_0016_0FCD62579A07F890"/>
every day. The acquieſcence of murderers in the juſtice of their execution, is the effect of prejudice and education. It cannot flow from a conſcience acting in concert with reaſon or religion—for they both ſpeak a very different language.</p>
               <p>The world has certainly undergone a material change for the better within the laſt two hundred years. This change has been produced chiefly, by the ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged influence of chriſtianity upon the hearts of men. It is agreeable to trace the effects of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the extirpation of ſlavery—in the diminution of the number of capital puniſhments, and in the mitigation of the horrors of war. There was a time when maſters poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a power over the lives of their ſlaves. But chriſtianity has depoſed this power, and mankind begin to ſee every where that ſlavery is alike contrary to the intereſts of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and the ſpirit of the goſpel. There was a time when tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was part of the puniſhment of death, and when the number of capital crimes amounted to one hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one. Chriſtianity has aboliſhed the former, and reduced the latter to not more than ſix or ſeven. It has done more. It has confined in ſome inſtances capital puniſhments to the crime of murder only—and in ſome countries it has aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it altogether. The influence of chriſtianity upon the modes of war has been ſtill more remarkable. It is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to trace its progreſs.</p>
               <p>1ſt. In reſcuing women and children from being the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the deſolations of war in common with men.</p>
               <p>2dly. In preventing the deſtruction of captives taken in battle, in cold blood.</p>
               <p>3dly. In protecting the peaceable huſbandman from ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the carnage of war.</p>
               <p>4thly. In producing an exchange of priſoners, inſtead of dooming them to perpetual ſlavery.</p>
               <p>5thly. In avoiding the invaſion or deſtruction, in certain caſes, of private property.</p>
               <p>6thly. In declaring all wars to be unlawful but ſuch as are purely <hi>defenſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the only tenure by which war now holds its place among chriſtians. It requires but little ingenuity to prove that a defenſive war cannot be carried on ſucceſsfully without offenſive operations. If this be true, then this laſt degree of it, upon our author's principles, muſt be contrary to the ſpirit of the goſpel. Already the princes and nations of the world diſcover the ſtruggles of opinion or conſcience in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024762_0017_0FCD6259114A54A0"/>
their preparations for war. Witneſs, the many national diſputes which have been lately terminated in Europe by negociation, or mediation. Witneſs, too, the eſtabliſhment of the conſtitution of the united ſtates without force or bloodſhed. Theſe events indicate an improving ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs. They lead us to look forward with expectation to the time, when the weapons of war ſhall be changed into implements of huſbandry, and when rapine and violence ſhall be no more. Theſe events are the promiſed fruits of the goſpel. If they do not come to paſs, the prophets have deceived us. But if they do—war muſt be as contrary to the ſpirit of the goſpel, as fraud, or murder, or any other of the vices which are reproved or extirpated by it<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſpirit of chriſtianity which our author deſcribey as a vulgar deiſtical ſpecies of humanity, has found its was into ſchools and families, and has aboliſhed, in both, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ignominious puniſhments. In the inſtructions to the maſters and miſtreſſes of the ſundry ſchools, I obſerve with great pleaſure a direction "to uſe corporal punſhments as ſeldom as poſſible."</note>.</p>
               <p>I cannot take leave of this ſubject without remarking that capital puniſhments are the natural offspring of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical governments. Kings believe that they poſſeſs their crowns by a <hi>divine</hi> right: no wonder, therefore, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the divine power of taking away human life. Kings conſider their ſubjects as their property: no wonder, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they ſhed their blood with as little emotion as men ſhed the blood of their ſheep or cattle. But the principles of republican governments ſpeak a very different language. They teach us the abſurdity of the divine origin of kingly power. They approximate the extreme ranks of men to each other. They reſtore man to his God—to ſociety—and to himſelf. They revive and eſtabliſh the relations of fellow-citizen, friend, and brother. They appreciate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, and increaſe public and private obligations to preſerve it. They conſider human ſacrifices as no leſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to the ſovereignty of the people, than they are to the majeſty of heaven. They view the attributes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like the attributes of the deity, as infinitely more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by deſtroying evil by means of <hi>merciful</hi> than by exterminating puniſhments. The united ſtates have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe peaceful and benevolent forms of government. It becomes them therefore to adopt their mild and benevolent

principles. An execution in a republic is like a human ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in religion. It is an offering to monarchy, and to that malignant being, who has been ſtiled a murderer from the beginning, and who delights equally in murder, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be perpetrated by the cold, but vindictive arm of the law, or by the angry hand of private revenge.</p>
