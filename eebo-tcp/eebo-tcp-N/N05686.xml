            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas the beſt, and greateſt Men in the World, from Age to Age, have been bred up in, and come from the School of AFFLICTION,; all his former Pangs, Agonies, and Fears, would be turned into Gratitude, Thankfulneſs, Circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Watchfulneſs, and upon the whole, prove a much wiſer and better Man, and a more uſeful Member in Society; for his Example would be of great Advantage to all around him.</p>
            <p>Now as ſuch good Conſequences would naturally reſult from the above mentioned ſalutary Law, we leave it to the wiſe and thinking Part of Mankind, to ſay, what Sort of Men thoſe are, who directly oppoſe ſuch a <hi>Benevolent Method</hi> of accomodating Difficulties amongſt Mankind, ſo <hi>dependant upon one another in Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Sun is to the Day after a Tempeſt; or Health to the Body after Sickneſs; or what a Bridgroom feels coming out of his Chamber, that, LIBERTY is to a broken Trader.</p>
            <p>But before we conclude this Head, we beg Leave to anſwer a few OBJECTIONS. For ſome Men are ſo ſond of Objections, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007215_0013_102B3E4DDFF8D080"/>they diſlike every Thing but themſelves; who indeed are an <hi>Objection</hi> to all Mercy, Peace, and Benevolence.</p>
            <p>The firſt Objection we ſhall mention is, <q>That no Man ought to agree to any Thing that is not in his Power to perform, and therefore ought to pay according to his Agreement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this Objection, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That in Strictneſs of Speech, this is impoſſible, becauſe no Man has Power over Accidents, Caſualties, and Contingencies, but is liable to them all, and even this Night his Soul may be required of him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever <hi>is future,</hi> he has not abſolute Power over, not even of himſelf, but is a dependent relative Being, <hi>whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, and whoſe Life is a Span;</hi> and therefore all Promiſes and Agreements are in their Nature uncertain, caſual, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; and when the Power of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is wanting, the <hi>Intention</hi> is accepted: So that in ſome ſpecial Caſes, a Man may break his Promiſe and Contract, and yet be an <hi>honeſt Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he that makes a Promiſe with a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> to break it, or with no Reſolution of performing it, cannot be ſo: And he that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007215_0014_102B3E500511DA00"/>makes a Promiſe, and does not poſitively do his Endeavour to the utmoſt of his Power to perform it <hi>(if it is juſt)</hi> cannot be an honeſt Man; for a Promiſe once made, ſuppoſes the <hi>Promiſer</hi> willing to be as good as his Word, and it has a binding <hi>Influence</hi> upon him who made the Promiſe, ſo far as his Power of performing extends; but if it is not in his Power to perform it, as in the Affair of Payment of <hi>Money,</hi> is often the Caſe, the Man cannot be condemned as a diſhoneſt Man: For the Performance of <hi>his</hi> Promiſe might depend on the Promiſes of <hi>Others</hi> to him, on the cuſtomary Run of the Trade and Buſineſs he is engaged in, and on many other contingent Circumſtances, and all might poſſibly fail him, tho' ever ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a Man himſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Objection</hi> therefore, eſpecially with Regard to Traders, is unreaſonable, and of no Force againſt the above mentioned Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly:</hi> Another <hi>Objection</hi> is, 'That ſuch a LAW (as the above mentioned) would encourage Debtors to be careleſs, extravagant, and diſhoneſt.'</p>
            <p>To this Objection we reply, That no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws can make all Men Good and Wife. Amongſt the <hi>Clergy,</hi> ſome are not ſit
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007215_0015_102B3E51F143F428"/>for their Holy Function. Amongſt the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, ſome are Quacks, and of no Value. Amongſt Counſello<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, ſome are of a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Mind. Shall we therefore be ſo <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Wiſe,</hi> as to have no Counſellors, no Phyſicians, nor Clergymen? And becauſe ſome Traders prove Knaves and Rogues, muſt all Traders be liable to be treated as ſuch?</p>
            <p>Men accuſtom'd to do Evil, habituated to Wickedneſs and Villainy, ought to be duly puniſhed. But a Man's Misfortunes does not prove him a Rogue. Nor is Weakneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency, or Imprudence, which all Men have more or leſs of, a Proof of Fraud, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, or Extravagancy; for Men are too often valued, not according to the Integrity of their Hearts, the Cleanneſs of their Hands, the Wiſdom of their Heads; but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſuppoſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007215_0030_102B3E7185FBE7F8"/>Sin. This ſpeaks for itſelf—And as no Man can approve ſuch Treatment with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to himſelf, ſo he ought not to be guilty of it towards others, which fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the Inhumanity of Impriſoning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent Debtors. And ſeeing we have no Law to prevent ſuch barbarous Uſage, Is it not highly reaſonable, wiſe, and fit, we ſhould have ſuch a Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>To deprive an honeſt Man of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the Power of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ling, is Inhuman and Unreaſonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Liberty is dear to Man. Life without Liberty, is a Kind of dying daily. Man is born free, and born for Action, and to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and has a natural Right to Himſelf, his Labour, and to the Air, the Earth, and the Seas; and his Fellow Creatures have not, in a State of <hi>Nature,</hi> any Right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him in the free Enjoyment of what his Great Creator has bountifully beſtowed upon, or granted to him.</p>
            <p>But Man in Society, voluntarily gives up Part of his <hi>natural</hi> Liberty, in order to be governed by ſuch Laws as are beſt adapted to promote the Peace and Proſperity of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety—But then he has an equal Right to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007215_0031_102B3E73476013A8"/>as much Liberty as the Laws grant to the other Members in the ſame Community. But under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Light of the glorious Goſpel, is it right and fit to take away a Man's Liberty, his Labour, yea, his <hi>Liberty</hi> of Air, and ſhut him up in a Priſon, becauſe he has loſt <hi>his Money,</hi> and cannot pay what he oweth; and this by Means out of his Power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent?</p>
            <p>Again: Is it right and ſit, that Chriſtian Communities ſhould make Laws in <hi>direct Oppoſition</hi> to the Laws of GOD?</p>
            <p>By the meer Providence of GOD, an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man is ſuddenly deprived of all his <hi>Worldly Subſtance,</hi> which immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our ſincere Pity and Commiſeration and <hi>Aſſiſtance;</hi> becauſe we are under the ſame Law of Nature, and therefore certainly liable to the ſame Effects and Conſequences from the ſame <hi>Cauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by a Law in the Community where the unhappy Man ſuffered under Misfortunes, it is there lawful to caſt him into Priſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever—for Debt only—This looſe, <hi>indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating</hi> Law, is left open, becauſe wicked Men, by wicked Deeds, ſometimes cheat
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007215_0032_102B3E75CC13CC00"/>their <hi>Creditors,</hi> who juſtly, for ſo doing, caſt them into Priſon: Therefore all Men, the beſt Men <hi>(is this right!)</hi> who owe Money, tho' the meer Providence of God, by ſome remarkable Accident, has put it out of their Power to pay; yet, if their Creditors pleaſe, <hi>he ſhall likewiſe</hi> be caſt into Priſon—Is not this therefore, <hi>doing Evil, that Good may come of it?</hi> And is not this acting in direct Oppoſition to the Command of God? Is it not highly reaſonable, therefore, to have ſome <hi>Medium,</hi> to adjuſt the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Debtor</hi> and the Creditor?</p>
            <p>With what ſacred Rage! with what Vehemence, Indignation, and <hi>Pathos,</hi> did the Man after GOD's own Heart, call for dire <hi>Vengeance</hi> on ſuch—<hi>For they perſecute him, whom thou haſt ſmitten; and they talk to the Grief of thoſe, whom thou haſt wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Pſa. 69.</p>
            <p>To <hi>afflict</hi> the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> to take away a Man's <hi>natural</hi> and his <hi>civil</hi> Liberty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of the Power of acting, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his Time, and his Talents, for the Good of himſelf and his Family, for the Benefit of the Community; in doing which, he ſo far glorifies GOD his Maker, to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007215_0033_102B3E78427C6210"/>deprive an honeſt Unfortunate, of the <hi>neceſſary Advantages, is, as it were,</hi> to <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> a Man after he is dead, and therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and inhuman.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>it is abſolutely neceſſary, for the Good of the Community, to have a Law of Equity eſtabliſhed, which ſhould judge between the Creditor and the Debtor,</hi> in <hi>Caſes extream.</hi> Becauſe the Tempers and Paſſions of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors may hurry them on to do ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Actions to their Debtors, when unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>their</hi> Power, and under Colour of the Law too, that may ruin a valuable Man, his Family, and deprive Society of a uſeful Member; and all out of meer Humour, Will, Reſentment, Spite, or Malice. It is <hi>Godlike,</hi> to prevent ſuch inhuman, ſuch unreaſonable Power.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly and Laſtly. <hi>The Impriſoning honeſt Inſolvents, is Inhuman in itſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in deſpite of the Chriſtian Religion, which is the only Religion we profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Thing that is comprehended and implied in the <hi>Words,</hi> Goodneſs, Love, Peace, Mercy, Truth, and Charity, is in the moſt earneſt Manner recommended and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007215_0034_102B3E7A3660AF50"/>inculcated in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the Godlike Example of its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Author, <hi>His own Example</hi> was more <hi>Forcable</hi> than all the <hi>Arguments</hi> in a whole World full of Books—And thoſe that love him will keep his Commandments; but thoſe who will neither believe <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor JESUS CHRIST himſelf (in whoſe Words we finiſh what we have at <hi>preſent</hi> to ſay on this Subject) all ſuch we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eave in the Hands of HIM who will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every One according to their Deeds.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Then came <hi>Peter</hi> to him, and ſaid, Lord, how oft ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive? till ſeven Times?</p>
               <p>JESUS ſaith unto him, I ſay not unto thee, until ſeven Times, but until Twenty Times Seven. Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King, which would take an Account of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him <hi>Ten Thouſand Talents:</hi> But foraſmuch as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be ſold, and his Wiſe and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and all that he had, and Payment to be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:007215_0035_102B3E7BC85C7508"/>
The Servant therefore fell down and worſhipped him, ſaying, Lord, have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with me, and I will pay thee All. Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and looſed him, and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave</hi> him the Debt.</p>
               <p>But the ſame Servant went out and found one of his Fellow Servant which owed him <hi>an Hundred Pence,</hi> and he laid Hands on him, and took him by the <hi>Throat,</hi> ſaying, Pay me that thou oweſt And his Fellow Servant fell down at hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So when his Fellow Servants ſaw what was done, they were very ſorry, and came and told unto their Lord all that was done.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord, after that he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, ſaid unto <hi>him, O thou wicked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> I forgave thee all <hi>that</hi> Debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me, ſhouldſt not thou alſo have had <hi>Compaſſion</hi> on thy <hi>Fellow Servant</hi> even as I had Pity on thee?</p>

               <p>So <hi>likewiſe</hi> ſhall my Heavenly FATHER do alſo unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive <hi>not</hi> every one his Brother their <hi>Treſpaſſes.</hi>—Thus ſpake JESUS the Son of GOD, who ſpake as never Man ſpake— Who is ſtiled the Wiſdom of GOD, and the Power of GOD. <bibl>See <hi>Matt.</hi> Goſp.
