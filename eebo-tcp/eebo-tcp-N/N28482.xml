            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THAT elevation and depreſſion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character, ſo obſervable, forms one of thoſe ſtriking contraſts in which nature ſeems to delight in all her works. While, by a happy diſpoſition of circumſtances, the few fortunate travellers aſcend the lofty ſummit of human ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, the multitude, far below, move down the vale of obſcurity, unnoticed, into ſoon-forgotten graves. Man, having opportunities and calls for conſtant exertion, finds his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities unfolding, his mind growing to his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037944_0005_100F6C541F8C7E08"/>
till in the end he becomes as much greater than others, as his circle was larger. He may, by being placed in advantageous circumſtances in ſociety, be inſtrumental of almoſt infinite good to millions; and generations yet unborn, as they riſe, ſhall call him bleſſed.</p>
            <p>BUT few ſituations will admit extenſive uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The circle in which the greater part move is very confined; conſequently their uſefulneſs and fame are very limited. Happy for the world when the few elevated ſeats in a nation are filled with truly great men, who delight in diffuſing liberty, peace and happineſs through their exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive circle of influence.</p>
            <p>OUR text is the remark of David to his ſubjects, on the death of Abner, a diſtinguiſhed General over the armies of Iſrael. Above deception and revenge himſelf, he did not ſuſpect them in one that called himſelf his friend. He fell a ſacrifice to the ambition and revenge of a rival, who was jealous of his deſerving and poſſeſſing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic confidence and eſteem above himſelf. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, ſenſible of his worth as a man, of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037944_0006_100F6C5845DA2F28"/>
bravery and ſucceſs as an officer, moſt tenderly laments his premature fall; and by example teaches us the propriety of lamenting public characters, who have rendered eſſential ſervices to their country and the world.</p>
            <p>THERE is then a ſenſe, in which man may, in the language of inſpiration, be called great. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>opriety of publicly lamenting ſuch men.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We are to inquire what conſtitutes man great. To give him this character in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, three things are principally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A MIND which can embrace large and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive views of human things. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> reaſon and intelligence a man poſſeſſes, the higher he riſes in the ſcale of exiſtence. Men differ as much in their intellectual powers, as in the conſtitution of their bodies. Some come into life with feeble
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037944_0007_100F6C59C831DEB0"/>
conſtitutions—always incapable of thoſe bodily labours and exertions, which others can ſupport. So ſome have leſs intelligence—are incapable of ſuch large, comprehenſive views of things—and therefore incapacitated for acting upon a broad, extenſive plan. The more extenſive views a man has, the deeper he penetrates into men and things, the more noble creature he is. Hence the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite intelligence of GOD—his cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending perfectly all things in the univerſe— confer inconceivable dignity on the Divine Mind. Could we ſuppoſe the Divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d to poſſeſs leſs intelligence—were his views diminiſhed—had he a leſs perfect acquaintance with all things—he would not be ſo great as he now is. Extenſive views of things—capacities equal to great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—form the great man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SUCH a mind, to appear great, muſt be placed in ſuch ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap>ances as admit of expreſſing in <hi>action</hi> theſe enlightened conceptions. This is neceſſary to give ſuch a mind is due expanſion, and call forth all its energies. Man is, in a great degree, the creature of circumſtances and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037944_0008_100F6C5C34E5D308"/>
The mind enlarges by exerciſe, and, like the body, owes its growth and ſtrength to its own operation. Let a man poſſeſs the moſt extenſive views of things—great degrees of prudence, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and bravery—yet, if he is never called to act in a ſituation which demands theſe energies of mind, he cannot appear to poſſeſs them. There is fire in the flint; but, unleſs it is ſmitten, it will not ſhine. Hence great occaſions always produce great men—diſplay their greatneſs to the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seaſons of public and national danger have called forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> men, who were able to take hold of theſe great events, and direct them with fortitude and prudence. Theſe great events, and national concerns, are as familiar to ſuch a mind, and conducted with as much eaſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as others guide their little domeſtic affairs. There is real greatneſs and dignity in a mind equal to great events—which can direct them with a ſteady hand. When we caſt our eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heavens, and obſerve their order, their motions, and revolutions, how great does that All-preſiding Mind appear, which can direct all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037944_0009_100F6C5F8C8A8688"/>
their movements! In this way the powers of the Divine Mind are exhibited, and GOD appears great. It is in <hi>action</hi> that a being appears great. When we ſee a man forming great deſigns, and with facility carrying them into effect, he appears great. Actions, in which great wiſdom, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, courage and fortitude are diſplayed, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a great mind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. TRUE greatneſs conſiſts in directing theſe extenſive views, and great actions, to the good of mankind. To be great as agents of deſtruction— in diffuſing miſery—is the greatneſs of devils. This has been the greatneſs of many men, in all ages of the world. Many, before and ſince the Macedonian and the Swede, have performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have aſtoniſhed the world, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign only to ſhackle and exterminate the human race. Such men abundantly merit the eternal execrations of GOD and man. Could we ſuppoſe that Deity created the world, and peopled it with rational creatures, with intention of making them all miſerable; ſuch a deſign, and ſuch an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, could not be called great, but infinitely

dreadful. In what an amiable point of light do the deſigns and actions of Jeſus Chriſt appear, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thoſe, for inſtance, of Alexander! Both poſſeſſed extenſive deſigns, and performed great actions: but look at their objects: one went forth to conquer and deſtroy the world; and, when he had done it, wept that there was not another world to encrimſon with its blood.

America is fallen upon one of her high places. In him, how much worth has left our land and world! From Mount Vernon, the great, the excellent WASHINGTON, like Moſes from Piſgah, has taken his flight to heaven, and, like him, left a nation in tears. He has left us, and left us without the conſolation which Moſes gave his people—<hi>that</hi> GOD <hi>would raiſe them up another like unto him.</hi> This hope we can hardly indulge.

When a man of ſuch diſtinguiſhed worth; who hath rendered ſuch eminent ſervices to his country; when he falls a victim to death, we may ſay—<hi>A great man indeed hath fallen in our Iſrael.</hi> Not to notice his death, would indicate forgetfulneſs of his ſervices, and ingratitude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>MEN, who have benefited the world by their example and active ſervices, are public bleſſings to the human race. It is a diſtinguiſhed favour to a people to have a truly great man in ſome
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037944_0012_100F6C664E8FF378"/>
important poſt in ſociety. His example is moſt ſalutary on the public mind. To ſee a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly acting from noble, diſintereſted views— ſacrificing private conſiderations for the public good—employing his enlightened mind in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt and noble plans for national proſperity and happineſs—to ſee him directing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated concerns of a nation with ſucceſs—tends to elevate the mind, and expoſe that low ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which cannot ſacrifice a little private good for public happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE example of Jeſus Chriſt is frequently propoſed, in ſcripture, for the imitation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of chriſtians. So the example of a great man, in ſocial, civil and military life, may conduce to the improvement of mankind in all theſe characters.

               </gap>ed that of the ſoldier, and dignified that of the ſtateſman, than GEORGE WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. We have ſeen him great in counſel and in arms—crowned with ſucceſs and glory, both in the cabinet and field; yet modeſt—not eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037944_0013_100F6C67D15EB760"/>
with his own greatneſs, not dazzled with the ſplendor of his own great actions, nor intoxicated with the praiſes of millions—indeed of the world. We have ſeen him modeſtly declining the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of thoſe whom he had ſo eminently bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by his labours and toils. Poſſeſſing that fine ſenſibility of ſoul which ever accompanies true greatneſs, he bluſhed at his own deſerved ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: and we have ſeen his manly countenance, which was never diſcompoſed by fear, ſoftened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a profuſion of tears, at the reſpect of a grateful people. A little mind, on ſuch occaſions, would be lifted into a god; and never would be ſatisfied, unleſs his humble worſhippers had bowed the knee, and in the language of eaſtern idolaters ſaid, <hi>O king, live forever.</hi> But a great mind is ſatisfied with the conſciouſneſs of having benefited man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This is more acceptable and pleaſing to it, than all their applauſes. The death of ſuch a man ſhould be lamented for the loſs of his ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>DEATH hath alſo cloſed the ſcene of his public and important ſervices for his country. When
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037944_0014_100F6C6A3A931E00"/>
the head of a riſing family, who guides his affairs with prudence, is taken away, the loſs to them is great. He can no more return to his houſe. They can no more be benefited by his counſels and labours. A nation may be as greatly benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome great public character, as a family is by its prudent, induſtrious head. A ſingle man may, under GOD, really deſerve the character of the <hi>deliverer and ſaviour</hi> of his country; and may, by his counſels and dangers, tranſmit from one generation to another the invaluable bleſſings of liberty and good government to millions, when he is no more. A nation may, after being eſſentially benefited by the extenſive views, and active la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, of ſome great character, ſtill need his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in ſeaſons of national danger and diſtreſs. The reputation and influence of a man who is great in counſel and arms, and who hath proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in whatever he hath put his hand to, tend greatly to diſmay the enemies, and animate the friends, of his country. In this view the death of WASHINGTON is a public loſs, and greatly to be lamented in the preſent criſis.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037944_0015_100F6C6E6DCD3070"/>WE are juſtified in ſcripture in lamenting this great man; and we feel it no profanation of this day, to bring into view our national obligations to that great, that excellent man, who is no more. Death hath ſhown us he was but man: and in lamenting him we are countenanced by abundant ſcriptural examples. When we read the biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical memoirs of diſtinguiſhed men, who have eſſentially benefited their generation and poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and follow them to the cloſing hour of life, we find a general ſorrow to prevail. It ſeems a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſentiment of human nature, that ſuch men ſhould not deſcend into the grave without general teſtimonials of public reſpect. Mankind have, in all ages and countries, generally united in bedew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grave of a benefactor with their tears. Such ſentiments and conduct are certainly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and the public expreſſion of them is due to diſtinguiſhed merit, and eminent public ſervices. Let the hearſe of the inſignificant and worthleſs-great be followed by a proceſſion of mercenary mourners, who ſeek to hide the tears they do not ſhed—let them purchaſe the ſorrow which their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037944_0016_100F2E184FD154E8"/>
merit cannot excite—let them rear their proud monuments, and flattery laviſh her inſcriptions, to perpetuate and emblazon a worthleſs name;— WASHINGTON has a living monument—a monument in every heart, deeply inſcribed with his actions and virtues—a monument, which will be rebuilt in every future generation, and will crumble only with the ſkies. America mourns— her tears will fall, as liberal and pure as the drops of heaven. He was her father; and her ſons will remember that the ſoil which they reap, and the ocean which laves their ſhores, were ſecured by his toils. And her fair daughters will recollect that WASHINGTON made them mothers—not of a degraded race of ſlaves, but of a free, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nation.</p>
            <p>EVERY man is bound to commit the remains of a father to the grave with decency and reſpect. So a nation may be under obligations to commit the ſacred aſhes of a public benefactor to the grave with reſpect and tears: and ſhould they withhold them, the ſtones might reprove their inſenſibility.</p>
            <p>MOSES, in every view, was a great man. He
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037944_0017_100F6C74246598B0"/>
was raiſed up to break Egyptian chains, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a great nation. He put himſelf at their head, fought their battles, ſhared their toils, gave them a ſyſtem of civil government, and through a long life adminiſtered it with undeviating integrity; raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to great national reſpectability, and put their dread on ſurrounding nations. After a long life thus ſpent, he ſuddenly, like our American Moſes, drops mortality, and dwells with his GOD. Though individuals, envying his honour, had faulted his adminiſtration, and excited inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtill he was venerated in life, and greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in death. We are informed that <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael wept for Moſes, in the plains of Moab, thirty days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN being juſt to acknowledge all our national de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, and public mercies, as the gifts of GOD, we ſhould not overlook thoſe diſtinguiſhed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which they have been conveyed. We may rob man, as well as GOD, in withholding from him his deſerved ſhare of love and reſpect.</p>
            <p>THE MAN, ſo juſtly deſerving the love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of AMERICA, is now no more. By his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, fortitude and ſucceſs, he hath received the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037944_0018_100F6C75F4CA5BC8"/>
applauſes of the world. Raiſed up, like Moſes, to redeem a people from foreign domination, with a like modeſty he accepted from Congreſs, in 1775, the command of the American forces. Contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with veteran troops, and generals who had figured on the European ſtage of war, he was found their ſuperior in the day of battle. Early did he ſtep forth in the expiring cauſe of liberty. Poſſeſſed of ſuperior fortitude to ſupport evils, and bravery to front dangers, he nobly triumphed in the field; generouſly refuſing any compenſation for all his toils, but that divine one, of having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the moſt important ſervices to his country. Through a long, arduous revolution, he finally led us to victory, independence and glory. He then returned to his peaceful home, with the bleſſings of his country.</p>
            <p>AT a period perhaps equally difficult, he was called by the voice of his grateful ſons, to ſave them—not from the ravages of a foreign enemy, but one ſtill worſe—domeſtic diſcord and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Raiſed to the Preſidential chair, his plaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic hand ſoon healed our civil wounds, and reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to a ſtate of political vigour and happineſs.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037944_0019_100F6C77958012F8"/>
Having filled the chair, for eight years, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive uſefulneſs, dignity and glory, he declined the future ſuffrages of his country. He claimed an exemption from the oppreſſive cares of public <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>—a retirement ſo pleaſing to increaſing years, and a mind worn in the public good. To Mount Vernon we ſaw him retire, to ſeek repoſe in the tranqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſcenes of private life. There our thoughts attended him; and our prayers aſcended, that he might enjoy every ſocial and religious pleaſure, protracted to a good old age, and then be gently laid to reſt in the lap of our common mother.</p>
            <p>BY the threats and lawleſs depredations of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of robbers and atheiſts, the conſtituted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our country invited him to the firſt military command in the nation. And, to the joy of America, he accepted the appointment. In this high command Death found him labouring for the good of his country.</p>
            <p>SINCE Moſes, no people have owed more to any one man, than America does to that beloved name, GEORGE WASHINGTON. Like Moſes, he had ſome enemies—ſufficient to prove his worth. This is a tribute which great worth
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037944_0020_100F6C79F9669868"/>
muſt pay. Theſe men have proved themſelves the enemies of all civil and religious order and happineſs. While in office, they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pining away with unſatisfied deſires to ſee him blunder in his political race, and plunge from his eminent ſtation of uſefulneſs and glory into obſcurity and contempt. As the ſore, wounded eye is pained by the cheering rays of the ſun, ſo envy is tortured at ſuch a conſtellation of virtues as diſtinguiſhed the illuſtrious WASHINGTON. While his few enemies have impatiently beheld his wiſdom and inflexible integrity, we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed every bleſſing which the nature of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment would admit. About the term of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years hath this great man conducted our arms and councils; at the head of which, he hath appeared the brave, the fortunate, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane General, and the wiſe, the prudent, the accompliſhed Stateſman. In theſe wide, extenſive fields has he gathered laurels which will never fade while liberty and good policy are known in the world. The circumſtances of his life have been remarkable. He has always been the honour and glory of his offices. Inſtead of wearing them out,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037944_0021_100F6C7C5B2DCF38"/>
he hath clothed them with increaſing uſefulneſs and glory. No man ever poſſeſſed a reputation for prudence and integrity more unſpotted, and a character which the world has more generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. His humanity, his public ſpirit, with his many other virtues, will be applauded by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
            <p>AS to his religion, let charity follow him into the noiſe and confuſion of the camp—into the perplexing cares of government—and obſerve his conſtant devotional retirement, which he was known to practiſe; let her ſee him in his houſe, bowing before the SUPREME MAJESTY with the loweſt of his fellow creatures; let her ſee his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in the church; let her connect his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of GOD with his love of man, and would ſhe not ſay, <hi>Truly, this is a righteous man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS great man has now bid a final adieu to his family, to his country, and the world. The mournful tidings are now circulating our country, and will ſoon reach the diſtant corners of the globe. It will long be remembered, that GEORGE WASHINGTON, after a life of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive uſefulneſs, and unſpotted honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

terminated his mortal exiſtence on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of December, 1799, in the ſixty-eighth year of his age; ripe in days and virtue.</p>
            <p>WE have dwelt with mournful pleaſure on his memory; but we muſt bid him adieu—a long adieu! Farewell, happy ſhade!
