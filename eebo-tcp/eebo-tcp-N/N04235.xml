         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT I aim at in this ſmall Tract, is, to be a little uſeful to Young Gentlemen that are to be introduced into the Knowlege of the Sciences, (to whom they at firſt appear like a meer Wilderneſs,) by ſetting before them a <hi>General View</hi> of the whole <hi>Syſtem of Learning,</hi> as it were in Miniature; wherein they may at once behold, not only the Objects, Boundaries, Ends and Uſes of each of the Sciences; but at the ſame time, their Foundation in the nature of things; the natural Order wherein they lie; and their ſeveral Relations, Connexions and Dependences, both with reſpect one to another, and to the General End, <hi>viz.</hi> Our <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which is purſued through them all.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to me as uſeful in the Instruction of young Beginners in the Study of the Sciences, as it is in teaching <hi>Geography,</hi> to exhibit firſt of all a general Map of the whole Terraqueous Globe, in order to a more particular Deſcription of the ſeveral Countries and Kingdoms in the following Maps: And likewiſe in teaching <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> to give firſt a general Delineation of the whole System of the world, in order to account for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the ſeveral particular Planets in the following Schemes. — For as in the <hi>Natural World.</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:005220_0003_1018B1DCC4EEA260"/>
one cannot have a juſt Notion of any particular Country, without conſidering it's Situation in relation to the whole Globe, nor of any particular Globe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering it's Situation with reſpect to the whole System: So neither in the <hi>Intellectual World,</hi> (if I may ſo call it, I can one have a juſt Notion of any particular Science without conſidering it as it ſtands related to the whole Syſtem of Learning, and to the general End purſued through the whole. — I have therefore drawn up this <hi>General View of Philoſophy</hi> for the uſe of young Students, that whatever Subject they are upon in the Courſe of their Studies, they may know to which Science it belongs, and what relation it bears to the whole Syſtem; which may, perhaps, be of ſome uſe to direct and methodize their Thoughts and enlarge their Minds: And thus to open to them at once a proſpect of the whole Compaſs of their Buſineſs, may alſo engage them to a more earneſt and induſtrious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the purſuit of their Studies for the accompliſhment of it.</p>
            <p>Not that I would be underſtood to think this the proper Order in which the Sciences are to be taught. — There are many obvious Reaſons that render it highly Convenient to begin the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of youth with the <hi>Languages</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics</hi> (which are themſelves indeed a kind of Language;) for theſe are both of them a neceſſary Furniture in order to the attainment of any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perfection in the other parts of Learning. —
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:005220_0004_1018B1DE46EE2B80"/>
And beſides, the <hi>Languages</hi> are beſt ſuited to their lively Imaginations, moſt eaſily retained by their young Memories, and moſt obvious to their little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings: And the <hi>Mathematics</hi> are very uſeful to inure them to thinking, to poſſeſs them of a Habit of cloſe Application, and by that means ripen their Minds to a fixed and ſtrong attention to the Objects about which they are employed. — It is beſt therefore that they ſhould be long inured to theſe parts of Learning, before they proceed to the ſublimer Studies of <hi>Logic</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral Philoſophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, perhaps it was for this Reaſon that <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Oratory, Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics</hi> have not been commonly accounted parts of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but rather Inſtructions introductory thereunto; namely, becauſe they were chiefly the Studies about which Youth were generally employed among the Ancients <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Quin<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

For whether they are
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005220_0005_1018B1E0F6C78388"/>
properly parts of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> or not, it is not worth the while to diſpute; tho' I believe it was never doubted but that they are accompliſhments that are eſſential to the Character of a complete Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>However, as I ſaid, It is neceſſary to begin the Inſtruction of Youth with the <hi>Languages</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics.</hi>— Theſe ſhould all along while they are at the Schools be taught together: The <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> and <hi>Claſſics</hi> as their Buſineſs, and the eaſieſt and plaineſt things in the <hi>Mathematics</hi> as their Diverſion: — And when young Lads have been long exerciſed at the Schools in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek Languages</hi> and <hi>Claſſics,</hi> and conſequently in the firſt Rudiments of <hi>Grammar, Oratory, Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> and likewiſe of <hi>Arithmetic, Geometry, Muſic</hi> and <hi>Geography;</hi> (both becauſe theſe Studies are, as I ſaid, moſt ſuitable to their juvenile Capacities, and at the ſame time neceſſary to render the other parts of Learning more eaſy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible and delightful;) they may then proceed at the Colleges with the greater Expedition and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in perfecting themſelves in theſe Studies: (For the <hi>Claſſics</hi> and <hi>Mathematics</hi> ſhould indeed never be laid aſide;) and at the ſame time go on ſucceſſively in the ſeveral Studies of <hi>Metaphyſics, Logic</hi> and <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> and <hi>Mechanics, Phyſic</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> and <hi>Pneunmology, Theology, Ethics</hi> and <hi>Politics,</hi> together with the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> all in the Order wherein they here lie before them.</p>

               <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>PHILOSOPHY is the Study of true Wiſdom, or the Study of Truth and Right, in order to the attainment of true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. — Or it may be defined. The purſuit of true Happineſs in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of things as being what they really are, and in acting or practiſing according to that Knowlege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>True Wiſdom</hi> conſiſts in diſcovering the beſt Ends, and the fitteſt Means in order to the Attainment of them, and in Vigorouſly purſuing thoſe beſt Ends by the fitteſt Means. — Now the great End
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005220_0007_1018B16264332E70"/>
that above all things concerns us, is, that we he truly <hi>Happy</hi> in the whole of our Nature and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; — And our true <hi>Happineſs</hi> conſiſts in that Pleaſure which attends the Contemplation of all things that come within the Compaſs of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and eſpecially ſuch as concern us, as being what they really are, and the Regulation or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our Actions according thereunto: i. e. according to the Truth of things and the Laws of right Reaſon founded thereon. — And ſince this is the great End ultimately purſued through all the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> they muſt be conſidered as the means to our true Happineſs.</p>
               <p>For in order that we may be compleatly happy, it is neceſſary that all the Powers of our Souls, our <hi>Underſtandings, Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> be united with their proper Objects which are <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good:</hi> And in order to this, that they be duly inſtructed and directed in all their Exertions, — To accompliſh this, therefore, is the whole Buſineſs of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which comprehends the whole Syſtem of the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in order the better to underſtand wherein our true <hi>Happineſs</hi> conſiſts, and the means to it, it is neceſſary to explain what we mean by <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> — And in order to this, <hi>Truth</hi> muſt be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Intellectual,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Practical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natural Truth,</hi> which might rather be call'd <hi>Real Truth</hi> or the Truth of things, is nothing elſe but the Reality of their Exiſtence, as being what in fact they are, and ſo ſituated and related as to conſtitute One intire Whole or Syſtem, as in fact they do. —
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005220_0008_1018B1E7249E9E58"/>
And <hi>Intellectual Truth</hi> is the Knowlege of things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they really are, their Exiſtence, together with all their Relations, Connexions and Dependencies among themſelves and with regard to the Whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natural Good</hi> is either of <hi>Things</hi> or <hi>Perſons.</hi> The <hi>Natural Good</hi> of Things is their Fitneſs or Suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to anſwer their ſeveral Ends as they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute one intire Syſtem conſpiring to the — Order, Harmony, Beauty and Uſefulneſs of the whole, ſo as to render it, in the beſt manner, ſubſervient to the Pleaſure and Happineſs of the Senſitive and Rational Nature.— The <hi>Natural Good</hi> of <hi>perſons</hi> is their Pleaſure or Happineſs, and the means, whether Things or Actions neceſſary to promote it. As on the other hand, Pain or Uneaſineſs with the means that procure it are Natural Evil.</p>
               <p>Now in as much as we conſiſt of a twofold <hi>Nature, Senſitive</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> each of which have their diſtinct <hi>pleaſures</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> there muſt be two ſorts of <hi>Good,</hi> viz. <hi>Senſible</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Good.</hi> Thoſe things or Actions which procure and promote the Comfort and Pleaſure, or remove the Pain or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of the <hi>Senſitive</hi> or Animal Nature, are it's <hi>Senſible Good;</hi> and thoſe which procure &amp; promote the Pleaſure and Happineſs or remove the Pains &amp; Miſeries of the <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Nature</hi> are it's <hi>Spiritual Good.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Practical Good</hi> conſiſts in our chuſing &amp; doing what tends to promote our Well being and Happineſs.— And this is of two Kinds, correſpondent to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Heads of <hi>Senſible</hi> &amp; <hi>Spiritual Good,</hi> viz. <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Secular Good,</hi> (if I may uſe ſuch a Term) I mean, that which conſiſts in the Practice of thoſe ſeveral Arts and Buſineſſes that tend to promote our outward and ſenſible Wellbeing in this Life, or the temporal Comfort and Pleaſure of our Animal and Senſitive Nature.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Moral Good</hi> conſiſts in our chuſing or refuſing, and embracing or rejecting either Things or Actions according as they do or do not tend to make our <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> Nature, in the whole ultimately happy, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Time and to all Eternity. — And contrary to this is <hi>Moral Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Theſe ſeveral Kinds of Good, are either <hi>Private</hi> or <hi>Public,</hi> according as they relate either to <hi>one Perſon</hi> ſingly conſidered, or conſidered in relation to the <hi>whole System,</hi> whether <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Political.</hi>

               <p>From theſe Diſtinctions of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that our true Happineſs conſiſts in both <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi> and <hi>Practice:</hi> in the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and in the <hi>practice</hi> of that which is <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Right:</hi> Or which is the ſame thing, in <hi>Knowlege</hi> and <hi>Virtue:</hi> In the <hi>Knowlege</hi> of all things that come within the Reach of our Underſtandings as being what they really are, and in always <hi>chuſing</hi> and <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> whatſoever Truth and Right Reaſon dictate as neceſſary to be choſen and done in order to our true Happineſs, in the whole of o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This part of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is moreover called <hi>Somatology</hi> or the Doctrine of <hi>Bodies,</hi> which alone are the proper Objects of it — It is not therefore the Buſineſs of this Science to ſearch after, or treat of Efficient Cauſes.

               <p n="3">III. MORAL PHILOSOPHY inſtructs us in the Knowlege of the Moral World, i. e. the great Syſtem of Spirits or intelligent active Beings, and teaches all the Truths that can be known by us concerning rational Creatures and moral Agents, ſuch as are our own Souls and other orders of created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005220_0024_1016E6BDF47E56D8"/>I thus define <hi>Moral philoſophy</hi> in a larger ſenſe than is uſual, comprehending under it, not only the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Behaviour or moral practice, which <hi>Tully</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines <hi>Rerum fugiendarum expetendarumque Scientia,</hi> but alſo the Doctrine of Spirits which truly belongs to it, and is indeed the Foundation of it: for the Knowlege of our Duty and what we muſt hate and avoid or chuſe and embrace in order to Happineſs, is ſo neceſſarily connected with the Knowlege of the nature of Spirits, that it cannot be underſtood or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained without it. v. Woll. Rel. of Nat.</p>
               <p>So that there are two parts of <hi>Moral philoſophy;</hi> the one <hi>Speculative</hi> the other <hi>Practical;</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> teaches all the <hi>Truths</hi> that can be known of the moral World; the <hi>ſecond</hi> from them deduces the <hi>Rules</hi> of our Duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Speculative</hi> part of <hi>Moral philoſophy,</hi> which is called <hi>PNEUMATOLOGY,</hi> teaches all that we can know concerning Spirits, both thoſe that are <hi>Created</hi> and GOD the <hi>Creator</hi> of them This has been wont, (tho' improperly,) to be treated of as the ſecond part of <hi>Metaphyſics.</hi> — And</p>
               <p n="1">(1) As to <hi>Created ſpirits,</hi> we know from our ſelves, that they are intelligent &amp; active Beings, as having the powers of Perceiving, Imagining &amp; Remembring, of Thinking or Underſtanding &amp; Willing, and of freely Chuſing, Refuſing &amp; Acting or Exerting themſelves, according as they either love, hate, hope, fear, or are any otherwiſe affected: For of all there Perceptions and Exertions, Paſſions or Actions, we are conſcious to our ſelves. — All theſe Faculties therefore are here particularly explained, and from thence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that Spirits only can properly be ſaid to be Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſes, as having alone an internal Principle of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005220_0025_1016E6C0A72817F8"/>
Activity or of variouſly exerting &amp; determining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to Deſign, Counſel or free Choice, &amp; therefore they alſo alone are capable of moral Agency and moral Government. — Particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">[1] This Science treats of the Nature, Powers and Operations of our <hi>Rational Souls,</hi> and of their Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Future State of Exiſtence. And this may be called <hi>PSICHOLOGY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">[2] It inquires as far as we are able concerning the Exiſtence, Nature, Powers and Operations of other perceptive or <hi>Intelligent Active Creatures</hi> beſides or Superior to us, whether Good or Evil. And this is called <hi>DAEMONOLOGY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) This Science proceeds, by Analogy from what Powers &amp; Perfections we find in our ſelves (removing all Defects and Limitations,) to explain what we are capable of Knowing concerning the Being, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Attributes &amp; Operations of GOD, the Supreme, All wiſe and Almighty Spirit who hath made, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and Governs all things, both in the Natural &amp; Moral World; being here diſcovered to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Efficient and Author of all the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of Nature, in whoſe Eternal, All comprehending Mind are the Archetypes of our Ideas, and who is the Great Original and Father of our Spirits, and conſequently our chief Good; and our Supreme King and Moral Governor, and therefore infinitely Wiſe, Juſt &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent in all his Conduct towards us; to whom we muſt give an Account of all our Actions, and by whom we ſhall be moſt righteouſly and equitably dealt with hereafter, and be either Rewarded or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, in exact proportion, according as our Behaviour ſhall be found to have been good or bad in this Life. And this part of <hi>Pneumatology</hi> is called <hi>THEOLOGY.</hi>

                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005220_0026_1016E6C35C115168"/>2. The <hi>Practical part</hi> of <hi>Moral philoſophy,</hi> from the Truths diſcovered concerning GOD &amp; Created Spirits in the <hi>Speculative</hi> part of it, infers the Rules of our Duty &amp; Behaviour, and teaches us ſo to live and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct our ſelves upon all Occaſions as will render us truly Happy both here and for ever. — And here Mankind muſt be conſidered in a twofold Capacity; viz either as a <hi>Moral Syſtem</hi> in general, or as ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>particular Society's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) That which reſpects mankind as a <hi>Moral Syſtem</hi> in general, is called <hi>ETHICS</hi> or Morality, which is defined, The Art of Living happily by the practice of <hi>Vertue,</hi> which conſiſts in that force and ſtability of Soul whereby we do firmly perſiſt in chuſing &amp; doing whatever Truth &amp; Right Reaſon dictate as neceſſary to be choſen &amp; done in order to our true Happineſs, in ſpight of all Temptations to the Contrary.</p>
               <p>This I have called <hi>Moral Good,</hi> which is here to be conſidered, not only as founded in the Truth and Nature of things, but alſo as being the Will &amp; Law of GOD concerning us, and conſequently what we are Obliged to do in Obedience to his Will and from a ſenſe of Duty to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For we are here to conſider our ſelves as a Moral Syſtem acting under the Eye of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD &amp; Accountable to Him as our Supreme King &amp; Moral Governour, whoſe Will and Law it therefore is, that we ſhould thus behave our ſelves, becauſe he would have us happy. For being perfectly Happy himſelf and Self ſufficient to his own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, He could have (no Selfiſh Views,) no other View in Creating &amp; Governing the Moral World, than that it might be, in the whole, a happy Syſtem: — Since therefore He would have us Happy, it muſt be his Will <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Law that we ſhould conform all our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005220_0027_1016E6C607284680"/>
and Behaviour to Truth &amp; Right Reaſon, becauſe ſuch a Conduct. is, in the Nature of things neceſſary to our true Happineſs.</p>
               <p>So that there are two things to be here Conſidered, viz. The <hi>Criterion</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> &amp; <hi>Wrong,</hi> and the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> we are under to practice the One &amp; avoid the Other. — The <hi>Criterion</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> &amp; <hi>Wrong,</hi> is the <hi>Truth</hi> &amp; <hi>Nature</hi> of things or their <hi>Fitneſs</hi> in the whole to promote our True Happineſs. — And the <hi>Obligation</hi> we are under to practice accordingly is two fold, <hi>Internal</hi> &amp; <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>External</hi> &amp; <hi>Moral.</hi> The <hi>Internal</hi> &amp; <hi>Natural Obligation</hi> we are under to the practice of Vertue is that great Law of our Nature, whereby we are Obliged to ſeek our own Preſervation and Happineſs. — And the <hi>External</hi> &amp; <hi>Moral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> is the Conſideration that it is the Will &amp; Law of a Superior to whom we are Accountable. —And this is either <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> — The <hi>Political Obligation</hi> is the Conſideration that it is the Public Will, or the Law of the Society to which we belong. — And the <hi>Religious Obligation,</hi> which is here eſpecially to be regarded, is the Conſideration that it is the Will and Law of GOD concerning us, to whom we are Accountable for all our Behaviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ETHICS,</hi> therefore, or true <hi>Morality</hi> conſiſts in the Practice of whatſoever is neceſſary to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Obedience to the Will of GOD: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it muſt preſcribe all the Rules of upright and vertuous Behaviour in all the Relations wherein we ſtand, whether with regard to <hi>GOD,</hi> our <hi>Selves,</hi> or our <hi>Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">[1] With regard to our <hi>Selves.</hi> That we live anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Dignity of our Rational &amp; Immortal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005220_0028_1016E6C8CE221290"/>
by governing our Reaſon, and our Appetites &amp; Paſſions, whether Concupiſcible or Iraſcible, according to the Rules of <hi>Prudence, Temperance</hi> &amp; <hi>Fortitude,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">[2] With reſpect to <hi>GOD,</hi> our Creator, Preſerver and Governour; That we Contemplate &amp; Love Him above all things; Truſt in his Infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs; Reſign our Selves intirely to his holy Will &amp; Pleaſure; Worſhip his Adorable Majeſty, and Imitate all his Moral Perfections, according to the Precepts of true <hi>Religion</hi> &amp; <hi>Piety.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="3">[3] With reſpect to <hi>our Neighbours;</hi> i. e. Other created Spirits like our ſelves, all being conſidered as a Syſtem of Rational Creatures, equally related to GOD as our common Father and Lord, and to one another as Brethren and Fellow ſervants; That we <hi>Love them as our ſelves,</hi> and render to every one his Due; That we do no wrong to any one, but that we ſpeak the Truth, and do all that is Juſt and Right and Faithful, and all that is Friendly, Kind and Merciful to every one, as we have opportunity, according to the Laws of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> in all the various Branches of them. — And in all theſe conſiſts the higheſt Perfection &amp; Happineſs of the Rational Nature conſidered as a <hi>Moral Syſtem</hi> in general.
