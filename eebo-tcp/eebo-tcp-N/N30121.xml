            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Salus Populi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which end under the Engliſh OEconomy Judges and Juries are appointed: To Hear, Try, and finally to do impartial Juſtice to all Perſons whatſoever: and may all Judges who ſhall fail in their Duty through Bribery or Deſign meet with a juſt Puniſhment, not inferior to what befel thoſe unhappy Wretches (once the happy Favourites of ſome of our greateſt Kings) who are Hung up in Terrorem (as by the following Sheets will appear) that others may hear and fear and do no more ſo wickedly, leſt an equal if not a worſe Puniſhment be Executed upon them.</p>
            <p>It's very <hi>Terrible</hi> when <hi>LION</hi>-like Judges appear upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Benches, who neglect the <hi>Law</hi> and act generally by the Power of their own <hi>Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtitution</hi> muſt certainly when it ſo happens (and ſuch Judges Male Adminiſtration paſs with Impunity) be in the utmoſt Danger; it's therefore thought nothing would be more acceptable to the Publick than <hi>The Triumphs of Juſtice over Unjuſt Judges;</hi> and as it is for the Information of all, ſo it is hop'd, it will be a Warning to all, eſpecially Civil Officers; for which purpoſe the diſmal Narrative of the deadly Cataſtrophy of ſo many <hi>Britiſh</hi> Judges is Reprinted.</p>

            <p>How odious this Vice is, to <hi>God and Man,</hi> as being equally deſtructive to Religion, and Humane Society; and how ſeverely it has been heretofore puniſhed, by both, may appear by The Enſuing Examples.</p>

Mic. 7.2, 3, &amp; 4 ver. with many of the like Texts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As corrupt Judges are thus obnoxious to the <hi>Curſe of God,</hi> ſo hath his Divine Providence not ſeldome Executed it upon them even in this world by the hands of <hi>men.</hi> Nor indeed is there any thing that can render <hi>Kings</hi> (Gods Vicegerents) more <hi>Glorious,</hi> or better eſtabliſh any <hi>ſtate,</hi> than to keep the Current of <hi>Juſtice</hi> clear and unfullied; and exemplarily to puniſh their Subordinate <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Judges</hi> that ſhall preſume to <hi>impoiſon</hi> that Sacred <hi>Fountain.</hi>

            <p>Several Heathen Princes are Renowned for this wholeſom ſeverity. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, that he had ſuch an averſion and abhorrence of unjuſt Judges, that at the very ſight of them he would vomit <hi>Choler,</hi> and was ready with his fingers to <hi>pluck out their eyes.

            <p>The reaſon of the Judgment is entred in the Roll in theſe words — <hi>Quia praedictus Willielmus Thorpe qui Sacramentum Domini Regis erga populum ſuum habuit ad Cuſtodiendum, fregit malitioſe, falſe &amp; Rebelliter quantum in ipſo fuit.

            </p>
            <p>And ſo much did the then Collective Wiſdom of the Nation reſpect Judges herein, that 'tis expreſly entred, that this Judgment ſhould not be drawn into example againſt any other Officers who ſhould break their Oaths, but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, <hi>Qui predictum Sacramentum ſecerunt et fregerunt, et habent Leges Angliae ad Cuſtodiendum.</hi> That is, only to the Judges that violate their Oaths, having the Laws of <hi>England</hi> Entruſted unto them.</p>

Which Caſe, I humbly conceive, reſolves the Caſe in Law <hi>Point Blank</hi> thus: <hi>That it is death for any Judge wittingly to break his Oath in any part of it.</hi> This Oath of <hi>Thorp</hi> is entred in the <hi>Roll,</hi> and is the ſame <hi>verbatim,</hi> with the Judges Oath in 18 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.

            <p>The Oaths of our Judges of <hi>England,</hi> as they bind them to the <hi>due Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice to the Subject, according to the Laws,</hi> (which are every <hi>Free-mans</hi> Birth-Right) ſo alſo, as they be of the Kings Council, they are by ſuch their Oaths oblig'd, <hi>lawfully to counſel him,</hi> that is, whenever their opinions are demanded, they are ſworn and bound to deliver them <hi>according to the Law.</hi> — Let us ſee how our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> reſented theſe matters.</p>
            <p>In a Parliament held in the 11<hi>th</hi> year of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. there was Judgment of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> given againſt 18 ſeveral Perſons, and all, ſave one of them, of Eminent Rank; Three Privy Counſellors, <hi>viz</hi> The <hi>Arch Biſhop of York,</hi> The <hi>Duke of Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Earl of Suffolk,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop of Exeter,</hi> the <hi>Kings Confeſſor, Five Knights,</hi> of whom ſome had been Servants to <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. and all, but one, Servants to the then King, and ſome of them of Noble Deſcent; but that

which I more particularly obſerve, there were amongſt them Six <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Locton</hi> the Kings <hi>Serjeant at Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Blake</hi> of the Kings <hi>Council at Law,</hi> and <hi>Usk</hi> the under <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe 18, 8 were Executed, that is, Sir <hi>Robert Treſilian,</hi> the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> was drawn from the <hi>Tower,</hi> through the midſt of <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there <hi>Hanged;</hi> ſo likewiſe were <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Three, that is, the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> died miſerable Fugitives in foreign Parts.</p>
            <p>The other ſeven (whereof five were <hi>Judges</hi>) with much ado got a Pardon as to Life, but were baniſhed, and their Lands and Goods all forfeited; and it was made Felony for any to procure their Recalling home, and themſelves forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be executed as Traytors, if at any time they ſhould preſume to return.</p>
            <p>And of theſe eighteen Perſons, all ſave three were impeached by the <hi>Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Offences</hi> which procured theſe <hi>Exemplary Puniſhments,</hi> were briefly theſe:</p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> the II. being an unthinking diſſolute Prince, by the ill counſel of ſome near his Perſon, there had during his minority happened divers miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in the Government: To redreſs which, in a Parliament holden in the tenth year of his Reign, and the twentieth of his Age, a Commiſſion was awarded to <hi>Twelve Peers,</hi> and others of greateſt Wiſdom and Ability, impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to inſpect the paſt management of the <hi>Houſhold,</hi> the <hi>Revenue,</hi> the <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> and in a word, all things that did concern the Good of the <hi>Realm;</hi> with full power finally to determine, and put all things in execution, ſo as might moſt tend to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>King, Relief</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi> which <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was to endure only one year.</p>
            <p>Now come five of the Perſons above named, <hi>viz</hi> the Arch-biſhop, the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Chief <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Brembre,</hi> who ſeeing themſelves like to be called to Account for their pernicious Counſels and Irregularities, and to be brought to deſerved ſhame and puniſhment; to avoid the ſame, and continue their Villanies for the future, they inſinuated to the King, <hi>That this Commiſſion intrenched upon the Royal Power, and was derogatory to the Crown, that the procu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers thereof had extorted His Royal Aſſent thereunto in Parliament;</hi> and <hi>that this was Treaſon</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo the Chief <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> the Kings Council, who was adviſed withal in the <hi>Writ,</hi> declared it to be; whereupon <hi>Blake</hi> was commanded to prepare an Indictment of Treaſon againſt all the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and againſt ſuch others as had been moſt active in procuring that Authority: Accordingly he draws the Indictment which ſtands entred in the Roll, and is to this effect, <hi>That the ſaid Commiſſioners, &amp;c. had Traiterouſly conſpired among themſelves to make this Commiſſion by Authority of Parliament againſt the Royalty of the King, to his diſheriſon, and in derogation of the Crown, and that they forced the Kings Conſent, and confederated themſelves to maintain one another in ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was deſigned that they ſhould be tryed upon this Indictment in <hi>Middleſex</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> and therefore (ſome of the parties to be proſecuted not being Peers)
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040005_0013_1015BECE4D8C79B0"/>
               <hi>Usk</hi> the Under-Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex</hi> was acquainted with the buſineſs, (who was to return a Pack'd Jury (you ſee that's a very old <hi>Game</hi>) that might be ſure to do the buſineſs, which he performing accordingly, was therefore <hi>hang'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, the five grand <hi>Favourites,</hi> that the King might the more confide in their Counſels, (for ſo are the words of the <hi>Record</hi>) and that under colour of Law, they might cover their malice from the King and the Kingdom, before the Trials were to be brought on, adviſe the King to demand the Opinion of ſome of the <hi>Judges,</hi> that is, of the two <hi>Chief Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Chief Baron,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> ſix in all in number, and of <hi>Locton</hi> the <hi>Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant; Blake,</hi> of the <hi>Kings Council at Law,</hi> was commanded to draw up thoſe <hi>Queſtions,</hi> who did it accordingly, and for <hi>drawing</hi> the ſame, and the before-mentioned Indictment, he was himſelf <hi>Drawn</hi> and <hi>Hanged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Queſtions</hi> being prepared in Writing, the <hi>Judges</hi> were ſent for to <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham Caſtle,</hi> where in the Kings own Preſence, they were commanded upon their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to deliver their Opinions,

                  <item>2. <hi>Whether the perſwading and urging the King to conſent thereunto in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was Treaſon</hi>? They anſwered, <hi>That it was.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Here were other <hi>Queſtions</hi> ask'd, but theſe were the Main, and <hi>thoſe for which they were condemned,</hi> as appears by the Replication of the <hi>Commons</hi> to the <hi>Judges Anſwer,</hi> and by the Words of the <hi>Judgment — That they the ſaid</hi> Judges <hi>knew that this Commiſſion was awarded in Parliament, &amp;c that it was for the Publick Good; That they knew of the Traiterous Intent to deſtroy the Procurers of this Commiſſion; That they knew the Law, and that it was not Treaſon, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſuch Opinions thereby, under colour of Law, to cover their Treaſonable Intent,</hi> and therefore Judgment of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> was given againſt them, and againſt <hi>Locton</hi> the Kings <hi>Serjeant,</hi> who had Subſcribed theſe Falſe Opinions with the <hi>Judges.</hi> And though there be other Articles againſt the <hi>Reſt,</hi> yet this alone is adjudged <hi>Treaſon,</hi> in the ſeveral <hi>Judgments</hi> againſt every one of the Eighteen: And 'tis obſervable, <hi>That in all theſe Judgments, they are adjudged Traitors as well againſt the Perſon of the King, as againſt the Common-wealth</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is there declared upon great Advice taken, <hi>That in Treaſons which concern the King and Kingdom, they are not bound to proceed according to the Rules of the Common Law, but according to the Courſe of Parliaments, ſo as may be for the Common Good.</hi> Nor were theſe <hi>Judgments</hi> huddled up in haſte, but given upon long and mature Deliberation, <hi>the Work of a Whole Parliament.</hi> And it is declared in the <hi>Roll, That they ſpent long time, and took great pains in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the Evidence,</hi> the better thereby to ſatisfy their own Conſciences and the World. Their Proceedings againſt the five Plotters were begun the 14 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and the <hi>Judgments</hi> were not given till the 15 of <hi>Feb.</hi> following, which is a <hi>Quarter</hi> of a <hi>Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis alſo to be obſerved, <hi>That ſeveral of theſe Judges were very unwilling to give their</hi> Corrupt Opinions, <hi>but were</hi> menaced <hi>and</hi> violently <hi>drawn thereunto by

the Duke of</hi> Ireland <hi>and others.</hi> And at their <hi>Trials,</hi> they ſeverally Alledged, <hi>That in part</hi> Violence <hi>had been offered to their Perſons, becauſe they had deferred the delivery of their Opinions.</hi> But as <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Cowardice</hi> is no <hi>Plea</hi> for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the <hi>Forts</hi> or <hi>Bulwarks</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſo neither is it for <hi>baſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying our Rights and Liberties.</hi> Theſe Allegations of being <hi>threatned from their Duty,</hi> could not excuſe them from the <hi>Rope:</hi> but how much more then do they deſerve it who ſhall preſume to do as bad things or <hi>worſe,</hi> without any <hi>Menaces</hi> at all, but wilfully and preſumptuouſly, purely out of their own baſe inclinations?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Treſilian</hi> was not the only Judge which our <hi>Engliſh Hiſtory,</hi> even ſince the Conqueſt, mentions to have been executed for irregular Practices: For in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, a <hi>Wiſe</hi> but <hi>Avaritious</hi> Prince, there were two Gentlemen of the Long Robe, that for private Intereſt, and to ſerve the Kings preſent <hi>Turn,</hi> were ready to diſpenſe with their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and the known Fundamental Laws.

            <p>Their <hi>Names</hi> were Sir <hi>Richard Empſon</hi> Knight, and <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> both (ſaith Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> fol. 247) <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and both of them <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> throughout <hi>England: Dudley</hi> of a good Family, but <hi>Empſon</hi> the Son of a <hi>Sieve-maker:</hi> So true is that Remark of the <hi>Poet;</hi>

            <p>KING <hi>Charles the Firſt</hi> came to the Crown 27 <hi>March,</hi> 1625. In the <hi>Three Firſt</hi> Years of His Reign, he call'd <hi>Three ſeveral Parliaments;</hi> but none of them Complying to give ſo much <hi>Money,</hi> as was Expected: But rather inſiſting upon Complaints againſt <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the then Grand <hi>Favourite,</hi> and to have <hi>Publick Grievances</hi> Redreſſed, They were all <hi>Diſſolved</hi> in Diſcontent; and no more <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſpoken of, till that of the <hi>Thirteenth of April,</hi> 1640 (which was likewiſe ſuddenly <hi>Diſſolved.</hi>) During this long Interval, or Abſence of thoſe whom the Laws had Entruſted with Keeping the <hi>Right Keys</hi> of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Purſe,</hi> there were ſome that would needs be Tampering to <hi>Pick</hi> it; I

mean, ſeveral <hi>little Intrigues</hi> were ſet on Foot, to Supply the <hi>Court,</hi> and get <hi>Money</hi> from the Subjects, without their <hi>Common Conſent</hi> in <hi>Parliament;</hi> (that good Old Courſe, which <hi>Never Fail'd</hi> any <hi>KING,</hi> upon any Juſt Occaſion, or where they knew it ſhould not be diverted to the <hi>KING</hi>'s Diſhonor, and the Nations further Grievance) Of this kind were, 1. The Privy Seals iſſued. 2. Benevolence required. 3. Commiſſions of Loan. 4. The Buſineſs of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; whereby all perſons Seiz'd of Lands and Rents of <hi>Forty Pounds per Annum,</hi> or upwards, were by Proclamation Summon'd, either to appear, and take upon them the Degree of Knighthood, or elſe were liable to be Fined for Reſpite of the ſame.

            </p>
            <p>But all this was ſtill thought too little: Theſe <hi>Devices</hi> might ſerve for a preſent <hi>Shift,</hi> once, and no more; but there wanted a <hi>Continual Fund,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Supply,</hi> as oft as the <hi>Court</hi> wanted, or tho't fit to require Money, without being beholden to Parliaments. Whereupon, 5<hi>ly.</hi> By the fatal Advice (as 'tis ſaid) of <hi>Noy,</hi> the then Attorney General, the King was put upon this Project of raiſing Money, by Iſſuing out Writs, Commanding his Subjects to be Rated, and Aſſeſſed in ſuch and ſuch Sums, for Building, and Equipping of <hi>Ships,</hi> for the publick Defence of the Kingdom: Which the ſaid Attorney perſwaded his Majeſty might be Juſtified by antient Precedents. In purſuance hereof, the King in the <hi>Ninth</hi> Year of his Reign, Iſſued out certain Writs of that kind, to the <hi>Sea-Ports,</hi> and <hi>Maritine</hi>-Parts of the Realm: And finding (for the moſt part) a punctual Obedience, and good Advantage thereby; it was in ſhort time after, adviſed to Extend the ſame Charge to all the <hi>Counties</hi> of this Realm, though never ſo remote from the Seas; wherein, meeting with ſome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to pay, as Conceiving the ſame Unlawful, the Judges (who by their <hi>Oaths,</hi> are the Kings proper Counſellors in all difficulties concerning the Law) were to be Conſulted with.

Attempts to take from us the Dominion of the Seas; of which we are ſole Lord, and Right Owner, and Proprietor; and the Loſs whereof, would be of greateſt Danger and Peril to this Kingdom, and other our Dominions, &amp; many other ways. We for the avoiding of theſe, and the like Dangers; well Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our ſelf, that where the Good, and Safety of the Kingdom in general is concern'd, and the whole Kingdom in Danger, there the Charge, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ought to be Borne by all the Realm in general, did for the preventing ſo publick a Miſchief, reſolve with our ſelf, to have a Royal Navy prepared, that might be of Force and Power (with Almighty GOD's Bleſſing and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance) to Protect, and Defend this our Realm, and our Subjects therein, from all ſuch Perils and Dangers: And for that purpoſe, we Iſſued forth Writs under our great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> Directed to all our Sheriffs of our ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> Commanding thereby all our ſaid Subjects in every City, Town, and Village, to provide ſuch a Number of Ships well-furniſht, as might ſerve for this Royal Purpoſe; and which might be done with the greateſt Equality that could be. In performance whereof, though generally throughout all the Counties of this our Realm, we have found in our Subjects, great Chearfulneſs, and Alacrity; which we Graciouſly Interpret as a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as well of their Dutiful Affection to us, and our Service, as of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they have to the Publick, which well becometh every good Subject.

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:040005_0023_1015BEE780FB24F8"/>Having thus got the Buſineſs <hi>back't</hi> with the <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> of all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the ſame were <hi>Enrolled</hi> in all the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> And now, they began to Proſecute briskly, all the <hi>Defaulters;</hi> amongſt whom, the Chiefeſt was <hi>John Hampden</hi> of <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> Eſquire, who had upon one of theſe Ship. Writs directed to the Sheriff of that County, been Aſſeſſed <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> for his Lands in <hi>Stoke-Mandevil,</hi> in that County; which not being paid, was Certified (amongſt others) into the <hi>Chancery,</hi> upon a Writ of <hi>Certio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari,</hi> Dated 9 <hi>Martii, Anno</hi> 12 <hi>Car.</hi> by a <hi>Schedule</hi> thereunto annexed; and by a Writ of <hi>Mittimus, Teſte</hi> 5 <hi>Maii,</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> tranſmitted into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> with a Command there, to do for the Levying of the Sums ſo Aſſeſſed and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid; <hi>Prout de Jure, &amp; ſecundum, Legem Regni noſtri</hi> Angliae <hi>fuerit faciendum; So as of Right, and according to the Law of our Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>was to be done:</hi> whereupon a <hi>Scire Facius</hi> iſſued out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> reciting the ſaid Writs, to warn Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> (amongſt others) to ſhew Cauſe, why he ſhould not be Charged with this Money.

            <p>This being a <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>General Caſe,</hi> the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> deſired the Aſſiſtance of the reſt of the <hi>Judges,</hi> who did Joyn accordingly. The Caſe was argued, firſt, by Counſel on both Sides; and next, by the <hi>Judges</hi> ſeverally; of whom, Sir <hi>Richard Hutton,</hi> Knight, one of the Judges of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Crook,</hi> Knight, one of the Judges of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> in large and learned Arguments, (ſince Printed) did ſhew the <hi>Illegality</hi> of ſuch Writs, and gave their Opinion; <hi>That the Defendant</hi> Hampden, <hi>ought not to be Charged.</hi> But the reſt of the <hi>Judges</hi> were reſolved to carry the Point for the <hi>King:</hi> and accordingly gave their Opinions, <hi>That the Defendant ought to be Charged.</hi> And then, it was the Part of the <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to give <hi>Judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore, it is conſidered by the ſaid Barons, That the ſaid</hi> John Hampden <hi>ſhall be Charged, and ſhall ſatisfy the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Judgment</hi> was impoſed, as ſuch an <hi>Infallible Determination</hi> of the Law in this Caſe, that no further Diſpute would be allow'd thereof to any others; inſomuch, that a Perſon of Honour, having a Caſe depending in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> was denyed any Argument or Debate, concerning the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Ship-Money,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:040005_0024_1015BEE97AE4ACE8"/>
for no other Reaſon, but that it had been by the former <hi>Judgment,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided already in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps be ſaid: <hi>This Impoſition of</hi> Ship Money <hi>was</hi> ſmall <hi>and</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; <hi>Mr.</hi> Hampden, <hi>a Gentleman of a fair Eſtate, was Aſſeſſed but</hi> Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings: <hi>And, Why ſhould any Body ſcruple ſuch a petty Buſineſs, when the</hi> King <hi>Commanded it? Was not the</hi> Redemy <hi>far worſe than the</hi> Diſeaſe? <hi>Why ſhould any Subject exſpend a great deal of Money in Law, to avoid Payment of ſo</hi> Trivial <hi>a Sum? Or, What Harm could accrue to the</hi> Publick, <hi>by the</hi> Judges <hi>allowing the</hi> King <hi>Power to Impoſe ſuch an Aſſeſsment, when it was for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Realm from</hi> Eminent <hi>and</hi> Imminent <hi>Danger, and he exerted that Power ſo favourably,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to ſuch <hi>Objections,</hi> it muſt be ſaid; That true it is, it was then only Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi>'s Caſe; but the whole Nation, every individual Subject of <hi>England,</hi> was concern'd in it: nay, ſo far concern'd, that all his Eſtate and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was therein given up. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> was not <hi>Quantum,</hi> but <hi>Quo Jure</hi>? If Publick Danger might give the <hi>King</hi> Title to lay Impoſitions without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and He alone were <hi>Judge</hi> of ſuch Danger, When might it not be alledged? If <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> were Aſſeſſed on Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> that Year, How did it appear, but <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> might be required the next, and <hi>Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi> the Year following? And, What Uſe, what Occaſion would the <hi>Court</hi> have had for ever afterwards of a <hi>Parliament</hi>? But as to the <hi>Illegality</hi> of theſe <hi>Ship Writs,</hi> I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to Judge <hi>Crook's Argument;</hi> where the ſame is Demonſtrated to be againſt the <hi>Common Law,</hi> againſt divers <hi>Statutes,</hi> not to be maintain'd by any <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or Power Royal, unwarrantable by any former <hi>Precedents,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee then, what were the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of theſe <hi>Extra judicial</hi> Opinions, and this <hi>Illegal</hi> Judgment of the <hi>Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the <hi>King:</hi> They thereby miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led him (as much as in them lay) to Diſcompoſe the Harmony of <hi>Government;</hi> to Entrench upon the <hi>Property</hi> of His Subjects; and (contrary to his Intentions) by Colour of Right, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Laws, which, do doubt, that <hi>Good Prince</hi> meant to have preſerv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Subjects:</hi> They were not only hereby Injured, but their <hi>Affections Alienated</hi> from their Sovereign; which to occaſion, is to doubt a very High (becauſe almoſt Irreparable) <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Genuine Senſe of theſe <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> being no leſs than this; That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>often</hi> as Himſelf pleaſeth, may declare the Kingdom to be in Danger, and that ſo often, His Majeſty, for Prevention of ſuch Dangers, may, by His Writ under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> alter the <hi>Property</hi> of the Subjects Goods, without their Conſent in <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that in <hi>ſuch Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as His Majeſty ſhall think fit: And beſides, may deprive them of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their Perſons, and that in ſuch Manner as Himſelf ſhall pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the <hi>Judges</hi> themſelves: It prov'd deſervedly <hi>Fatal;</hi> For no ſooner was a <hi>Parliament</hi> Call'd, but they were call'd to Account for theſe their Illegal Opinions and Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:040005_0025_1015BEEBC47D1BE0"/>And after a long Debate, on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1640 theſe <hi>Four</hi> ſeveral <hi>Votes</hi> Paſſed upon them, without ſo much as <hi>One Negative Voice</hi> to any of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>THat the Charge impoſed upon the Subjects, for the Providing and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of Ships; and the Aſſeſsments for Raiſing of Money for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, commonly called Ship-Money, are againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Right of Property, and contrary to former Reſolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Extrajudicial Opinions of the Judges, Publiſhed in the</hi> Star-Chamber, <hi>and Inrolled in Courts as</hi> Weſtminſter (<hi>before Recited) in the whole, and in every part of them are againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Reſolutions in Parliament; and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the writ to the Sheriff of</hi> Bucks <hi>(particularly Recited) and the other Writs, commonly called Ship-Writs; are againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Judgment in Mr.</hi> Hampden's <hi>Caſe (as before Recited) in the matter and ſubſtance thereof; and in that it was conceived that Mr.</hi> Hampden <hi>was any way Chargeable, is againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Reſolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Votes</hi> being Tranſmitted by the <hi>Commons</hi> to the <hi>Houſe of Lords;</hi> Their Lordſhips did Concur therein. And on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 26. of <hi>February,</hi> 1640. It was Ordered by the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> in the High <hi>Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> Aſſembled; That the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> or <hi>Maſter of the Rolls,</hi> the <hi>Two</hi> Lord <hi>Chief Juſtices,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Chief Baron;</hi> and likewiſe the <hi>Chief Clerk of the Star-Chamber,</hi> ſhould bring into the Upper <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of the Judgment againſt Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> concerning <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> in each of thoſe ſeveral Courts, and that a <hi>Vacat</hi> thereof ſhould be made. And that a Copy of the Judgment of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning the <hi>Illegality</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhould be Delivered to the ſeveral <hi>Judges of Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e;</hi> and that they ſhould be required to Publiſh the ſame in all the <hi>Circuits.</hi> Which on the 27. of the ſame <hi>February,</hi> was done accordingly: the ſaid <hi>Records</hi> being <hi>Vacated,</hi> and the <hi>Rolls</hi> Croſs'd with a Pen in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and Subſcribed with the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Parliament's</hi> Hand.</p>
            <p>And ſoon after, ſeveral of the before-named Judges were <hi>Impeached</hi> for the ſame in <hi>Parliament:</hi> And not daring to ſtand the <hi>Shock,</hi> ſome of them, as the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice Finch,</hi> Fled beyond the Seas; and <hi>others</hi> Abſconded. And ſoon after, came on the Unnatural <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> ſo Deſtructive to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> which, though no way Juſtifiable, yet it cannot be denied; but they were not a little <hi>Occaſion'd,</hi> and the Animoſities of the People, blown into an

Untameable <hi>Flame,</hi> by theſe baſe Traiterous Proceedings of thoſe <hi>Sycophant Judges.</hi> And <hi>Woe unto thoſe</hi> (ſay Sacred <hi>Oracles) by whom Offences come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, after ſo many diſmal Experiences, and fair Warnings, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of His preſent Majeſty, our Gracious Soveraign (whom <hi>God</hi> long Preſerve) a <hi>Prince</hi> of Incomparable Lenity, and Good-natur'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Example; it might be hoped, that none, Preferr'd to the <hi>Publick Seats of Juſtice,</hi> durſt to have Acted ſo contrary to His Royal Inclinations, as to violate thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> which He Himſelf has <hi>Sworn</hi> to Maintain, and Intruſted them to <hi>Adminiſter:</hi> Yet ſo Baſe and Extravagant are ſome, as even to abuſe the Favours of the <hi>Beſt of Princes,</hi> and pufft up with Preferment, will take no Admonition from the Falls of their <hi>Head-ſtrong</hi> Predeceſſors; but ſtill preſume to fully thoſe <hi>Ermins,</hi> (the <hi>Emblems</hi> of <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>) which they wear, and adventure on the ſame Deſtructive Precipices.</p>
            <p>You have heard, how heinouſly our Prudent Anceſtors reſented the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> (though by an Act) in Tryals of the Free-born People of <hi>England</hi> WITHOUT JURIES. Next to which, is the <hi>Ruffling, Hectoring,</hi> and <hi>Over-awing</hi> of <hi>Juries:</hi> For, What real Difference is there, betwixt allowing no <hi>Juries</hi> at all, and <hi>Menacing</hi> them into a Compliance (contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> and their own <hi>Conſciences</hi>) with the Corrupt Humours, and Time-ſerving Intereſts of ill Judges? Of this Crime, the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice Keeling,</hi> about the Year 1666. (a Time when <hi>God</hi>'s General Judgments on this Sinful Land, might have awakened them to greater Circumſpection and Uprightneſs) was not only Guilty, but Queſtion'd for the ſame, even by <hi>That</hi> very <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was never extraordinarily Celebrated for bringing <hi>Publick Vermine</hi> to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet ſuch a Senſe they had of theſe ill Practiſes, that in their <hi>Journal,</hi> we find the following <hi>Votes</hi> on this Occaſion.</p>

            <p>This well contrived, neceſſary <hi>Oath,</hi> preſcribed by the Prudence of our Fore-Fathers, would bear a large <hi>Comment;</hi> but we muſt haſten, and ſhall only remark:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they Swear, <hi>Well and Truly</hi> (that is, <hi>Uprightly,</hi> and according to <hi>Law) to Serve the</hi> King, <hi>and his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they ſhall do <hi>Equal Right, and Execution of Law, to all the</hi> King's <hi>Subjects, Rich and Poor;</hi> (that is, without <hi>Partiality, Favour, Malice,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Juſtice</hi> is Pictured <hi>Blind</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Subject,</hi> not the <hi>Object:</hi> She has a <hi>Ballance,</hi> not to weigh <hi>Gold,</hi> but the <hi>Crime:</hi> She has regard to <hi>Offences,</hi> not <hi>Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That if any <hi>Letters from the King</hi> (unduly obtain'd, for ſo all ſuch are ſuppoſed to be) ſhall be brought to them, <hi>contrary to Law,</hi> they are not to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:040005_0029_1015BEF7A20DAE90"/>
regard them; much leſs are they to value any <hi>Verbal</hi> Commands, or little <hi>Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kally Inſinuations</hi> of any <hi>Court Favourites,</hi> huſſing <hi>Grandeos,</hi> or ſmall <hi>Minions</hi> of State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That by this their <hi>Oath, Judges</hi> are to proceed according to <hi>Law;</hi> their Buſineſs is <hi>Jus Dicere,</hi> to Declare and Adminiſter the Laws Eſtabliſh'd; not <hi>Jus Dare,</hi> to Impoſe their own Whimſical, Arbitrary, <hi>Peeviſh,</hi> or Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Opinions, for <hi>Law;</hi> or to Uſurp a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power, ſo as deliver that to be Law, which in truth is not ſo. And if they ſhall preſume to offend here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they are <hi>Exemplarily</hi> to be puniſhed: For ſince 'tis a known <hi>Maxim</hi> of Law, <hi>Ignorantia Juris non excuſat, That Ignorance of the Law ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe no Man;</hi> (The Reaſon of which, is, becauſe every Man a ſuppoſed to be <hi>Privy,</hi> and conſenting to all our Laws, by his <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.)</hi> How much leſs are <hi>Judges</hi> (whoſe <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> it is to Underſtand the Law; and therefore, muſt take Notice of it, at their <hi>Peril</hi>) to be Indulg'd? Under what Character will they plead Excuſe? Are they Perſons of known <hi>Learning,</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Natural Parts,</hi> great <hi>Reading,</hi> exquiſite <hi>Eloquence, &amp;c</hi>? All this but <hi>aggravates</hi> their Fault, that they ſhould abuſe ſuch good Gifts, to the Diſhonour of the <hi>King</hi> that Commiſſions them, and Prejudice of His <hi>People</hi> that expected more exact Dealings from ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Accompliſhments. Will they ſhelter themſelves under the before-mentioned <hi>Plea</hi> of <hi>Ignorance</hi>? This is already ſhewn to be an Invalid Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and beſides, 'tis a Reflection on that <hi>Royal Power</hi> that Preferr'd them: And, What infinite Miſchiefs (of which there is no Particular <hi>Complaint</hi> or <hi>Information</hi>) may the Subjects ſuffer in their <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> under ſuch <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which is always attended with Equal <hi>Preſumption</hi>? Or, <hi>laſtly,</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhould be offered in their Favour, That for ſome time, at firſt, they were <hi>Upright,</hi> and have had the Reputation of Prudence and Integrity, in all Caſes, except <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch:</hi> for which NOW they are queſtioned: To this it may be fitly Anſwer'd, (as he of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Athenians</hi>) If they carryed themſelves <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll,</hi> when Time was, and now <hi>Ill,</hi> they deſerve a <hi>Double</hi> Puniſhment; becauſe they are not <hi>Good,</hi> as they <hi>were:</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>Evil,</hi> as they <hi>were not.</hi> The <hi>Judges,</hi> 'tis true, are declared in the <hi>Parliament-Roll</hi> of the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. to be <hi>Executors</hi> of the <hi>Statutes,</hi> Judgments, and Ordinances of <hi>Parliament:</hi> But they muſt not make themſelves the <hi>Executioners</hi> of them too, by endeavouring the Deſtruction of the Fundamentals of our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> whither the Subject is to run for Shelter and Defence: But if the Judges, <hi>Sacerdotes Juſtitiae,</hi> thoſe <hi>Prieſts of Juſtice,</hi> ſhall, like thoſe of <hi>Delphos,</hi> utter <hi>Falſe, Ambiguous,</hi> and <hi>Time-Serving Oracles,</hi> Where is the Comfort of the Poor <hi>Votaries</hi>? Will not this <hi>Sanctuary</hi> then become <hi>Templum ſine Numine,</hi> like that of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> who after he had built it, put no <hi>Gods</hi> into it? We ſhall have the Dead <hi>Killing Letter</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> but not the Quickening, Preſerving <hi>Senſe</hi> of it: The Fabrick and Formalities of the <hi>Temple;</hi> but the <hi>Goddeſs Aſtraea,</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:040005_0030_1015BEFA33748BE0"/>
the <hi>Dii Tutelares,</hi> all that ſhould Conſerve our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> will be vaniſh't: And inſtead thereof, we ſhall have but an <hi>Indian Pa-god,</hi> a frightful, terrible <hi>Idol</hi> of <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> delighting in <hi>Humane Sacrifices,</hi> and only Adorable for Averting that <hi>Miſchief,</hi> with which it threatens us.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Contraria juxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt: Contraries illuſtrate each other.</hi> We have hitherto Treated the <hi>Reader</hi> with <hi>Doleſome Narratives</hi> of <hi>Lewd Judges:</hi> Let us now (briefly) Entertain him with an Account of ſome <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Imitable</hi> Ones; <hi>Memoria Juſti in Aeternum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>H.</hi> 4 His Son and Heir apparent (then a <hi>Wild Youth,</hi> but afterwards as Solid, and Renowned a King, as moſt that have ſway'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter) hearing that one of his Companions was Arraigned for Felony before the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> (I am ſorry my narrow Reading has not brought me acquainted with his Honourable Name) came to the Bar, and offered to take away the <hi>Priſoner</hi> by force; but being withſtood by the ſaid Chief Juſtice, ſtepped to him, and <hi>Struck</hi> him over the Face; whereat the Judge nothing daunted, roſe up, and with a <hi>Gravity</hi> becoming his Dignity, told him, That he did not this Affront to <hi>Him,</hi> but to the King his <hi>Father,</hi> in whoſe Place he ſate; and therefore, forthwith Committed him to Priſon. The Prince <hi>Over-aw'd</hi> with the Majeſty of the <hi>Sage Judge</hi>'s Expreſſions, calmly Suffered himſelf to be carried away by an ordinary <hi>Tip-Staff;</hi> which being told the King, He not a little Rejoyced, both that he had a <hi>Judge</hi> of ſuch Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Integrity; and a <hi>Son</hi> of ſuch Submiſſive Obedience to his Laws, <hi>Vide Baker fol.</hi> 163.</p>
            <p>The Famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having required a <hi>Charge</hi> upon divers of Her Subjects, by particular Letters from the Lords of Her Council, of ſeveral <hi>Sums</hi> of Money, for preſent Aid towards Her Wars in <hi>Ireland;</hi> hearing that one of Her <hi>Judges,</hi> viz, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> being conven'd before the ſaid Lords, for Non Payment thereof, thereby Diſcouraging others; had Anſwered, That it was <hi>Contrary to Law</hi> that the ſame ſhould be Impoſed, there being an Expreſs <hi>Statute</hi> againſt it; which He being a <hi>Judge,</hi> was bound by his Oath, to ſignifie to Her Majeſty, he being (as much as in him lay) a Conſervator of the <hi>Queens Oath</hi> in that behalf; Her Majeſty was much Offended, that any ſuch Impoſition had been pretended to, and Commanded that it ſhould be ſtopped from further <hi>Gathering;</hi> and to ſuch as had paid it, their Money, by Her expreſs Order, was <hi>Reſtored. Judge Crooks Argument</hi> in <hi>Hampden's Caſe,</hi> p. 57.</p>
            <p>In the 29th. of the ſame Queen, Her Majeſty having Erected a New-Office in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> for making of <hi>Superſedeas</hi> on <hi>Exigents,</hi> She Grants it to one <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> Her Servant; ſends to have him admitted, but the Judges delay the doing thereof, On this Reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Prothonotaries,</hi> and <hi>Philizers</hi> Claimed the making thoſe Writs. The Queen ſends a <hi>Sharp</hi> Letter, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them forthwith to Admit him: Then She ſends a more poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, requiring the Reaſon of their <hi>Contempt</hi> and Diſobedience. The Judges return the beforementioned Reaſon to the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:040005_0031_1015BEFCCD010678"/>
(no mean Man in thoſe Days) upon which, the Queen ſends a <hi>Fourth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory</hi> Meſſage for their Admitting him, with this Reaſon: That if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were put out, they were <hi>Rich,</hi> and Able Men, and that Her Courts of Juſtice were <hi>Open,</hi> where they might Demand their Right; for this was not to debar them <hi>Therefrom,</hi> but only to put them to their <hi>Action.</hi> The <hi>Honeſt Judges</hi> returned this Anſwer, That the Queen had taken Her <hi>Oath,</hi> for the due Execution of Juſtice <hi>According to Law,</hi> and they did not doubt, but when Her Majeſty was Informed it was againſt the Law, She would Act therein as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her. For their own parts, they had taken an <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Her,</hi> and the COMMON-WEALTH; And if they ſhould do it without <hi>Proceſs</hi> of Law before them, and only upon Her Command put the others out of Poſſeſſion, though the Right remained to them, it were a Breach of their <hi>Oath;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Fear of <hi>God</hi> were not Sufficient, they told Her the Puniſhment, that was Inflicted upon their <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> for Breach of their Oaths (citing <hi>Thorpe,</hi> &amp;c) might be a ſufficient <hi>Warning</hi> to them: Whereupon the Queen hearing theſe Reaſons, was Satisfied; and the ſaid Judges heard no more of this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>To Deſcend nearer our own Times, we cannot omit that grand Example of <hi>Uprightneſs,</hi> the ever Famous Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> late Lord Chief Juſtice of the King's-Bench; a <hi>Miracle</hi> for all other parts of <hi>Polite</hi> and <hi>Serious</hi> Learning, as well as profound knowledge in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Of whom I ſhall yet, not offer any particular <hi>Inſtances,</hi> ſince his whole Life was one continued Thread of <hi>Sincere, and Underſtanding Juſtice:</hi> For as eaſily you might have juſtled the <hi>Sun</hi> out of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> as to have warp'd him from his conſtant Road of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</hi> An exact <hi>Standard</hi> whereby <hi>Future Princes</hi> may meaſure the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of their <hi>Judges;</hi> for though he were a moſt <hi>Loyal,</hi> and Zealous Servant to the <hi>Crown;</hi> yet he was ſo far from being ever <hi>Impeached</hi> by the <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Body</hi> of the Nation, that no one <hi>Single</hi> Perſon (no not of thoſe that were <hi>Caſt</hi> before him) were ever heard to complain of his Conduct.</p>
            <p>And if any <hi>Latter</hi> Judges have been diſmis'd by falſe Tales of Sycophant <hi>Whiſperers,</hi> or for oppoſing baſe <hi>Illegal Arbitrary Intereſts;</hi> as they have the Invaluable Satisfaction of a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> for their Comfort; ſo they may be aſſured, they ſtill appear more Glorious in the Eyes of all good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men at preſent, and will be Recorded more Venerable to Poſterity, than any <hi>Robes</hi> or Preferment, ſullied with <hi>Bribery, Flattery,</hi> or <hi>Treacherous</hi> Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, could render them.</p>
            <p>However, we hope the <hi>Various Examples,</hi> we have here Enumerated from Authentick <hi>Records,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> may be ſufficient to Deter future <hi>Judges</hi> from Ill Courſes; and ſatisfie all the World, both in the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments late Proceedings in this Caſe, and the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of their <hi>Vote</hi> and intended <hi>Bill,</hi> That <hi>Judges</hi> henceforth ſhould hold their Places, and Salaries, not <hi>Ad Placitum,</hi> but <hi>Quam Diu ſe bene geſſerint.</hi> Which was the principal Aim of theſe Papers. <hi>Fiat Juſtitia.</hi>
