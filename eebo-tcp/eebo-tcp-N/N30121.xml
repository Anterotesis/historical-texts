            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For which end under the Engli≈øh OEconomy Judges and Juries are appointed: To Hear, Try, and finally to do impartial Ju≈øtice to all Per≈øons what≈øoever: and may all Judges who ≈øhall fail in their Duty through Bribery or De≈øign meet with a ju≈øt Puni≈øhment, not inferior to what befel tho≈øe unhappy Wretches (once the happy Favourites of ≈øome of our greate≈øt Kings) who are Hung up in Terrorem (as by the following Sheets will appear) that others may hear and fear and do no more ≈øo wickedly, le≈øt an equal if not a wor≈øe Puni≈øhment be Executed upon them.</p>
            <p>It's very <hi>Terrible</hi> when <hi>LION</hi>-like Judges appear upon <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Benches, who neglect the <hi>Law</hi> and act generally by the Power of their own <hi>Will.</hi>

Baron of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> (who it ≈øeems had been a notable <hi>Bribe-fingerer) four and thirty</hi> Thou≈øand Marks, [<hi>A prodigious Sum almo≈øt</hi> 400 <hi>years ago!</hi>] And Sir <hi>Thomas Wayland</hi> Chief Ju≈øtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> being found the greate≈øt Offender of all, was Attainted of Felony for taking of <hi>Bribes,</hi> and his Lands and Goods Forfeited: as appears in the <hi>Pleas of Parliament,</hi> 18. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. And he was al≈øo Bani≈øht the Kingdom, as unworthy to live in that State again≈øt which he had ≈øo much Offended.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Thorp</hi> Chief Ju≈øtice of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in K. <hi>Edw,</hi> the Third's time, having of five ≈øeveral Per≈øons received five ≈øeveral Bribes, which in all amounted to 100 <hi>l.</hi> was for this alone adjudged to be Hang'd, and all his Goods and Lands Forfeited.</p>
            <p>The rea≈øon of the Judgment is entred in the Roll in the≈øe words ‚Äî <hi>Quia praedictus Willielmus Thorpe qui Sacramentum Domini Regis erga populum ≈øuum habuit ad Cu≈øtodiendum, fregit malitio≈øe, fal≈øe &amp; Rebelliter quantum in ip≈øo fuit.

            </p>
            <p>And ≈øo much did the then Collective Wi≈ødom of the Nation re≈øpect Judges herein, that 'tis expre≈øly entred, that this Judgment ≈øhould not be drawn into example again≈øt any other Officers who ≈øhould break their Oaths, but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt tho≈øe, <hi>Qui predictum Sacramentum ≈øecerunt et fregerunt, et habent Leges Angliae ad Cu≈øtodiendum.</hi> That is, only to the Judges that violate their Oaths, having the Laws of <hi>England</hi> Entru≈øted unto them.</p>

Which Ca≈øe, I humbly conceive, re≈øolves the Ca≈øe in Law <hi>Point Blank</hi> thus: <hi>That it is death for any Judge wittingly to break his Oath in any part of it.</hi> This Oath of <hi>Thorp</hi> is entred in the <hi>Roll,</hi> and is the ≈øame <hi>verbatim,</hi> with the Judges Oath in 18 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.

            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> the II. being an unthinking di≈ø≈øolute Prince, by the ill coun≈øel of ≈øome near his Per≈øon, there had during his minority happened divers mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in the Government: To redre≈øs which, in a Parliament holden in the tenth year of his Reign, and the twentieth of his Age, a Commi≈ø≈øion was awarded to <hi>Twelve Peers,</hi> and others of greate≈øt Wi≈ødom and Ability, impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to in≈øpect the pa≈øt management of the <hi>Hou≈øhold,</hi> the <hi>Revenue,</hi> the <hi>Courts of Ju≈øtice,</hi> and in a word, all things that did concern the Good of the <hi>Realm;</hi> with full power finally to determine, and put all things in execution, ≈øo as might mo≈øt tend to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>King, Relief</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi> which <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion</hi> was to endure only one year.</p>

            <p>It was de≈øigned that they ≈øhould be tryed upon this Indictment in <hi>Middle≈øex</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> and therefore (≈øome of the parties to be pro≈øecuted not being Peers)

In performance whereof, though generally throughout all the Counties of this our Realm, we have found in our Subjects, great Chearfulne≈øs, and Alacrity; which we Graciou≈øly Interpret as a Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as well of their Dutiful Affection to us, and our Service, as of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect they have to the Publick, which well becometh every good Subject.

            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps be ≈øaid: <hi>This Impo≈øition of</hi> Ship Money <hi>was</hi> ≈ømall <hi>and</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable; <hi>Mr.</hi> Hampden, <hi>a Gentleman of a fair E≈øtate, was A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed but</hi> Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings: <hi>And, Why ≈øhould any Body ≈øcruple ≈øuch a petty Bu≈øine≈øs, when the</hi> King <hi>Commanded it?

            <p>In <hi>An≈øwer</hi> to ≈øuch <hi>Objections,</hi> it mu≈øt be ≈øaid; That true it is, it was then only Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi>'s Ca≈øe; but the whole Nation, every individual Subject of <hi>England,</hi> was concern'd in it: nay, ≈øo far concern'd, that all his E≈øtate and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was therein given up.

If Publick Danger might give the <hi>King</hi> Title to lay Impo≈øitions without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and He alone were <hi>Judge</hi> of ≈øuch Danger, When might it not be alledged? If <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> were A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed on Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> that Year, How did it appear, but <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> might be required the next, and <hi>Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Pounds</hi> the Year following? And, What U≈øe, what Occa≈øion would the <hi>Court</hi> have had for ever afterwards of a <hi>Parliament</hi>?

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the <hi>Judges</hi> them≈øelves: It prov'd de≈øervedly <hi>Fatal;</hi> For no ≈øooner was a <hi>Parliament</hi> Call'd, but they were call'd to Account for the≈øe their Illegal Opinions and Judgment.</p>

            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>H.</hi> 4 His Son and Heir apparent (then a <hi>Wild Youth,</hi> but afterwards as Solid, and Renowned a King, as mo≈øt that have ≈øway'd the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Scepter) hearing that one of his Companions was Arraigned for Felony before the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice of <hi>England</hi> (I am ≈øorry my narrow Reading has not brought me acquainted with his Honourable Name) came to the Bar, and offered to take away the <hi>Pri≈øoner</hi> by force; but being with≈øtood by the ≈øaid Chief Ju≈øtice, ≈øtepped to him, and <hi>Struck</hi> him over the Face; whereat the Judge nothing daunted, ro≈øe up, and with a <hi>Gravity</hi> becoming his Dignity, told him, That he did not this Affront to <hi>Him,</hi> but to the King his <hi>Father,</hi> in who≈øe Place he ≈øate; and therefore, forthwith Committed him to Pri≈øon. The Prince <hi>Over-aw'd</hi> with the Maje≈øty of the <hi>Sage Judge</hi>'s Expre≈ø≈øions, calmly Suffered him≈øelf to be carried away by an ordinary <hi>Tip-Staff;</hi> which being told the King, He not a little Rejoyced, both that he had a <hi>Judge</hi> of ≈øuch Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Integrity; and a <hi>Son</hi> of ≈øuch Submi≈ø≈øive Obedience to his Laws, <hi>Vide Baker fol.</hi> 163.</p>
            <p>The Famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having required a <hi>Charge</hi> upon divers of Her Subjects, by particular Letters from the Lords of Her Council, of ≈øeveral <hi>Sums</hi> of Money, for pre≈øent Aid towards Her Wars in <hi>Ireland;</hi> hearing that one of Her <hi>Judges,</hi> viz, Mr. Ju≈øtice <hi>Walme≈øley,</hi> being conven'd before the ≈øaid Lords, for Non Payment thereof, thereby Di≈øcouraging others; had An≈øwered, That it was <hi>Contrary to Law</hi> that the ≈øame ≈øhould be Impo≈øed, there being an Expre≈øs <hi>Statute</hi> again≈øt it; which He being a <hi>Judge,</hi> was bound by his Oath, to ≈øignifie to Her Maje≈øty, he being (as much as in him lay) a Con≈øervator of the <hi>Queens Oath</hi> in that behalf; Her Maje≈øty was much Offended, that any ≈øuch Impo≈øition had been pretended to, and Commanded that it ≈øhould be ≈øtopped from further <hi>Gathering;</hi> and to ≈øuch as had paid it, their Money, by Her expre≈øs Order, was <hi>Re≈øtored. Judge Crooks Argument</hi> in <hi>Hampden's Ca≈øe,</hi> p. 57.</p>
            <p>In the 29th. of the ≈øame Queen, Her Maje≈øty having Erected a New-Office in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> for making of <hi>Super≈øedeas</hi> on <hi>Exigents,</hi> She Grants it to one <hi>Cavendi≈øh</hi> Her Servant; ≈øends to have him admitted, but the Judges delay the doing thereof, On this Rea≈øon, becau≈øe the <hi>Prothonotaries,</hi> and <hi>Philizers</hi> Claimed the making tho≈øe Writs. The Queen ≈øends a <hi>Sharp</hi> Letter, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them forthwith to Admit him: Then She ≈øends a more po≈øitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, requiring the Rea≈øon of their <hi>Contempt</hi> and Di≈øobedience. The Judges return the beforementioned Rea≈øon to the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Leice≈øter</hi>

(no mean Man in tho≈øe Days) upon which, the Queen ≈øends a <hi>Fourth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory</hi> Me≈ø≈øage for their Admitting him, with this Rea≈øon: That if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were put out, they were <hi>Rich,</hi> and Able Men, and that Her Courts of Ju≈øtice were <hi>Open,</hi> where they might Demand their Right; for this was not to debar them <hi>Therefrom,</hi> but only to put them to their <hi>Action.</hi> The <hi>Hone≈øt Judges</hi> returned this An≈øwer, That the Queen had taken Her <hi>Oath,</hi> for the due Execution of Ju≈øtice <hi>According to Law,</hi> and they did not doubt, but when Her Maje≈øty was Informed it was again≈øt the Law, She would Act therein as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her. For their own parts, they had taken an <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Her,</hi> and the COMMON-WEALTH; And if they ≈øhould do it without <hi>Proce≈øs</hi> of Law before them, and only upon Her Command put the others out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, though the Right remained to them, it were a Breach of their <hi>Oath;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Fear of <hi>God</hi> were not Sufficient, they told Her the Puni≈øhment, that was Inflicted upon their <hi>Predece≈ø≈øors</hi> for Breach of their Oaths (citing <hi>Thorpe,</hi> &amp;c) might be a ≈øufficient <hi>Warning</hi> to them: Whereupon the Queen hearing the≈øe Rea≈øons, was Satisfied; and the ≈øaid Judges heard no more of this Bu≈øine≈øs.</p>
            <p>To De≈øcend nearer our own Times, we cannot omit that grand Example of <hi>Uprightne≈øs,</hi> the ever Famous Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> late Lord Chief Ju≈øtice of the King's-Bench; a <hi>Miracle</hi> for all other parts of <hi>Polite</hi> and <hi>Serious</hi> Learning, as well as profound knowledge in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Of whom I ≈øhall yet, not offer any particular <hi>In≈øtances,</hi> ≈øince his whole Life was one continued Thread of <hi>Sincere, and Under≈øtanding Ju≈øtice:</hi> For as ea≈øily you might have ju≈øtled the <hi>Sun</hi> out of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> as to have warp'd him from his con≈øtant Road of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</hi> An exact <hi>Standard</hi> whereby <hi>Future Princes</hi> may mea≈øure the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of their <hi>Judges;</hi> for though he were a mo≈øt <hi>Loyal,</hi> and Zealous Servant to the <hi>Crown;</hi> yet he was ≈øo far from being ever <hi>Impeached</hi> by the <hi>Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Body</hi> of the Nation, that no one <hi>Single</hi> Per≈øon (no not of tho≈øe that were <hi>Ca≈øt</hi> before him) were ever heard to complain of his Conduct.</p>
            <p>And if any <hi>Latter</hi> Judges have been di≈ømis'd by fal≈øe Tales of Sycophant <hi>Whi≈øperers,</hi> or for oppo≈øing ba≈øe <hi>Illegal Arbitrary Intere≈øts;</hi> as they have the Invaluable Satisfaction of a good <hi>Con≈øcience</hi> for their Comfort; ≈øo they may be a≈ø≈øured, they ≈øtill appear more Glorious in the Eyes of all good <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Men at pre≈øent, and will be Recorded more Venerable to Po≈øterity, than any <hi>Robes</hi> or Preferment, ≈øullied with <hi>Bribery, Flattery,</hi> or <hi>Treacherous</hi> Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, could render them.</p>
            <p>However, we hope the <hi>Various Examples,</hi> we have here Enumerated from Authentick <hi>Records,</hi> and <hi>Hi≈øtories,</hi> may be ≈øufficient to Deter future <hi>Judges</hi> from Ill Cour≈øes; and ≈øatisfie all the World, both in the <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments late Proceedings in this Ca≈øe, and the <hi>Rea≈øonablene≈øs</hi> of their <hi>Vote</hi> and intended <hi>Bill,</hi> That <hi>Judges</hi> henceforth ≈øhould hold their Places, and Salaries, not <hi>Ad Placitum,</hi> but <hi>Quam Diu ≈øe bene ge≈ø≈øerint.</hi> Which was the principal Aim of the≈øe Papers. <hi>Fiat Ju≈øtitia.</hi>
