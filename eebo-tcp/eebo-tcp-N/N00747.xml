            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That theſe withdrawings are not from Gods hatred, but his love; they are ready to ſuſpect this, and ſay, as Pſal. 77.7, 8, 9. <hi>will the Lord caſt off for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> but it is their <hi>infirmity, verſe</hi> 10. they think, becauſe he hides himſelf, he loves them not; but indeed he doth therefore ſo hide, becauſe he loveth them. <hi>Zion</hi> thinks that now ſhe is <hi>forgotten and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>; but God aſſures her that it is far
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000901_0031_0FAC9A7AE26C6890"/>
otherwiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14, 15. and God is grieved that his people ſhould think there is any defect or decay in his love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſo carries to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though God love them, yet he may be angry at them, and withdraw in anger. <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but <hi>Anger</hi> is ſubordinated, and may be employed by either of them; there is an anger of love as well as of hatred: A Father hath a dear love for his Child, but he may be very angry at him, and manifeſt it too in ſevere tokens. God can be provoked, ſo as to withdraw from his own; and he ſo declares, Iſa. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet this anger is managed by love, and ſhall work accordingly. Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at his Children ſhall do nothing but what love directs; if then he hides away from them in anger, it is becauſe he ſeeth it is beſt for them: it ſhall not extinguiſh, no, nor diminiſh, no, nor ſo much as intermit the operation of his love towards them, but ſhall always do loves work: when therefore he afflicts, it is in <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> as Pſal. 119.75.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That God may withdraw from his
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000901_0032_0FAC9A7BA3AA7288"/>
people when he is not angry; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have cauſe to be afraid of ſome provocation given, and accordingly to make diligent ſearch: but God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times withdraws from them, when there is no ſpecial provocation given him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Job</hi> had great <hi>deſertions,</hi> as hath been obſerved, and yet God himſelf teſtifieth of him, that there was <hi>none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man,</hi> Job 1.8. and the Church could ſay, in Pſal. 44.17. <hi>all this is come upon us, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That there is ever ſomething in the condition of his people, for which theſe withdrawings are ſutable; they are in ſuch a poſture as is beſt for the glory of God, and their everlaſting welfare, that they met with ſuch a diſpenſation. And now let us take notice what that is, that ſo we may be helped to diſcover Gods ſpecial deſign herein; and this may be reduced to three heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God doth it for their chaſtiſement and amendment. <hi>Divine Corrections</hi> are one part of Gods diſpenſations to his people here, Heb. 12.6. <hi>whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon

               <p n="3">3. The glory of God, and their good, are concerned in their recovery. It is not conſiſtent with either of theſe for them to be left always in ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they have brought themſelves into by ſuch things. Gods name ſuffers not a little by the former, nor is there any way for them to repair the injury done to it, but by a ſoaking repentance; and their work lies by by both, and there is no progreſs made in the buſineſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are to work out their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the reparation therefore of both theſe, it is requiſite, that they be made to ſee and lament their folly, and be rowzed up to their buſineſs: and <hi>Gods Covenant Faithfulneſs</hi> engageth him to do this for them.</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:000901_0036_0FAC9A7EA33CE3A8"/>2. God doth it for the exerciſe and tryal of their Grace. That this is one end of Gods dark diſpenſations to his people, we are told in, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. <hi>To prove thee.</hi> And we may ſee the reaſon or ground of it in theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hath put his Graces into his people for exerciſe, in which he is to be glorified. The Creatures laſt end is the Glory of God: and that man may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him, he muſt have grace to do it: and he only glorifieth God by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of theſe Graces, without which he would receive them in vain. This is the <hi>fruitfulneſs</hi> by which Chriſt tells us, that <hi>His Father is glorified, Joh.</hi> 15.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This exerciſe of Grace is made illuſtrious when it is put to the tryal. Grace is like gold, which is diſcovered by the tryal of it, both as to the reality and excellency of it: and what ſaith he? <hi>Job</hi> 23.10. <hi>When he hath tryed me, I ſhall come forth as gold.</hi> By theſe the truth of Grace is made manifeſt; if there be any activity in it, it will now ſhow it ſelf: and the ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here by Temptations I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all ſorts of afflictions. Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity indeed hath its Temptations in it, but the Spirit of God more peculiarly puts this title upon afflictions, becauſe hereby we are brought into difficulty, wherein it will be proved whether God, or any other be our object of hope and truſt, the Apoſtle therefore tells us that <hi>our manifold Temptations are for the tryal of our faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7 Now we are in the dark, and many will ſay, <hi>where is your God</hi>? Beſides, there are ſome Graces that are peculiarly ſuited for, and the proper occaſion for the exerciſe of them is from an hour of Temptation, ſuch as patience, meekneſs, ſubmiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Deſertions belong to theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And indeed grace is never ſo put to the proof, as when God hides his face from us. To believe in a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing God, to be following hard after him, when he ſeems to be going away from us; to hold him the faſter, when he offers to knock our hands off; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve with him, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, I will put my trust in him.</hi> And him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I will wait for the Lord,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000901_0038_0FAC9A80A37DE830"/>
who hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob</hi>; requires no ſmall meaſure of faith: when it is with us, as it was with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> then to ſay and do as he did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. <hi>begin</hi>

               <p n="5">5. God hereby lets them know their own weakneſs, to humble them. When God withdraws, the corrupt part ſtirs: unbelief is ready to diſcover it ſelf, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to break forth in unſuitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and carriages; the Chriſtian who before thought, what he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. And he lets them herein experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his own fidelity and power. When he gives them a full proof of their own weakneſs, and helpeth them to cry out to him for help: when with <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 14.30.

a God he is, had it not been for ſuch an exigency. It was when the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was <hi>Compaſſed with the ſorrows of Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he called upon God, Pſal.</hi> 116.3, 4. that he Celebrates him with that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. <hi>Gracious is the Lord and righteous, yea our God is merciful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And herein he alſo helpeth others of his Children. One ſuch experience is of great uſe to many, when they are in a like caſe. We are adviſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>To be followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes.</hi> God hath recorded ſuch experiences for our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, direction, and encouragement. Hereby alſo he makes ſuch a Chriſtian to be fit to help others at a dead lift, by communicating of their own experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for this reaſon Chriſt gave that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 22.32. <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And the tendency and iſſue of all this, is to advance their glory.

               <p n="1">1. That Gods Children are in danger of being drawn into ſin; they live in a world of Temptation, and they carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with them a body of death: there are the remains of Concupiſcence in them, by which they are ready to take the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſuch Temptations as are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to draw them aſide; for which reaſon Chriſt hath given us that as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our addreſſes to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. <hi>lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> A Child of God is never free from this hazard as long as he lives in an evil wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a work that God hath called them to; but ſin is no part of it, but contrary to it; and not only ſo, but every ſin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as are more bold, deadneth them, and renders them unfit for the buſineſs they are engaged in; a Believer whilſt under the efficacy of any luſt, is not progreſſive, but regreſſive; however God can make it ſerve to his after faſter growth: <hi>David</hi> was thus all the while he lay under his ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The corruption in them oftentimes abuſeth the comforts of Gods preſence to preſumption and careleſsneſs. Such is our weakneſs whilſt we are here, that wa can bear but a little of the new wine of Conſolation. We are like children, who, if cockered by their Parents, grow ſawcy and licencious. This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe in our <hi>Context: God had made his mountain ſtrong,</hi> and he thereupon grow ſecure, and believed himſelf to be out of danger, and that made him to grow wanton, &amp; remit of that care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over himſelf that became him.</p>

for the time to come; theſe become a cloſe leſſon unto them, to let them ſee what an egregious folly it is for them to abuſe their fathers kindneſs, and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; this becomes a memento to them as long as they live, and they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out grow it, but it giveth them an <hi>item,</hi> when at any time a temptation offers it ſelf: it was doubtleſs ſuch an experiment as brought <hi>David</hi> to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, Pſal. 39.1. <hi>I will take heed to my ways, that I ſin not</hi>; and by this means there is more cloſe communion afterward manifeſted betweeen God and them.</p>

That Gods deſertions are not alike to all his Children; nor alike to the ſame at all times, as there are the degrees of his manifeſting himſelf to them, ſo of his withdrawing from them; he doth not deal with all alike on this account; ſome are deeper in the <hi>Valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death</hi> than others are: and the ſame believers are at ſometimes more deeply deſerted than at others.

are carried through the world, as with no extraordinary captures of comfort, ſo with no extraordinary depreſſions and terrours of ſoul: whereas others are ſometimes raviſhed beyond meaſure with the cleareſt apprehenſions of Gods love, and again deſerted unto aſtoniſhment, under the hidings of God from them, and the deſolate eſtate which they are reduced unto thereby: and how frequent ſuch times had the <hi>Pſalmiſt?</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by ſeveral <hi>Pſalms.</hi>

leaves them in the dark about their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eſtate, there are theſe effects that properly follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This makes them to call their ſtate into queſtion: There is an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> which is the baſis of a believers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and according to the degrees of it, ſuch is his comfort in it; this is helped by Gods enabling of him to read his own evidences, and to judge of the reality of them, and by his co-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing with them. When therefore God witholds this, he is left in the dark about is; and the proper reſult of it is to be afraid whether ever any thing was right in him, whether he hath not all this while deceived himſelf, and built on a falſe hope; out of doubt this fear ſtirred in <hi>David,</hi> when he put up that petition, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11. <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

he would hope that God will return to him again; and yet he is afraid whether he will or no: fear preſſeth him down as an heavy weight, and hope endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to buoy him up again; there is a wreſtling, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>ult.

               <p n="1">1. A Child of God hath been made apprehenſive of the fearful miſery under which he was by ſin.

Conſider therefore, and ſuppoſe you hear God ſaying to you, as once he did to the Prophet, 1 King. 19.7. <hi>ariſe and eat, becauſe the Journey is too great for thee.</hi> Now lay up experiences, now record the evidences which are ſo clearly given your of his love to you, and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of your ſafe and good eſtate; that when other witneſs fails, as it may, you may have this to ſupport you then.

Lay in then for it, and be ſure to take down by faith, large draughts of theſe flaggons of conſolation, which may be for ſuitable ſupport under ſuch tryals: and helping you with reſolution to go through them: this will be your beſt wiſdom, and ſo ſhall you be prepared for ſuch an hour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To ſuch as are conducted in a middle way. Poſſibly you have had no experience of the extraordinary raptures, and tranſporting joys that ſome can tell of; and on the other hand, you have not encountred thoſe diſtreſſing plunges, and diſmal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arkneſſes, ariſing from grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>Deſertions,</hi> which others alſo have cryed out bitterly of; but your way is more even; you are not without your fears, but yet you can <hi>hope in Gods Grace,</hi> and encourage your Souls to truſt in
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000901_0110_0FAC9AB6E8918F20"/>
him, and <hi>wait for his Salvation.</hi> And if ſometimes there be a cloud that doth a little obſcure you, it is not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ray breaks forth and giveth you light: and though you ſenſibly labour of infirmities, yet you are kept from <hi>great Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and helped in the work of God which you are engaged in: and this is likely the condition of the greateſt part of Gods Children. To ſuch then let me offer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Believe that God is infinitely wiſe in his conduct. Be ſure that you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain adoring thoughts of him: judge therefore that this is the beſt condition for you. Reckon that your father knows what is moſt proper for every one of his Children, and that his love ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth all theſe concerns. Think, this is the way in which he ſees meet to lead me, and I believe it is the <hi>right way</hi>; and how little cauſe you have to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure that it is otherwiſe with ſome. Do not ſay that God deals better with them than with you: what though you do not meet with their raptures? conſider alſo that you are not oppreſt with their deſolate tryals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be much in ſtabliſhing your hope.
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:000901_0111_0FAC9AB7A27BAEB8"/>
God hath given you a good hope; make much of it, and be always fortifying of it, and take heed of expoſing it to be undermined: and in ſpecial, beware of that temptation which is ſometimes urged to diſquiet and diſturb the minds of the Children of God, <hi>viz.</hi> to queſtion the ſolidity of your hope, becauſe you have not been entertained with thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that others have not met withal, nor thoſe raviſhings which ſome talk of. Know then that thoſe are not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, but arbitrary. Let your care be to ſee that the <hi>root of the matter</hi> is in you, and that your hope is built upon the Grace of God in Chriſt, revealed in you, and is ſuch an hope as ſets you upon the purſuit of Holineſs, according to, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, as he is pure.</hi> And let this encourage you to be very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Serving of God, and waiting <hi>to ſee his Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And let your fear produce the greater caution in you: let not your fear diſturb and weaken your hope, but ſerve it. Let it quicken your ſpiritual watch, let it maintain in you an holy awe and reverence of God, and help
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:000901_0112_0FAC9AB894101008"/>
you to look the more carefully to your ways, leſt you ſhould ſin, and make you more forward and conſtant in <hi>working out your own Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, Phil.</hi> 2.12. Let it make you to ſhun all the ſnares that are in your way, and help you in diſcerning them, and excite you to <hi>walk circumſpectly</hi>: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is ſaid in <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. <hi>The fear of God, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 To ſuch as labour under ſpiritual <hi>Deſertions.</hi> And to ſuch it is that our <hi>Doctrine</hi> more directly points; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a time wherein there are not a few who labour under theſe in a great meaſure, whoſe condition ſaith as he did, <hi>Job</hi> 19.21. <hi>Have pity upon me, Oh my friends, for the hand of the Lord hath touched me.</hi> Let me apply this advice diſtinctly to ſuch: &amp; that way may be made more clearly to purſue this, give me leave to remove ſomething out of the way, to prevent the miſtakes which ſome may labour of, with reſpect to their true and real condition; here then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſuch as ſometimes thought themſelves converted, but were miſtaken in their apprehenſion: and now they
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:000901_0113_0FAC9AB9229A13F8"/>
find trouble, and call all in queſtion, and ſuppoſe themſelves deſerted: ſuch a caſe may be, and poſſibly is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> than we are aware of; and is very haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous. They have poſſibly formerly pretended to great confidence, but now they are in fear. Give me leave to lay out the caſe of theſe, and then offer them ſome counſel: for the diſcovery of ſuch, let theſe things be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are thoſe that have had ſomething of a common work on them, every one hath a <hi>natural Conſcience</hi> in him, whoſe nature and office is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect inward, and apply practical truths to one ſelf, and this Conſcience is not at once brawned and ſeared: the Word &amp; Ordinances are accommodated to meet with mens Conſciences, to put them in fear, and make them ſollicitous: and the Spirit of God often comes in theſe means under which men ſit, and ſtrives, and gives them inward touches and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings, which puts them upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to get quiet; and though natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption ſeeks to ſtifle ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and divert them from them, and ſo <hi>quench the Spirit</hi>: yet they cannot always ſo do, but are put upon it to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000901_0114_0FAC9AB9E44EA5B0"/>
that may bring them inward peace, and nouriſh in them an hope that it ſhall go well with them; that they are reconciled unto God, and ſhall eſcape his terrible indignation; ſo it was with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But they have taken up ſhort of a good foundation: The work hath not been carried through, but hath ſtopped in the way, and they have reſted in ſomething elſe, before they have come over to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which hath prevented their coming: and this is a frequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. The conviction of ſome leads them to a <hi>Legal Reformation</hi>: they have ſeen ſome of their actual ſins, and the Law that hath been broken by them, and the threatning out againſt ſuch ſins written in it, but have not been led to the fountain of original ſin from which theſe ſtreams do flow; and ſo they were never concerned for a <hi>new heart,</hi> but thought if they took up a new life, abſtained from thoſe ſins in practice, &amp; ſet upon the practice of neglected du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they ſhould herein pleaſe God, and hereupon they have pacified their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; this was the fartheſt reach of the <hi>Phariſe,</hi> Luk. 18.11. or poſſibly their
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:000901_0115_0FAC9ABAA2328440"/>
trouble for ſin hath been met with the general offer of pardon, upon believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and they have entertained it with <hi>joy,</hi> as the <hi>ſtony ground</hi> hearers are repreſented, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. they accept of the offer, and now they are ſecure: but they never knew the utter impotency to believe which they labour of: never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the truth of that, Joh. 6.44 <hi>No man can come unto me, except the father that hath ſent me draw him</hi>; and ſo they reſt in a faith of their own, and have not that which is <hi>of the operation of the ſpirit,</hi> being never humbled out of their own <hi>Suffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ncy</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon this they have thought that much aſſiſtance and comfort have been afforded them; they have engaged in moral and religious duties, and been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to and through them with a great deal of pleaſure and eaſe, and it hath greatly ſatisfied them; and they have reckoned theſe for influences of grace, and <hi>joys of the ſpirit</hi>; by reaſon whereof they have argued themſelves, to a ſtrong perſwaſion and high confidence that all was well with them, and have ſaid to themſelves, as <hi>Agag</hi> once did, <hi>the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death it over.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:000901_0116_0FAC9ABB6448D568"/>4. But now they find all this to fail them, and they are brought into a deep plunge. Now they are made to ſee that they can do nothing: they are either left to ſome foul ſin, or conſcience is awakned to tell them, they have deceived themſelves, and that they are in the <hi>gall of bitterneſs</hi>; that the Wrath of God is upon them, their whole profeſſion is a meer cheat, &amp; their <hi>building is upon the ſand</hi>; and this puts them into fears, and poſſibly they take it for a <hi>deſertion</hi>; whereas indeed it is but a <hi>diſcovery.</hi> In ſuch a caſe as this, let me offer two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This calls you to ſearch your ſelves to the bottom: the caſe of ſuch hath ſome reſemblance to that of deſerted Saints: when therefore it is ſo, the firſt buſineſs is a trial of our ſelves throughly; and herein we muſt <hi>prove our ſelves,</hi> whether ever we were <hi>in the faith,</hi> as they are adviſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 5. whether ever we were throughly broken off from every other object, and brought over to Chriſt, and built upon him: yea, and to beg of God alſo to ſearch us, that we be not miſtaken in the very founda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for an errour there cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in any other way, but in laying it
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:000901_0117_0FAC9ABC23FD2A50"/>
a new, and digging deep enough for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you have failed here, this is a merciful diſpenſation to you: Had God left you under theſe miſtakes, you would have gone on ſecurely, and dropt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares into perdi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion. God hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted you, but made your falſe hopes to forſake you, that ſo you might in time ſeek a better ſecurity. This is the way in which God is wont to bring <hi>proud legaliſts,</hi> and <hi>carnal Goſpellers</hi> home to himſelf. God is not going from you, but coming to you, and theſe are the methods of the Holy Spirit: this is the beſt ſign that God hath a purpoſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting love to you, and is now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to draw you home to himſelf: for he will drive that ſoul out of ſelf, and its own righteouſneſs, which he will have mercy upon and ſave. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our main buſineſs is with thoſe that have indeed the root of the matter in them; have a principle of ſaving Grace, and belong to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Deſertion.</hi> And there are two things which I ſhall apply my ſelf unto in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To direct them how to carry it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe <hi>Deſertions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:000901_0118_0FAC9ABCE6CE20B8"/>2. To point what is to be done to get relief under, &amp; deliverance from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For direction how to carry it under theſe <hi>Deſertions.</hi> There is a right beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour which God expects of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when he thus treats them: and it is for his honour, and our advantage, that we comply with it. And there are three things that I ſhall urge on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure to carry it humbly towards God. God expects it, and is now put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this grace to the trial; let it then have its exerciſe, and ſeek to him for help herein, and for your guidance in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Adore his Soveraignty: it may be your dejected and diſquiet minds, are entertaining ſtrange ſurmizes about the Providence of God in this, &amp; <hi>leavened,</hi> as his was, in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73. and 77. but know it; if you cannot reſolve your ſelves in the particular reaſon of it, this is enough to ſilence and ſatisfy you, that it is of God, who can do no wrong, and is not to be <hi>contended</hi> with. <hi>Job</hi> was brought to this, before God had done with him: he was ready to ſay, <hi>behold, I am vile, Chap.</hi> 40.5. and to reſolve to <hi>lay his hand upon his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:000901_0119_0FAC9ABDA23AF468"/>2. Acknowledge his Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Poſſibly you may, upon enquiry, ſee a ſufficient reaſon for his ſo deſerting of you; yea, the particular provocation that hath procured it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here is enough to bring you to his fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, and put you upon humble confeſſing his juſtice and equity in his proceedings: this <hi>David</hi> aims at in our <hi>Context, verſe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. by telling us how his was introduced. But if you are at a loſs about the particular occaſion, yet you have always enough before you, if you are humble, to make you to ſay, God had reaſon enough to deal thus with me, and it is rich mercy, that he doth not always do ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beware of charging him with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality. There is an envy on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, too apt to diſcover it ſelf; ſuch as was in <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> had told him what trials he muſt encounter, is inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive what muſt befal the <hi>beloved Diſciple,</hi> for which he received a rebuke, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.21, 22. hence ſuch muſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Why are theſe taken into fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with him, and I muſt be treated at a diſtance? Why do they enjoy his ſmiles, and I ſuffer his frowns? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take heed of pining; <hi>Why ſhould your eye be

                  </gap>ed in queſtion by your jealouſie? or muſt he ask your counſel and leave how to carry it in his family?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Call neither his truth nor his wiſdom in queſtion on this account. Say not, how can he bring good to me out of this, or what advantage can accrue to me by it? Say not, where is now the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of his word which he hath made me to hope in? how is this the performance of his promiſe? this is pride: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>His thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor his ways as your ways, but as high above them as the heaven is above the earth.</hi> Reſolve that he is the <hi>Potter,</hi> and you the <hi>Clay,</hi> and that you will lye as ſuch in his hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have a care of raſhly judging your own ſtate from hence. How ready are the Children of God in a dark hour, to caſt off their hope, &amp; repeal their eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he ſlay me, I will put my truſt in him.</hi> And he, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I will wait on the Lord, who hideth his face.</hi> And for help, Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no new thing for Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be Deſerted. It ought not then to be a ſtrange thing to you, much leſs an argument that becauſe of this, you are none of his Children. This ſtopt the <hi>Pſalmists</hi> mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.15. <hi>If I ſay, I will ſpeak thus, I ſhould offend against the generation of thy Children.</hi> As to the more remiſs <hi>Deſertions,</hi> it may be ſaid to you, as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> common to man.</hi> And if you combate with ſuch as are more intenſe, and full of darkneſs, yet you are not without the inſtances of ſuch, who were very dear to God. There can then be no ſuch concluſion ſafely built on this argument: it cannot amount to a Demonſtration, ſince this is one part of the way in which God leads his own to glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There may be Grace where there wants light: it is true, a Child of God cannot ſee or read it, when the light is taken from him: but poſſibly he hath read it, when he enjoyed this light: and the withdrawing of it from him doth
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:000901_0122_0FAC9ABFE226EB80"/>
not make any alteration in his ſtate, though it doth in his ſenſe of it. This therefore ought not to beat you off from your former experiences, but calls you rather more carefully to improve them, as he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10, 11. <hi>I will remember the years of the right hard of the moſt high, I will remember the works of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> If Grace were gone, every time comfort and aſſurance is obſcured, it would be ſad indeed; but it is nothing ſo; your ſtate is the ſame, though your frame be altered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There may be the evidence of true Grace, where there is not the evidence of ſtrong Grace: and reaſon good, for there may be faith, though not like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>against hope, believed in hope,</hi> but like a grain of muſtard ſeed. There are the Characters of real faith, in its loweſt actings; and there are the notes of the ſtrong &amp; vigorous actings of it: and we are apt to apply our ſelves in an hour of temptation, to the latter, and becauſe we find them not, we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the former, and vote our ſelves to have none, becauſe we have it not in ſuch degrees, and hereby we greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:000901_0123_0FAC9AC107117E78"/>4. God may not be withdrawn as to Aſſiſtance, when he is ſo as to comfort: and certainly this affords matter of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in a dark time. Nay, it is to be obſerved, that ſometimes God gives more powerful aſſiſtances at ſuch a time. When <hi>Christ</hi> withdrew, as to comfort, from the <hi>Spouſe, Cant.</hi> 5. yet never was her grace in ſuch vigour and reſolution as then, expreſſing her inſuperable love to him, her inſatiable deſire after him, and her unconquerable reſolution to follow him, till ſhe had found him again; nor did ſhe ever give a more glorious deſcription of him, than in that <hi>Deſertion, Verſe</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Above all take heed of concluding your ſelves Reprobates. We obſerved, that ſometimes the temptation may grow up to a readineſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
