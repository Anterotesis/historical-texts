            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THESE <hi>Indians</hi> were the Remains of a Tribe of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> ſettled at <hi>Coneſtogoe,</hi> and thence called <hi>Coneſtogoe Indians.</hi> On the firſt Arrival of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> Meſſengers from this Tribe came to welcome them, with Preſents of Veniſon, Corn and Skins; and the whole Tribe entered into a Treaty of Friendſhip with the firſt Proprietor, WILLIAM PENN, which was to laſt <q>as long as the Sun ſhould ſhine, or the Waters run in the Rivers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Treaty has been ſince frequently renewed, and the <hi>Chain brightened,</hi> as they expreſs it, from time to time. It has never been violated, on their Part or ours, till now. As their Lands by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees were moſtly purchaſed, and the Settlements of the White People began to ſurround them, the Proprietor aſſigned them Lands on the Manor of <hi>Coneſtogoe,</hi> which they might not part with; there they have lived many Years in Friendſhip with their White Neighbours, who loved them for their peaceable inoffenſive Behaviour.</p>
            <p>It has always been obſerved that <hi>Indians,</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the Neighbourhood of White People, do not increaſe, but diminiſh continually. This
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009667_0004_0F7CE23247ACB8C0"/>
Tribe accordingly went on diminiſhing, till there remained in their Town on the Manor, but 20 Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> 7 Men, 5 Women, and 8 Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Boys and Girls.</p>
            <p>Of theſe, <hi>Shehaes</hi> was a very old Man, having aſſiſted at the ſecond Treaty held with them, by Mr. PENN, in 1701, and ever ſince continued a faithful and affectionate Friend to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> he is ſaid to have been an exceeding good Man, conſidering his Education, being naturally of a moſt kind benevolent Temper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peggy</hi> was <hi>Shehaes</hi>'s Daughter; ſhe worked for her aged Father, continuing to live with him, though married, and attended him with filial Duty and Tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> was another good old Man; his Son <hi>Harry</hi> helped to ſupport him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Will Soc</hi> were two Brothers, both young Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Smith,</hi> a valuable young Man, of the <hi>Cayuga</hi> Nation, who became acquainted with <hi>Peggy, Shehaes</hi>'s Daughter, ſome few Years ſince, married her, and ſettled in that Family. They had one Child, about three Years old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Betty,</hi> a harmleſs old Woman; and her Son <hi>Peter,</hi> a likely young Lad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sally,</hi> whoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Name was <hi>Wyanjoy,</hi> a Woman much eſteemed by all that knew her, for her prudent and good Behaviour in ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trying Situations of Life. She was a truly good and an amiable Woman, had no Children of her own, but a diſtant Relation dying; ſhe had taken a Child of that Relation's, to bring up
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009667_0005_0F7CE2331B1F4878"/>
as her own, and performed towards it all the Duties of an affectionate Parent.</p>
            <p>The Reader will obſerve, that many of their Names are <hi>Engliſh.</hi> It is common with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> that have an Affection for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to give themſelves, and their Children, the Names of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Perſons as they particularly eſteem.</p>
            <p>This little Society continued the Cuſtom they had begun, when more numerous, of addreſſing every new Governor, and every Deſcendant of the firſt Proprietor, welcoming him to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, aſſuring him of their Fidelity, and praying a Continuance of that Favour and Protection they had hitherto experienced. They had accordingly ſent up an Addreſs of this Kind to our preſent Governor, on his Arrival; but the ſame was ſcarce delivered, when the unfortunate Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe happened, which we are about to relate.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 14th of <hi>December,</hi> 1763, Fifty-ſeven Men, from ſome of our Frontier Townſhips, who had projected the Deſtruction of this little Common-wealth, came, all well-mounted, and armed with Firelocks, Hangers and Hatchets, having travelled through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the Night, to <hi>Coneſtogoe</hi> Manor. There they ſurrounded the ſmall Village of <hi>Indian</hi> Huts, and juſt at Break of Day broke into them all at once. Only three Men, two Women, and a young Boy, were found at home, the reſt being out among the neighbouring White People, ſome to ſell the Baſkets, Brooms and Bowls they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactured, and others on other Occaſions. Theſe
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009667_0006_0F7CE233CACD55C8"/>
poor defenceleſs Creatures were immediately fired upon, ſtabbed and hatcheted to Death! The good <hi>Shehaes,</hi> among the reſt, cut to Pieces in his Bed. All of them were ſcalped, and otherwiſe horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly mangled. Then their Huts were ſet on Fire, and moſt of them burnt down. When the Troop, pleaſed with their own Conduct and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but enraged that any of the poor <hi>Indians</hi> had eſcaped the Maſſacre, rode off, and in ſmall Parties, by different Roads, went home.</p>
            <p>The univerſal Concern of the neighbouring White People on hearing of this Event, and the Lamentations of the younger <hi>Indians,</hi> when they returned and ſaw the Deſolation, and the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chered half-burnt Bodies of their murdered Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and other Relations, cannot well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſent out to collect the remaining <hi>Indians,</hi> brought them into the Town for their better Security againſt any farther Attempt; and it is ſaid condoled with them on the Misfortune that had happened, took them by the Hand, comforted and <hi>promiſed them Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>—They were all put into the Workhouſe, a ſtrong Building, as the Place of greateſt Safety.</p>
            <p>When the ſhocking News arrived in Town, a Proclamation was iſſued by the Governor, in the following Terms, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Proclamations have as yet produced no Diſcovery; the Murderers having given out ſuch Threatenings againſt thoſe that diſapprove their Proceedings, that the whole County ſeems to be in Terror, and no one durſt ſpeak what he knows; even the Letters from thence are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, in which any Diſlike is expreſſed of the Rioters.</p>
            <p>There are ſome (I am aſhamed to hear it) who would extenuate the enormous Wickedneſs of theſe Actions, by ſaying, <q>The Inhabitants of the Frontiers are exaſperated with the Murder of their Relations, by the Enemy <hi>Indians,</hi> in the preſent War.</q> It is poſſible;—but though this might juſtify their going out into the Woods, to ſeek for thoſe Enemies, and avenge upon them thoſe Murders; it can never juſtify their turning in to the Heart of the Country, to murder their Friends.</p>

The only Crime of theſe poor Wretches ſeems to have been, that they had a reddiſh brown Skin, and black Hair; and ſome People of that Sort, it ſeems, had murdered ſome of our Relations.

            <p>HOMER wrote his Poem, called the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> ſome Hundred Years before the Birth of Chriſt.

The Rites of Hoſpitality were called <hi>ſacred,</hi> becauſe the Stranger, the Poor and the Weak, when they applied for Protection and Relief, were, from the Religion of thoſe Times, ſuppoſed to be ſent by the Deity to try the Goodneſs of Men, and that he would avenge the Injuries they might receive, where they ought to have been protected.— Theſe Sentiments therefore influenced the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of all Ranks of People, even the meaneſt; for we find that when <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> came, as a poor Stranger, to the Hut of <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> the Swineherd, and his great Dogs ran out to tear the ragged Man, <hi>Eumaeus</hi> drave them away with Stones; and

            <p>Theſe Heathen People thought, that after a Breach of the Rites of Hoſpitality, a Curſe from Heaven would attend them in every thing they did, and even their honeſt Induſtry in their Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would fail of Succeſs.—Thus when <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> tells <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> who doubted the Truth of what he related, <hi>If I deceive you in this, I ſhould deſerve Death, and I conſent that you ſhall put me to Death; Eumaeus</hi> rejects the Propoſal, as what would be attended with both Infamy and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſaying ironically,

            <p>Thus much for the Sentiments of the ancient <hi>Heathens.</hi>—As for the <hi>Turks,</hi> it is recorded in the Life of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Founder of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, That <hi>Khaled,</hi> one of his Captains, having
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009667_0017_0F7CE23F7351F080"/>
divided a Number of Priſoners between himſelf and thoſe that were with him, he commanded the Hands of his own Priſoners to be tied behind them, and then, in a moſt cruel and brutal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, put them to the Sword; but he could not prevail on his Men to maſſacre <hi>their</hi> Captives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Fight they had laid down their Arms, ſubmitted, and demanded Protection. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when the Account was brought to him, applauded the Men for their Humanity; but ſaid to <hi>Khaled,</hi> with great Indignation, <hi>Oh</hi> Khaled, <hi>thou Butcher; ceaſe to moleſt me with thy Wickedneſs.—If thou poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſedſt a Heap of Gold as large in Mount</hi> Obod, <hi>and ſhouldſt expend it all in God's Cauſe, thy Merit would not efface the Guilt incurred by the Murder of the meaneſt of thoſe poor Captives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Arabs</hi> or <hi>Saracens,</hi> though it was lawful to put to Death a Priſoner taken in Battle, if he had made himſelf obnoxious by his former Wickedneſs, yet this could not be done after he had once eaten Bread, or drank Water, while in their Hands. Hence we read in the Hiſtory of the Wars of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> that when the <hi>Franks</hi> had ſuffered a great Defeat from <hi>Saladin,</hi> and among the Priſoners were the King of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and <hi>Arnold,</hi> a famous Chriſtian Captain, who had been very cruel to the <hi>Saracens;</hi> theſe two being brought before the Soltan, he placed the King on his right Hand, and <hi>Arnold</hi> on his left; and then preſented the King with a Cup of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who immediately drank to <hi>Arnold;</hi> but when <hi>Arnold</hi> was about to receive the Cup, the Soltan interrupted, ſaying, <hi>I will not ſuffer this wicked

Man to drink, as that, according to the laudable and generous Cuſtom of the</hi> Arabs, <hi>would ſecure him his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the ſame laudable and generous Cuſtom ſtill prevails among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> appears from the Account but laſt Year publiſhed of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels by Mr. <hi>Bell</hi> of <hi>Antermony,</hi> who accompanied the Czar <hi>Peter</hi> the Great, in his Journey to <hi>Derbent</hi> through <hi>Daggeſtan.</hi> 
               <q>The Religion of the <hi>Daggeſtans,</hi> ſays he, is generally <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> ſome following the Sect of <hi>Oſman,</hi> others that of <hi>Haly.</hi> Their Language for the moſt Part is <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> or rather a Dialect of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic,</hi> though many of them ſpeak alſo the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Language. One Article I cannot omit concerning their Laws of Hoſpitality, which is, if their greateſt Enemy comes under their Roof for Protection, the Landlord, of what Condition ſoever, is obliged to keep him ſafe, from all Manner of Harm or Violence, during his Abode with him, and even to conduct him ſafely through his Territories to a Place of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</q>—</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Saracens</hi> this ſame Cuſtom obtained among the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Africa;</hi> was by them brought into <hi>Spain,</hi> and there long ſacredly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtorians record with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe one famous Inſtance of it. While the <hi>Moors</hi> governed there, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were mixed with them, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalier, in a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Quarrel, ſlew a young <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Gentleman, and fled. His Purſuers ſoon loſt Sight of him, for he had, unperceived, thrown himſelf over a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009667_0019_0F7CE240AFBA0C50"/>
Garden Wall. The Owner, a <hi>Moor,</hi> happening to be in his Garden, was addreſſed by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> on his Knees, who acquainted him with his Caſe, and implored Concealment. <hi>Eat this,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Moor,</hi> giving him Half a Peach; <hi>you now know that you may confide in my Protection.</hi> He then locked him up in his Garden Apartment, telling him, that as ſoon as it was Night he would provide for his Eſcape to a Place of more Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—The <hi>Moor</hi> then went into his Houſe, where he had ſcarce ſeated himſelf, when a great Croud, with loud Lamentations, came to his Gate, bringing the Corps of his Son, that had juſt been killed by a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> When the firſt Shock of Surprize was a little over, he learnt, from the Deſcription given, that the fatal Deed was done by the Perſon then in his Power. He mentioned this to no One; but as ſoon as it was dark, retired to his Garden Apartment, as if to grieve alone, giving Orders that none ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. There accoſting the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Chriſtian, the Perſon you have killed, is my Son: His Body is now in my Houſe. You ought to ſuffer; but you have eaten with me, and I have given you my Faith, which muſt not be broken. Follow me.</hi>— He then led the aſtoniſhed <hi>Spaniard</hi> to his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, mounted him on one of his fleeteſt Horſes, and ſaid, <hi>Fly far while the Night can cover you. You will be ſafe in the Morning. You are indeed guilty of my Son's Blood, but God is juſt and good, and I thank him that I am innocent of yours, and that my Faith given is preſerved.</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009667_0021_0F7CE242017D60D0"/>
Men, are bound as ſuch, by the Laws of Humanity, to afford Relief to diſtreſſed Men, who aſk it of us. We cannot, even againſt our Enemies, take Advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of an Act of God. You have Leave therefore to unload your Ship, if that be neceſſary, to ſtop the Leak; you may refit here, and traffick ſo far as ſhall be neceſſary to pay the Charges; you may then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and I will give you a Paſs, to be in Force till you are beyond</hi> Bermuda. <hi>If after that you are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, you will then be a Prize, but now you are only a Stranger, and have a Stranger's Right to Safety and Protection.</hi>—The Ship accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and arrived ſafe in <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>Will it be permitted me to adduce, on this Occaſion, an Inſtance of the like Honour in a poor unenlightened <hi>African Negroe.</hi> I find it in Capt. <hi>Seagrave</hi>'s Account of his Voyage to <hi>Guinea.</hi> He relates that a <hi>New-England</hi> Sloop, trading there in 1752, left their ſecond Mate, <hi>William Murray,</hi> ſick on Shore, and ſailed without him. <hi>Murray</hi> was at the Houſe of a Black, name <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joe,</hi> with whom he had contracted an Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance during their Trade. He recovered, and the Sloop being gone, he continued with his black Friend, till ſome other Opportunity ſhould offer of his getting home. In the mean while, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship came into the Road, and ſome of the Blacks going on board her, were treacherouſly ſeized, and carried off as Slaves. Their Relations and Friends, tranſported with ſudden Rage, ran to the Houſe of <hi>Cudjoe</hi> to take Revenge, by killing <hi>Murray. Cudjoe</hi> ſtopt them at the Door, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what they wanted? The White Man,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009667_0022_0F7CE242C98940F0"/>
ſaid they, have carried away our Brothers and Sons, and we will kill all White Men;—give us the White Man that you keep in your Houſe, for we will kill him. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cudjoe; the White Men that carried away your Brothers are bad Men, kill them when you can catch them; but this White Man is a good Man, and you muſt not kill him.</hi>— But he is a White Man, they cried; the White Men are all bad; we will kill them all.—<hi>Nay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you muſt not kill a Man, that has done no Harm, only for being white. This Man is my Friend, my Houſe is his Fort, and I am his Soldier. I muſt fight for him. You muſt kill me, before you can kill him.—What good Man will ever come again under my Roof, if I let my Floor be ſtained with a good Man's Blood!</hi>—The <hi>Negroes</hi> ſeeing his Reſolution, and being convinced by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that they were wrong, went away aſhamed. In a few Days <hi>Murray</hi> ventured abroad again with <hi>Cudjoe,</hi> when ſeveral of them took him by the Hand, and told him they were glad they had not killed him; for as he was a good (meaning an innocent) Man, <hi>their God would have been angry, and would have ſpoiled their Fiſhing.</hi>—I relate this, ſays Captain <hi>Seagrave,</hi> to ſhow, that ſome among theſe dark People have a ſtrong Senſe of Juſtice and Honour, and that even the moſt bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal among them are capable of feeling the Force of Reaſon, and of being influenced by a Fear of God (if the Knowledge of the true God could be introduced among them) ſince even the Fear of a falſe God, when their Rage ſubſided, was not without its good Effect.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:009667_0023_0F7CE243833A56F8"/>Now I am about to mention ſomething of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> I beg that I may not be underſtood as framing Apologies for <hi>all Indians.</hi> I am far from deſiring to leſſen the laudable Spirit of Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my Countrymen againſt thoſe now at War with us, ſo far as it is juſtified by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy and Inhumanity.—I would only obſerve that the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> as a Body, have kept Faith with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ever ſince we knew them, now near an Hundred Years; and that the governing Part of thoſe People have had Notions of Honour, whatever may be the Caſe with the Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debauched, Trader-corrupted Vagabonds and Thieves on <hi>Saſquehannah</hi> and the <hi>Ohio,</hi> at preſent in Arms againſt us.—As a Proof of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I ſhall only mention one well-known recent Fact. When ſix <hi>Catawba</hi> Deputies, under the Care of Colonel <hi>Bull,</hi> of <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> went by Permiſſion into the <hi>Mohawks</hi> Country, to ſue for and treat of Peace for their Nation, they ſoon found the <hi>Six Nations</hi> highly exaſperated, and the Peace at that Time impracticable: They were therefore in Fear for their own Perſons, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that they ſhould be killed in their Way back to <hi>New-York;</hi> which being made known to the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Chiefs, by Colonel <hi>Bull,</hi> one of them, by Order of the Council, made this Speech to the <hi>Catawbas:</hi>—</p>

            <p>The <hi>Catawbas</hi> came away unhurt accordingly.</p>
            <p>It is alſo well known, that juſt before the late War broke out, when our Traders firſt went among the <hi>Plankeſhaw Indians,</hi> a Tribe of the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> they found the Principle of <hi>giving Protection to Strangers</hi> in full Force; for the <hi>French</hi> coming with their <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſhaw</hi> Town, and demanding that thoſe Traders and their Goods ſhould be delivered up;—the <hi>Plankeſhaws</hi> replied, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were come there upon their Invitation, and they could not do ſo baſe a Thing. But the <hi>French</hi> inſiſting on it, the <hi>Plankeſhaws</hi> took Arms in Defence of their Gueſts, and a Number of them, with their old Chief, loſt their Lives in the Cauſe; the <hi>French</hi> at laſt prevailing by ſuperior Force only.</p>
            <p>I will not diſſemble that numberleſs Stories have been raiſed and ſpread abroad, againſt not only the poor Wretches that are murdered, but alſo againſt the Hundred and Forty chriſtianized <hi>Indians,</hi> ſtill threatned to be murdered; all which Stories are well known, by thoſe who know the <hi>Indians</hi> beſt, to be pure Inventions, contrived by bad People, either to excite each other to join in

the Murder, or ſince it was committed, to juſtify it; and believed only by the Weak and Credulous. I call thus publickly on the Makers and Venders of theſe Accuſations to produce their Evidence. Let them ſatisfy the Public that even <hi>Will Soc,</hi> the moſt obnoxious of all that Tribe, was really guilty of thoſe Offences againſt us which they lay to his Charge. But if he was, ought he not to have been fairly tried? He lived under our Laws, and was ſubject to them; he was in our Hands, and might eaſily have been proſecuted; was it <hi>Engliſh Juſtice</hi> to condemn and execute him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard? Conſcious of his own Innocence, he did not endeavour to hide himſelf when the Door of the Work-houſe, his Sanctuary, was breaking open; <hi>I will meet them,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for they are my Brothers.</hi> Theſe Brothers of his ſhot him down at the Door, while the Word Brothers was ſtill between his Teeth!—But if <hi>Will Soc</hi> was a bad Man, what had poor old <hi>Shehaes</hi> done? what could he or the other poor old Men and Women do? What had little Boys and Girls done; what could Children of a Year old, Babes at the Breaſt, what could they do, that they too muſt be ſhot and hatcheted?—Horrid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late!—and in their Parents Arms! This is done by no civilized Nation in <hi>Europe.</hi> Do we come to <hi>America</hi> to learn and practiſe the Manners of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians?</hi> But this, <hi>Barbarians</hi> as they are, they practiſe againſt their Enemies only, not againſt their Friends.—</p>
            <p>Theſe poor People have been always our Friends. Their Fathers received ours, when
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009667_0026_0F7CE24802944740"/>
Strangers here, with Kindneſs and Hoſpitality. Behold the Return we have made them!— When we grew more numerous and powerful, they put themſelves under our <hi>Protection.</hi> See, in the mangled Corpſes of the laſt Remains of the Tribe, how effectually we have afforded it to them!—</p>
            <p>Unhappy People! to have lived in ſuch Times, and by ſuch Neighbours!—We have ſeen, that they would have been ſafer among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Heathens,</hi> with whom the Rites of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were <hi>ſacred.</hi>—They would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>Gueſts</hi> of the Publick, and the Religion of the Country would have operated in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But our Frontier People call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians!</hi>—They would have been ſafer, if they had ſubmitted to the <hi>Turks;</hi> for ever ſince <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Reproof to <hi>Khaled,</hi> even the <hi>cruel Turks,</hi> never kill Priſoners in cold Blood. Theſe were not even Priſoners:—But what is the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Turks</hi> to Scripture <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>—They would have been ſafer, though they had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in actual War againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> if they had once drank Water with them. Theſe were not taken in War againſt us, and have drank with us, and we with them, for Fourſcore Years.— But ſhall we compare <hi>Saracens</hi> to <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>— They would have been ſafer among the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> though they had been <hi>Murderers of Sons;</hi> if Faith had once been pledged to them, and a Promiſe of Protection given. But theſe have had the Faith of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> given to them many Times by the Government, and, in Reliance on
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009667_0027_0F7CE249A73AEC48"/>
that Faith, they lived among us, and gave us the Opportunity of murdering them.— However, what was honourable in <hi>Moors,</hi> may not be a Rule to us; for we are <hi>Chriſtians!</hi>—They would have been ſafer it ſeems among <hi>Popiſh Spaniards,</hi> even if Enemies, and delivered into their Hands by a Tempeſt. Theſe were not Enemies; they were born among us, and yet we have killed them all.—But ſhall we imitate <hi>idolatrous Papiſts,</hi> we that are <hi>enlightened Proteſtants?</hi>—They would even have been ſafer among the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> where at leaſt one manly Soul would have been found, with Senſe, Spirit and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough, to ſtand in their Defence:—But ſhall <hi>Whitemen</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> act like a <hi>Pagan Negroe?</hi>—In ſhort it appears, that they would have been ſafe in any Part of the known World,— except in the Neighbourhood of the CHRISTIAN WHITE SAVAGES of <hi>Peckſtang</hi> and <hi>Donegall!</hi>—</p>
            <p>O ye unhappy Perpetrators of this horrid Wickedneſs! Reflect a Moment on the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ye have done, the Diſgrace ye have brought on your Country, on your Religion, and your Bible, on your Families and Children! Think on the Deſtruction of your captivated Country-folks (now among the wild <hi>Indians</hi>) which probably may follow, in Reſentment of your Barbarity! Think on the Wrath of the United <hi>Five Nations,</hi> hitherto our Friends, but now provoked by your murdering one of their Tribes, in Danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our bitter Enemies.—Think of the mild and good Government you have ſo auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly inſulted; the Laws of your King, your
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009667_0028_0F7CE24A5008C068"/>
Country, and your GOD, that you have broken; the infamous Death that hangs over your Heads: —For JUSTICE, though ſlow, will come at laſt.—All good People every where deteſt your Actions.—You have imbrued your Hands in innocent Blood; how will you make them clean?—The dying Shrieks and Groans of the Murdered, will often ſound in your Ears: Their Spectres will ſometimes attend you, and affright even your innocent Children!—Fly where you will, your Conſciences will go with you:—Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your Sleep ſhall betray you, in the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium of a Fever you yourſelves ſhall make your own Wickedneſs known.</p>
            <p>One Hundred and Forty peaceable <hi>Indians</hi> yet remain in this Government. They have, by Chriſtian Miſſionaries, been brought over to a <hi>Liking,</hi> at leaſt, of our Religion; ſome of them lately left their Nation which is now at War with us, becauſe they did not chuſe to join with them in their Depredations; and to ſhew their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in us, and to give us an equal Confidence in them, they have brought and put into our Hands their Wives and Children. Others have lived long among us in <hi>Northampton</hi> County, and moſt of their Children have been born there. Theſe are all now trembling for their Lives. They have been hurried from Place to Place for Safety, now concealed in Corners, then ſent out of the Province, refuſed a Paſſage through a neighbouring Colony, and returned, not unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps, but diſgracefully, on our Hands. O <hi>Pennſylvania!</hi> once renowned for Kindneſs to

Strangers, ſhall the Clamours of a few mean Niggards about the Expence of this <hi>Publick Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> an Expence that will not coſt the noiſy Wretches <hi>Sixpence</hi> a Piece (and what is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the poor Maintenance we afford them, compared to the Expence they might occaſion if in Arms againſt us) ſhall ſo ſenſeleſs a Clamour, I ſay, force you to turn out of your Doors theſe unhappy Gueſts, who have offended their own Country-folks by their Affection for you, who, confiding in your Goodneſs, have put themſelves under your Protection? Thoſe whom you have diſarmed to ſatisfy groundleſs Suſpicions, will you leave them expoſed to the armed Madmen of your Country?—Unmanly Men! who are not aſhamed to come with Weapons againſt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, to uſe the Sword againſt Women, and the Bayonet againſt young Children; and who have already given ſuch bloody Proofs of their Inhumanity and Cruelty.—Let us rouze our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for Shame, and redeem the Honour of our Province from the Contempt of its Neighbours; let all good Men join heartily and unanimouſly in Support of the Laws, and in ſtrengthening the Hands of Government; that JUSTICE may be done, the Wicked puniſhed, and the Innocent protected; otherwiſe we can, as a People, expect no Bleſſing from Heaven, there will be no Security for our Perſons or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; Anarchy and Confuſion will prevail over all, and Violence, without Judgment, diſpoſe of every Thing.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:009667_0030_0F7CE24BCB09A730"/>When I mention the Baſeneſs of the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the Uſe they made of Arms, I cannot, I ought not to forget, the very different Behaviour of <hi>brave Men</hi> and <hi>true Soldiers,</hi> of which this melancholy Occaſion has afforded us freſh Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>Royal Highlanders</hi> have, in the Courſe of this War, ſuffered as much as any other Corps, and have frequently had their Ranks thinn'd by an <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy; yet they did not for this retain a brutal undiſtinguiſhing Reſentment againſt <hi>all Indians,</hi> Friends as well as Foes. But a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them happening to be here, when the 140 poor <hi>Indians</hi> above mentioned were thought in too much Danger to ſtay longer in the Province, chearfully undertook to protect and eſcort them to <hi>NeW-York,</hi> which they executed (as far as that Government would permit the <hi>Indians</hi> to come) with Fidelity and Honour; and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Robinſon,</hi> is juſtly applauded and honoured by all ſenſible and good People, for the Care, Tenderneſs and Humanity, with which he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe unhappy Fugitives, during their March in this ſevere Seaſon. General <hi>Gage,</hi> too, has approved of his Officer's Conduct, and, as I hear, ordered him to remain with the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Amboy,</hi> and continue his Protection to them, till another Body of the King's Forces could be ſent to relieve his Company, and eſcort their Charge back in Safety to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where his Excellency has had the Goodneſs to direct thoſe Forces to remain for ſome Time, under the Orders of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, for the Security of the <hi>Indians;</hi> the Troops of this Province being at preſent neceſſarily poſted
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009667_0031_0F7CE24C866B5750"/>
on the Frontier. Such juſt and generous Actions endear the Military to the Civil Power, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Minds of all the Diſcerning with a ſtill greater Reſpect for our national Government.— I ſhall conclude with obſerving, that <hi>Cowards</hi> can handle Arms, can ſtrike where they are ſure to meet with no Return, can wound, mangle and murder; but it belongs to <hi>brave</hi> Men to ſpare, and to protect; for, as the Poet ſays,
