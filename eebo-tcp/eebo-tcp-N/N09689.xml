            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following ſermons, compriſed in this ſmall treatiſe, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and preached at Weymouth, by <hi>JAMES BLAKE,</hi> A. B. of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, a young gentleman, who has for ſome time been repoſited in ſilence; and it is now neceſſary to give ſome reaſons why they are made public, and perhaps it may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reader to ſee a ſhort character of their author.</p>
            <p>He was admitted into Harvard-College, in the fifteenth year of his age, where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited an eminent example of ſtudiouſneſs and proficiency in learning. He was free from vice to which many are unhappily addicted, and which is too often prevalent, in ſuch a ſociety of youth. He was greatly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his claſs-mates, and all the ſociety that were familiar with him. He gain'd the good will of his inſtructors, and was valued by them as one that greatly ornamented the ſociety. Thus he paſſed away his time at College, without the diſeſteem of any, and commenced Bachelor of arts in the year <hi>1769.</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012330_0003_0F88C91D2A46BD18"/>
From thence he went to Weymouth, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the office of a School-maſter to general ſatisfaction; but that being diſagreable to his mind, and ſo great an impediment to his ſtudies, that he reſigned it in about nine months, and employed himſelf wholly in the ſtudy of divinity, under the inſtruction of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi> He purſued this his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite ſtudy with unwearied aſſiduity for a year, and then he began on the important work of the miniſtry, but not without great reluctance; for he had determined not to preach until he had acquired a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the fundamental parts of religion (which cannot be done in the ſmall ſpace of a year.) But Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> being ſick, he was many times urged to ſupply his place until he recovered, which (after repeated denials) he did. Thus having made a beginning he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued preaching almoſt every ſabbath until he died. With reſpect to his public character, he did not effect to be oſtentatious, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the minds of his hearers, by a flow of words to little ſignificancy, but his main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to edify them in the way of their duty; accordingly his diſcourſes were plain and inſtructive, his delivery was eaſy and agreable, accompanied with a few natural geſtures. With regard to his private cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he was ſober and temperate, friendly
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:012330_0003_0F88C91D2A46BD18"/>
and ſociable, and in converſation entertaining and edifying; to theſe was joined an even temper and diſpoſition of mind, all which made him very agreable. He "perſevered in the ways of well doing," 'till he was <hi>21</hi> years old, wanting one month (which was the <hi>17</hi>th day of November <hi>1771</hi>) when after a very ſhort illneſs, his Lord and maſter, whoſe glory he was daily endeavouring to advance, was pleaſed to ſummon him from this ſinful earth, to receive the reward of his early piety. Thus I have given a ſhort character of him, and faintly delineated, nevertheleſs worthy of our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as he has left no iſſue to tell poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity their loſs, his friends and acquaintance have thought fit to print the following ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that his name may be preſerved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and likewiſe that the kingdom of Chriſt may be advanced.</p>
            <p>Now, Reader, I preſent theſe ſermons (without any material alteration) to your peruſal. And (after informing you, that they were never ſtudied with a deſign to be printed, and probably not wrote with ſo great accuracy as they would have been, had he entertained ſuch a thought) I ſincerely hope that the divine bleſſing may accompany them, and that hereby, thoſe that are dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, and are not as yet ſavingly intereſted in Chriſt, but are proceeding daily
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012330_0004_0F88C91DED6093C0"/>
in the broad way to perdition, and who will ſhortly, without the ſovereign influences of God's grace, be forever excluded the manſions of bleſſedneſs, may have a laſting impreſſion made on their minds, that their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may be agreable to the dictates of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and reaſon, and that by their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may abundantly evidence that they are candidates for future glory. And that thoſe of you who have an intereſt in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent joys of the approaching world, may hereby be encouraged to go on cheerfully in your christian walk, and ſhew forth the virtues of Christ, in each of your daily actions, that your life may terminate in perfect peace and happineſs.</p>
            <p>And that we may all not only know our duty, but likewiſe be diligent in doing of it; that we may increaſe daily in grace and in the knowledge of Christ our Saviour, and keep ourſelves unſpotted from ſin; and be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect over our steps, that we may adorn our christian profeſſion; ſo that when we ſhall have ſerved our Maker to his acceptance, whether in the bloom of youth, or in more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced life, we may then be admitted to the ſupercelestial ſpaces of bliſs and immortality, is the ſincere and hearty deſire of,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE whole of this chapter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the inſpired author of it, to ſet forth the excellency of faith. He begins with a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, Now faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, &amp;c. and proceeds to bring various inſtances from the old Teſtament, wherein thoſe ancient Patriarchs were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and excited by this divine grace of faith, to do and ſuffer many excellent things to the advancement of the glory of God, and in obedience to his commands. It was this ſhining virtue that encouraged Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012330_0005_0F88C91EA8FB7480"/>
at the command of God, to leave the place of his nativity, and to ſojourn in a ſtrange land, which was promiſed him for a future inheritance. Here, with Iſaac and Jacob, he dwelt in tabernacles, as a ſtranger in the land of promiſe. Theſe all died in faith, the apoſtle tells us, not having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded that they ſhould afterwards be accompliſhed. But though theſe promiſes were not made good during their life; yet by their ready obedience to the commands of God, their faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his word, and their confeſſing that their life on earth was but a pilgrimage, they plainly declared that they ſought a country: Yea, ſaith our text, they deſire a better country, that is, an heavenly. Thus you ſee what connection the text has with what goes before. But I ſhall conſider the words as they are in themſelves; and thus they plainly include this</p>

            <p n="1">1. Heaven is a better country. This I ſhall attempt to prove by taking a brief ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the glories of thoſe unſeen manſions, and thereby ſhewing that the excellency, beauty, and happineſs of them, infinitely ſurpaſs the moſt ſplendid and proſperous condition which can be enjoyed in this world. But alas! what a taſk have I propoſed to undertake? What tongue can utter? What pen can deſcribe? Yea, what imagination can comprehend, the tranſcendent happineſs of thoſe bleſſed regions, where God ſhines forth with unvailed luſtre, diſplays his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded majeſty, and ſheds the beams of his beneficence on all that ſtand around? "Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the things which God has prepared for them that love him."

               </gap>s obſcure and imperfect, "but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect ſhall be done away."

But in our heavenly ſtate, all theſe perplexing difficulties will be unfolded and made plain to us; we ſhall then be enabled to view the whole chain of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to diſcover the connection of it's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts, and their dependance upon each other, and perceive that every part, however dubious it might appear alone, is conducive to the good of the whole, and the carrying on of the grand deſign. There we ſhall ſee and acknowledge that it was only our blindneſs and ignorance that made us imagine any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies in the divine conduct.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is probable that we ſhall ſtill know and remember our friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whoſe company we took pleaſure in whilſt on earth: For the ſoul will retain all

it's former ideas and impreſſions, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of converſation will ſtill be continued to us; at leaſt ſo much of the knowledge of our former ſtate, as is conſiſtent with the purity of the place, and our happineſs there, ſhall remain with us in thoſe heavenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. From all this we learn that heaven is a better country than the earth, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that the knowledge of glorified ſpirits ſo far exceeds the ignorance of mortal men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Heaven is a ſtate of perfect purity and holineſs. "There ſhall in no wiſe enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it any thing that defileth, or that worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie," as we read in the 21ſt chapter of the Revelations, the 27th verſe. In this world all godly men do mortify their earthly and corrupt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and do their utmoſt to ſubdue all their perverſe appetites, and root out all evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. But ſtill there remain ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and blemiſhes in the beſt of men. But when they enter the heavenly world, they ſhall be freed from every taint of ſin, they ſhall be "cleanſed from all fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſs of fleſh and ſpirit," and ſhall be pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect like the angels of God, or as the apoſtle ſays, like God himſelf. There, thoſe long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and breathings after pure and ſpotleſs holineſs, which they had in this life, ſhall be fully gratified. There, there will be nothing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012330_0008_0F88C922C5FCDA28"/>
to incline or tempt them to any ſin or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But every thing will be agreable to the pure natures and deſires of the inhabitants. There, the fleſh will no longer ſway them to ſin, nor the world intrude on their divine employments. There, ſatan ſhall be diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his darts, he ſhall be rendred incapable of tempting any more; and the deſtroyer himſelf ſhall be deſtroyed. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Heaven is a ſtate of perfect joy and happineſs. This is the peculiar characteriſtic of heaven, but cannot be conceived, much leſs deſcribed, by us in our preſent ſtate; we are only certified of this in general (and this is ſufficient to excite our zealous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to obtain it) that this happineſs is great beyond comprehenſion, that it is free from all allay and interruption, that it will be ſuited to our capacities, and ſatisfactory to our deſires.</p>
            <p>But let us take a more particular view of what may be ſuppoſed to conſtitute the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the bleſſed inhabitants of heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſhall be freed from all thoſe evils which attend them here. Men in this life are liable to numberleſs evils and caſualties, fears and torments, which often render life itſelf a ſcene of miſery and ſorrow. But thoſe that ſhall be counted worthy to enter into that world ſhall be delivered from all
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012330_0008_0F88C922C5FCDA28"/>
thoſe annoyances. There, "all ſickneſs and death, ſorrow and ſighing, ſhall flee away," and uninterrupted peace, joy and ſatisfaction, ſhall come in their ſtead. This is admirably deſcribed by St. John, the favourite apoſtle of our Lord, who was favoured with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this heaven of happineſs, this new Jeruſalem, whilſt here on earth, Revelations 21. chap. 2, 3, and 4 verſes. "And I John ſaw the holy city, new Jeruſalem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her huſband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, ſaying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God. And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: For the former things are paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way." It was "ſin that brought death into the world and all our woes" and afflictions: Wherefore when ſin is thoroughly purged away, (as it will be before we enter upon the joys of heaven) all the diſmal train of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, pains, and death, ſhall depart with it. So there will be nothing to allay our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nothing to moleſt or diſcompoſe us in our tranquil pleaſures.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:012330_0009_0F88C92333036ED8"/>2. Another conſtituent of the happineſs of heaven will be, the enjoyment of God, the adoration of him, and the execution of his pleaſure. If good men take pleaſure in wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhipping God here on earth, and in rendring praiſes and thankſgivings to his name, how much more when they ſhall have dropt this vile fleſh, and are admitted to adore him in his more immediate preſence? In this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate it is impoſſible for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or deſcribe the pleaſure and happineſs which all the glorified ſaints will receive in the enjoyment of God. Doubtleſs it will be exceeding great, and worthy the bounteous author of it to beſtow. The performance of the divine will, and the celebration of God's goodneſs and kindneſs in man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſalvation, will be inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably pleaſant to the grateful ſaints of God. And this pleaſure will be heightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by recounting to each other the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercies, by worſhipping God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſinging ſocial hallelujahs to him.</p>
            <p>This brings me to conſider the third ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of the happineſs of heaven, namely,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The converſation of angels and ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. Man is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture formed for ſociety. He is ſo conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as to receive ſatisfaction and pleaſure, from converſation with his fellow creatures.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012330_0009_0F88C92333036ED8"/>
Eſpecially, the ſaints and people of God here on earth, reap not only much advantage, but great delight and pleaſure, from their communion and converſe with each other. It is a pleaſing entertainment to the true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jeſus, to confer together on holy matters, and jointly to exalt and magnify the glory of God for thoſe manifeſtations of his love and kindneſs, which are diſcovered to us in this our limited ſtate. But how much greater will the mutual pleaſure of their converſation be, when they are enabled to behold, at one view, the whole grand ſcheme of grace, and to recount to each other the mighty and undeſerved benefits reſulting therefrom? How will they admire God's love, and gratefully bleſs his name to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? This is heaven! This is happineſs! Here they will have nothing to interrupt them; no intruſions of the ungodly, no avocations of the world, to diſturb them; but they will ſpend a happy eternity, in mutual fellowſhip and communion. And this commerce will not only be maintained by them with one another, but alſo with the holy angels, thoſe miniſtring ſpirits, who have intereſted themſelves in man's welfare, and who will now by their divine converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, augment their joy and happineſs. But that we may have a more perfect idea of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012330_0010_0F88C923F0DD6E10"/>
the happineſs of the ſaints in heaven, let us conſider,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That after the reſurrection and final judgment, the bodies as well as the ſouls of the righteous ſhall participate in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bliſs. Their bodies, I ſay; not ſuch vile and corruptible bodies as they are laid in the grave, but they will then undergo a moſt glorious change. We learn from the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul, that when Chriſt ſhall come, "he ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body." Phil. 3.21. Fleſh and blood, ſays the apoſtle, cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Our bodies in their preſent groſs and mortal ſtate, are not ſuſceptible of that happineſs, which is to be enjoyed in the preſence of God; the effulgence of God's glorious preſence will be too bright and dazzling for mortal eyes. We cannot in theſe bodies ſee God's face and live. But at the reſurrection, the bodies of ſaints will be ſo altered as to be made capable of enjoying a pure, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading felicity, with God their Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and Sanctifier. This change of the body to be raiſed, is thus ſet forth by the apoſtle, 1 Cor. 15.42. <hi>It is ſown in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it is raiſed in incorruption: It is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory: It is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012330_0010_0F88C923F0DD6E10"/>
It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual body.</hi> That is, it ſhall be ſo purified and refined from all the dregs of matter, that it will deſerve the denomination of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, rather than of an ordinary body. Theſe bodies of ours are liable to accidents and diſeaſes, to corruption and decay; but at the reſurrection, "this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality." They ſhall be freed from every deſtructive quality, and ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred active and vigorous, ſo as to be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the free operation of the ſoul. Agreable to which our Saviour ſays, that the ſaints at the reſurrection, <hi>ſhall be as the angels of God in heaven.</hi> Mat. 22.30. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the righteous being thus refined, and their ſouls purified from all the remainders of ſin, they ſhall be admitted to dwell with the Lord both in ſoul and in body for ever. And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The happineſs which they ſhall there enjoy, ſhall be full and ſatisfactory; which cannot be ſaid of any earthly happineſs.</p>
            <p>Here in this world we conſtantly imagine ourſelves deſtitute of ſomething, which we eſteem requiſite to our compleat felicity; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> creates uneaſineſs and diſcontent. But in heaven our whole capacities of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be filled, and every deſire will be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012330_0011_0F88C924BA6251D0"/>
ſatisfied. And though there will be degree of glory and rewards in heaven, (as may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> argued from many places of ſcripture) yet this does not hinder but that each one's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſhall be perfect. For every one will be happy according to their ſeveral capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of enjoyment. So that nothing ſhall be wanting to any one to conſtitute the greateſt happineſs which he is capable of enjoying. A difference of rewards is evident hence, Holineſs is a qualification, yea, and a neceſſary ingredient of happineſs. Wherefore as there are different degrees of holineſs in this life, ſo there muſt of neceſſity be different degrees of happineſs in the next. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the felicity of any ſtate will be greatly increaſed, by a perſon's entring upon it from a ſtate of adverſity and unhappineſs. The comparing their former with their preſent ſtate, much enhances the value of the latter. Wherefore ſuch ſaints as have been perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and hardly uſed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>th, will more ſenſibly feel the vaſtneſs and worth of the heavenly enjoyments. Mat. 5.12. Bleſſed are ye, ſays our Saviour, when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you; rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven. But this difference does not hinder (as I ſaid before) but that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all ſhall be complete, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their deſires and capacities.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012330_0011_0F88C924BA6251D0"/>6. and laſtly. To crown all that has been ſaid, of the happineſs of the juſt, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, let us conſider that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſhall be <hi>eternal.</hi> The felicity which they ſhall enjoy in God's preſence, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have an end. Whence it is ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called in ſcripture by the name <hi>of eternal life,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting life</hi>; (inſtances of which are numberleſs.) This is neceſſary to the perfection of the heavenly felicity. If the ſaints there were in continual apprehenſion of having an end put to their happineſs, how would it damp their joys, and leſſen their pleaſure? But on the contrary, it adds a new reliſh to their enjoyments to be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that they will be immutable, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, that they will endure for myriads of ages, and then, be no nearer ending than at firſt. We cannot now form to ourſelves an adequate idea of this endleſs duration. Our finite underſtandings cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend infinity. But that the heavenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are perpetual, and without end, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evident from the word of God. St. Peter aſſures the ſaints to whom he wrote, that there is <hi>an inheritance incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for them.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. The things which are ſeen, and which we now enjoy, are temporal and vaniſhing; but the things
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012330_0012_0F88C9265699A118"/>
which are not ſeen, &amp; which ſhall ſucceed this tranſitory ſtate, are never-ending and eternal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus I have given you ſome faint deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matchleſs glories, and unparallell'd happineſs of the heavenly kingdom: But how weak are all deſcriptions compared with the joys themſelves! The repreſentation which I have made of them, bears but a faint reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the reality. I have endeavour'd, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> far as my reaſon, and the word of God would conduct me, to decypher this happineſs to you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And what I have ſaid is ſufficient to call forth our ſtrongeſt deſires and moſt zealous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to attain theſe glorious rewards. That which is beyond the comprehenſion of our preſent faculties, we muſt patiently leave, until God ſhall ſee fit, of his abundant grace, and through the merits of Chriſt, to call us (after we have done o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> utmoſt to qualify ourſelves) to the poſſeſſion of thoſe tranſcendent enjoyments. We ſhall then doubtleſs be ready to ſay, as the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, <hi>Behold the half was not told us!</hi> The glories and excellencies, which we now behold, far exceed the utmoſt that we ever heard or conceived of them.</p>
            <p>I now proceed according to my firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed deſign briefly to conſider the ſecond part of the doctrine contained in the text, namely,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:012330_0012_0F88C9265699A118"/>II. That the ſaints and people of God deſire, and ſtrive after heaven, that better country. But now they deſire a better country, that is, an heavenly. This life they eſteem but a pilgrimage, or journey to another. They find nothing in this world worthy to engage their ſupreme affections: Nothing that is able to ſatisfy the deſires of a rational and immortal ſoul. They look down on all theſe worldly vanities with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, and ſoar aloft to thoſe bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of glory, where are tranſcendent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prepared for them. Thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſeek after heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As their thoughts and converſation center in that bleſſed place. The pleaſures of a virtuous courſe, the pleaſures to be found in the ſervice of God, and the glorious end of their godly race, are continually in their thoughts. They are conſtantly meditating on heaven, and the rewards that God has there prepared for them that love him. Heaven is the object of their contemplations, and it is this that influences them, in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that "their converſation is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven," whilſt they dwell here on earth. All their words and ſpeeches evidently manifeſt their heavenly temper, and ſhew their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love to God, and their pious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to pleaſe him. From theſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012330_0013_0F88C926EA497C38"/>
a moſt ſublime and god-like pleaſure; living in a conſciouſneſs of the favor of God here, and a comforting and well-grounded hope of his approbation in the world to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The deſires and affections of the godly are aimed at heaven. God and Chriſt are the objects of their love, they therefore often ardently wiſh to depart hence, that they may be with Chriſt which is far the beſt of all; with that mighty ſaint and holy apoſtle Paul, they <hi>know that when their earthly houſe of this tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, they have a building with God, an houſe not made with hands eternal in the heavens.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>for this they groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with their houſe which is from heaven.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.12. They are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and chuſe rather to be abſent from the body, to caſt off this vile body with all it's ſinful inſtigations, with all it's pains and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, miſeries and diſquiets, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord, to behold his glory, and worſhip in his preſence through eternal ages. Though they enjoy here the bleſſings of a compoſed mind, and peaceful conſcience, yet they feel that their happineſs on earth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete. Tho' to them, to live be Chriſt, yet to die will be ſtill greater gain. This cauſes them to deſpiſe all earth's unſatisfying enjoyments, and excite their longings and breathings after heaven.</p>

Not only their thoughts and affections are placed on heaven, but all their actions likewiſe are ordered with a view to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of thoſe glorious rewards. This is the principle of their conduct, this the ſpring from whence their actions flow, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at which they aim. Thoſe who are thus heavenly diſpoſed, will be careful "to deny ungodlineſs, and every worldly luſt, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, in this preſent evil world," knowing that theſe are neceſſary qualifications for their admittance into heaven. It is not a vain and fruitleſs wiſhing to enjoy heaven, nor a bare aſſent to the truths of the goſpel, that will procure an entrance into thoſe bliſsful manſions. But all that hope for admittance there, muſt be careful to live a godly life, and to practice all thoſe duties that are required in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as evidences of their being in a ſtate of juſtification and ſalvation. Belief is in order to practice, and the one is vain without the other. All therefore who are truly pious, and who ſincerely ſtrive after heaven, are careful ſo to order their converſation here, as to be qualified for happineſs hereafter. And thus muſt all do, that deſire to be godly. Thus I have ſhewn, that it is the character of the ſaints, to deſire and ſtrive after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. All that now remains for me to do,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012330_0014_0F88C927C9D549C8"/>
is to draw ſome uſeful and practical infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from the whole.</p>
            <p>Inference 1ſt. Hence we ſee the vanity of this world, and it's inſufficiency to make us happy. Though a man be poſſeſſed of all the good things of this life: Though he have attain'd to the higheſt pitch of affluence, and is dignified with all the honour and power his ambition could crave: Though he have riches unnumbered, and all worldly pleaſures at his command; yet with theſe only, how far is he from happineſs? There ſtill remains ſome void in his breaſt, ſome deſire which theſe things are not able to ſatisfy. Beſides, theſe outward things are fading and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, they vaniſh like a ſhadow and leave no trace behind them. And tho' they ſhould be continued to a man as long as his frail and brittle life laſts, yet how ſhort is that? What a poor compenſation will theſe fleeting and unſatisfactory pleaſures make for the loſs of happineſs to all eternity? It becomes us therefore to draw off our affections from the things of this world, &amp; place them on heaven; to look upon this life as a journey to another; to be indifferent to the things of earth, and to ſhew by all our actions that we are aiming at a better country, even a heavenly one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The conſideration of thoſe bright and glorious rewards, prepared for the juſt in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012330_0014_0F88C927C9D549C8"/>
heaven, ſhould excite our thankfulneſs, and draw forth our praiſes to God, for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited goodneſs.</p>
            <p>We by our ſins have ſubjected ourſelves to the curſe of God's broken law, and it had been no breach of juſtice in him, to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the eternal puniſhment, annexed to the violation of it, to have fallen upon us. But bleſſed be his name, he has not left us to our own ruin; he has promiſed us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon our repentance; the aſſiſtance of his Spirit upon our weak endeavours; and eternal life upon our perſeverance in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and gave his Son to die for us, to procure for us the pardon of our ſins, and to open to us the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. O let God's love and mercy to us, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle our love to him: And let us manifeſt our gratitude, by our praiſes and thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and not only ſo, but by embracing thoſe offers of grace, by performing the will of God, and laying hold on eternal life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This thought, that there is a crown of glory prepared in heaven for the godly, which God the righteous judge will ſhortly beſtow upon them, ſhould ſerve to ſupport them under all the preſſures and calamities of life.</p>
            <p>Though their circumſtances be low in the world, though they be deſtitute of the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoyments in this life, though they be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012330_0015_0F88C92869C50DE0"/>
exerciſed with pains and afflictions, and tho' ſuffer perſecution from the ungodly, yet let them conſider that they ſhall ſhortly be freed from them, that they ſhall ſoon be admitted to the rewards of their ſufferings, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of heaven, which will even be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by them. With theſe thoughts let them comfort themſelves, and <hi>poſſeſs their ſouls in patience. For I reckon,</hi> ſaith the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> Thoſe who die in the Lord ſhall reſt in their labours. The grave will be to the godly a place of quiet: <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling: There the weary are at reſt. There the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners reſt together, they hear not the voice of the oppreſſor. The ſmall and the great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter,</hi> as Job elegantly expreſſes it, 3d chap. 17, 18, and 19 verſes. Surely then they have no reaſon to complain or to be impatient under the evils of this life, ſince they will be ſo very ſhort, and will be followed with ſuch great and inconceivable rewards. Eſpecially when the apoſtle tells them, that "theſe light afflictions, which are but for a moment, ſhall work for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." 2 Cor. 4.17. By thus quietly ſubmitting to the troubles and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012330_0015_0F88C92869C50DE0"/>
croſſes of life, we imitate our bleſſed maſter, "who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame." But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="4">4. From what has been ſaid, of the purity and holineſs of heaven, we learn the neceſſity of our being holy here, in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy there. Such as are <hi>pure in heart,</hi> and only ſuch, <hi>ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> "Without holineſs, ſays the apoſtle, no man ſhall ſee the Lord." Wherefore if we ever would get to heaven, we muſt, thro' the aids of the divine Spirit, renounce all our carnal affections, ſubdue all our depraved ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and inclinations, mortify all our luſts and corruptions, and cleanſe ourſelves from all impurities of thought, word and deed. This, in the very nature of the thing, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make us capable of enjoying the happineſs of heaven. For if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a wicked man to be admitted into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the temper with which he left the earth, with all his grovelling deſires, and carnal affections about him; heaven itſelf would be no heaven to him. He would have no reliſh for the ſublime and ſpiritual joys of that place. He would take no pleaſure in the fellowſhip of God, whoſe nature is ſo oppoſite to his. And the ſociety of the juſt would afford him no delight: For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012330_0016_0F88C92B393D2AF0"/>
ſanctified, and purified from all filthineſs, their converſation and employment will be wholly about things pure and ſpiritual, and ſo will afford no ſatisfaction to the impure deſires, and carnal propenſions of a wicked man. In fine, he would find there nothing ſuited to his depraved taſte, nothing to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his corrupt inclinations, and ſo he would properly be in hell, though in the manſions of the bleſſed. Thus we ſee it is not ſo much the place itſelf, as the temper of the inhabitants, that conſtitutes the happineſs of heaven. So that if we ever expect to enjoy happineſs in heaven, we muſt acquire a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly temper here below: The latter is both a natural, and moral qualification for the former; a natural, as it fits us for enjoying this happineſs, and a moral, as it is required by God as a condition of our being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This doctrine affords us ample encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to zeal and faithfulneſs in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. There is an ample reward offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them that do well, no leſs than an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of happineſs. This will be conferred on all the true ſervants of Chriſt; and ſuch as have moſt diſtinguiſhed themſelves in ſerving God and doing good, to their brethren, ſhall be bleſſed with a more diſtinguiſhing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Wherefore let us with a holy emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012330_0016_0F88C92B393D2AF0"/>
ſtrive to outvie each other in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious courſe. Let us ſtruggle, and ſtrive with all our might, diligently to do God's will, that great may be our reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. More eſpecially let us do all the good we can to the ſouls of men, let us do our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to procure the ſalvation of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; reſting aſſured, that after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> Dan. 12.3.</p>
            <p>Finally. Let us (as we have heard that the people of God do) long and ſeek after this heavenly country. Let us ſoar above the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling pleaſures of this world, and fix our minds on heaven the habitation of God. Let us always keep heaven in our eye; let our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme affections be placed on this; and let all our actions tend to this. Let us improve the price put into our hands. Let us ſeize the preſent opportunity, and lay hold on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life: Let us live as thoſe that expect a future bliſs: Let us conſecrate our lives, our faculties, and all that we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012330_0018_0F88C92C2C70DC90"/>
of God himſelf came down from heaven; and by his doctrines, precepts, and example, pointed out the only effectual way, whereby mankind can eſcape the pollutions of the world, and attain the regions of eternal bliſs. And in order to the inſtruction of after ages, he has left behind him the ſacred records of his will, written by holy men under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and inſpiration of his bleſſed Spirit, that none might be ignorant of the way of ſalvation, wrought out and revealed by him. "Thus has Chriſt Jeſus aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light by the goſpel." Mankind being ſinners, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no way to unaſſiſted reaſon, whereby God can, conſiſtent with the honor of his perfections and laws, overlook their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and receive them into favour and happineſs with himſelf. But in conſulting the goſpel revelation, how are we ſurpriſed to find, that God has in infinite wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and in infinite mercy revealed and executed a plan of grace, whereby all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attributes ſhine unſullied, and yet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is put into a capacity of obtaining eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation.? For "God ſo loved the world as to ſend his only begotten Son," &amp;c. This is an undeſerved favour. The free gift of God—as is declared by the apoſtle in the text. By grace are ye ſaved, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:012330_0018_0F88C92C2C70DC90"/>The apoſtle begins this chapter by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Epheſians what a deplorable ſituation they were in, before they were quickned by divine grace. He deſcribes them as "dead in treſpaſſes and ſins—walking according to the courſe of this world, and according to the prince of the power of the air—having their converſation in the luſts of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind—and being by nature children of wrath." "<hi>But</hi>" proceeds the apoſtle, "God who is rich in mercy, for his great love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt, has raiſed us up, and has made us ſit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus." So that it was owing to the free grace of God alone, that they were renewed in the temper of their minds, and from a ſtate of expoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the divine wrath, and eternal death, were brought into a ſtate of ſalvation. This is more fully declared in the text, wherein we are told, that the ſalvation of believers is of the free grace of God, and that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification herefor on their part, is faith in Jeſus Chriſt. From the words I ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt theſe three things.</p>

               <item>III. Shew how or in what ſenſe this faith is ſaid to be the gift of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſhew that it is of the free grace of God alone that any are ſaved. By grace are ye ſaved, &amp;c. It was the unconſtrained benevolence of the divine nature, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the tenders of mercy, and made eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life obtainable by us. It is a free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſollicited favour, to which God had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous motives or excitements, nothing but his benevolence and good will. "He firſt loved us," and that when by ſin we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him. We being ſinners and could do nothing to call forth the divine mercy, there was nothing in us but our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery to move his pity and compaſſion. Our juſtification therefore and ſalvation is often called by St. Paul, "the free gift." Which ſeems at firſt ſight in ſome meaſure to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or interfere with this, are <hi>the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the doings of our own?</hi> But neither of theſe deſtroy the freeneſs of God's grace in our ſalvation. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though it is granted that Chriſt made full atonement for our offences, and ſo paid down our ranſom for us, yet nevertheleſs it is of the free grace of God that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſaved. For it was God himſelf that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012330_0019_0F88C92CEB4EA3B0"/>
provided a Saviour for us. From motives of love and kindneſs only, he gave this unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gift of a redeemer to the world, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might ſhew mercy to us conſiſtent with the honour of his perfections. So that the mediation of Chriſt, and all that he did and ſuffered for us, is to be conſidered only as the <hi>means</hi> made uſe of by God in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting his ſcheme of mercy, and not as the motive that prompted him to ſhew mercy to man: It is not the cauſe, but the fruit and conſequence of the exertion of his free and undeſerved grace and favour towards us. It is thus that the ſcriptures repreſent the matter. "In this was manifeſted the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, becauſe that God <hi>ſent</hi> his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son into the world, that we might live thro' him." "Chriſt who knew no ſin <hi>was</hi>" by the gracious appointment of God "made ſin for us," the chaſtiſement of our peace was on him, and by <hi>his</hi> ſtripes we are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God was in no way obliged to provide a ſurety to bear the puniſhment of our ſins, and diſcharge our debts for us; neither was he obliged, when a redeemer freely offered himſelf to ſuffer for us, to accept of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as ſatisfaction for our offences. So that the miſſion of Chriſt was <hi>of free grace, his</hi> undertaking the office of mediator was <hi>of free grace,</hi> and God's accepting his merits
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012330_0020_0F88C92DAAF5C5B0"/>
and ſufferings for the juſtification of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is likewiſe of free grace. Hence as the apoſtle ſays, we are "juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt; whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God:—That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus." Rom. 3.24, 25, and 26. So far then is the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and meritorious ſufferings of Chriſt from infringing the free grace of God in our juſtification, that it is the greateſt inſtance of his free and undeſerved love towards us. "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins." 1 John 4.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither is the free grace of God any ways leſſened, by any works of holineſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by men, to qualify themſelves for the ſaving gift. The apoſtle Paul is very earneſt in affirming and proving that no man can be juſtified by any deeds of his own, done in conformity to the law. If indeed any man had fully anſwered the demands of the law, ſo as to ſtand juſtified and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, when that is made the ſtandard of judgment, then "the reward would juſtly be reckoned, <hi>not of grace</hi> but <hi>of debt:</hi>" He
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012330_0020_0F88C92DAAF5C5B0"/>
might claim the reward as his due. But this is not the caſe. There is no one but has tranſgreſſed the law, and ſo ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it's curſe. For the law is very ſtrict and peremptory in pronouncing "every one curſed that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them." But as many as are under the law and expect juſtification by it, <hi>are under the curſe.</hi> For, ſays the apoſtle, "all are gone out of the way—there is none righteous, no not one." Agreable to which ſaith the wiſe man, "There is not a juſt man upon earth that doeth good and ſinneth not." Since therefore all mankind have rendred but a very imperfect obedience to the divine law, and conſequently are under the curſe of it, they cannot be juſtified by it. For the law cannot condemn a man as a tranſgreſſor, and at the ſame time vindicate him as righteous. So that it muſt be by the free grace of God, through the redemption of Jeſus Chriſt, that any man is juſtified and ſaved; ſince all that we do merits no reward, but leaves us ſtill debtors to the law. <hi>Not by works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that we have done,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>but according to his mercy be ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt; which he ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour; that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012330_0021_0F88C9305A2FA4D0"/>
juſtified by his grace, we ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</hi> Titus 3.5, 6, 7. It would reflect highly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the divine wiſdom in conſulting a redeemer, and would deſtroy the neceſſity of any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to ſuppoſe that we by any works of ours, could claim the divine acceptance. For "if righteouſneſs comes by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain." "Then faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect." For the promiſe of juſtification to thoſe that believed in Chriſt, and depended on his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs alone herefor, would be vain and uſeleſs, could we be juſtified by the law, in conſequence of any deeds of ours done is conformity to it. But ſince it is impoſſible that any ſhould make void the promiſes or deſigns of God, it is evident, that it is of the free and abundant grace of God alone that any of the ſinful children of men are juſtified and ſaved. Indeed it is not only on account of our being debtors to the law, that we an ſaved by grace, but the ſame divine grace would be exerciſed in our ſalvation were we free from the law. For ſuppoſe a man ſhould render perfect obedience to the divine law, and not tranſgreſs it, in one ſingle point, yet ſtill he would merit nothing; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done no more than his duty, ſepara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

entitled to no reward. Juſtification indeed be might claim as his due: For he being really righteous, deſerves to be eſteemed and vindicated as righteous. Wherefore though ſuch a one could not be looked upon as guilty in the ſight of God, and conſequently not liable to puniſhment; yet ſeparate from the promiſe of God, who has connected juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſalvation, and has ſaid that "whom he juſtifies, them he alſo will glorify," ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from this I ſay, he would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to eternal life in heaven. If then the beſtowment of eternal happineſs on man would be of grace, even if he perfectly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the demands of the law, what ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounding grace is exerted in ſaving any, when "all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God?" But I proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. The grand qualification requiſite in thoſe who ſhall obtain ſalvation. By grace are ye ſaved <hi>thro' faith.</hi>" It is only thro' faith therefore that ſalvation is obtained. In the juſtification of a perſon by which he is put into a ſtate of ſalvation, there are three things requiſite, grace, Chriſt &amp; faith. The free grace of God is the <hi>prime or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive cauſe</hi> of man's ſalvation; the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt is the ſole <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi>; and <hi>faith in him,</hi> is the qualification
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012330_0022_0F88C931F137FDA8"/>
required in thoſe that receive this ſalvation, and is that by which alone the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to any for juſtification.</p>
            <p>Faith, in the ſimple notion of it, is an aſſen, or perſuaſion of the mind relating to any truth upon the teſtimony of others. The object of chriſtian faith is the revealed word of God, eſpecially the goſpel of Chriſt and his apoſtles. It is, as the apoſtle phraſes it, "the belief of the truth as it is in Jeſus." But all that believe Chriſt and his goſpel, are not poſſeſſed of ſaving faith. When our Saviour preached to the Jews at Bethany, "many of the chief rulers believed on him:" But they ſtill remained in a ſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and <hi>loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God.</hi> John 12.43. And ſuch is the faith of many profeſſing chriſtians at this day. It is hiſtorical &amp; ſpeculative only; it is the reſult of education, rather than a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and pious confidence in the teſtimony of God, and does but faintly affect their hearts, and influence their actions. It may rather be ſaid of them, that they do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe the goſpel, or do not concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about it, whether it be true or not, than that they have a poſitive belief of it, or a firm perſuaſion of the truth of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant matters contained in it. But he who is the ſubject of ſaving faith, hath a realizing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012330_0022_0F88C931F137FDA8"/>
and affecting view of ſpiritual things. He receives the truths of the goſpel, "not as the word of man but as the word of God," and relies on Chriſt alone for ſalvation. The eyes of his underſtanding being enlightned, he is enabled to view divine truths in their ſpirituality and importance, as what intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern him, and ought ſuitably to affect him. The natural product of this faith is love to God, and delight in his worſhip and obedience. It is a faith that <hi>works by love, and purifies the heart.</hi> It is a faith that <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh the world</hi>; ſo as that the ſubject of it is not <hi>conformed unto this evil world,</hi> but is <hi>transformed by the renewing of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi> For <hi>whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> ſays the apoſtle John, <hi>is born of God:</hi> And <hi>whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> does not allow himſelf in known tranſgreſſions, but <hi>keepeth himſelf,</hi> and is careful to conform his converſation to the example of Chriſt, and the precepts of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Thus the true chriſtian faith, or that faith which juſtifies and ſaves, is ſuch a firm and realizing perſuaſion of the truth of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as powerfully influences the heart and affections, and diſpoſes to a chearful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with all the divine commands. Such
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012330_0023_0F88C9325AFB2290"/>
was the faith of <hi>Abraham, the father of the faithful,</hi> who "by faith, when he was called to go out unto a place which he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards receive for an inheritance, <hi>obeyed.</hi>" And ſuch was the faith of all the ancient Patriarchs, as the apoſtle to the Hebrews ſhews at large;—and this is the faith which the apoſtle James ſhews to be neceſſary to our juſtification. We are not juſtified by a <hi>dead</hi> and unactive faith, but by ſuch a faith as is a lively and powerful principle of holy actions, as exerts and evidences itſelf by good works, as is declared in the 2d chapter of St. James's epiſtle. St. Paul likewiſe aſſures us, that <hi>all,</hi> whatever their belief is, "who obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power." 2 Theſſ. 1.9. Works of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then, or the bleſſed fruits of faith, are the beſt and only ſure evidence by which <hi>the faith of God's elect,</hi> may be diſcerned from the faith of ſuch as remain in an unjuſtified ſtate. And that <hi>faith</hi> in this view of it, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which the ſaving benefits of Chriſt's mediation are conferred upon us, or the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification required in order to our being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, and admitted to eternal life, is evident from ſcripture, and from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing. John 3.36. <hi>He that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012330_0023_0F88C9325AFB2290"/>
believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life; but he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> In the Greek it is, "he that <hi>obeyeth</hi> not the Son," without which none does truly and ſavingly believe. It is neceſſary that mens hearts ſhould be <hi>purified by faith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be fitted for the holy enjoyments of heaven. By faith they realize things not ſeen, conquer the world in their affections, and look ſupremely at God and heaven:— It is <hi>through faith</hi> then that any <hi>are ſaved.</hi> But here leſt we miſtake, it is neceſſary that we make a proper diſtinction. Though <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> only are juſtified and ſaved; yet their believing is not the meritorious cauſe of their ſalvation. It is not for the ſake of any thing that the perſon is or has, that he is acquitted from guilt, and admitted into favour and happineſs with God: But the reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds wholly from the free grace of God, and is conferred ſolely on account, or in conſideration of the righteouſneſs wrought out by Jeſus Chriſt. Faith is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as ſubordinate to theſe. For if we rely on our faith as that in the ſole virtue of which we ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, or as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration entitling us to theſe, we do as truly make void the grace of God, and the death of Chriſt, as if we relied on the merit of our
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012330_0024_0F88C932F4066BA0"/>
works to ſave us. Unerring wiſdom has ſeen fit to conſtitute his plan of mercy, as that the ſaving benefits of redemption ſhould be conferred only on ſuch as believe on him; not becauſe their faith has any merit or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in itſelf to procure theſe benefits; but becauſe it is moſt ſuitable to the honor of his majeſty, to confer them on ſuch as believe on, and truſt in, the proffer'd Saviour, rather than on ſuch as deſpiſe and reject him. "Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God." "Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved." I proceed now to conſider the</p>
            <p>IIId and laſt thing propoſed from the text, viz. To ſhew how, or in what ſenſe this faith is ſaid truly and properly to be the <hi>gift of God.</hi> But here by the way, I would juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that this laſt part of the text is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſomewhat ambiguouſly (as well in the original as in our tranſlation) and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly expoſitors differ in their interpretation of it. Some [as Poole, Clarius, &amp;c.] refer the laſt words, "it is the gift of God," to the whole preceeding ſentence: "By grace ye are ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," &amp;c.—and ſo underſtand it, that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the gift of God.—Others again [as Henry, Grotius, Burkitt, &amp;c.] refer it to the ſubſtantive immediately foregoing, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that what the apoſtle deſigned to affirm,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012330_0024_0F88C932F4066BA0"/>
was, that the faith through which we are ſaved, <hi>is the gift of God.</hi> I ſhall prefer the latter ſenſe as it is the common acceptation, and as it is agreable to what this ſame apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who is the beſt interpreter of his own meaning, ſays in another place, Phil. 1.29. "Unto you it is <hi>given,</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> on him." So that what I have to enquire into is, how this <hi>faith</hi> by which we are juſtified and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is <hi>the gift of God</hi>; or in what ſenſe it is properly ſaid to be the gift of God? To this I anſwer—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively. Faith is not ſo the gift of God, as to prevent or ſet aſide the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of all endeavours of our own to obtain it. It is very plain from the whole tenor of ſcripture, from the exhortations, commands, promiſes and threatnings, which are found in almoſt every page, eſpecially of the new Teſtament. It is very evident from theſe, I ſay, and will appear ſo to every one, that peruſes them, with a careful and impartial eye, that we are not to ſit idle and indulge ourſelves in ſin, 'till God ſhall ſee fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with this ſaving virtue; but that we are to be up and doing, exercing ourſelves and faculties in the uſe of thoſe means, which God has appointed to fit us, for the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his grace and ſpirit, and by which alone he <hi>ordinarily</hi> communicates them.—
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012330_0025_0F88C933AA556ED0"/>
Why elſe are we ſo often called upon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, repent, &amp;c. and threatned with aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated damnation if we comply not? Why does he not rather ſay to us, as to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites at the red, ſea, "<hi>Stand ſtill,</hi> &amp; ſee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lord?" This were more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſuitable language to be addreſſed to us, if there is nothing for us to do preparatory to, or in concurrence with, the ſaving work of the Spirit in our ſouls, than that which we find in the new Teſtament, "Repent and believe the goſpel—and he that believeth not ſhall be damned—He that hath ears to hear, let him <hi>hear</hi>—Conſider the mighty works and miracles wrought among you, &amp; be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by them to believe on me, otherwiſe it ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than for you—ſtrive to enter into the ſtrait gate;" and innumerable other texts of like import. When the Jailor in conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation beſought Paul &amp; Silas, what he ſhould <hi>do</hi> to be ſaved, they did not tell him that he had nothing <hi>to do</hi> but ſit ſtill, 'till God ſhould work faith in him; but their anſwer was, "Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved." So when Simon the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer by his avaritious and mercenary diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition proved himſelf to be "in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity." The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012330_0025_0F88C933AA556ED0"/>
in order that he might be extricated from this woful ſtate, does not adviſe him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dolence and inactivity, and a contempt of the inſtituted means, as of no avail with God; but he directs him to "repent of this his wickedneſs, and to pray to God, if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him." Let us now ſee whether the apoſtles in this reſpect taught any thing different from what their great Lord and maſter taught before them. In the 6th chapter of John at the 27th verſe, we find our bleſſed Saviour exhorting the people to "labour for the meat that endures unto everlaſting life." On which ſome of his ſurrounding audience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to him this queſtion, "What ſhall we do that we may work the works of God?" Jeſus anſwered, "This is the work of God," or this is the work which God requires of you, "that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent." Now if God in the beſtowment of faith ſuperſedes all human exertions, why does Chriſt mention it as a work required of them? Why does he not rather ſay, This is what God requires of you, that you wait in carnal indolence and ſloth, 'till you receive the irreſiſtible impulſe of the ſpirit of grace begetting faith in your hearts? Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears according to the doctrine of Chriſt and his apoſtles, that it is not only the duty of

Or <hi>in what way</hi> is it communicated to us? The apoſtle will reſolve this queſtion for us, "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." We are conſidered by
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012330_0026_0F88C9346A434660"/>
God as moral and accountable agents, as beings endued with underſtanding and will; and God requires that we make uſe of our rational faculties in matters of religion and faith. Otherwiſe what need have we of any written revelation at all, if the belief of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths is wrought in us wholly by the more compendious way of divine illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Particularly, of what uſe are the many miracles wrought in confirmation of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, if not to convince us by rational evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? It is on theſe that Chriſt himſelf reſts the ground of our faith on him. "If I do not the works of my father, ſays he, <hi>believe me not</hi>; but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the father is in me, and I in him." John 10.37, 38. Why is it ſo frequently recorded of the apoſtles that they <hi>reaſoned</hi> with their hearers, <hi>proving</hi> from the ſcriptures, &amp;c. that Jeſus was the Chriſt, if faith is wrought in us by the Spirit without the uſe of our own faculties and powers? If we are not to apply our diligence to reading and hearing the word, and to weigh in our minds the proofs offered for our rational convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the multitude of miracles wrought by Chriſt and his apoſtles, were to no end, and the works themſelves, as well as the records of them, are wholly ſuperfluous. But this
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012330_0027_0F88C9352922C300"/>
cannot be. Beſides, if there is nothing leſt for us to do, how do we incur ſo great gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by not believing? And how ſhall we qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God of injuſtice, when he ſays, "He that believeth not ſhall be damned?" If there is nothing required of us, we cannot certainly merit eternal puniſhment for doing nothing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that we may farther ſee the conſiſtency between <hi>human endeavours,</hi> and the aſſertion in the text, let us conſider, that God is ſaid in ſcripture to be the <hi>giver,</hi> not only of <hi>faith,</hi> but <hi>of every good and perfect gift.</hi> Our corn and wine, and whole bodily ſuſtenance, are as truly the gifts of God, as faith and other ſpiritual gifts. But as God does not in the ordinary courſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, confer theſe temporal gifts, but thro' human induſtry in the uſe of the means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to obtaining them, ſo alſo it is with the gifts of the ſpirit. They are not <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> conferred but only on ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to refrain from ſin, and to pleaſe God in the ways of his appointment. Not but that God <hi>ſometimes</hi> is "found of them that ſeek him not," as well in the obtaining of ſpiritual as of temporal favours. Thus it was with St. Paul, and many others in his day, and perhaps ſome in our's too. But as both ſcripture and experience abundantly teſtify, that this is not the <hi>ordinary</hi> way of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012330_0027_0F88C9352922C300"/>
God's dealing with men, we have no right or reaſon to expect the ſpiritual gifts of God, without the uſe of our own faculties and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. Nay this would be as abſurd, as for a man who is deſirous of getting an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to fit ſtill and wait for ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary interpoſition of providence in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. As ſome have been wrought upon, and converted by God, excluſive of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious endeavours, or wiſhes of their own, ſo ſome have grown rich excluſive of their own pains and foreſight: And both of them are extraordinary, and out of the common courſe of God's dealings with men. But I proceed in the</p>
            <p n="2">2d Place, to ſhew, poſitively, how this <hi>faith</hi> by which any are juſtified and ſaved, is truly and properly the <hi>gift of God.</hi> This I ſhall do in two or three particulars. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is God that gave the <hi>object of faith,</hi> viz. Chriſt and his goſpel. He who delights in the good and happineſs of his creatures, ſo ſoon as man had fallen and forfeited his favour, was pleaſed of his free and unſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted benevolence, to enter into a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, and conſtitute a mediator, through whom he might be juſt and yet the juſtifier of thoſe that ſhould believe in him. An early promiſe of this God gave to Adam, immediately after the fall, "that the ſeed of

               </gap> and holy obedience of his life, perfectly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the demands of the law; that ſo "the righteouſneſs of God might be by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the chriſtian life.</p>
            <p>All this was done without any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſollicitation or endeavours, on the part of man. As God therefore gave Chriſt, and his goſpel, to be believed by man, he may truly and juſtly be ſaid, to be the giver of the chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is the giver of faith, as he is the author of thoſe arguments which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to convince and perſuade the natural reaſon of men. God not only ſent his Son to publiſh the glad tidings of ſalvation, but he alſo accompanied his miſſion, with ſuch

glorious proofs and atteſtations as render all men inexcuſable who do not believe on him. Thus, by a voice from heaven, the manſion of his glory, he declared him to be his "beloved Son in whom he was well pleaſed." The Saviour through the whole courſe of his miniſtry, wrought by his divine power many great, ſignal and evident mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to confirm the faith of his diſciples, and that all men might have ſufficient evidence to believe on him: And to theſe he himſelf frequently appeals for the truth of his divine miſſion. And after his aſcenſion his apoſtles were enabled, by the effuſion of the holy Spirit on them, to work miracles in his name, for the conviction of the world: "God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bearing witneſs to the truth of their preaching, both with ſigns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt." But the greateſt outward teſtimony, which the Spirit of God has given of the truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt's miſſion, is, <hi>his reſurrection from the dead.</hi> By this "he was declared to be the Son of God with power." St. Paul, in his ſermon at Athens, having mentioned the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant article of a future judgment by Jeſus Chriſt, gives this as the confirmation of it, "whereof he hath <hi>given aſſurance</hi> unto all men, in that he hath <hi>raiſed him from the dead.</hi>" In the original it is, "given <hi>faith</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:012330_0029_0F88C93852BBC2D8"/>
to all men." Acts 17.31. Thus God is <hi>the giver of faith,</hi> as he gives thoſe means and arguments by which faith, as a rational conviction, is wrought in the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly and laſtly. Faith is the gift of God, more eſpecially in reſpect to the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> by which this faith is produced in the heart, and without the inward efficacy and operation of which, it never becomes an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding and effectual perſuaſion and principle of holineſs in any perſon. It is the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> that worketh in us the <hi>work of faith with power</hi>; and not the mere exertion of our natural faculties, which being depraved and diſabled by ſin, are inſufficient for this work. But then the method ordinarily made uſe of by the ſpirit of holineſs in working faith in the hearts of men, is not immediate inſpiration, or a mere ſupernatural and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible impulſe, in which man is wholly and entirely paſſive; but a proper improving and directing theſe faculties we already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, concurring with them, and propounding proper means and motives to them. The ſpirit does not implant in our minds any new faculties or powers which we had not before, neither does it infuſe into them any new truths, beſides them contained in the holy Bible, which is a perfect rule of faith and manners. But by the Spirit of God ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

underſtandings are ſtrengthned, &amp; the truths of the goſpel propoſed to them in a new and ſtriking light. "The eyes of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings being enlightned, that we may know what is the hope of his calling," &amp;c. By the Spirit, the arguments or evidence of the chriſtian faith are propounded, and our minds held fixt and intent on the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: The prejudices of our minds againſt the goſpel are removed, our luſts and paſſions ſuppreſſed, and our minds freed from the wrong bias they induce. By the Spirit our faculties, though not materially changed, are refined, purified, and freed from that deprevation which ſin has brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>It is by ſuch means as theſe, generally, that the Spirit of holineſs works faith in the hearts of men, and not by ſuch an irreſiſtible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe as ſupercedes the uſe of our own facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and endeavours. We cannot, on the one hand, by our own ſtrength alone, produce a ſaving faith in our hearts, or change in our ſouls; the influence and operation of the holy Spirit (which by the promiſe of God will not be withheld from our ſincere endeavours and requeſts) is abſolutely requiſite: And on the other hand, the concurrence of our own powers and endeavours, is ſo neceſſary as to render us abſolutely inexcuſable, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

Your labour will all be vain and fruitleſs, unleſs God concur with your endeavours, grant you refreſhing ſhowers, and the warm influences of the heavens, to draw forth, quicken and mature the ſeed you ſow. But was this ever conſidered by any as a good reaſon, why he ſhould ſit ſtill and not labour at all? Do you not all induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly purſue the means ſuited to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired end, and leave the event to providence?

But though you all think your labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry reaſonable in this inſtance, yet herein you act with much leſs certainty of ſucceſs, than in that I am perſuading you to.

            <p>But the things with which we are chiefly converſant here on earth, are <hi>material</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, deſtitute of any incorporeal ſubſtance. Man is a compound of both. He is the bond
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012330_0032_0F88C93A716D7CF8"/>
of union between the two worlds of body and ſpirit: An immaterial ſoul, being in him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by ſome inconceivable bands, connected with a material body. How unimbodied ſpirits perceive and know things, we cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But we, while we exiſt in theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, derive through <hi>them</hi> our moſt perfect knowledge of external things. We ſee, hear, and feel the objects around us, and thereby come to the infallible knowledge of, their exiſtence, and theſe ideas being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the mind, the immaterial ſoul can reflect on them, and judge and reaſon about them. But as to ſuch things as are of a ſpiritual nature, and ſo fall not under the cognizance of our bodily ſenſes, or things that are at ſuch a diſtance as to be beyond the reach of ſight and ſenſe, our knowledge of them is leſs diſtinct and certain: They are not the objects of ſenſe, but of faith, which is a ſomewhat leſs degree of evidence than that of ſenſe. When we ſee any thing plainly exiſting before our eyes, we do not ſay we <hi>believe</hi> that ſuch a thing is, but we know it, becauſe we have the greateſt and ſureſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it that we can poſſibly have of any thing. But when we determine concerning any thing of a ſpiritual nature, or any thing that exiſts or is tranſlated beyond the reach of our ſenſes, our evidence or knowledge of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012330_0032_0F88C93A716D7CF8"/>
this is called faith, and we ſay that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it exiſts, or is ſo and ſo. And this evidence of faith ariſes not from ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration (for then it would not be faith, but fight): But it ariſes from the moral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability or certainty of the thing, or elſe from the teſtimony of ſome other perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And ſo that the certainty of the thing to be believed is greater and more infallible, according as the moral evidence of it, or the reaſons drawn from the thing, are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, or as the perſon on whoſe teſtimony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e receive it, is more <hi>credible</hi> and <hi>able</hi> to give a certain account. It is thus that the apoſtle defines faith, making a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and fight; faith is not the evidence of things ſeen, but "the evidence of things not ſeen." Heb. 11.1. It is alſo called "the ſubſtance, or confident expectation of things <hi>hoped</hi> for:" Which muſt evidently mean things future and <hi>inviſible</hi>; for "hope that is ſeen is not hope: For what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for? But, we have hope for that we ſee not." Having thus ſhewn what is the evident meaning of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, in his deſcription of the chriſtian walk in the text, which is by faith, not by fight; we will proceed to a more diſtinct conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the words. In which I ſhall attempt to ſhew the four following things, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:012330_0033_0F88C93D53888CA0"/>I. To prove the truth of the propoſition, that chriſtians walk by faith, and not by ſight.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew the reaſons why we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was ſo ordered by God, or the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior advantange of ſuch a conſtitution to any other.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Shew that ſuch a repreſentation of the chriſtian walk, does not weaken the ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of our faith, or the certainty we have of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That it is both our duty and intereſt to walk by faith, and not by ſight.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſhew, that the chriſtian life is a life of faith, or that chriſtians in this world walk by faith and not by ſight.</p>
            <p>All who direct their walk chiefly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God and the things of another world, which are beyond the ken of our bodily ſenſes, (as all true chriſtians do) are properly ſaid to direct their walk by <hi>faith.</hi> For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have a full perſuaſion of theſe things by faith, they have no evidence of them at all; and ſo it is highly abſurd, as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the nature of things, that they ſhould make theſe the aim and end of our conduct. For who would take pains to pleaſe a being of whoſe exiſtence they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Eſpecially if this command thwarted their natural, though corrupt inclinations. Or who would deny himſelf any preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012330_0033_0F88C93D53888CA0"/>

               </gap>s it is the character of all true chriſtians ſo to do, it is evident that they firmly and on good grounds <hi>believe</hi> theſe, though they ſee them not. Like the Patriarchs of old, they live and "die in faith, not having yet receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off by an eye of faith, they are perſuaded of them, and embrace them, and ſo confeſs that they are but ſtrangers and pilgrims on earth." Even in reſpect of God, though wherever we turn our eyes we behold his footſteps, the marks and traces of his infinite wiſdom, power and goodneſs, which furniſh us with undeniable evidence of his exiſtence; yet ſtill this is the evidence of faith and not of ſight: For "no man hath ſeen God at any time." The ſupreme Jehovah, "who only hath immortality, dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen or can ſee. "None can ſee his face and live" in theſe bodies. "Oh that I knew where I might find him, ſays Job, that I might come even to his ſeat!—Behold I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: He hideth himſelf on the right hand that I

Thus we ſee that the chriſtian in reſpect to the ground, the evidence, and the end of his courſe walks by faith and not by fight.

            <p>Some will think thus. The evidence of ſenſe is certainly a ſtronger degree of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and more ſolid ground of aſſent, than the evidence of faith. Since then the things of God and another world are indiſputably of the utmoſt importance to us; why has not God made them matters of ſenſible and ocular demonſtration, that every one might ſee and know them to be true? Why are we not made to behold the <hi>inviſible things of God</hi> directly and ſenſibly, and not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>they</hi> would mark out, would inevitably be much greater, than the ſuppoſed advantages of it. For, not to argue from the wiſdom of God, who does all things for the beſt, nor from the nature of man, who (as I have ſaid in the beginning of this diſcourſe) cannot whilſt he is incorporated in fleſh, view ſpiritual things by immediate intuition. To wave theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012330_0036_0F88C93FB0B65640"/>
I ſay, making the objects of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith to become matters of <hi>ſenſible</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, would be attended with theſe two plain bad conſequences. It would wholly deſtroy the virtue of faith, and would hinder this life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being properly a probationary ſtate. It would make faith of no value. For ſuppoſe every man in this life was admitted to a view of the heavenly manſions, and ſaw with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cries and groans of the damned; or ſuppoſe we could for one moment feel theſe tormenting pains: We ſhould certainly in this caſe be convinced of theſe things by irreſiſtible evidence, and there would be no room left for the exerciſe of faith. For what virtue would it be in any one to believe theſe things, when he had felt ſuch ſenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of them? The beſt faith that could be exerciſed under ſuch circumſtances by
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012330_0036_0F88C93FB0B65640"/>
man, would have no more virtue in it ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than that of the <hi>devils,</hi> who <hi>believe and tremble</hi>; for faith in this caſe would not be virue but neceſſity, where then would be the diſtinction between the believer and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, good and bad, righteous and wicked? All would be unavoidably excited by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principle of ſelf-preſervation to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fly from the pains which they ſaw or felt, and to ſeek God, without any holineſs perhaps or love to him in their hearts. And ſuch a forc'd obedience as this, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be of no value in the ſight of God, who requires the whole heart. Thus there would be no room for trial and probation in this life; no place for the exerciſe of an holy and divine faith, or pure and unconſtrained acts of obedience, but all would be violently and irreſiſtibly compelled. The ſame may be ſaid of the other objects of the chriſtian faith, as of future rewards and puniſhments: If they were the objects of ſight and ſenſe, they could not properly be the objects of faith, and ſo not fitted to our ſtate on earth. When Thomas, one of the apoſtles, would not be convinced of the truth of Chriſt's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection without the evidence of ſenſe, our Saviour condeſcended to grant him ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, but did not pronounce him bleſſed, becauſe his faith, after having ſeen and felt

            <p>We have ſufficient aſſurance of the truths of religion, though the objects of it are not viſible to ſenſe.

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012330_0037_0F88C9406BC717A0"/>
work of none but God; when we behold and conſider theſe things, I ſay, we are, I about not, as fully ſatisfied of the exiſtence of a Deity, as if he made himſelf viſible to our bodily eyes: That none but David's fool, who wilfully ſhuts his eyes, can even ſay in his heart, there is no God. The many things revealed to us in the word of God, and the truth of revelation itſelf, though they are matters of faith, yet we may be fully and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt convinced of the truth of them. For if we have all the demonſtration of the truth of any thing to be proved by moral evidence, which the caſe and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the thing will admit of, and all the evidence &amp; aſſurance we could have received, ſuppoſing the thing was true, we have no more reaſon to doubt it, than to diſpute the exiſtence of any ſenſible object, when we ſee it with our eyes. This is the caſe with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of divine revelation. We believe them becauſe we have all the evidence of them that they are capable of. We receive them on no leſs evidence than the teſtimony of God himſelf that cannot lie: Who to convince us has foretold many things that we have ſeen are ſince fulfilled; who has wrought many miracles to confirm our faith, accounts of which have been delivered down to us by the inconteſted and concurring report of

Thus we ſee that though chriſtians walk by faith and not by ſight, yet they are not without ſufficient certainty, but have light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to diſpel all doubt, and by the concurrence of divine grace, to work in them what the apoſtle calls <hi>a full aſſurance of faith.</hi> I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. and laſtly. It is the <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> of all chriſtians <hi>to walk by faith and not by ſight,</hi> or to direct their courſe by the things which they believe, and not by things of ſenſe. They are chiefly to regard and look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are temporal. It is their duty not only to believe theſe things and rely upon
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012330_0038_0F88C94138857B80"/>
them as true, but alſo to think and act agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch a belief. That is they are always to bear on their minds, a ſenſe of the reality and infinite importance of thoſe things, how nearly themſelves are concerned in them, and how certainly their future ſtate will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by their preſent belief of them and care about them. They ought ſeriouſly and frequently to meditate on the being and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, his univerſal preſence and providence; to read and ſtudy his word of truth, and to reſign themſelves to his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, with faith unfeigned: They are daily to walk more humbly and cloſely with God, and to pray him through Jeſus Chriſt to increaſe and ſtrengthen their faith, and to make it more and more influential and operative in their lives. It is the duty of all that profeſs themſelves chriſtians, to neglect the things of ſight and ſenſe, in compariſon of future and inviſible things; to riſe above the world, and the vanities of it; to free their ſouls from an undue attachment to the vain and fleeting joys of time and ſenſe, and to ſet their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on things of a heavenly nature, the ſervice and glory of God, the unſeen plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of immortality, and joys beyond the grave. Thus ſhould they demonſtrate by the whole tenor of their converſation, that they prefer heaven to earth, the pleaſures of

If we have attained to a full aſſurance of faith and hope, we ſhall <hi>know</hi> with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, "that when the earthly houſe of this tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, we have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." "Therefore," ſaith the apoſtle in the verſes preceeding and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the text, "we are always confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord: (For we walk by faith, not by ſight) we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord. Wherefore we labour, that whether we are preſent or abſent, we may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him." True faith <hi>purifies the heart,</hi> Acts 15.9. and ſo qualifies the ſubject of it to enjoy pure and ſpiritual happineſs at God's right hand: A happineſs refined from all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ys of ſin and ſenſe, and conferred as the reward only of believers, who through <hi>faith</hi> and patience inherit the promiſes. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſtrengthen in us, and conduct our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by, this great principle of the chriſtian life; if we bring the diſtant ſcenes of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity near to us by holy contemplation, fix on our thoughts the certainty and importance of them, and make them as if they were actually preſent before our eyes; if we <hi>walk and live by faith,</hi> as the men of this world do by ſenſe,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012330_0040_0F88C94430BD8DE8"/>
and are as ſerious and earneſt in the purſuit of the things of it, as they are of their ſenſual gratifications &amp; enjoyments, we ſhall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at laſt through the grace of God, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the end of our faith, even the ſalvation of our ſouls."</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that it is both the duty and happineſs of chriſtians to walk by faith, and not by fight; to look at things not ſeen, and not at things ſeen, to ſet their affections on things above, and not on things on the earth, and ſo to conduct themſelves by that <hi>faith by which the juſt ſhall live,</hi> by an unſhaken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in God, in Chriſt, and the things of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world, that their faith may not be vain, and their hope alſo vain; but that they may believe to the ſaving of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewn that the chriſtian life on earth is neceſſarily a life of faith and not of viſion, that this is the wiſe appointment of God, who hereby gives all due encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to faith and holineſs, and has afforded us ſufficient grounds for a confident perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that we ought accordingly to make our faith in God, and his word and promiſes, the chief directory of our chriſtian walk.

               <p>From what has been ſaid we ſee the reaſon why ſenſual and worldly men are ſo blind and averſe to the future concerns of their ſouls. It is becauſe theſe things are matters of faith, and not objects of ſight; and their minds are ſo ſenſualized, as not to reliſh any thing of a ſpiritual nature, nor purſue any thing that does not affect their ſenſes. The world and the things of it have engroſſed the whole of their affections and thoughts; and whilſt theſe poſſeſs the ſovereignty of the ſoul, they exclude from it all deſires and contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a ſerious &amp; heavenly nature.

The carnal man walks only by ſight, and knows not how to direct his courſe by faith of things not ſeen. The concerns of a future ſtate appear at a great diſtance, to him that is uſed to contemplate only on preſent things; at ſo great a diſtance that he believes them not, or which amounts to the ſame thing, regards them not. Thus "the carnal mind" (or, as the apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it in another place, "the friendſhip of the world) is enmity with God." We ought therefore to "take diligent heed leſt there be in any of us an evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012330_0041_0F88C944FA837A18"/>
in departing from the living God." Though we ſee not now either the <hi>glories</hi> or the <hi>horrors</hi> of the inviſible world; yet ſince God that cannot lie, has promiſed the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hence alſo we ſee the unreaſonableneſs of all ſuch as diſbelieve the things of God and another world, becauſe they have not ſeen them. For it is impoſſible in the nature of the thing that they ſhould ſee theſe things whilſt they dwell in bodies of fleſh. Spirit and ſpiritual things being of too ſubtile and refined a nature to be diſcerned by our groſs corporeal organs. Beſides if they could be made to ſee them, ſtill it would be to no end. God having already done enough to convince the reaſon of every intelligent man who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the thing without prejudice. For if a man obſtinately ſtands out againſt all the arguments &amp; means of conviction which God has given, if he refuſes to hear Moſes and the Prophets, Chriſt and his apoſtles; if he will not hearken to the dictates of his own mind,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012330_0041_0F88C944FA837A18"/>
nor the ſuggeſtions of the holy Spirit; we have the reaſon of the thing, as well as the word of God to aſſure us, that he would not <hi>truely</hi> and <hi>stedfaſtly</hi> believe, tho' one of the bleſſed inhabitants of Heaven ſhould be deputed to declare to him in the language of glory, the being and will of God; or the one ſhould ariſe from the dead, array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the ghaſtly terrors of the pit, ſhould proclaim the dreadful condemnation of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate unbelievers. He would doubtleſs be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We ſee likewiſe the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, who has given ſufficient evidence of religious truths, for the ſatisfaction of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who is not prepoſſeſt, and bias'd by his paſſions and luſts; and has moreover promiſed to aſſiſt and conduct ſuch in their ſearch after truth.

               </gap>cal ſtate: That by this breach of the divine law, he loſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine image, forfeited God's favour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to his eternal diſpleaſure. But inſtead of our being doomed to ſuffer irretrievably that eternal death which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the breach of God's law, the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel brings us glad tidings of great joy. By this we are informed that God of his infinite mercy, and unconſtrained goodneſs, has deigned to ſend his own ſon, from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manſions of bliſs, where he ſhone coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal with the father, to this our polluted world, to ranſom us from ſin and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to bear the puniſhment of our ſins, and thereby render man's ſalvation conſiſtent with God's unerring juſtice. In the goſpel revelation, the plan of grace, the method of executing it, the benefits reſulting therefrom, and the terms on which we are to receive them are laid before us, and propoſed to our ſtudy and acquaintance. Here it is that we are to
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012330_0046_0F88C94A45A9F380"/>
learn our duty. Here are laid down the moſt excellent rules &amp; moſt important precepts for the direction of our conduct. And it is our incumbent and indiſpenſable duty to ſtudy theſe rules, and by a diligent inquiry, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ourſelves in whatever our great Creator, Lawgiver and Redeemer, requires of us. But we are not to reſt here. We are not only to ſearch out what our duty is, but muſt ſeriouſly and diligently ſet about the practice of it. Knowledge is abſolutely requiſite in order to practice, but in vain and uſeleſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. <hi>Uſeleſs</hi> did I ſay? Nay, it is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of our guilt; for "he that knows his maſter's will, and yet doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes." One deſign of our Saviour's appearing on earth, was to inſtruct men in the doctrines and duties of religion; for without ſuch inſtruction they could not partake of the benefits of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. This inſtruction he gave both by example &amp; precept. But he often inculcates it upon us, that we reſt not in the bare ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative knowledge of our duty, but that we be careful to reduce it to practice. "Learn of me," ſays he, and not only ſo, but "if ye love me keep my commandments."</p>
            <p>And here, in the text, he promiſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of happineſs to thoſe that not only <hi>know,</hi> but <hi>do</hi> what is commanded them.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012330_0047_0F88C94B149F05B0"/>
"If ye know theſe things, &amp;c." In this our Saviour takes occaſion from a particular inſtance, to ſettle a general maxim, viz that religion conſiſts mainly in <hi>practice,</hi> to which, nevertheleſs, knowledge is a pre-requiſite. In the preceeding verſes we are told, that Chriſt though Lord of glory, condeſcended to the low and ſervile office of <hi>waſhing his diſciples feet,</hi> thereby to teſtify his love to his diſciples, to give them an example of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſerviceableneſs, and to figure to them that ſpiritual waſhing which was neceſſary in order to their being cleanſed from the filth, and pollution of ſin, and being made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his holineſs. This ſervice being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, Chriſt inquires of them whether they knew the meaning of what he had done. On which he takes occaſion to explain it to them, and to exhort <hi>them</hi> to the like deeds of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and condeſcenſion, one towards another. Whence he eſtabliſhes this general concluſion, "if ye know theſe things," this duty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and the other chriſtian graces and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which I have taught you, "happy are are ye <hi>if ye do them.</hi>"—Though theſe words primarily refer to this particular duty, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to low and mean ſervices, for the ben fit of our brethren, yet as they may well be extended to the whole of religion, I ſhall conſider them in this enlarged view. In
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012330_0047_0F88C94B149F05B0"/>
which ſenſe theſe three propoſitions are either expreſſed or implied in them, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The knowledge of God's will, and our duty, is abſolutely neceſſary in order to our performing it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The knowledge of chriſtianity is vain and inſignificant, if not attended with prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The practice of religion, or doing what we know to be our duty, is the way, and the only way to happineſs. If ye know theſe things, <hi>happy</hi> are ye if ye <hi>do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The knowledge of God's will, and our duty, is abſolutely neceſſary in order to our performing it.</p>
            <p>This is implied in the text, "if ye know theſe things," which ſuppoſes that we muſt <hi>know them,</hi> before we can do them. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pemberton.</note> "All true religion begins with the underſtanding, from thence deſcends into the heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates our life and converſation." Unleſs we firſt learn what things are to be done by us, and what not, we cannot know when we do them, nor when we neglect them. We may ſometimes perhaps, through accident, do thoſe things which God requires of us, but then, ſince we do them not from a convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſuch things are our duty, ſince we do not perform them from love to God, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:012330_0048_0F88C94BC3F248D0"/>
from a deſign to glorify him, we do not do our duty, even whilſt we perform thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acts, which are required of us by God as duties. So that there muſt be knowledge prior to practice, in order to our perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any religious acts aright. Accordingly the apoſtle exhorts chriſtians to ſearch the ſcriptures, to let the word of God dwell in them richly, and to grow in grace, and in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of their Lord and Savior Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Would we be ſincerely religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and true diſciples of Chriſt, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint ourſelves with all the duties that are to be practiſed by us. We muſt ſtudy the ſcriptures with diligence and care, and uſe all neceſſary means, to find out the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. We muſt hear them explained from the pulpit, and diligently improve all the means of knowledge, which God has been graciouſly pleaſed to grant us. We muſt add to theſe, our own ſtricteſt inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and meditation, and pray for the divine aſſiſtance with us in our reſearches. But not only are the duties themſelves to be ſought out, but we muſt alſo conſider and know the obligations we are under to perform theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. We muſt conſider God as our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſovereign and lawgiver; muſt conſider ourſelves as his dependent creatures, indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for life, preſervation, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

By thus acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves with the obligations we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to do the will of God, we ſhall have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reſh inducements to practice it.</p>
            <p>We muſt likewiſe, previouſly to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the duties of chriſtianity, acquaint ourſelves with the manner in which they are to be done. The principles, the ends and deſigns from which we ought to act in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, muſt be duly ſettled in our minds. Love to God, and a deſire to pleaſe him, muſt be the chief ſprings of our conduct; and the divine glory the end at which we are to aim. But whilſt I mention theſe as the principles from which we ought to act, I do not mean to ſet aſide all views to our own happineſs, in religion. That is made by God himſelf, a motive of our conduct. And whilſt we ſerve God from the principles alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned, we unavoidably purſue our grand &amp; trueſt intereſt. That chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we are required to obtain, likewiſe includes the knowledge of our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012330_0049_0F88C94D64558F38"/>
and natural inability of ourſelves, to perform the duties of chriſtianity aright. We muſt ſettle it in our minds, that it is by the concurrent operations of the divine ſpirit that we are aſſiſted to perform the divine will in an acceptable manner. It is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us to know, that whatever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

They will be careful to ſearch into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of rendring themſelves and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct acceptable to God, and their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it.

            <p n="2">II. That the bare knowledge of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is vain, and inſignificant, if not attended with a ſuitable practice. The doing the will of God is ſo eſſential to the true knowledge of it, that the ſcriptures will hardly allow it to be called <hi>knowledge,</hi> unleſs it have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on our lives. For ſaith the apoſtle, "Hereby we <hi>know</hi> that we <hi>do know</hi> him, if we keep his commandments. He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him." 1 Joh. 2.3, 4. The Pſalmiſt alſo makes the practice of duty a proof of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it aright. "A good <hi>underſtanding</hi> have all they that <hi>do</hi> his commandments." Pſalm 111.10. Notwithſtanding the intimate and indiſſoluble connection there ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the knowledge and practice of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet we often ſee them unnaturally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ated.—Some ſtudy religion only as a ſcience, that they may appear learned, and know how to converſe upon divine ſubjects.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012330_0050_0F88C94DEBABE2C8"/>
They will often take upon them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with a dogmatical air the moſt abſtruſe doctrines in religion, and condemn thoſe who they pretend are ignorant or erroneous in them; whilſt they neglect the <hi>precepts</hi> of religion, and feel nothing of their influence.</p>
            <p>Others there are that take up religion merely for faſhion's ſake. Theſe will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read the ſcriptures, that they may be able to quote them on common occaſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they attend on the public worſhip, becauſe it is the cuſtom; and thus they learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the hiſtory of the bible, (and the doctrines of chriſtianity) without endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conform their lives to it. There are others again who make uſe of religion for worldly deſigns, to acquire the credit of men, to get an eſtate, &amp;c. Theſe are <hi>obliged</hi> to underſtand ſomething of religion, that they may know how to keep up the appearance of it: But they comply with the injunctions of it no farther than is neceſſary to anſwer their ſelfiſh deſigns. All theſe have a <hi>form of godlineſs,</hi> but deny the <hi>power</hi> of it; they <hi>know</hi> theſe things, but <hi>do</hi> them not. But the bare knowing of theſe things, will not be any advantage to them. For their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will not recommend them to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. They come under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe whom our Saviour ſpeaks of,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:012330_0050_0F88C94DEBABE2C8"/>
"who call him, Lord, Lord, but do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e things which he ſays." Let us hear the curſe that will be denounced againſt ſuch. Matt. 7.22. "Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that <hi>doth</hi> the will of my father which is in heaven. Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ye workers of iniquity." Though they knew Chriſt in their head, yet as they knew him not in their heart, Chriſt <hi>never knew them.</hi> There is not a place in the bible where the favour of God, or the gift of God, which is eternal life, are promiſed upon a mere ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative knowledge of him. And as this knowledge cannot procure the divine favor, nor future happineſs, ſo neither can it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure true peace and ſatisfaction of mind in this life. That conſciouſneſs of the divine favor here, and aſſurance of his approbation hereafter, which fills thoſe that are truly godly with joy and comfort, are unknown to the win pretender to religion. He is a ſtranger to the pleaſures of a virtuous courſe, and that comforting ſelf-approbation which attends the mere exerciſe of acts of piety and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012330_0051_0F88C90BEC9E0328"/>
The knowledge of God which he has will not qualify him for the enjoyment of him in the next life. For tho' we muſt acquaint ourſelves with God here, in order to be happy with him eternally, yet this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance muſt be not only in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but alſo in the heart and life. For "without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord." Nay ſo far will the bare knowledge of God's requirements be from benefiting us, that it will make us the more aggravatedly guilty, and conſequently more deplorably miſerable. He that conforms not to an unknown law, has ſome excuſe for his neglect; but if we ſin againſt the light we have no cloak for our ſin. "To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin." James 4.17. God will forgive ſuch tranſgreſſions of his law as proceed from unavoidable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but will ſeverely puniſh all wilful vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations of a known duty. For, ſaith our Saviour, "that ſervant that <hi>knew</hi> his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes: For "unto whomſoever much is given, of him much ſhall be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." The miſimprovement of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have been favoured with, will of itſelf neceſſarily aggravate our future torment. For nothing will more ſenſibly torment and
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012330_0051_0F88C90BEC9E0328"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing us in the other world, than this cutting reflection, that we wilfully rendred ourſelves miſerable, when we know better, and had the means of happineſs in our power. "For if we ſin wilfully, ſaith the apoſtle, after having received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin; but a certain fearful looking for of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fiery indignation, which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the adverſaries." So far then is the bare ſpeculative knowledge of religion from being an advantage to us, that it will deprive us of ſolid comfort and happineſs here, and increaſe our condemnation in the coming world. But,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>practice</hi> of religion, or <hi>doing</hi> what we know to be our duty, is the way, and the only way to happineſs. If ye know theſe things, &amp;c. The text don't ſay, if ye know theſe things, happy are ye; but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are ye if ye know and <hi>do</hi> them. Such as diligently improve all the opportunities, that God has put into their hands of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knowledge of him and their duty. Such as in good earneſt ſet about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their duty, with prayers to God for his aſſiſtance, and reſolution by divine grace to act agreable to what they ſhall find to be their duty: Such as in all reſpects, and at all times, endeavour to conform
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012330_0052_0F88C8F2B0E07768"/>
their temper and behaviour to what by the moſt diligent ſtudy, appears to them to be the will of God; and <hi>that</hi> with pleaſure and delight; with a view to pleaſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God, as well as to obey him, and with a ſpecial reference to Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Such</hi> will be <hi>happy,</hi> happy in the bleſſing and favor of God here on earth—happy in their own minds, and the approving teſtimony of their own conſciences—and happy in the compleat enjoyment of God throughout e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Both the divine promiſe and the nature of things, entitles them to happineſs in each of theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are happy in the favor &amp; bleſſing of God here on earth. This the apoſtle James declares, "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourſelves. For whoſoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed." Such ſhall be bleſſed with the enjoyment of worldly good things, ſo far as God ſees to be moſt for his glory, and beſt for them. "The Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them." A confluence of earthly enjoyments often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proves a ſnare to men; wherefore God often ſees it beſt that his faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012330_0052_0F88C8F2B0E07768"/>
ſhould not poſſeſs them. But even if they are deſtitute of theſe, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd in afflictions, ſtill God is merciful to them, extends his grace and favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, ſanctifies his afflictive diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to them, and ſo makes all things work together for their good. Thoſe that ſincerely endeavour, to conform their minds and actions to the will of God, enjoy his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and ſmiles here on earth; whereas they that know their duty, and are not careful to do it, are objects of his wrath and diſpleaſure. "For not the hearers of the law are juſt before God, but the <hi>doers</hi> of the law ſhall be juſtified." Rom. 2.13. Thus the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere chriſtian who uſes all poſſible means to <hi>know</hi> his duty, and applies his whole ſtrength to <hi>do</hi> it, is bleſſed and approved of God on earth, and is conſcious of pleaſing him. And on this account chiefly it is, that</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is happy in the peace of his own mind, and the approbation of his conſcience. There is nothing that affords a more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction to the mind of man than a conſciouſneſs of having done his duty. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe of this will ſupport him under all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſſes and inſults which the doing of his duty will expoſe him to, from the difficulty of the undertaking, or the malice of enemies. Though difficulties apparently inſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012330_0053_0F88C8F32D9A0AB0"/>
oppoſe themſelves in his way, though he incur the hatred, and draw upon him the ſlander and ridicule of men, yet the conſideration that he is engaged in what is his duty, and conſequently pleaſing to God, will afford him comfort and ſatisfaction of mind, and carry him through all attending difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in an inconceivable manner. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, nothing ſo troubles and diſquiets a man's mind, as the conſciouſneſs that what he is doing is diſpleaſing to God, and ſo a violation of his duty to him. Our actions conſidered only in themſelves, and in relation to this life, neceſſarily afford either ſatisfaction or diſſatisfaction, according as they are conformable to the will of God or not. But more eſpecially do they ſo, if we take into conſideration thoſe future rewards and puniſhments, which are the certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of them. Theſe hopes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approbation and reward hereafter, which men enjoy upon doing their duty; and that dread of future vengeance which attends the neglect and violation of it, greatly increaſe the ſerenity and joy of the active ſervants of Chriſt, and the grief and uneaſineſs of the vain profeſſors of his goſpel. To be happy in one's own mind, is the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can be enjoyed on this ſide heaven; and the way which our Saviour points out
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012330_0053_0F88C8F32D9A0AB0"/>
to us in the text, is the only way to ſecure this, viz. to learn and do our duty. But, moreover,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such as not only know, but <hi>do</hi> the will of God, will be happy in the eternal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. We are told by the inſpired Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 103.18. "The mercy of the Lord is <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting</hi> upon them that fear him; to ſuch as keep his covenant, and to thoſe that <hi>remember</hi> his commandments to <hi>do</hi> them." Not to ſuch as barely <hi>remember</hi> his commandments, but to ſuch as <hi>remember</hi> them <hi>to do them.</hi> This is the account which the bible gives us of the matter, from one end of it to the other. "If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?" ſays God to Cain. And in the laſt chapter of the revelations Chriſt ſays, "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work ſhall be.—Bleſſed are they that <hi>do</hi> his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." If a man attend to the doctrine of Chriſt, and gain the knowledge of it, without governing his life by it, his hopes of heaven are vain and groundleſs, built as it were upon the ſand. The difference of the hopes of him that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his duty, and of him that negligently hears it, is thus admirably expreſſed by our
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012330_0054_0F88C8F3EAF07268"/>
Saviour: "Whoſoever hears theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken to a wiſe man that built his houſe upon a rock; and the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock: And every one that hears theſe ſayings of mine and doth them not, ſhall be likened to a fooliſh man, that built his houſe upon the ſand; and the rain deſcended, &amp;c. and it fell, and great was the fall of it." The hopes of him who has a practical knowledge of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, ſhall brave the utmoſt efforts of malice, ſhall firmly ſtand the ſtorms of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and floods of perſecution: While the hopes of him whoſe knowledge is theoretical or ſpeculative only, ſhall fail and ſink under the leaſt trial. Though it is not on account of what we do that eternal life is conferred on us (for it is the meritorious obedience and ſufferings of Chriſt that have opened heaven to us) yet without our performing the duties of chriſtianity, or unleſs we exerciſe that faith and repentance, and ſhew forth that ſincere obedience, which the goſpel requires, <hi>we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved.</hi> For knowledge alone will not fit us for heaven. It is a conformity to God in heart and actions, that renders us like him, and ſo capable of enjoying him. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. TILLOTSON.</note> "If a

So ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi>" Thus we ſee that the <hi>practice of religion</hi> is the way, and the only way to happineſs in this, and the future life; which is what I was laſt to ſhew. I ſhall now make a ſhort improvement of the whole, and ſo conclude. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Since <hi>knowledge</hi> is ſo neceſſary in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, how thankful ſhould we be to God that he has granted us the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? The holy ſcriptures are profitable for doctrine, and for inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and theſe God has graciouſly given into our hands, tranſlated into our own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and made intelligible to us by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of perſons ſkilled in the original tongues. So that we need not make that
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012330_0055_0F88C8F4AB0F7BB8"/>
inquiry, "Who ſhall aſcend into heaven? i. e. to bring Chriſt down from above. Or who ſhall deſcend into the depths? i e. to bring up Chriſt again from the dead. For behold, the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart." How thankful ſhould we be, that we are allowed the free uſe of thoſe ſacred writings, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the doctrines and precepts of ſalvation? That they are not prohibited the loweſt of the people, nor lock'd up from them in an unknown tongue, as in ſome popiſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but that we have been taught from our infancy to read, and to ſtudy them, and to hear the explanations of them. How thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ought we to be for ſabbath opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? For the proviſion God has made in his church of a ſtanding miniſtry, whereby the truths of the goſpel are propoſed, and his precepts inculcated on our minds; wherein by his ambaſſadors, Chriſt himſelf beſeeches us to be reconciled to God, and calls upon us to repent, turn, and live. What praiſes and thankſgivings ſhould we render to God, for the ſpirit of grace, whereby if we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m at doing our duty, our minds will be enlightened in the knowledge of Chriſt, and we <hi>led</hi> into all truth. For, ſaith Chriſt, "if any man be deſirous to do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012330_0055_0F88C8F4AB0F7BB8"/>
I ſpeak of myſelf." Whereas "if the goſpel be hid from any, it is hid to them that are loſt; in whom the god of this world hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inded the minds of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, ſhould ſhine unto them." So that if any man ſearches the ſcriptures with an honeſt heart, and with ſincere deſires to learn and do the will of God, God will graciouſly aſſiſt him, and by the illuminations of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, lead him into the knowledge of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truth. "The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way." The goodneſs of God in this reſpect calls for our ſincere and unfeigned thanks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How inexcuſeable ſhall we be if we do not improve thoſe means of knowledge, in ſtudy and in practice? The heathen, who were never favoured with the light of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as we are, will by a plea of ignorance, receive at leaſt a mitigation of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But <hi>we</hi> cannot exculpate ourſelves by pleading ignorance at the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of God. For ſince God has put us into a capacity of learning our duty; though we ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the means of knowledge, and remain as ignorant of the divine will as the heathen world, yet our ignorance would not ſerve for our excuſe, at the great day. For God
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012330_0056_0F88C8F73A9888B8"/>
offers inſtruction to us if we will receive it, but we wilfully oppoſe it. And the breach of duties of which we are <hi>wilfully</hi> ignorant, is equally as blame-worthy as the breach of, duties which we knew to be commanded by God. Wherefore when I ſay that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of duties unperformed, will aggravate our puniſhment, let none think to alleviate his condemnation by obſtinately perſiſting in ignorance of his duty. For the obſtinate neglect of learning his duty, will render him as guilty in the ſight of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as miſerable, as the not performing his duty when known. Wherefore we ſee how deſtitute we are of all excuſe, if we do not make uſe of thoſe means which God has graciouſly favoured us with, and by divine grace, learn and practice what is required of us. God has done his part towards inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. He has granted us his word, and offers us his ſpirit, to enlighten our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and lead us in the way of truth. Whom then have we to blame but ourſelves, if we at laſt ſuffer the aggravated condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe who have <hi>choſen darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light, becauſe their deeds were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?</hi> Since then we cannot be acquitted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a plea of ignorance, for our own non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the divine will; what excuſe ſhall we offer? Shall we plead our natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:012330_0056_0F88C8F73A9888B8"/>
and inability to perform the duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us? Neither will this pretence ſtand us in ſtead. For tho' our natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility and impotence is great, yet God has promiſed us his ſpirit to help our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, if we ſincerely aſk it of him, and are deſirous to practiſe his will. If to our ſincere endeavours we add our earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for aſſiſtance, his ſtrength will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us; and through his ſtrengthning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s we can do all things. "Does any man lack wiſdom" to direct, or ſtrength to aſſiſt him in the way of his duty, "Let him aſk it of God, who gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it ſhall be given him." <hi>But,</hi> it follows, "let him aſk in faith, nothing wavering." Our Savior declares that God is more ready to grant his holy Spirit to thoſe that thus aſk, than earthly parents are to give portions to their children. So that neither the plea of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> nor <hi>inability</hi> will ſerve to excuſe us at the bar of God, for our neglecting the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion. But if from principles of love to God and faith in Chriſt, we ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cheerfully endeavour, to perform whatever we can find to be our duty, our obedience tho' mix'd with many imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, will through the merits of Chriſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and rewarded. And this is the only
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012330_0057_0F88C8F7C686A398"/>
way wherein we can be acquitted, in the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God, when he ſhall render to every man according to his works, and according to the fruit of his doings.</p>
            <p>Finally, ſince we here ſee the road to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs marked out to us, let us all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to purſue it. Let us lay aſide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very weight, and the ſin that does moſt eaſily beſet us, and run with patience the race ſet before us. Let us be zealous and reſolute in diſcharging the duties of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, that we may become the approved ſervants of Chriſt. Let no difficulties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us, no dangers affright us from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our duty; if we are the diſciples of Chriſt, we muſt imitate him as in other things, ſo in bearing the croſs. "Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf," &amp;c. We muſt expect to meet with many croſſes, difficulties, and diſappointments in our chriſtian warfare. But conſidering the end of our faith, the prize of victory, and him under whoſe banner we ſerve, let us cloath ourſelves with the whole armour of God, and with undaunted fortitude fight the good fight of faith, looking unto Jeſus the captain of our ſalvation, who himſelf for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is now

Athens was at this time famed throughout the world for learning and arts, which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed here in the greateſt perfection and luſtre, and which rendred this city the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs

of Greece and of the world, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of all learned men for ſeveral ages, 'till Rome rivalled her and eclipſed her glory. But however eminent the Athenians were for human knowledge, the holy apoſtle found the city wholly given to idolatry, which ſhewed their groſs ignorance in divine and heavenly things. To reclaim them from their idols to the ſervice of the living God, in the deſign and tendency of this diſcourſe of the apoſtle, which we find in the text and context. From the 18th verſe we learn that the apoſtle had been diſputing with ſome of their philoſophers and wiſe men, particularly of the epicurean and ſtoic ſects. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of whom, though they did not deny a God, yet they made him an idle and uſeleſs being, for they held the world to be made and governed by chance, that God took no cognizance of the affairs of men, and that the pleaſures of the world conſtituted the ſupreme happineſs of man. Thus their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples tended directly to the diſhonour of God, and the uncontroled indulgence of all manner of vice and immorality. The latter ſect, the ſtoics, allowed both the being and providence of God, but ſuppoſed him to be of a corporeal ſubſtance, and that his hands were tied up by the rigid &amp; inflexible laws of fate: And their fancied wiſe men, who had
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012330_0059_0F88C8F92B114C90"/>
wholly eradicated their paſſions, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely extolled as equal to God himſelf. Theſe men it was that oppoſed Paul with their falſe notions and ſophiſtic reaſonings, and carried him before the above-named <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ourt, there demanding his farther explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was probably done from an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curioſity of hearing ſome new notions or opinions; for it is ſaid ver. 21. that "all the Athenians and ſtrangers which were there, ſpent their time in nothing elſe, but either to tell or to hear ſome new things." Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pagan and idolatrous people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not knowing the holy ſcriptures, the apoſtle does not reaſon with them from the ſcriptures as he did oftentimes with the Jews, but confutes their abſurd and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous notions from their own principles, from the reaſon and nature of things. But firſt to obviate a prejudice they had conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as a letter-forth of ſtrange gods, he tells them that the God he preached unto them they already ignorantly worſhipped, as appeared by an altar they had amongſt them inſcribed "to the unknown God." That his deſign therefore was only to inſtruct them in his nature and perfections, and the way to render their conduct acceptable to him. Thoſe things he proves and elucidates from God's making the world, and preſerving all

things in being, ſo that "in him we live, move, and have our being." And he cites [a paſſage from <hi>Aratus</hi>] one of their own poets, affirming that we are all the offspring of God. Since then God is allowed to be the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, and ſince he giveth to all life and breath and all things, the apoſtle infers that he cannot be like to gold or ſilver, or ſtone graven by the art of man, nor that he dwells in temples made with hands, or that he was worſhipped by their oblations as though be needed any thing, or was fed by the fumes of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and ſacrifices, as they abſurdly and fondly imagined. And leſt they ſhould plead the authority of their own religion, and their deſires of truſting their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſame footing that their fathers for ſo many ages had, the apoſtle tells them in the text, that though God had hitherto connived at their ignorant ſyſtems of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ways of worſhip, yet that he had now revealed a new diſpenſation of his grace, wherein he aboliſhed all ſacrifices but that of Chriſt, who had now appeared in the end of the world to take away ſin by one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf; and wherein all men were invited to <hi>repent</hi> of all their former ſins and miſcarriages, and accept the ſalvation offered by Jeſus Chriſt.

How did they people hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven &amp; earth with a multitude of deities, and pay their ſenſeleſs adorations and offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to gods of their own creation; though few of them went ſo far as wholly to deny the exiſtence of any God, (for to do this they muſt firſt deny their reaſon and ſenſes, ſince they could not open their eyes without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the footſteps of the Deity in the works of his creative and providential power. Their reaſon left to itſelf, however corrupt, would ſtill lead them to the knowledge of a God. Though therefore they could not but own his exiſtence) yet their groſs and unworthy apprehenſions of him diſhonour him as much or more than the total denial of him would have done: For there was ſcarce any manner of vice or lewdneſs practis'd on
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012330_0062_0F88C8FC2AF92CC8"/>
earth, but they aſcribed to their gods. No wonder therefore if they in imitation of their deities, indulged themſelves in all manner of vicious and immoral practices. Not but that there were ſome exceptions. There were a few choice and enlightned ſpirits even in theſe dark ages, who in a great meaſure broke thro' theſe miſts of ignorance, and entertained more juſt and worthy notions of the ſupreme being. Thus Socrates, Plato, and ſome others, ſeem to have reaſoned well on the unity of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature and moral duties. But even theſe, however juſt their ideas and conceptions were, conformed in their practices to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the times. And as the opinions generally entertained of the Deity, were very groſs and inadequate, their knowledge of the way of rendering themſelves &amp; their conduct acceptable to him, muſt be equally falſe and erroneous. They ſeem to have truſted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly in external rites, prayers, hymns, ſacrifices, &amp;c. without thoſe internal devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul and thoſe ſpiritual ſacrifices which the bleſſed Jeſus has taught us, and ſhewn to be ſo worthy of God, who being himſelf a Spirit, demands a ſpiritual ſervice of his rational creatures. They had only the dim light of nature to direct their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and point out the rules of duty to them: Which though it might lead them to
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012330_0062_0F88C8FC2AF92CC8"/>
the knowledge of the chief moral duties, yet theſe did but feebly influence their hearts and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves; becauſe they had not that clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, nor thoſe encouragements <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d obligations to practiſe them, which we have under the goſpel. The mere beauty and amiableneſs of virtue in itſelf, and the rewards it carries along with it, could not have that efficacy againſt the corrupt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, luſts and prejudices of men, as when accompanied with the aſſurance of the divine preſence here, and acceptance in the coming world. When therefore we behold the great prevalence of iniquity, even under all the motives and encouragements which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel affords to a holy life, we cannot wonder if the heathen world, while diſtitute of theſe encouragements, was more generally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and ſunk in the depths of vice, error and ſuperſtition. Moreover the gentile world before it was enlightned by the goſpel of Chriſt, was not only vaſtly defective in the knowledge of God, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſequently the practice of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and holineſs, but they know little of themſelves, their condition here, the deſign of their creation, and the cauſe of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſo prevalent in the world. The moſt diſcerning of them ſeem to have been ſenſible in general that there was ſomething
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012330_0063_0F88C8FD173B5F58"/>
wrong in the nature of man, that he could not come out of the hands of a merciful Creator, as we now find him, prone to ſin, ſubject to a thouſand unhappy caſualties, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. and calamities; and after a ſhort life of hur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared paradoxes to them, they not knowing that man was created innocent and happy, not ſubject to diſeaſes nor death, had not he by his own unhappy fall, brought death upon himſelf, attended with a long and diſmal train of evils, pains, and miſeries.</p>
            <p>In fine (for I muſt not enlarge here) The heathen were ignorant in regard to a future ſtate. Some of them (as Epicurus and his followers) wholly denied the ſoul's immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and future exiſtence. But the greateſt part of them had ſome dark and confuſed notions of a future ſtate of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which they might derive partly from tradition, and partly from a ſenſe of the juſtice and holineſs of the Deity, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal diſtribution of pleaſure and pain in this world. But what wild notions did they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of heaven and hell, of the elyſian fields and internal regions! When we read theſe ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and fancies in their poets, one would be ready to imagine that their deſign was rather to ridicule and burleſque, than deſcribe a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:012330_0063_0F88C8FD173B5F58"/>
ſtate. So ignorant were they of that life and immortality which are now brought to light by the goſpel. They nevertheleſs, many of them, entertained ſtrong hopes, not far ſhort of aſſurance, that there was a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs prepared for good men after death. [Witneſs Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates, Cicero, &amp;c.] But as to the reſurrection of the body, they ſeem not to have had the leaſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or ſuſpicion of any ſuch thing: But ſuppoſed that at it's diſſolution by death it wholly ceaſed for ever. They had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that theſe bodies of ours, which are now ſo frail and brittle, though after death they be corrupted and diſſolved; yet ſhall e'er long be called from their duſty bed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated by the power of God, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and ſpiritualized as never again to be ſubject to diſſolution or decay.</p>
            <p>Thus ignorant was the heathen world. In ſuch an impenetrable darkneſs were we of the Gentiles involved, until the day-ſpring from high viſited us; until the light of the glorious goſpel ſhone upon us, and with it's refulgent beams ſcatter'd theſe clouds of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and error, and brought to light theſe future glorious ſcenes of joy, and things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to mortal ſight. "Bleſſed be God therefore, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy"
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012330_0064_0F88C8FDAA6AC7A8"/>
has not left us to grope in the thick darkneſs of heatheniſm, void of hope and void of comfort, but "has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt times; wherein we greatly rejoice." 1 Pet. 1.3, 5. I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">II. God winked at the ignorance and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of theſe times, without bearing any public teſtimony againſt them, except <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ent to inſtruct them, or to convert them from the error of their ways, nor of any particular ſignal manifeſtations of the divine judgments againſt them, either to puniſh them for their wickedneſs, or reclaim them from their errors, except in a few ſingle cities or individuals, until after Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on earth, and commiſſioned his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to go and teach all nations what is the true and acceptable way of the Lord. God beheld the generality of the world ſunk in ſin and idolatry for ſo many ages with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent unconcern, and ſeemingly connived at their ways, until the fulneſs of time came,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012330_0064_0F88C8FDAA6AC7A8"/>
until the Meſſiah appeared to deſtroy the dominions of ſin and ſatan, and eſtabliſhed his own kingdom in the world. This the apoſtle Paul declares not only in the text but more fully in his ſermon to the men of Lyſtra, Acts 14 where he tells them that he was now ſent "to preach to them that they ſhould turn from their vanities unto the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, who made heaven and earth, and the ſea, and all things therein; who in times paſt ſuffered all nations to walk in their own ways; nevertheleſs he left not himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſs, in that he did them good, and gave them rain from heaven and fruitful ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs." Here we ſee exemplified the goodneſs, patience and forbearance of the great Father of mercies, who makes his ſun to riſe, and his rain to fall on the evil as well as the good. Notwithſtanding their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was in a great meaſure wilful, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their prejudices and perverſeneſs which hindred them from attending to the intimation of the divine will in his works of creation and providence, notwithſtanding they acted in general contrary to the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of their conſciences, or that law of God which was written in their hearts; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe things, I ſay, God bore with them from age to age, granted them
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012330_0065_0F88C90092381BB8"/>
temporal favours in abundance, and after a long ſucceſſion of years and of mercies, ſent his own ſon to enlighten and reform them, and receive them into covenant with himſelf. "Theſe things haſt thou done, ſaith God, and I have kept ſilence." Sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God teſtified his diſpleaſure againſt their wicked ways, by diſplaying his judgments againſt ſome particular cities, which had filled up the meaſure of their iniquities. Thus we read of the frequent denunciations of God's wrath againſt Egypt, Babylon, Tyre and Sidon, &amp;c. Upon their not attending to which, God utterly deſtroyed them, for an example to preſent and after ages.</p>
            <p>But as long as they maintained any thing of natural virtue, humanity, and probity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, God winked at their many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities, becauſe they enjoyed but a ſmall degree of light. For which reaſon alſo he has declared that their caſe ſhall be more tolerable at the judgment, than that of thoſe who have ſinned againſt the clear light of the goſpel. Here is a demonſtration of the mercy and compaſſion of God to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then world. Tho' God was always equally an enemy to ſin, yet as he ſaw not fit then to inſtruct them by a revelation from heaven, he paſſed by their corruptions in doctrine and worſhip, and in compaſſion to their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012330_0065_0F88C90092381BB8"/>
withheld his judgments from them. They had not any particular call to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor any direct encouragement to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs upon their renouncing and forſaking their ſins. Upon theſe conſiderations God winked at the impenitency of theſe dark ages, but <hi>now</hi> under the goſpel, commands all men every where to repent, and threatens the ſignal manifeſtations of his vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch as refuſe to comply with the gracious invitation.</p>
            <p>Or we may conſider the text in another light. We may conſider God's winking at the heathen in their ignorance and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the juſt judgment of God againſt them for their notorious wickedneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable idolatry. Had they acted agreable to the beſt light they had, and appeared ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſirous of farther degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the ſake of performing the divine will in a more perfect manner, God would doubtleſs have diſpatched ſome of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to them, as he often did to his people Iſrael, to enlighten their minds in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and declare to them more explicitly what is that good and acceptable thing which the Lord required of them. But when God ſaw them ſo little deſirous of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo obſtinate in their prejudices, and firmly attach'd to their errors and vices, he
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012330_0066_0F88C900EEF5D1F0"/>
gave them up to their own blindneſs of mind and hardneſs of heart, and ſuffered them to go on in their ways, without reclaiming them by any expreſs meſſages from heaven. We may imagine God ſo diſpleaſed with them for their flagrant immoralities and violations of the law of nature, as to pronounce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them as he did of the rebellious Jews by the prophet Iſaiah, "go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed but perceive not: Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes; leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and convert and be healed." This prejudice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of the Jews, our bleſſed Savior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives as the reaſon (and cites this very text) why he did not inſtruct them more plainly, during his abode on the earth, in things pertaining to the kingdom of heaven, but choſe to declare them only by way of fiction and parable, to be more fully explained by his apoſtles after his aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>And why may not this be ſuppoſed to be the caſe with the gentile world? It ſeems to be agreable to the account which St. Paul gives of them in his firſt chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, where he ſays, that "the inviſible things of God, even his eternal power and
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012330_0066_0F88C900EEF5D1F0"/>
godhead, are clearly ſeen by the work of creation; ſo that they are without excuſe: Becauſe that when they knew God, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God, neither were thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but became vain in their imaginations, and [ſo] their fooliſh hearts was darkned. Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe they became fools; and changed the glory of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God into an image, &amp;c. And ſo, as they did not like to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, God <hi>gave them over</hi> to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things which are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. Becauſe that knowing the judgment of God thus far, that they who commit ſuch things are worthy of death, they not only did the ſame, but had pleaſure alſo in them that did them."</p>
            <p>Thus did God for many ages overlook the corruptions of the heathen world; while he choſe out the poſterity of Abraham for his own peculiar people, to whom he might more plainly reveal himſelf, that they might be a generation to ſeek him, and a ſeed to ſerve him; and that the worſhip of the true God might never wholly ceaſe among men, 'till Chriſt the lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, appeared on earth, who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom for all, and who commanded his apoſtles to go and preach the goſpel to every creature, heathen as well as jew, that
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:012330_0067_0F88C90178E36E48"/>
whoſoever believed on him, forſook his ſins, and conformed his life to his inſtructions, might be ſaved by him. This bleſſed goſpel is what by the grace of God we are favoured with, and the tenor of which we are next to contemplate. I proceed therefore to my</p>
            <p n="3">III. Propoſition, which is, that the grand deſign of the goſpel revelation is to call men to repentance. "But now commandeth all men every where to repent. The glad news of ſalvation by Chriſt was uſhered in by John baptiſt his forerunner, who preached the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins; and cried in the wilderneſs of Judea, "repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." i. e. the diſpenſation of the goſpel and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Meſſiah is ſoon to be eſtabliſhed in the world, repent ye therefore and reform your lives, that ye may become the worthy ſubjects of his kingdom. Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior himſelf being initiated into his office as it were by baptiſm, began his public preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with "repent, for the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand." Mat. 4.17. And when he ſent forth the twelve with inſtructions to publiſh his goſpel to the world, they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general ſcope and tenor of the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of their divine maſter, "went out and preached that men ſhould repent." For Chriſt himſelf, when he came into Galilee
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012330_0067_0F88C90178E36E48"/>
"preaching the goſpel of the kingdom of God," did it in theſe words, "the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: "<hi>Repent</hi> ye and believe the goſpel." Theſe two words, repent and believe, comprehend in brief all that the goſpel requires of us. But the world, before Chriſt, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed and ſunk in the loweſt abyſs of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and idolatry, as we have juſt now ſeen, it was neceſſary that they ſhould repent of all their former ſins, and ſo obtain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of them, before they could properly embrace the goſpel, and receive the ſaving benefits of it. For the firſt ſtep that a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man can take towards a godly reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch a thorough change of life as the goſpel requires, is to be truly ſenſible of, and ſorry for his ſins, and ſo to repent of, and forſake them. Accordingly, "God hath highly exalted Chriſt Jeſus by his right hand, to be a prince and a ſaviour to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and forgiveneſs of ſins." And the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in his name teſtified not only to Jews, but alſo to the Greeks, repentance towards God as well as ſaith in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. "It is indeed a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, to ſave them from the error and corruption of their ways, to excite them to repent and
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012330_0068_0F88C9022FE36640"/>
to invite them to accept ſalvation through him. Had mankind been ſo holy and guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as not to ſtand in need of forgiveneſs, there had been no neceſſity of the goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to call and encourage them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; there had been no occaſion for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the ſon of God from the heaven of glory, to ſuffer and die, to purchaſe pardon for penitent tranſgreſſors. But ſince all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had corrupted his way, and there was none righteous, no not one: Since not only the Heathens who ſat in darkneſs, but the Jews alſo who were favoured with a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, had ſhamefully perverted and violated the divine law; it was requiſite in order to ſave mankind from periſhing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that there ſhould be ſome other way appointed for their ſalvation, beſides the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid condition of the covenant of works.</p>
            <p>To anſwer this gracious end, Chriſt came to earth, "whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare <hi>his</hi> righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God." And through him "the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation, hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all men, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012330_0068_0F88C9022FE36640"/>
and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jeſus Chriſt; who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquities, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works." This is what God the Lord requires of us under this new diſpenſation of his grace. For this, Chriſt has enlightned us with the light of his glorious goſpel, has purchaſed forgiveneſs by his ſufferings, and has promiſed us his holy Spirit to aſſiſt us to forſake our ſins and ſubdue our luſts; and on our complying with theſe his gracious deſigns, has promiſed us pardon and acceptance with God, whoſe favour is life, and whoſe loving kindneſs is better than life.</p>
            <p>Repentance then we ſee is a duty indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably incumbent on all who hope to obtain ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt, it therefore deſerves a more large and ample conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall therefore under this head at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſhew theſe ſeveral things. 1ſt. What is implied in true repentance. 2dly. The univerſality of the call and obligation to it. 3dly. The abſolute neceſſity of it. And, 4thly. The motives and encouragements gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it in the goſpel. But, I ſhall conclude at preſent with one or two reflections on what has been already conſidered. And,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:012330_0069_0F88C9030244FA78"/>1. How thankful ought we to be to God, for granting us the light and priviledges of the glorious goſpel of the bleſſed Jeſus, and thereby diſpelling the ignorance of heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and calling us out of darkneſs into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light. The greater the darkneſs is from which we are delivered, the greater in proportion ought our gratitude to be. We have ſeen what groſs ignorance and error the heathen world before Chriſt was involved in; "The gentiles, ſays the apoſtle, walk in the vanity of their minds, having the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts." It was almoſt impoſſible for them amidſt ſuch thick and palpable darkneſs, to diſcern the right way and walk in it. Being thus blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deluded in their minds, it was eaſy for ſatan the prince of darkneſs, to lead them captive at his pleaſure. But yet methinks, it would not be proper for us, ignorant as we are of the doings and deſigns of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, utterly to exclude them from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and peremptorily to deny the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſalvation of any of them. The ſcripture no where that I know of, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes any ſuch determination; and if we have no ground for it here, certainly that charity which the goſpel ſo frequently inculcates,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:012330_0069_0F88C9030244FA78"/>
does not require us thus to judge. There were a few even in the dark ages of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, who ſeem to have been raiſed up as glorious lights in the world; and who ſhone the brighter, for daring to appear ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for virtue, when the generality of mankind were ſunk in ſin and vice.</p>
            <p>Theſe glorious few ſeem not only to have had pretty juſt notions of God and religion, but to have been ſincerely deſirous to pleaſe him, to have taken great pains to ſubdue their appetites and paſſions, and to cultivate the virtues of a good life. Now there ſeems to be no abſurdity in ſuppoſing that a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and good God ſhould in ſome meaſure grant to ſuch the divine influences of his ſpirit, to implant in them a principle of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and ſo far reveal Chriſt to them, as is neceſſary to their ſalvation thro' him, as well as to ſuch as lived under the jewiſh diſpenſation. It is ſaid of Cornelius, while he was yet a heathen, "that he was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout man, and one that feared God, that his prayers were heard, and that his alms were had in remembrance before him." And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſt of theſe good qualities, he was dictated by a viſion where to go and learn Chriſt. On which occurrence the apoſtle Peter, to whom he was ſent, makes this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, "of a truth I perceive that God
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012330_0070_0F88C903A99B7188"/>
is no reſpecter of perſons; but in every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he that feareth God and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is accepted with him." Acts 10.4. But whether it ſhall pleaſe God to admit any of the heathen to eternal happineſs or not, as it does not intimately concern us, and as he has not thought fit expreſsly to reveal it to us, ſo it becomes us not to be peremtory on either hand, but to reſt gratefully ſatisfied with that meaſure of light and knowledge which we are favoured with, and to leave the reſt to God, "who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy," aſſured that he who has no pleaſure in the death or puniſhment of any, will extend his mercy and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo far, and no farther, than ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with equity and juſtice, and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and honour of his moral government. But be this as it may. This we are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly affored of, that we under the goſpel are put into a capacity of obtaining eternal life: That this eternal life and the way to it are revealed to us with ſufficient clearneſs; that God is ready to aſſiſt our feeble but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right endeavours after it; that we may, and many of us doubtleſs ſhall be admitted thro' Chriſt's merits to the bleſſed preſence and enjoyment of God in heaven. What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and unbounded thanks are due from us to God, for this unſpeakable gift! That
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012330_0070_0F88C903A99B7188"/>
the ſun of righteouſneſs has ariſen upon us, and ſcattered with his gladſome beams the miſts of heathen ignorance! That the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring from on high has viſited us and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the bleſſings of light, life &amp; joy among us.</p>
            <p>How ſhould our tongues be exerciſed with repeated noſannas to God! How ſhould our hearts be affected and earth reſound with our praiſes to the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who has bleſſed us with the joyful ſound of ſalvation by Chriſt; who has revealed to us thoſe myſteries which have been hid from ages and generations of the world, and has brought to our ears thoſe glad tidings of great joy, which many prophets, wiſe men and princes deſired to ſee and hear, but might not! If we have the leaſt ſenſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in our boſoms, or any reliſh for divine and ſpiritual bleſſings, we cannot but be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with love and thankfulneſs to God for theſe ineſtimable favours. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are bound not only to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for the goſpel, but to comply with the merciful deſign of it, which we have heard is to call men to repentance. It is by this means alone that we can demonſtrate to ourſelves and others, that we are truly thankful. If we reject the goſpel and live in the practice of thoſe immoralities and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which blackened the heathen world, we
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012330_0071_0F88C9047901A890"/>
give an undeniable evidence that we are not truly thankful for that goſpel which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves thoſe deeds, and commands us to repent of and forſake them.</p>
            <p>Such as thus go on in ſin, whatever profeſſions of thankfulneſs they make, would doubtleſs be glad that God had never ſo clearly revealed his will and their duty to them, and the neceſſity of their compliance with it. "For he that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved."</p>
            <p>Let us therefore ſhew forth our love and gratitude to God by forſaking our ſins and cleaning unto him. And may God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty aſſiſt us by his grace hereto. May he "create us anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works," and grant us the aids of his Spirit, to ſubdue our ſinful affections, to fortify us againſt temptation, and lead us in the paths of truth and righteouſneſs for his name ſake. AMEN.</p>

They were at a loſs how to account for the origin and prevalence of ſin and evil, how they firſt came into the world, and why all mankind were ſtill liable to ſin, to afflictions, diſeaſes and death. Their notions of a future ſtate were very erroneous and chimerical, full of doubt &amp; uncertainty: And of the reſurrection, they entertained not the leaſt ſuſpicion. They knew not how to ſue for pardon and the divine favor, nor in what way, or in what name, it was poſſible for them to be reconciled to a juſt and holy God. They ſeem to have been ſenſible that a mediator was neceſſary, which made them addreſs their ſupplications to Demons, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, departed Heroes, and other inferior Deities. For theſe, by ſome of the wiſeſt of them, were worſhipped only as interceſſors for them to the ſupreme God; though the ignorant vulgar ſeem generally to have made them the ultimate objects of their adoration. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. I ſhewed in the former diſcourſe that God winked at theſe times of general ignorance and corruption; and bore with them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particular viſitation or expreſs reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his will, 'till the coming of Chriſt. This I told you might be underſtood either as a manifeſtation of the patience of God, in
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:012330_0072_0F88C90537F69D48"/>
that he kept ſilence and did not cut them off in their frequent and enormous vices; or of his <hi>mercy,</hi> in that he pitied their ignorance; and paſſed by their faults becauſe the light they were favoured with was but ſmall; or of his <hi>juſtice,</hi> whereby he was induced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this walking ſo contrary to the light of nature, and the dictates of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to give them over to blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart, to commit all iniquity with greedineſs. But though God as it were connived at the ignorance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency of thoſe times, yet <hi>now</hi> under the goſpel he peremptorily and expreſly "com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all men every where to repent."— For I ſhewed thirdly, that the grand deſign of the goſpel revelation is to call men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Under this laſt head I told you I ſhould endeavour to ſhew four ſeveral things; to which I now proceed, viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. What is implied in true repentance.</item>
               <item>II. The univerſality of the call and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to it.</item>
               <item>III. The abſolute neceſſity of it. And,</item>
               <item>IV. The motives and encouragements the goſpel gives to it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the firſt place I am to ſhew wherein true repentance conſiſts, or what is implied in it. Here I ſhall very briefly mention ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things which a ſincere repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012330_0073_0F88C9083AB528D8"/>
God neceſſarily includes in it, though all of them perhaps are not felt in equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees by every true penitent. And if any ſhould chuſe to call ſome of the things I ſhall mention, preparatories to true repentance, or concomitants with it, and others of them the bleſſed fruits and effects of it, rather than parts of repentance itſelf, I will not contend; but only affirm that wherever true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is, there are found (in a greater or leſſer degree) the following things: 1. A ſenſe of ſin and guilt. None can truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his ſins till he is ſenſible that he is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He muſt be brought to a ſenſe of the great evil and heinous nature of ſin, and of his expoſedneſs thereby to the wrath and curſe of God; he muſt ſee the neceſſity there is of breaking off his ſins by repentance in order to his obtaining favour and acceptance with the Almighty; otherwiſe he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a ſincere and godly repentance. For whilſt he thinks himſelf innocent, or is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot convinced of his aggravated guilt, he ſees nothing that he has to repent of. It is not ſuch as are ſelf-righteous, that by the enabling grace of God are brought to a true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but ſuch as know themſelves to be ſinners, ſuch as have ſo thorough and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating conviction of their own vileneſs, ſuch as are of a broken heart and contrite ſpirit
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012330_0073_0F88C9083AB528D8"/>
on account of their tranſgreſſions of the holy law of God, and are cloathed with that ſelf-abaſing ornament of humility, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</p>
            <p>This is admirably exemplified by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the ſtory of the conceited Phariſee and convinced Publican, who enter'd the temple together to pay their devotions to God. Whilſt the one boaſts of his virtues to claim the divine acceptance, the other ſenſible of his unworthineſs not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the favour of God, but even to lift up his eyes to heaven, ſmites on his breaſt, and exclaims, "Lord, be merciful to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner." He being thus convinced of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and guilt, was in a proper diſpoſition of mind to receive the pardon and favour of God; and accordingly "he went down to his houſe juſtified rather than the other." He that is duly ſenſible of the great need he ſtands in of the divine forgiveneſs, of his own unworthineſs of it, and of the neceſſity of the merits and mediation of Chriſt in order to it, cannot but be ſorry that he has bro't himſelf into ſuch a woful ſtate by ſin; and will be excited to the ſtrongeſt deſires and endeavours to forſake his ſins, and pleaſe God, whoſe diſpleaſure he has incurred by ſinning: And ſuch a one has ample encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to expect the aſſiſtance and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012330_0074_0F88C908E9D25450"/>
of God, who with ſuch a ſacrifice is well pleaſed." "For thus ſaith the high and lofty One who inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him alſo that is of a contrite and <hi>humble</hi> ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ones. I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him, peace, peace to him," &amp;c. Iſa. 57.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True repentance implies in it not only a convicted ſenſe of our manifold ſin and guilt, but a humble <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of them before God. He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh them ſhall have mercy." And "if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs." So that we cannot truly repent of our ſins, ſo as to obtain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgiveneſs, without penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of them. I acknowledge my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, ſays David; and my ſin is ever before me. It is neceſſary that we confeſs in general, that we have ſinned and done that which is not right, that we have in many inſtances broken God's holy law, and acted contrary to thoſe obligations of duty and gratitude we were under to him; that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have juſtly incenſed him againſt us, and expoſed ourſelves to his wrath, and the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:012330_0074_0F88C908E9D25450"/>
ſad effects of his diſpleaſure. And not only ſo, but when we fall into any great or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſins, we ought particularly to recount and confeſs them before God, with their ſeveral aggravations, and with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition in ſome meaſure proportioned to the guilt of them. Whereas a general confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, (if ſincere) will be accepted for thoſe many ſins which we cannot particularly call to remembrance, for our ſins of ignorance and infirmity, and the daily imperfections of our beſt ſervices. And our confeſſions both general and particular, muſt be accompanied with hearty deſires and earneſt prayers for forgiveneſs. Thus David prays particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "Deliver me from blood-guiltineſs, O my God; and in general, "cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults." God requires confeſſion of us not to inform him, (for he is perfectly accquainted with all our thoughts and ways) but for our own good, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on our hearts a humiliating ſenſe of our ſins, and to ſhew forth our penitent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mind. Such a diſpoſition as will fit us for receiving pardon from God, "who looketh upon man, as Elihu ſaith, and if any ſay, I have ſinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not: He will deliver his ſoul from going into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light." Job 33.27, 28.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="142" facs="unknown:012330_0075_0F88C90A839FF2B0"/>3. Our confeſſion muſt be accompanied with ſhame and ſorrow for our ſins, ſuch a ſorrow as ſhall produce hatred and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them, otherwiſe we ſhall not be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in our confeſſions, and in our purpoſes of amendment. For he that confeſſes a fault is always ſuppoſed to be convinced of it. And he that is convinced that he has done amiſs, cannot but be aſhamed of it. Thus Ezra lamented, and confeſſing before God the ſins of the land, ſays, "O my God, I am <hi>aſhamed</hi> and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increaſed over our head, and our treſpaſs is grown up unto the heavens." So Jeremiah 3.25. "We lie down in our <hi>ſhame,</hi> and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion covereth us, for we have ſinned againſt the Lord." Evangelical repentance is alſo attended with great grief and ſorrow for ſin. I will declare mine iniquity, ſays the Pſalmiſt, and be ſorry for my ſin. The ſincere peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mourns and ſorrows for his ſins, not only becauſe he has by them ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the wrath of God &amp; pains of hell. For a ſinner that is actuated by a mere legal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, who continues to love ſin and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go on in it, may yet like Judas, be filled with ſorrow and remorſe, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the great miſchief and intolerable miſery which he has brought upon himſelf.
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:012330_0075_0F88C90A839FF2B0"/>
Such ſorrow, ſuch repentance as this, ſhall be exerciſed by the damned in hell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is not in itſelf that gracious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſoul which recommends to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. But ſorrow for ſin, which is the concomitant of true repentance, is of a more ingenious nature. It proceeds chiefly (though not wholly excluding the other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) from love and gratitude towards God, and a conciouſneſs of having acted unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily towards him who is his Creator and conſtant Benefactor, and who has ſent his own ſon to ranſom him from ſin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. He is grieved for having acted unworthy of a rational creature, for having deformed and defiled his own ſoul, reflected diſhonour on God, and diſobeyed his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous laws. This is that "godly ſorrow" that "worketh repentance to ſalvation not to be repented of." He who thus ſincerely laments his ſin, and ſorrows after a godly ſort, who weeps and grieves more bitterly, the greater his ſin and folly has been, will be led to hate ſin and loathe himſelf on account of it. And not only ſo, but—</p>
            <p n="4">4. He whoſe grief and repentance for his ſins is ſincere, will firmly <hi>reſolve</hi> to forſake them for the future, and cleave unto God. And unleſs this is the happy effect of it, his repentance is not genuine, but only that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:012330_0076_0F88C90B334EE340"/>
and uneaſineſs which naturally ariſes in the mind of man, from a conſciouſneſs of having done wrong, and a fear of puniſhment. Without a firm and vigorous reſolution, nothing can be done towards repentance and a change of life. When a ſinner is brought to reflect on his paſt life, and ſees how guilty he has been; when he is convinced of the evil and danger of his former courſes, and that the only ſafe way for him is to forſake his ſin and return to God and his duty; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrongly he is determined in his mind upon the expediency of repentance, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there is a fixed determination or <hi>reſolution</hi> of the will alſo, true repentance will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. For though it is neceſſary that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the judgment ſhould go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſolution of the will, yet the one does not always imply the other. Many men have been fully convinced of the fitneſs and neceſſity of a change of life, who yet for want of a ſtedfaſt reſolution to turn from their ſins, have gone on in them and died in a ſtate of impenitence. Nothing but a ſtrong and determinate reſolution will enable a man to ſtem the torrent of vicious cuſtom, to conquer his own ſinful inclinations, and the ſtrength of inveterate habits, and to withſtand the powerful aſſaults of temptation. Weak and feeble purpoſes of amendment will not
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:012330_0076_0F88C90B334EE340"/>
do this. Such as only faintly wiſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to repent and reform, will be eaſily ſway'd to ſin: Whereas he who upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation and ſincere deſires to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God in his life, has taken up a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to ceaſe from ſin and go on in a way of duty, will doubtleſs be able, by help of divine grace, to keep his reſolution. For reſolution fixes a man's ſpirit, like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable rock, which when the rains deſcend and floods aſſail it, abides firm againſt all impreſſions. By virtue of ſuch a reſolution as this, David could riſe in defiance againſt all that would tempt him to ſin, ſaying, "depart from me, ye evil doers, for <hi>I will</hi> keep the commandments of my God."— Thus we ſee how neceſſary a part holy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is, of true repentance. Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. That chriſtian repentance which the goſpel requires, includes in it, a repairing to Chriſt, relying on his merits alone for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and caſting the guilty ſoul before him to be waſhed in his blood, and cleanſed from all ſin. Faith in Chriſt, and truſt in him for acceptance, is the root and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the chriſtian graces; and deſtitute of this principle, they are not evangelical graces, but mere moral acts, ſuch as may be exerciſed by Pagans as well as Chriſtians. An Infidel, Heathen, or Jew, may be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:012330_0077_0F88C90CAB358600"/>
grieved and ſorry for his ſins, and reſolve to forſake them; and in conſequence of this may turn from his allowed vicious courſes, and cultivate in general the moral virtues of a good life. But this repentance, though it be commendable and praiſe worthy in him, yet being deſtitute of faith in Chriſt, it is not evangelical repentance which is required of us under the chriſtian diſpenſation. Weary and heavy-laden ſinners, who labour under a burdenſome ſenſe of their ſins, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the goſpel, not only to repent of and forſake them, but to come to Chriſt for pardon, that ſo being eaſed of the heavy load, they may find reſt for their ſouls. Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, who was delivered up to death for our offences, and roſe again for our juſtification, has by his obedience and ſufferings made a compleat atonement and ſatisfaction for ſin. In conſequence of which God has highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him by his right hand, to give <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins. "Through him therefore is preached unto you the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins: And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes." Thus as the <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> is conferred only <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> and as repentance is in order to forgiveneſs, it is neceſſary that our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012330_0077_0F88C90CAB358600"/>
ſhould have a particular reference to Chriſt; or that a goſpel penitent ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith in him, <hi>by whom we receive the atonement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That</hi> repentance which is ſincere and genuine, neceſſarily implies in it, or at leaſt produces, actual reformation and change of life; a forſaking of ſin, and practice of virtue and piety. It has been already ſhewn that repentance includes in it a deep and hearty <hi>ſorrow</hi> for ſin, with a diſpoſition of mind, and a reſolution of will to turn from it. But this, if we ſtop here, is not true repentance. Repentance ſignifies <hi>a change,</hi> not only of diſpoſition but of practice; not only a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to walk in the way of duty, but an actual performing ſuch a reſolution, ſo far as opportunity is granted for it. In affairs of common life, by repenting we frequently mean no more than a ſorrow for any paſt action, which upon reflection we find to have been wrong, and to wiſh that we had done otherwiſe. But this though it is implied in goſpel repentance, does not come up to the full notion of it, neither is it what is moſt eſſential to it. For what availeth the moſt poignant ſorrows and compunction, unleſs it worketh repentance, or a thorough change of heart and life? How can grief or remorſe alone, either pleaſe God or profit us? Sorrow
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012330_0078_0F88C90DB4D59AB0"/>
in itſelf is only pain and miſery. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore be a greater affront and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered to God, who delights in the happineſs of his creatures, than to ſuppoſe that he takes a cruel pleaſure in the miſery of men; or that he delights to ſee them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in tears, and labouring under trouble of mind and remorſe of conſcience for their ſins, any further than as this conduces to the reformation and happineſs of the perſons thus affected. Our grieving and taking on can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affect the almighty, nor move his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards us, whilſt we continue in ſin: Neither does he count himſelf glorified by pain or melancholy; but "<hi>herein</hi> is my father glorified, ſaith our Savior, that ye bring forth much fruit." What perſons feel a more painful ſorrow and contrition for ſin, than ſuch as are ſunk into the depths of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair? Yet who are farther from true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? If grief and affliction of ſoul for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinned were all that conſtituted goſpel repentance, the devil himſelf might become a true penitent: For he, when he feelst he juſt vengeance of God, cannot but condemn himſelf, and grieve that ever he rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: But as he remains the ſame devil ſtill, retains the ſame malignant temper, and continues the ſame courſe of wickedneſs and rebellion, he is at the fartheſt remove poſſible
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012330_0078_0F88C90DB4D59AB0"/>
from true repentance. Thus we ſee, that grief and ſorrow are of no advantage, any farther than as they are productive of a real repentance and reformation. So that if we would determine what is <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> and what not, we muſt judge of it, not from the degree of affliction in it, but from the real effects of it in heart and life. For he is moſt truly ſorry for his ſin, that reflects upon it with deteſtation, and abſolutely ſhuns and forſakes it. The goſpel repentance is called repentance from dead works;" not only for them, but from them. The grace of God by Chriſt Jeſus, was not revealed to the world to inflict torment and miſery on men, or to make them ſad and melancholy, but to ſubdue ſin in them and under them, to teach and direct them to "deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and godly, in the world." When John baptiſt came preaching the baptiſm of repentance, and when many people were baptiſed by him, and <hi>confeſſed their ſins,</hi> he lets them know that this alone was not ſufficient, but that it was neceſſary that they ſhould alſo <hi>bring forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> A good tree will infallibly bring forth good fruit. However humbly and penitently therefore we have confeſſed our ſins, however deeply we have been affected
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:012330_0079_0F88C90E2A7942B0"/>
with ſorrow and anguiſh for them, however vile we have eſteemed ourſelves on account of them, and however ſtrongly we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to forſake them, yet if we do not actually ceaſe the indulgence of them, and practice the virtues of a holy life, when time and opportunity is granted herefor, we may be aſſured beyond all doubt, that we have not yet exerciſed that true repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God which the goſpel requires of us. Every true penitent becomes thenceforward <hi>a new creature.</hi> He is "created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works," By the aſſiſtance of the divine Spirit, "he puts off the old man which is corrupt, and puts on the new," repentance being neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected or concomitant with regeneration and converſion. "Repent ye therefore, and <hi>be converted,</hi> that your ſins may be blotted out." I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Reſtitution</hi> is a neceſſary branch or effect of ſincere repentance. It is a dictate of natural reaſon as well as of religion, that whenever any wrong or injury is done to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, a full reſtitution or ſatisfaction ought (ſo far as can be) to be made to the party injured. As to our treſpaſſes againſt God, we can make no adequate compenſation for them. All we can do in reſpect of God, is humbly to confeſs our faults, to be heartily
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:012330_0079_0F88C90E2A7942B0"/>
ſorry for them, and do better for the future. Though this does not come up to the notion of reſtitution or ſatisfaction, yet God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed through Chriſt to accept it as ſuch, when performed ſincerely and from the heart. But beſides the wrong done to God and ourſelves; in many of our ſins we likewiſe injure our fellow-men. In this caſe we may and ought to make reparation. If we have by our example, influence, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, drawn any into ſin, and thereby endangered their precious ſouls, we are bound ſo far as we can, to reclaim them from their vices, and promote their ſalvation. Or in whatever other way we have injured any perſon, whether by fraud or violence; whether the wrong affects his body, eſtate or reputation; we are obliged to reſtore what we have unjuſtly detained from him, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe make ſatisfaction, according as the caſe and circumſtances require. And unleſs we do thus, we do not ſincerely repent of the ſin. For he that is truly penitent and ſorry for his ſin, will heartily wiſh he had not done it, and ſo will be careful ſo far as he can to <hi>undo</hi> it by making reſtitution. Whilſt a man wilfully neglects making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for any act of injuſtice, oppreſſion, deſamation, &amp;c. he continues in the ſin; and whilſt he continues in the ſin, and does
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:012330_0080_0F88C910D1D66FD0"/>
not forſake it, the guilt of it ſhall not be waſhed away. [Non dimittitur peccatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum.] The ſcriptures mention reſtitution as a neceſſary part of repentance, and an indiſpenſible condition of pardon. Thus Ezekiel 33.14, &amp;c.— "When I ſay unto the wicked, thou ſhall ſurely die: If he <hi>turn</hi> from his ſin and do that which is lawful and right; if the wicked <hi>reſtore the pledge, give again that which he hath robbed,</hi> and walk in the ſtatutes of life without committing iniquity; none of his ſins that he hath committed ſhall be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned unto him; he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die."</p>
            <p n="8">8. That our repentance be ſincere, and effectual to procure the pardon of our ſins, it is neceſſary that we forgive the offences of others againſt us. That this is a neceſſary concomitant of true repentance, I prove thus. The divine forgiveneſs is often promiſed us on our ſincere repentance: "Repent and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out." "If the wicked turn, he ſhall live, &amp;c. But our Savior expreſly declares, that "if we forgive not men their treſpaſſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will our heavenly father forgive us." Conſequently that repentance to which the promiſe of pardon is annexed, muſt include in it, forgiveneſs of others. Indeed the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012330_0080_0F88C910D1D66FD0"/>
practice of all the duties of chriſtianity, ſo far as by God's grace we are able, is, as I have already ſhewn, comprehended in true repentance. But this duty of forgiving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is more particularly inſiſted on in the goſpel, as of peculiar efficacy in order to our obtaining pardon of God. If we forgive men their treſpaſſes, and not otherwiſe, God will forgive us all thoſe ſins which we have utterly forſaken and renounced. And this is a very juſt and equitable requiſition.</p>
            <p>For if God is ready to forgive us our hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous and aggravated tranſgreſſions upon our penitently aſking it of him, how can we in conſcience or gratitude refuſe to overlook the ſlight and inconſiderable offences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againſt us? When we read the ſtory of the ſervant who being freely forgiven by his Lord a vaſt debt of ten thouſand talents, yet refuſed to forgive or have patience with his needy and ſupplicating fellow-ſervant for the ſmall ſum of one hundred pence, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry; the conſcience of every one cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut ſubſcribe to the juſtice of the ſentence of his being delivered to the tormentors, until <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſhould make ſatisfaction for the whole debt. "So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do unto you, ſays Chriſt, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012330_0081_0F88C911318448E8"/>
their treſpaſſes." If therefore we would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence our repentance to be true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, ſuch as ſhall avail with God through Chriſt for our pardon, we muſt "be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, when as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us."</p>
            <p>Laſtly. That our repentance be effectual to our final ſalvation, it is neceſſary that we not only change our lives at firſt, and turn from ſin to God, but that we continue in ſuch a courſe to the end. "He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to the end ſhall be ſaved; but if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in him." There are many who by ſome awakening call either in the word or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, are brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>ntinue for ſome time to all appearance ſincerely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. But theſe good impreſſions being worn off by time, they relapſe into their former ſtate of inactivity and wickedneſs, and ſhew by their after-conduct that their former repentance was not eſtabliſhed on a good and laſting principle. Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of ſuch as thus afterwards fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (if it may be called repentance) will not avail to their final happineſs. All their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrivings and ſorrows will not anſwer for
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:012330_0081_0F88C911318448E8"/>
their admiſſion into heaven. For ſaith God, "when I ſay to the righteous, thou ſhalt ſurely live; if he truſt to his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs [and turn aſide] and commit iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; all his righteouſneſs ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he ſhall die for it." So that a conſtant and ſteady progreſs in virtue is eſſential to that repentance unto ſalvation, which the goſpel requires. And by this it is diſtinguiſhed from that repentance which is vain and unavailing.</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſidered the ſeveral things which are either contained in true repentance or accompany it, or elſe flow from it. They are a ſenſe of ſins, confeſſion of them with ſhame and ſorrow, reſolution againſt them, applying to Chriſt for forgiveneſs, an actual reformation in heart and life, reſtitution, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and perſiſtance in virtue and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Before I proceed to the next head, I would juſt make one remark. Though each of theſe I have mentioned (as parts of true repentance) are neceſſary, yet they are not <hi>equally</hi> diſcernible in every goſpel-peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Such as have had the happineſs of a religious education, whoſe infant minds have had the principles of chriſtianity inſtilled into them, and who have been brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012330_0082_0F88C911E95CF188"/>
though in their repentance they mourn for their ſins and imperfections, yet not having been guilty of any notorious tranſgreſſions, their ſorrow will not be equal in degree to that of others: And as the general tenor of their actions has always been outwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the rules of religion, the change that is made in them will not be ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and evident to themſelves and others, as in thoſe that are reformed from a courſe of profligancy and vice. But though the repentance and renovation of ſuch is more ſilent and inſenſible, yet it is neceſſary that they as well as all others ſhould repent and be renewed in the temper of their minds, before they can be ſo conformed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of God as to enjoy happineſs with him. For "God commandeth <hi>all men every where</hi> to repent." I proceed therefore to conſider, as I propoſed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. The univerſality of the call and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to repentance. Before Chriſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God's will, and the invitation to repentance for the remiſſion of ſins, was made only to the Jews. Many prophets were ſent forth by the almighty, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exhorting <hi>them</hi> to repent and turn from their evil ways, with promiſes that hereupon they ſhould live and not die. But ſince the preaching of the goſpel, the true
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:012330_0082_0F88C911E95CF188"/>
religion is not as before, confined to any one nation or country, "but in every nation he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted of him." God has now graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fulfilled his promiſe made by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to call the gentile world to the faith. "Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not alſo of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo." Every man every where, who hears the bleſſed ſound of the goſpel, is now called upon to repent. Even the greateſt ſinners have encouragement here. For "it is a faithful ſaying—that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, even the chief." And juſt before his entrance into glory, he gave orders to his apoſtles, "that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem, who were the chief of ſinners, the deſpiſers and crucifiers of our bleſſed Lord. But not only great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious tranſgreſſors, but ſuch alſo as have led more regular and moral lives, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to repent. For as all men have ſinned and therefore ſtand in need of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, ſo all are invited to accept of it on goſpel terms. Even the righteous or ſuch as have already turned their feet into the way of God's teſtimonies, though the general tenor of their actions being right, they have
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:012330_0083_0F88C9149DFB1068"/>
not need like the ſinner to turn wholly about, and change their courſe, yet they ought fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to renew their repentance. Though the loud calls in ſcripture to repent and turn, are directed chiefly to ſinners, and though that repentance which I have deſcribed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a thorough change, can in the extent of it be applied only to them, yet there is a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which is required of ſuch as are already true penitents and believers. For ſince none can arrive to a ſtate of impeccability or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perfection in this life, the grace of God in the goſpel would be inſufficient to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any, if it provided not for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſins committed after the firſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as well as before. The beſt of men, the moſt eminent ſaints, will ſometimes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their utmoſt caution, fall into ſin, and fail in the exact performance of their duty; and while any are under the guilt of any ſin, they are expoſed to the wrath and curſe of God: It is neceſſary therefore that they recover themſelves, and be renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto repentance in order to their being reſtored to the favour of God. They muſt mourn for their remaining imperfections; and whenever they are ſurprized into ſin, muſt penitently aſk forgiveneſs thro' Chriſt, and be excited to greater caution and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in their future conduct. Thus all men,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:012330_0083_0F88C9149DFB1068"/>
good and bad, high and low, bond and free, are called to repentance, and ſo invited to the benefits of the goſpel redemption. For with God "there is no reſpect of perſons,—there is neither Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Chriſt is all and in all."—I am,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhew the neceſſity of repentance. And this, as there needs not much to be ſaid to make it evident, ſo I ſhall not be long upon it. Without it we cannot be pardoned. For God is holy, and cannot be reconciled to ſin. His nature is oppoſite to it, and his laws were deſigned to reſtrain men from it But to forgive ſin without repentance and amendment, is the direct way to encourage the practice of it, and deſtroy the honour and reverence due to thoſe laws which ſo ſeverely forbid it. We cannot enjoy happineſs in the communion of God, until we become like him, or he like us. But God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Conſequently we muſt forſake our ſins, and become in ſome degree holy as God is holy, before we can be happy with him. Nay, ſhould God, contrary to his nature and word, forgive our ſins tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd and unrepented of, and admit us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his beatific preſence, ſtill we could not forgive ourſelves. Conſcience, that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable Judge which God has placed in our breaſt, will not free us from the ſting of
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:012330_0084_0F88C9150288B268"/>
guilt, till we have repented and reformed. And ſo long as a ſenſe of guilt remained, we could not be happy. Thus in the nature of things, happineſs and impenitency are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incompatible with each other. This is farther evident from the word of God. Sinners or "the unrighteous cannot inherit the kingdom of God." "The wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment." "God is angry with the wicked every day: If he turn not he will whet his ſword, and his miſchief ſhall return upon his own head." "Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh." "Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God:" But "without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord." Every man who conſults the word of God, who ſees there the woful end of the impenitent ſinner, and the glorious happineſs of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſaint, cannot but be ſenſible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and neceſſity of repentance. And ſince the preſent life is known to be the only time allotted for it, one would think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any ſhould be ſo unwiſe as to neglect or delay it. But this being unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the caſe, we will conſider in the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. and laſt place, the motives and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to repentance which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel affords. The impenitency of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then was winked at by God, becauſe they
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:012330_0084_0F88C9150288B268"/>
had little or no encouragement to it. But this is not the caſe under the goſpel. Here we find God declaring himſelf "not willing any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance." And that for this very reaſon "he is long-ſuffering to us-ward," "that the goodneſs of God may lead us to repentance." Here we have the promiſe of pardon and remiſſion, on our ſincerely and truly repenting of our ſins; and a promiſe of the divine aſſiſtance herein, and not only ſo, but we are aſſured that there is a crown of glory that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us. The great and manifold bleſſings of redemption, the divine bleſſing and fellowſhip of the ſpirit here, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God throughout eternity, are promiſed to ſuch as forſake their ſins, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their luſts, and are renewed in the ſpirit of their minds after the image of him that created them. But if we refuſe to hearken to the gracious calls of God to repentance and a holy life, and obſtinately go on in ſin "after our hard and impenitent hearts, we treaſure up to ourſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory and honour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:012330_0085_0F88C915B10B9E48"/>
eternal life." Having therefore thoſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe ourſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God."</p>
            <p>Let us conſider that whilſt we go on in a ſtate of impenitency, we counteract the gracious deſigns of God in the goſpel reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. In vain has God provided a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for us to deliver us from ſin and death: In vain as to us has Chriſt died to purchaſe pardon and juſtification for ſinful man, and thereby to reconcile him to an offended God: In vain has God enlightened us with the knowledge of his will, and the terms on which we may procure his favor; if we ſtand out againſt his exhortations and calls, and are wilfully bent on our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Nay it will be the unſpeakable ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of our future doom, that the grace of God bringing ſalvation has appeared to us, but we have harden'd our hearts againſt God, and refuſed compliance with it.— Though God winked at the impenitency of the heathen in the times of ignorance, he will not wink at it in profeſſed chriſtians under the light of the goſpel; but will aſſuredly execute his threatned vengeance on all that now daringly continue in ſin. "Now conſider this ye that forget God,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:012330_0085_0F88C915B10B9E48"/>
left he tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver." Rom. 16.25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>"Now to him that is of power to ſtabliſh you according to the goſpel, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt (according to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the myſtery, which was kept ſecret ſince the world began, but now is made manifeſt, and by the ſcriptures of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets according to the commandment of the everlaſting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: To God only wiſe, be glory through Jeſus Chriſt, for ever.</p>

            <p>DIED at the Rev. Mr. Smith's at Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, the 17th inſtant, James Blake, B. A. and was this day decently interred at Dorcheſter, the place of his nativity. Early in life he diſcovered a love for virtue and a thirſt for knowledge. His riſing genius induced his friends to give him a liberal edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at Harvard College. He made a moſt rapid progreſs in the arts and ſciences, and as a univerſal ſcholar was equal perhaps to any of his ſtanding. Intenſe application to his ſtudies, impaired his health, and from an extreme averſion to diſtreſs his friends with his complaints, he concealed his difficulties, 'till an inflammation ſeated on his ſtomach, which removed him from this world in the bloom and verdure of life. Being ſoon ripe for heaven, heaven claimed him as it's due. For ſome months paſt he had preached in this and the neighbouring towns, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to the univerſal approbation of his hearers, and the beſt judges have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his diſcourſes from the pulpit were
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012330_0087_0F88C9172A4E8D18"/>
the works of a very maſterly and eloquent pen. He appeared ever to be influenced by the example of his divine Lord and Maſter, in whoſe ſervice he had engaged, and for the advancement of whoſe intereſt and kingdom in the world he was moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently accompliſhed. His undiſſembled piety, the amiableneſs of his temper, his modeſty, innocence and innoffenſiveneſs, which appeared through the whole of his life and converſation, endeared him to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all characters. The young, to whom his death is a ſtriking monitor, and a moſt ſenſible illuſtration of this humbling truth, that every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity, may from hence be convinced that early piety has it's attractive charms, and that the only way to laſting fame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory is through the temple of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. No youth has liv'd more univerſally beloved, or died more univerſally lamented.</p>
