            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſpecial occaſion of it was this: while our bleſſed REDEEMER was in the world, employed about his Father's buſineſs, at a certain time there was <q>brought unto him one poſſeſſed with a devil, blind and dumb; and he healed him, in ſo much that the blind and dumb both ſpake and ſaw, and all the people were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this the Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid? But when the Phariſees hear'd it, they ſaid, This fellow doth not caſt out devils but by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. And JESUS knew their thoughts, and ſaid unto them, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kingdom divided againſt itſelf, is brought to deſolution, and every city or houſe divided againſt itſelf, ſhall not ſtand. And if ſatan caſt out ſatan, he is divided againſt himſelf; how then ſhall his kingdom ſtand? And if I by Beelzebub caſt out devils, by whom do your children caſt them out? Therefore they ſhall be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014805_0007_0F94DC75FA446D78"/>
your judges. But if I caſt out devils by the ſpirit of GOD, then the kingdom of GOD is come unto you. Or elſe, how can one enter into a ſtrong man's houſe, and ſpoil his goods, except he firſt bind the ſtrong man? and then he will ſpoil his houſe. He that is not with me is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth abroad.</q> The miracle which our SAVIOUR here wrought was indeed a notable one; giving to one that, under the influence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a devil, was both blind and dumb, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er both of ſeeing and ſpeaking immediately. It excited the attention of the people, and filled them with wonder and ſurprize, and brought them at once to quere, "Is not this the ſon of David?" i. e. the promiſed and expected MESSIAH. But the Phariſees his crafty and bitter enemies and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers not being able to deny the fact, or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the reality of the miracle, which was ſo great and viſible; or, bring the author of it into diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute any other way, with equal abſurdity and malice attribute it to diabolical intercourſe and influence. Our SAVIOUR refutes this vile aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by ſhewing that it is founded on the folly and unreaſonableneſs of ſuppoſing that ſatan, that craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deceiver, ſhould lend him his power to pull down his own kingdom and work effectually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf: that it is ſuppoſing ſatan divided againſt himſelf and engaged for his own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides, if they attributed the miracle he had wrought to the devil, he aſks them, by whom do your children caſt out devils? There were certain Jews amongſt themſelves that caſt out devils in the name of the GOD of Abraham, Iſaac and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014805_0008_0F94DC76CD2BA4A0"/>
and it was acknowledged that they did it by the power of GOD: and there was no cauſe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from their malicious views and deſigns why they ſhould not acknowledge that what he did was by the ſame power. And, ſays he, if I caſt out devils by the ſpirit of GOD, then the kingdom of GOD is come unto you, i. e. the MESSIAH is come, and the miracles which I work prove my divine miſſion and character. And further, he uſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother argument to prove that the miracles which he wrought were by the power of GOD, and not by the help of Satan, which is this; that it requires greater ſtrength than Satan is poſſeſſed of, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and overcome him, and effectually counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act his influence, and diſpoſſeſs him of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He is the ſtrong man that reigns in this world or his houſe; he is ſtiled the GOD of this world, and no power but that which is truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, no ſtrength but that of Almighty GOD, can bind him and deſtroy his kingdom. He has too much ſubtilty to do any thing himſelf to deſtroy it, the promiſed ſeed, the glorious MESSIAH only can do it, and effectually bruiſe his head. And all mankind are to be ranked in two claſſes; and are either the ſubjects of CHRIST, the KING of ZION, and through him the children of GOD; or they are the ſubjects of Satan, the God of this world, who ruleth in the children of diſobedience. The former are free indeed, being made free by the SON of GOD, and are diſpoſed and engaged to promote the intereſt of CHRIST'S kingdom, which conſiſteth in <hi>righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the</hi> HOLY GHOST; and which bears the moſt friendly aſpect upon the happineſs of mankind. The latter are the ſlaves
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014805_0009_0F94DC77878C57B0"/>
of ſin and Satan; our SAVIOUR ſays of them, <hi>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him.</hi> They are engaged in the intereſt and belong to the kingdom of Satan, and their temper and conduct is inimical to the temporal and eternal happineſs of mankind. And both theſe claſſes of men are perfectly known to HIM, who thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes and characterizes them in the context: <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me, and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth abroad.</hi> And when we ſee the HOLY JESUS while exerciſing his miraculous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in infinite mercy and kindneſs to men, loaded with undeſerved reproach, and unreaſonable, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious calumny; and his moſt benevolent actions miſconſtrued and aſſerted to be owing to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Devil, we are not to wonder that the greateſt and beſt of men, exerting themſelves moſt in the way of their duty, and for the good of others, often meet a ſimilar treatment, and have all their benevolent and faithful efforts attributed by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, malicious and deſigning men, to the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and diabolical motives, eſpecially as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſaid <hi>The diſciple is not above his maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord. It is enough for the diſciple that he be as his maſter, and the ſervant as his Lord. If they have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, how much more ſhall they call them of his houſhold?</hi>

            <p>HAVING ſaid thus much of the original occaſion and deſign of the obſervations in the text; and of the ſacred paſſage ſo immediately connected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, we proceed to a more particular conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and improvement of it, or a theme of diſcourſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014805_0010_0F94DC783A63FB98"/>
pertinent to the important buſineſs of this day, and the alarming ſtate of public affairs.</p>
            <p>EVERY <hi>kingdom divided againſt itſelf, is brought to deſolution; and every city or houſe divided againſt itſelf ſhall not ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE truth of this obſervation carries its own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence with it, and immdeiately approves itſelf to the rational and conſidering mind. Two contrary powers, of any kind whatever, that act againſt and oppoſe each other, can have no other tendency but to deſtroy each other's force. And the greater the force they oppoſe to each other, the greater and more ſpeedy the mutual deſtruction which they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. This is illuſtrated and verified in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and material, as well as moral and rational, world, and holds true (not like the declaratory right of the Britiſh Parliament to make laws to bind the colonies, but in reality) <hi>in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</hi> And in all bodies of men and civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities whether great or ſmall, whether conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as kingdoms, provinces, cities, towns, or ſtill leſſer ſocieties, even particular private houſes, and families, their ſtrength and ſtability is in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their union; and diſunion and diviſion among them have the moſt fatal and deſtructive tendency. In proportion as theſe increaſe and rage, ruin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. They ſeverally bring kingdoms to deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and no city or houſe can flouriſh, or even ſubſiſt long under their baneful influence. Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contending factions ever have been, and forever muſt be, the ruin of thoſe among whom they riſe and rule. The greateſt and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kingdoms and ſtates are brought to deſolution by them, while much leſſer bodies are preſerved,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014805_0011_0F94DC78FAAF48F0"/>
and their intereſt, power and proſperity wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſed, by union, harmony and good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, with their ſtrength all employed in one deſign for mutual and univerſal good.</p>
            <p>IN this way have gone to ruin many nations and people of paſt ages, which were once great and flouriſhing, and chief among the nations, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny once ſmall and very inconſiderable ſtates, and by them oppreſſed or greatly diſpiſed, have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to, even exceeded all their greatneſs, grandeur and glory. Diviſion and diſcord brought deſolation upon the former; union, concord and perſeverance ſecured the proſperity and happineſs of the latter. To union many a flouriſhing ſtate hath owed its greatneſs, and its downfal to diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Concord and perſeverance advanced <hi>Rome</hi> to the height of its glory: And diſcord and faction ſunk it in debaſement and ruin. The final over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, the deſolation of their capital city, their temple and their country, was chiefly brought on by their diviſions and factions; and they did ten times more to their own undoing than all their foreign enemies and invaders.</p>
            <p>WE ſee the obſervation in the text exemplified, univerſally, in all inſtances without exception, as far as hiſtory or our acquaintance with kingdoms, cities or houſes divided againſt themſelves can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us. And worldly wiſe, ambitious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning ſtateſmen, are ſo well apprized of this truth, that it is long ſince a maxim with them, when they would weaken, enſlave or ruin a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (if not likely to be eaſily done by open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force) to do it by exerting and fomenting diviſions among them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014805_0012_0F94DC79BA7587C8"/>
AND by the ſucceſsful practice of this policy many have reached the ſummit of iniquitous gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and power, and been the moſt awful ſcourges to mankind. DIVIDE and TYRANNIZE is the ſtirrup by which they mount, and hold the ſeat of their ill-gotten authority; and the goad too or ſpur with which they unmercifully laſh on thoſe deluded and oppreſſed by them, waſting all their ſubſtance and wearing out their very lives, merely to gratify their own deſpotic will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> both in the Southern and Northern parts of it; and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſubjected with them to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> crown, have all in their turns, been ſhaken to their foundations, with internal diviſions, which have been excited, fomented and guided by arbitrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men, and ſpread ruin and deſolation all around. Since the political union of the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland, Great-Britain</hi> hath more than once been ſo unhappily divided againſt itſelf, as to appear evidently brought to the brink of deſolation, and inevitably falling into it, had not a ſpeedy end been put to ſuch a diviſion; or a <hi>glorious revolution</hi> taken place, through the kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpotion of divine providence.</p>
            <p>AND ſuch appears to be the unhappy divided ſtate of the nation at preſent, and her power and force ſo much and directly employed againſt her own intereſt and ſtrength, that without ſome great and eſſential alteration of meaſures, and a timely happy revolution of affairs, ruin is inevitable; the power and glory of <hi>Britain</hi> ſunk; and her name, if not loſt, only preſerved to reproach her with what ſhe once was, and might ſtill have

been, had it not been for her own wicked and wanton abuſe of the favours Heaven bleſſed her with: And being ſervilely ſubjected to ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power, ſhe may be forced too late, to rue her preſent meaſures and conduct; and herſelf experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thoſe ſlaviſh chains which ſhe is now forging for <hi>America;</hi> whoſe numerous and gallant ſons, had they been treated by her as they ought to have been, as juſtice and her own intereſt required, would always have been bound to her by affection and duty, and when properly called to her aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, would have moſt cheerfully adventured their lives and fortunes, for her protection, defence, and real intereſt and honour, and under providence rendered her ſuperior to all her enemies.</p>
            <p>SHE may one day, and that day not be very far off neither, want the help of her affectionate colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts whom ſhe hath butchered and plundered.</p>
            <p>BUT thoſe ſhe hath cruelly ſlain can riſe no more for her help: And with what an ill grace will ſhe call upon thoſe who ſurvive, whom ſhe hath ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all in her power to weaken and oppreſs, beyond the power of helping themſelves?</p>
            <p>AND the following obſervations of an elegant Engliſh writer of the preſent age, may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to our ſubject, or unapplicable to the paſt and preſent ſtate of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and what, in a human view, is likely to be her future fate; or unimproveable by us.</p>
            <p>"IN ſuch a world as this, all things are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual change, rotation and revolution: It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's proceſs. As the ſummer and winter gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſucceed and encroach upon each other, or as the ſun dawns and ariſes from darkneſs till he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

The virtue of all nations and families begins in poverty, thence ariſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, genius, honour, perhaps to conqueſt and empire; there is their zenith; but then comes on the load of pondrous wealth that gradually weighs them down from this meridian to indulgence, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, guilt, corruption, proſtitution, ſlavery, perdition."</p>
            <p>WE in this country, at the preſent day, have every thing to induce us to cultivate union, and guard againſt diviſions among ourſelves. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is moſt dear and valuable, in this world, to millions now living, and will be ſo to all the milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their poſterity after them, till the world ſhall be no more, is at ſtake.

            <p>THE ſtrife whether this vaſt continent, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in length and breadth more thouſands of miles, than <hi>Great-Britain</hi> extends hundreds, ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as an appendage to that iſland three thouſand miles diſtant from it; and ſubjected to the arbitrary government of a ſet of men, at ſuch a diſtance, when intereſt and humour may lead them perpetually to prey upon the property and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this country, nature, reaſon, <hi>common ſenſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts at the thought.

all. And there is all reaſon that they ſhould do the ſame to us. But how different, in reality is their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and conduct. By the force of arms they are trying to reduce us to a ſtate of abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them; and have wantonly and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reſolved that they have a right to make laws binding us <hi>in all caſes whatever,</hi> a right belonging to no man nor body of men, and to no being, in the whole univerſe, nor to be truſted in the hands of any one, but of GOD <hi>the great Creator and ſovereign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor</hi> of all things, who is unerring in wiſdom and infinite in juſtice, goodneſs and all perfection. They have unrighteouſly begun the quarrel, and unſheathed the ſword, and driven us to the ſad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking up arms for our own defence and protection.</p>
            <p>CRITICAL, uncommon and peculiar as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are, which brought on, and have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto attended, the unnatural conteſt, into which we have been reluctantly forced, Heaven hath wonderfully united the hearts of this country, and in the midſt of the moſt crafty and unwearied efforts to ſow diviſions amongſt us, preſerved and increaſed the union, and crowned the exertions and enterprizes of the people of <hi>America</hi> with great and continued ſucceſs: And in many inſtances and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, through the ſpecial interpoſition of divine providence, with very unexpected and ſurprizing ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>ALL ſuch things are omens for good, demand our thankfulneſs, and encourage us to proſecute the virtuous ſtruggle, in humble dependance upon GOD, till he ſhall be pleaſed to extricate us out of our troubles.</p>

THE martial ſpirit that hath been excited, among all ranks and ages throughout this vaſt continent; the readineſs with which men have willingly offered themſelves in the ſervice of their country; the chearfulneſs with which fond parents and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, part with their children and friends, and encourage and ſpirit them to go forth in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and for the protection of our rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, is a happy preſage of deſired ſucceſs. We have felt, we now feel, and I truſt poſterity will ever feel the happy effects of the CONTINENTAL UNION which hath taken place, and hath been hitherto (and we hope always will be) cheriſhed and preſerved. It is owing to this that we are not reduced, by all the policy and power of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to that abject, dependant, oppreſſed and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſtate which they aimed at, but have made a noble and virtuous, a laudable and effectual reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the effects of which they feel, and long muſt feel, to their own great mortification, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and irreparable loſs. They affected at firſt to treat our union and efforts for the preſervation of our country, with contempt and ridicule; our union, ſaid they, would be but as a rope of ſand; our attempts to reſiſt, altogether folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And to intimidate us, the fleets and armies of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have been conjured up in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary repreſentation, more powerful and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they really are, or ever have been, or ever can be, and marſhalled for our deſtruction.</p>
            <p>WE find them not unaſſailable, not invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not immortal; not altogether incapable of fear and being put to flight, and that a very haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one too; but in every encounter our brave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen

have had with them upon any thing near equal terms, as to number and circumſtantial advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, our men have been conſtantly victorious, and conquered the enemy, and made them yield or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, with ſhame and loſs. Tis true the war is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous: For the moſt righteous and proſperous war is ſo on many accounts: But that our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are as capable of all the exerciſes and fatigues of war, and as bold to face danger in all its forms, as any men need to be, or indeed can be; not to mention a great variety of heroic actions, in the ſeveral parts of <hi>America,</hi> by ſea and land during the preſent ſtruggle; the ſingle march to <hi>Quebec,</hi> through ſuch a length of trackleſs, inhoſpitable wilderneſs, at ſo late a ſeaſon; the gallant attempt our little army made upon that ſtrong fortreſs; and though repulſed, yet ſupporting themſelves, and maintaining the ſiege of the city, in that fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen climate, at the coldeſt ſeaſon of the year; and all this againſt numbers vaſtly ſuperior to them, lodged in the walls and enjoying all the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a fine city. Theſe things, I ſay, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verey impartial and unbiaſſed obſerver, muſt exhibit the martial proweſs, the courage, fortitude and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevernce of <hi>Americans</hi> in the moſt reſpectable light.</p>
            <p>THE heroic General MONTGOMERY, and the brave men who fell with him, enjoy, as they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerve, the grateful tears of their country; and will be remembered with love, honour, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and admiration to the lateſt poſterity. The near relatives of the gallant men, who have thus nobly bled for their country, are honoured by their relation to them, and whatever reaſon there
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014805_0018_0F94DD960423DC38"/>
may be to mourn their own and their country's loſs, yet they juſtly derive conſolation from a view of their character which they have left behind them, and of that peaceful reſt and glory which they hopefully now enjoy. May GOD who hath the reſidue of the ſpirit raiſe up others in their ſtead to make up the gap, and may <hi>America</hi> ever have and cheriſh in her arms, champions and defenders of like ſpirit and bravery.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould we fall into diviſions and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among ourſelves, the conſequences are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fatal; a complication of the moſt dreadful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities will involve us in inevitable ruin, we ſhould ſoon be ſo weakened as to fall an eaſy prey into the hands of thoſe who are ſeeking the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dominion and maſtery over us.</p>
            <p>THE reſiſtance already made to their deſpotic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and power, hath exaſperated them to the moſt cruel pitch, and what we have to expect from them, if left to their mercy, may be conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, from what hath already been felt, where their vengeance hath been permitted to extend to execution. <hi>Falmouth, Charleſtown, Boſton</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> all our maritime places acceſſable to them; their ſpreading fire and ſword, and deſolation, wherever they could, give us the moſt ſignal and convincing evidence that their "tender mercies are cruelty." And ſhould any be ſo baſe as to ſubmit to them in all their claims, the moſt they can expect is to hold their lives and properties (if they can be ſaid to have any) at their mere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and after they have been made the wretched inſtruments of helping to deſtroy their brethren and fellow countrymen, to be themſelves laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.

With reſpect to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the mother country, ſo called, upon the plan of conduct ſhe hath of late years adopted towards the colonies; and purſued with inceſſant ardor and unrelenting fury, amity is loſt and confidence forfeited, and if the plan be continued, <hi>loſt and forfeited forever.</hi> If ſhe be a mother, ſhe is an unnatural, monſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous one, who, if ſhe doth not forget, yet ſhews ſhe hath "no compaſſion" upon her children, but rather delights in their blood.</p>
            <p>The murderous ſword, with all the wantonneſs of cruelty and revenge, in inſtances too many, is already bathed in their blood. And if we were once ſubdued to her will, and ſhould be ſubjected to the controul and power of her exaſperated, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoldiery, ſuch cruel and dreadful ſcenes would take place, as every good and benevolent man, unable to prevent them, might well deſire to hide himſelf from the ſight of, in the dark and ſilent manſions of the leſs cruel grave.</p>
            <p>NOTHING but union and firmneſs will prevent our deſolation, and effect our deliverance; and in no other way can a reconciliation and connection between the two countries take place that will be of any deſirable or happy conſequence.</p>
            <p>AND providence hath bleſſed us with the means, and calls upon us, by a virtuous example, to ſhew and convince the world, that tamely to ſubmit to the arbitrary, lawleſs, oppreſſive claims, of kings or courts, when the rights, welfare and happineſs of the people are at ſtake, is ſo far from being a duty, that it is <hi>ſin,</hi> and the contrary is indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty, and every one is called upon to make a reſolute, virtuous reſiſtance.</p>

The manner in which they were ſubdued, and the treatment they have met with ſince, hold up ſufficient beacons for our warning. Diviſions were created and fomented among them, by <hi>Britiſh</hi> intrigues, and their own arms made uſe of againſt themſelves. Not want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or gallant conduct, or reſources among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But want of union in their councils and meaſures, left them a prey to the ambition and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny under which they have ſo long and greatly ſuffered. And in rivetting the chains which hold them, the moſt crafty policy hath been made uſe of. Under the name of a kingdom and a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own, they have been cajoled and bribed into ſubjection to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> court; and brought under foreign influence; and the people, under the ſpecious pretence of being governed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the genuine principles of the Engliſh conſtitution, chuſing their repreſentatives and tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014805_0021_0F94DD9846CD45A0"/>
themſelves by virtue of ſuch repreſentation, have been cruelly reſtricted in their trade and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, ſaddled with penſions, ſqueezed, fleec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and oppreſſed into wretchedneſs, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and venal parricides of their country, and idle pampered <hi>Britiſh</hi> penſioners, riot and fatten upon their miſery.</p>
            <p>LONG ſince have their honeſt, ſenſible men and true patriots, of which they have had a worthy and reſpectable number, who for learning and virtue would do honour to any nation under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with virtuous indignation beheld, unravelled and oppoſed all the wicked manoeuvres of ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and enſlaving meaſures: But all their zeal and influence hath never yet been ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate their country.</p>
            <p>THE chains once rivetted are not eaſily ſhaken off, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> adminiſtration is always care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by the various arts of bribery and corruption, to gain over to its intereſt a venal majority. This is equally the caſe with the parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the people ('tis plain as ſunbeams) are ruined by repreſentatives of their own chuſing, and what is ſtranger ſtill, buy their ruin with their own money.</p>
            <p>IRELAND, no doubt (ſuch is the knowledge, ſpirit and virtue of many of her ſons) had long ago been effectually arouſed and emerged from ſuch a wretched ſtate of vaſſalage, had it not been for her local circumſtances, being an iſland ſo near <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> acceſſible on all ſides to her fleets, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually watched at all points, by her internal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and domineering neighbours. Her friends have ſighed and groaned, and in all the ways they
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014805_0022_0F94DD9902FF26A0"/>
could, have vented their juſt reſentment. And when of late the miniſtry of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> equally their and our enemies, applied to their parliament to lend their aſſiſtance and ſend their troops, by butchery and force to ſubjugate <hi>America,</hi> while the venal majority obſequiouſly complied; with what juſtneſs of ſentiment, zeal for liberty, and the unalienable rights of mankind; indignation at what they themſelves have already ſuffered, and may further ſuffer, and by ſuch mean compliance, be inſtrumental in bringing upon themſelves; and with what force of rhetorick and affecting pother in their ſpeeches do they expoſe and oppoſe the meaſures of the miniſtry with reſpect to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Their ſouls ſeem to breathe in their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their hearts to flow out with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. And we ſhould take the warning to take care of ourſelves, while we may, and by a firm union and virtuous reſiſtance, keep off the chains which are forging for us. If we ſubmit, we do it with our eyes open, and againſt the moſt plain and ſolemn warnings; againſt the ſentiments and ardent hopes and faithful remonſtrances of the greateſt and beſt men in both the kingdoms of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND our Continental Congreſs, compoſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of as wiſe, worthy and learned a ſet of men as ever convened on earth (and this is not ſaying ſo much of them as the great and wiſe Lord CHAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, once Mr. PITT, the patriotic, beloved mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the nation, and inſtrumental, in the hand of providence, of the greateſt bleſſing to Britain and America, hath expreſly and publicly ſaid of them.) I ſay, this reſpectable Congreſs, whoſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014805_0023_0F94DD99C5B41158"/>
members are choſen by the free voice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe intereſt and all is at ſtake with our own, and who by their ſtation, and the important truſt repoſed in them by their conſtituents, as they ſtand in the front of danger themſelves, and have the beſt advantages for framing a right judgment; and have all the united motives of duty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to incite them to the greateſt watchfulneſs, zeal and fidelity in the cauſe of their country; have all along been wiſe and faithful, to ſpy out and warn us againſt the ſnares and dangers to which we have been expoſed; and to point out to us a plain and ſure way, under the bleſſing of providence, for our relief and ſafety. We are refuſed the privileges of Engliſhmen, and unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> arms are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bow our necks to the yoke of ſlaviſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>PROVIDENCE hath bleſſed us on this <hi>continent,</hi> with all the reſources which we could ever deſire, in a united, virtuous improvement of which, to be a free and happy people. Not expoſed to the diſadvantages of a little iſland, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides with ocean, and under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate eye of jealous arbitrary power, we inhabit a <hi>vaſt continent,</hi> which, in itſelf, yields to the diligent and virtuous induſtry and invention of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, <hi>all things</hi> neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, protection and defence.</p>
            <p>IF we are not a free and happy people, it will be our own fault, and owing to the abuſe of the light and advantages providence hath bleſſed us with: and the preſent ſtruggle, if not maintain'd with union and perſeverance, till crown'd with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014805_0024_0F94DD9A8BDB7238"/>
ſucceſs, but dropt through our own diviſions, or timidity, will render this country, to all future ages, inſtead of an aſylum for perſecuted liberty, inſtead of the envy of ſlaves and tyrants, inſtead of the boaſt, happineſs and glory of freemen, a ſhame and reproach through all the earth.</p>
            <p>OH, then, may this truth be ingraven in indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters on every heart among us, a truth approved of by reaſon, and experimental obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſanctified by all the authority of divine revelation, UNITED, WE STAND, BUT DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDED, WE FALL.</p>
            <p>ALREADY do the avaricious courtiers of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with the numerons train of their needy dependents and hangers-on, with the whole tribe of diſſolute ſpendthrifts, and idle deboſhee's, feaſt themſelves with the proſpect of poſſeſſing the fruits of our paſt induſtry, and the ſpoils of our future earnings, and if once ſubjected to them, we ſhould find them greedy and inſatiable, like the <hi>daughters of the horſe-leech, crying, Give, give,</hi> and like <hi>the three things, yea, four, which ſay not, it is enough. The grave, and the barren womb; the earth, that is not filled with water, and the fire that ſaith not, it is enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TWAS for this that our fore fathers fled from the perſecution and tyranny of the age they lived in, and braved every danger and difficulty, to ſeek out and ſettle this diſtant, and then wilderneſs country. They ſought a peaceful retreat for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and poſterity, in which to enjoy the bleſſings of liberty and religion. They from their graves, or rather "from the battlements of heaven," call upon us to preſerve and cultivate the fair inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014805_0025_0F94DD9B4901C170"/>
they ſo dearly purchaſed and left us; and poſterity will moſt reaſonably expect that we tranſmit the ſame, undiminiſhed to them; and our own happineſs depends upon the enjoyment and improvement of it.</p>
            <p>REASON and religion, every argument and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that can influence a rational and pious mind, call for the dutiful exertion of all our united powers, to defend, protect and improve the rights, liberties and privileges with which GOD, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, hath ſo richly bleſſed us, againſt all foes and invaders whatſoever.</p>
            <p>THE controverſy in which we are engaged, is, in its nature and conſequences, of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. A ſtruggle of the kind, of ſuch magnitude and ſo intereſting and extenſive in its influence, hath as yet no place in the hiſtory of mankind. Things new and ſtrange, dark and perplexing, things at one and the ſame time moſt critical and intereſting, and ſuch as muſt be acted upon, and muſt influence our conduct, and affect the public, often lie in our way; and no wonder in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances men differ in ſentiment, even the wiſe and good, and as true friends to their country as any it can boaſt: Tis much rather a wonder that in ſuch a ſtrange perplexed ſtate as we have been thrown into, the difference hath not been much greater.</p>
            <p>THIS teaches us the wiſdom and great neceſſity of mutual forbearance and condeſcention towards one another; of guarding againſt all irritating, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful language and injurious conduct; and aiming conſtantly at what we, in our beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014805_0026_0F94DD9BFB45DBD0"/>
think is for the greateſt welfare of our country. In the purſuit of this our HEARTS and HANDS ſhould be united, and if we cannot be perfectly agreed in all particular meaſures, yet we ſhould ſo keep the grand end in view, as to aim in all our wiſhes and conduct at that; and thus bury all uncomfortable and hurtful contentions among ourſelf, and do nothing to <hi>provoke one another except to love and good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the guilt and wickedneſs of that man is hardly to be conceived, who is diſpoſed to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the times, and (under the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of aiming at the liberty and proſperity of his country) aſperſe characters, gratify his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or more perſonal ſelf-intereſted views of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind; or is willing to <hi>owe his greatneſs to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND how abſurd, inconſiſtent and malicious is the temper and conduct of thoſe who impute all the exertions of our wiſeſt and beſt men, in the cauſe of their country, to a ſpirit of faction, and ſelf-intereſted and wicked motives and deſigns, and to any thing beſides the good of their country? This has been done by thoſe ſtiled <hi>the friends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> on both ſides the water. And yet it is notorious to all impartial obſervers, that theſe our patriots are acting from the ſame principles and motives, with the greateſt and beſt men the nation could ever boaſt, and who are acknowledged by themſelves to have been the trueſt friends to her rights, liberties and happineſs; and in defence of theſe and oppoſition to tyranny, ſome of them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bled; and by means of their virtuous ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014805_0027_0F94DD9CC16DB900"/>
the nation has enjoyed ſo much liberty and happineſs as it has.</p>
            <p>DOES not this comprize the abſurdity and malice of the ancient phariſaical ſpirit? They act like true patriots, they venture life and their ALL in the cauſe of their country, this cannot be denied, but then ſay our enemies, they aim not at the good but the ruin of their country: <hi>juſt as well may Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan caſt out Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is peculiarly our happineſs in this colony, that in the midſt of the perplexed ſtate of affairs through the country, our civil polity and form of government hath been and yet continues compleat. And we have reaſon to think it hath had a very extenſive happy influence through the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. And never did the freemen of it, need ſuch wiſdom, ſteadineſs and integrity in their conduct as at the preſent day.</p>
            <p>WE need a juſt ſenſe of the importance and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects of union; and of the malignity and fatal influence of diviſions, and of the ſolemn oath of GOD which is upon us; and this, and this alone, will enable us to diſcharge a good conſcience; and thus doing is the only way in which we can hope for the direction and bleſſing of Heaven.</p>
            <p>I ADD no more, but pray ALMIGHTY GOD to bleſs what hath been ſpoken agreeable to truth, and cauſe it to have a genuine, practical influence upon us all.</p>
            <closer>AMEN.</closer>
