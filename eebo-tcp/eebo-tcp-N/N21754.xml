            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE HEIR OF THE HOUSE OF OLDFIELD. A MORAL TALE</head>
            <p>IT is a maxim recognized by every obſerver of depraved human nature, "that he who has been baſe enough eſſentially to injure the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, never forgives them." We may add, that miſcreants of this deſcription frequently purſue, with relentleſs hatred, even the poſterity of thoſe whom they have thus offended. Yet let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that if implacable villany kindles with malice againſt the injured victims; it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their preſence, and even their exiſtence, reminds him of his guilt, and makes him tremble for the dreaded retribution.</p>
            <p>David Siniſter had been forty years ſtewar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and ſolicitor to Henry Oldfield, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> richeſt and moſt reſpectable families in the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of Hereford; and, at the time of that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's deceaſe, he had contrived to amaſs a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of about as many thouſand pounds. This ample ſum however, ſerved only to inſpire him
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028632_0005_0FDA32CA06BA4E28"/>
with the diabolical deſire of compleatly plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his maſter's heir of the family-eſtate, a deſing which he ſoon found means effectually to execute. To enumerate the various artifices by which this abominable plan was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would be but to lay open thoſe dreadful ſcenes of iniquity which are every day practiſing, and againſt which no human laws can poſſibly protect, with certainty, the hapleſs victims of an infernal confederation.</p>
            <p>The young man ſtruggled but a ſhort time with his hard fate; but he lived long enough to leave behind, at the age of twenty-five, a fine boy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two years old, whoſe mother had, about three months before, fallen the victim of a pulmonary complaint.</p>
            <p>Her father, the curate of a ſmall village, in the county of Cambridge, took the infant under his protection: and not only made him acquainted with the rudiments of learning; but, what was of far higher value, implanted in his tender mind, the unfeigned love of virtue, and a firm reliance on Providence. He was himſelf of a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive habit; and had long looked forward to the event which was to ſend the poor heir of the houſe of Oldfield houſeleſs into the world. Yet he would ſuddenly check the tear of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which his pious ſoul deemed ſinful; and preſſing the poor youth to his breaſt, as he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him on his trembling knees, he would ſing with the moſt celeſtial ſweetneſs and fervour
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028632_0005_0FDA32CA06BA4E28"/>
as if under the immediate inſpiration of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>He who the raven's wants ſupplies.</l>
               <l>For all his creatures will provide;</l>
               <l>To him I raiſe my ardent eyes,</l>
               <l>In him my trembling lips confide:</l>
               <l>And He, when my frail ſpirit's fled,</l>
               <l>Shall give my boy his daily bread.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The fatal hour at length arrived; and Harry, then little more than fifteen years of age, having wept over the grave of his laſt earthly friend, bowed to the will of the Father of the fatherleſs, with aſtoniſhing reſignation. The effects of the worthy old gentleman were barely ſufficient to diſcharge his trifling debts, and defray the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expences; and with ſomething leſs than ten pounds in his pocket, this well-educated little orphan had the prudence to conſider by what means he ſhould obtain more, before this ſmall ſum became exhauſted. At firſt, he thought of trying his fortune in London; but this deſign was abandoned, the inſtant he recollected what his grandfather had ſaid reſpecting the vices of the metropolis, and the many dangers to which friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs innocence and inexperienced youth are there expoſed. Some employ, however, he reſolved, to ſeek; and his heart ſighed to viſit the family ſtate of Oldfield Hall, which he had heard ſo frequently and ſo feelingly deſcribed. He was ſenſible of the height from which his poor father had fallen; and felt an ardent deſire to viſit the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028632_0006_0FDA32CF5EB19310"/>
cene of his family's proſperous days. He flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf, ſome perſon might be left in the neighbourhood, who would kindly afford him food for his labour; and, at any rate, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he could ſuſtain every hardſhip, on the ſpot where Heaven had formerly ſhowered for them ſo many bleſſings. "Surely," thought he, "I ſhall not be driven from fields, that were once theirs, without a few ſcattered ears of corn! I ſhall not be denied ſome ſmall portion of the fruits that are free for "Nature's commoners." Not Heaven, that has hitherto provided for me, will not there forſake me! My footſteps may ſometimes preſs the paths where they have trod; my eyes will behold views with which they have been delighted. I ſhall there eat the bread of health, I ſhall there drink the waters of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and be happy!" Theſe were the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that impelled him to ſet out for Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; and that enabled him to "go on his way rejoicing," during a tedious journey of near a hundred and fifty miles.</p>
            <p>He reached the abode of his anceſtors late in the evening; and crept, unperceived, into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> outhouſe, where he ſlept peacefully till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>He aroſe ſoon after the ſun; and walked muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the delightful grounds; and his eyes now ſuffuſed with tears, and now brightening with pleaſure, ſurveyed every object with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cret but melancholy ſatisfaction. Ardently di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

he long to behold the internal parts of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manſion! but this was a gratification not to be expected; at leaſt for the preſent.</p>
            <p>In this manner did he wander ſeveral days; ſometimes ſleeping in the ſhed where he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the firſt night, and ſometimes reaching a ſmall and lonely alehouſe, about a mile diſtant, the only habitation he could find in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>The preſent owner of Oldfield Hall, he knew, had been the former ſteward of the family; and he knew that his grandfather could never bear to hear the name of Siniſter mentioned, without viſible emotion; But he little thought that his father had been robbed of his inheritance by the machinations of the cruel monſter, and his heart entertained not the ſmalleſt prejudice againſt a man who he ſuppoſed had become the legal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of the eſtate.</p>
            <p>David Siniſter happened at this time to be from home. He was attending the aſſizes at Hereford, where he had been to convict a man for ſheep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtealing; and who, though he had a wife and ſeven children almoſt ſtarving, and it was his firſt offence, immediately received ſentence of death, and was ordered for execution.</p>
            <p>Having performed this act of juſtice, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with great ſatisfaction. It was a fine ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's evening; and, as he drew near home, he expatiated largely, to his ſervant, on the value
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028632_0007_0FDA32D1097F1378"/>
of honeſty; and on the turpitude of criminally appropriating another's property, however tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, even from the abſurd plea of neceſſity, which the malefactor had alone urged in his defence— "Property," cried he, "is ſo ſacred that I would hang my own brother, were he living, if he rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me of a ſhilling to ſave himſelf from ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!"</p>
            <p>Scarcely had he uttered theſe words, when Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oldfield, who happened to be in the field next the road, where he was at that moment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating with his conſcience the propriety of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a turnip for his ſupper, and who now reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to run away from the temptation, haſtily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending the ſtile, preſented, acroſs the road, the ſhadow of his father, to the aſtoniſhed eyes of this ſtern diſpenſer of juſtice. The glance was tranſitory, as the electrick ſtroke; but, like the ſtroke of electricity, it thrilled through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fibre of his frame. The momentary check which it occaſioned to his horſe, and the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his ſpeech which it inſtantaneouſly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, gave the youth time to leap over the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſtile, before Siniſter could be thoroughly ſatisfied whether what he beheld was reality, or the effect of ſome ſupernatural appearance, the poſſibility of which he had never till that inſtant believed. As ſoon as he regained the power of utterance, though he feared to look back, he ventured to aſk his ſervant if he had ſeen any thing, and deſired him now to ride a little before.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028632_0007_0FDA32D1097F1378"/>
The ſervant had been ſurprized at his maſter's ſudden taciturnity; and he was now aſtoniſhed at his queſtion, as well as his requeſt: advancing his horſe, however, he inſtantly replied, that he had ſeen nothing but a poor boy, who had juſt haſtily croſſed the road. "Are you ſure it was a boy?" ſaid Siniſter: "the ſhade appeared like that of a very tall man."—"La! Sir," replied the ſervant; "our ſhadows, you know, always grow longer at ſunſet!"—"That's true," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Siniſter: "but ſtill—"</p>
            <p>Here he pauſed—to conſider whether he was not about to ſay, what he might afterwards wiſh retracted: and, as they had now approached within a half a mile of the houſe, not another ſyllable did he riſque till they arrived there.</p>
            <p>At home, though he was ſurrounded with ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, he had never poſſeſſed any other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than that of amaſſing wealth, which he had not the ſpirit to enjoy. For innocent amuſements he had no reliſh; reading was a waſte of time; and reflection was death. He was beloved by no human being: even his ſon, whom he waded through iniquity, and even blood itſelf, to enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at once dreaded and deſpiſed him. His wife had long ſince fallen the victim to his cruelty; if, indeed, her death had not been haſtened by an artful ſtrumpet whom ſhe had indiſcreetly made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>her companion, and with whom he now openly cohabited. She, indeed, it is true, produced him a couple of children; but, if he had not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028632_0008_0FDA32D64EAED5B8"/>
been blinded by his abſurd attachment, he might have beheld what every one elſe plainly perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in the countenance of his French valet, and not in his own looking-glaſs, their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance was to be diſcovered. Monſieur's features were large, and his face was the rouged bronze of his country; his maſter's unpleaſingly dime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive, and his countenance the palid hue of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned guilt. With this baſe woman did Siniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpend moſt of his time; and, though her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were coarſe, her ſentiments groſly vulgar, and her voice harſh as the raven's; ſo that it was impoſſible he could have loved her, had he beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>To ſuch a companion, with all his weakneſs, he was much too cunning to unboſom himſelf. He had no appetite for the proviſion that was ſet before him; and, having laboured to drow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was in vain, however, that he endeavor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to compoſe himſelf to reſt: his eyes were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028632_0008_0FDA32D64EAED5B8"/>
fancy conducted to his ear ſounds of criminal accuſation, and of menaced vengeance. He clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both his ears and eyes, yet voices ſeemed to ſpeak from within him; and the cries of the ſheep-ſtealer's wife and children, now imploring pardon, and now reproaching him with ſuperior guilt, while to his mind's eye they ſeemed ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing around the agonized man, who was about to be launched into eternity; proved together too powerful for him; and leaping out of bed, with a loud cry he fell down in a ſwoon.</p>
            <p>Though his houſekeeper lay in the next room, and neither ſhe nor Monſieur were aſleep, they did not think proper to hear him: weltering, therefore, in his blood, for he had cut his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by the fall, he continued till nature gave him ſtrength ſufficiently recruited to reach the bell; when he immediately gave an alarm, to which they knew the certain conſequence of being deaf.</p>
            <p>Having put ſome balſam to the wound, which appeared trifling, notwithſtanding the effuſion of blood was great, his tender houſekeeper now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately intreated permiſſion to ſit up with him for the remainder of the night. But, tho' her preſence took off much of the horror he had before felt, it was in vain that he endeavored to procure ſleep; and in a ſtate of reſtleſs ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he continued till the welcome appearance of morning.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028632_0009_0FDA32D9E804FAD8"/>The morning, however, broke out with the ſplendor of the proceeding day. The cloud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> necoſſity of remaining at home.</p>

He had juſt raiſed to his lips the firſt morſal of his breakfaſt, when the whole groupe, having been refuſed admiſſion, knelt at his gate, and with their affecting cries began to realize what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> little for him to forgive; ſince he not loſt a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſhilling on the occaſion. The imprudent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028632_0009_0FDA32D9E804FAD8"/>
fellow was detected in ſelling this ſolitary ſheep, which he had met with ſtraying in the road, at a time when he had neither money, nor work, nor food for his family. He had, therefore, for the firſt time of his life, yielded to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he would not for the univerſe, have taken it home to his family, or have let them know that he had by improper means procured the value of a farthing. In this frame of mind, Siniſter deſired the petition might be brought in; and to the ſurprize of the ſervants, whoſe tears ran down their faces for joy, he immediately ſigned it. At the tranſporting, but unexpected intelligence, the poor woman faiinted away; for a pardon had been promiſed by the judge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the proſecutor would ſign the petition: and, when ſhe recovered, the fervor with which ſhe prayed to Heaven for bleſſings on her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's preſerver, and the artleſs manner in which ſhe was joined by her little ones, had an effect far beyond any conception.</p>
            <p>Siniſter, having thus cheaply ſatisfied his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſpent the remainder of the day in chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and, at night, enjoyed a more calm and delightful repoſe than he had for many years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
            <p>In the morning he roſe early; and looking out at a window, while his horſe was getting ready, what was his aſtoniſhment, on perceiving the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boy iſſue from a little ſhed, whoſe ſhadow,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028632_0010_0FDA32DBABCE14B0"/>
as he was now fully perſuaded, had occaſioned him ſo much alarm!</p>
            <p>He had but a few minutes to reflect on this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, before he was informed that the horſe waited; and, immediately mounting, he thought he would direct his ride to that part of the park in which he had loſt ſight of the boy. Having proceeded about a quarter of a mile, he diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at a diſtance, near a wood on the verge of the park; and, calling to his ſervant—"Look there, (ſaid he) is not that the boy you ſaw the other evening?"—"Where, Sir?" replied the man, looking in a different direction. "There, blockhead!" cried his maſter, pointing to juſt ſpot. But it was too late, for the youth had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> juſt entered the wood; and the ſervant began to think his maſter's ſenſes had taken leave of him.</p>
            <p>It is aſtoniſhing what trifles alarm a guilty mind! Siniſter's happineſs was again fled; all his terrors returned. Yet the object that excited this commotion was but a child; a poor friendleſs child! who had a heart too tender to trample wantonly on a worm.</p>
            <p>Young Harry had ſeen Siniſter at the window; and he was perſuaded that he had been ſeen by him when he quitted the ſhed. He now began to fear, that he had taken an unwelcome, and perhaps an unjuſt liberty, in lodging without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs permiſſion, where certainly any animal in the creation might ungrudgingly been ſuffered to repoſe: anduch was the delicate propriety of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028632_0010_0FDA32DBABCE14B0"/>
his mind, that he would have diſdained even the ſhelter of a hedge, if he felt the ſmalleſt indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he might poſſibly be acting wrong.</p>
            <p>Alas! he could feelingly ſay, with the only "perfect Being" ever on earth—"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have neſts; but the ſon of man hath not where to lay his head!"</p>
            <p>For ſeveral days he remained concealed in the woods, ſubſiſting merely on the nuts and berries he found there: and, each night, climbing a thick tree, he faſtened his body, with a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, to one of the firmeſt branches, where he fearleſsly repoſed till awakened by the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful harmony of his early and innocent neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>Siniſter, during all this time, was ſuffering e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very horror of a mind awakened to a ſenſe of it's guilt. Each day was ſpent in anticipating the terrors of the coming night; and ſuch were his augmented apprehenſions, that he could not endure to be left a moment in the dark, and had a ſervant conſtantly awake in his chamber. The wound on his temples too, either from the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his animal ſpirits, or in conſequence of his tender houſekeeper's balſam, a ſecret compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of her own began to exhibit alarming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances: but ſhe perſuaded him that her infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible plaiſter muſt ſoon do the buſineſs; and his mental wound gave him a thouſand times more
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028632_0011_0FDA32DCE12ECBF8"/>
pain, than he either felt or dreaded from ſo inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant a hurt.</p>
            <p>The ſervant, who accompanied him from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and on his airing in Oldfield park, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſiſt the kitchen council's enquiry into the cauſe of their maſter's malady, by relating what he had witneſſed reſpecting the boy; who had been obſerved looking earneſtly towards the houſe and contemplatively traverſing the grounds, ſeveral times. But there was, they all agreed, ſo much of the gentleman in the little fellow and he looked ſo innocent, good-natured, and handſome; that they were certain he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have any bad deſign, nor belong to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had; and they would have invited hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

laſt ſhe gueſſed, rightly enough, what was at the bottom. To ſatisfy herſelf, ſhe fetched from the lumber garret, where a large collection of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portraits had been long locked up, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits of the two laſt Oldfields; and, ſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oning into her apartment the ſervant who had ofteneſt ſeen the youth, ſhe began, firſt bribing his ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with a glaſs of cherry-brandy, to enquire if the boy he had ſeen was like either of thoſe pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The fellow, at the ſight of the youngeſt, which was in fact Harry Oldfield, (the father) ſtarted back with affright; his eyes ſeemed incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to quit their ſockets, and his hair ſtanding erect—"'Tis as like, 'tis as like, madam, (he ſtammered out) as, as, as—are you ſure it is not him himſelf?" This was ſufficient.

She repreſented the cruelty to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſmothering any ſecret that oppreſſed him, and mildly reproached his want of confidence in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner ſo long experienced affection. There was nothing, not even her life, that ſhe would heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to ſacrifice for the dear object to whom ſhe had already forfeited what was to a woman of her honor and breeding ſo much more precious than life itſelf. What would become of her, what would become of his ſweet babes, if he gave way to ſuch cauſeleſs but ruinous regrets! If he died, Heaven knew, they muſt all go to the work-houſe; for, to be ſure, his fine ſon would ſoon turn them out of doors, and perhaps not long have a houſe over his own head! With this kind of language, to which he but little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſhe contrived to keep her tongue in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome hours; and he who was all the time pondering on the means by which he ſhould ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually get rid of the laſt heir of the houſe of Oldfield, began to aſk what ſhe thought of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur. Conſcience haſtily interpreting this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe tartly replied, that he was an ugly wretch, and that ſhe could never abide him. "I do not mean, (ſays Siniſter) to aſk your opinion of his beauty: But do you think his fidelity can be depended on! Can he keep a ſecret?"—"O, yes! (replied ſhe, glad to find there was no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy): I have tried him many and many's the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028632_0012_0FDA32E1FAE777C0"/>
time; and you would be really aſtoniſhed, if I were to tell you how well he can keep a ſecret! No, hang him! though he is certainly not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to give the man his due, I muſt ſay, he is as fit to be truſted with ſecrets as any fellow I ever knew, and I have known many in my time."—"Not ſo faſt; not ſo faſt! (interrupted Siniſter) I have been thinking of a plan. If this boy could be privately ſecured, and ſent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where abroad, ſo that I might never ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, coſt what it would, I ſhould be happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough."—"Give yourſelf no more trouble about it, (ſaid ſhe) you may reckon the thing done, and ſleep in peace."</p>
            <p>She told Monſieur, in the morning, what had paſſed between her and her maſter; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, though with ſome reluctance, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the taſk. Accordingly, he ſpent the whole of that day, in making minute enquiries after the youth. He even traced him to the little alehouſe, where he had been refreſhed; but the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord and his wife proteſted they had ſeen nothing of him for ſeveral days, and they were anxious to know what could be become of him. They declared he was the gentleſt and beſt creature in the world: and they never loved ſo well a child of their own, for they believed he was an angel. Monſieur now told them, that if he came again, he begged they would ſend him word; and, if they would promiſe to keep the ſecret, he would tell
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028632_0013_0FDA32E3AB877A78"/>
them the truth. The boy, he ſaid, was his own ſon; and had run away from his mother, in France, who was breaking her heart at his abſence. All he wanted was, to ſecure the young rogue, and ſend him back to his mother, till his own father died; when he ſhould return to his dear wife, and live like a gentleman, on his own family eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The good ſouls, who believed every ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Monſieur ſaid, promiſed to do as he had told them; and they would have religiouſly kept their word, had Harry unfortunately furniſhed them with any opportunity. But Providence was pleaſed to diſpoſe of him in a different way.</p>
            <p>He was, one morning, deſcending from a tree in which he had all night repoſed, when he was perceived by an old man, ſitting on the ground at a little diſtance, who was binding together a few ſticks, to form a ſmall faggot. There was ſomething wonderfully benign and attractive in the countenance of the old man: Whoſe ſilver beard ſwept his boſom; and whoſe head, though rendered bald by age, ſtill retained a few ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered locks of ſnowy hair. His whole form was manly; and his dreſs, though coarſe, clean and neat in the extreme. He was a man of whom no ſtranger could heſitate to ſay, that he had ſeen more proſperous days. Harry, though natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diffident and diſtant, was attracted, as it were involuntarily towards the old man; who while the youth approached, looking ſtedfaſtly in his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028632_0013_0FDA32E3AB877A78"/>
face, with a union of ſurpriſe, of doubt, and of tranſport, no ſooner ſaw features once ſo famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar to his eye, than he roſe on one knee, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—"Gracious Heaven, I am not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this is ſurely my dear young maſter! it muſt, it muſt be, Harry Oldfield!"</p>
            <p>Harry acknowledged that his name was Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; and a few minutes acquaintance endeared them to each other. The good old man had in his youth been valet to Harry's grandfather. He afterwards rented for many years, a reſpectable farm, on the Oldfield eſtate, from which he was cruelly ejected by Siniſter, who had laid ſix farms into one, and thus driven ſo many families into diſtreſs and obſcurity.</p>
            <p>When the poor man underſtood the ſituation of Harry, from his ſimple narrative, his aged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I and my little girl contrive to live comfortably enough." To this generous offer, Harry could only reply, that he believed Heaven had brought them together; and if it pleaſed the ſame graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Power, he could wiſh nothing might ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them.</p>
            <p>Harry lived for ſome weeks in this retreat; and, by the advice of the old man, they ſeldom approached Siniſter's grounds. He knew the malice and implacability of the wretch, by ſad experience; and he dreaded the lengths to which the villain might proceed againſt the heir of Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field eſtate. They had, however been ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and, one evening, juſt after they had retired to reſt, three men in ſoldiers cloaths came to the door and demanded admittance. The old man told them, from a ſmall window, that his family were in bed; that he knew nothing of them; and that they could clearly have no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there. One of them replied, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a recruiting-party; and that, having come from Hereford, after a deſerter, whom he harboured, they were reſolved not to go away without him. The young man, they ſwore, was about five and twenty: He was one of the fineſt fellows in their regiment, being full ſix feet without his ſhoes; much ſcarred with the ſmall pox; and had red hair: he was, therefore re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>markable enough, and they were not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the perſon, though they well knew h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> went by different names. Harry, the old man,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028632_0014_0FDA32E73173F538"/>
and his daughter, having ſlipped on their cloaths, and agreeing there would be no harm in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſoldiers to ſearch for the perſon they deſcribed, the door was unſuſpectingly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Harry, whom two of the ſoldiers immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately dragged away, crying out—"This is him; this is him, ſafe enough! I thought we ſhould be too cunning for the old fox, and the young cub too!" The old man, in a ſtate of diſtraction, ruſhed out of the houſe, and purſued after them; but it was with difficulty he could diſcover even the road they had taken. That diſcovery how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inſpired him with hope; for he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the fields, of which they were clearly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and was thus enabled to get into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic road, and porcure aſſiſtance from two or three farm-houſes, full a quarter of an hour before they reached the end of the lane. Ten ſtout men with guns and pitchforks, therefore, lay in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh for their arrival; and ſuddenly burſting out ſurrounded and diſarmed the three villains, and ſafely delivered Harry into the arms of his old friend. The fellows being thus taken and ſecured, ſoon came to a confeſſion: from which it appeared that Siniſter's French valet had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and inſtructed them; and that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived twenty pounds a piece for undertaking the buſineſs, and where to have theſe ſums made up by five hundred whenever it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. They owned they were ſmugglers, and not ſoldiers; and the deſign was firſt to carry him
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028632_0015_0FDA32E82A4EF2A8"/>
into Wales, and from thence to tranſport him to the continent, where he was to be left without a ſhilling in his pocket, and conſequently there would have been no great chance of his ever get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting back again. The old man went next day to Hereford, with the three ſoldiers, and Harry Oldfield; and obtained from the majiſtrates, a warrant for the apprehenſion of Siniſter, as well as his valet. But Monſieur had juſt taken leave of Oldfield Hall; and his maſter had, a few hours before, ſet out to appear before the bar of a ſtill more tremendous tribunal! It appeared that, for ſome days, either in ſpite or in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his ſkilful houſekeeper's infalible plaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a gangrene had evidently taken place; and, while ſhe and Monſieur were gone to inſtruct the ruffians, old Siniſter, beginning to ſuſpect the truth, called his ſervants together, and taking his will, which contained a legacy to the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper and her children, of ten thouſand pounds, immediately thruſt it in the fire; declaring that the law would diſpoſe of his property exactly as he wiſhed, by giving every ſhilling to his ſon. Notwithſtanding the injunctions of ſecrecy, this intelligence reached the ears of the copartners in iniquity, within half an hour after their return; and they accordingly took care, in the courſe of the night, to make ample preparation for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Long before daylight, every thing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, that was eaſy to be concealed, found its way to a diſtant ſecret depoſitory; and old Siniſter,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028632_0015_0FDA32E82A4EF2A8"/>
whoſe dreadful groans for a great part of the night kept moſt of the family awake, was in the morning diſcovered to have breathed his laſt. It was the intention of Monſieur, and his tender houſekeeper, to carry their depredations ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but, in conſequence of a letter, which at noon arrived from young Siniſter, mentioning that he had juſt landed in England, and would be at Oldfield Hall the next day, they judged it moſt expedient for Monſieur immediately to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp into Wales; whither ſhe was to follow him, the moment ſhe could prevail on young Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to make her the handſome legal ſettlement, ſhe entertained no doubt of obtaining from his generous and unſuſpecting diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Harry Siniſter reached Oldfield Caſtle the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day; and ſoon learned the moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant particulars of the various tranſactions. For the miſerable death of his wretched father—
<q>"Some natural tears he dropp'd, but wip'd them ſoon."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when he heard, from all tongues, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſtory of Harry Oldfield's ſufferings; and, from the peruſal of ſome of his father's papers, became completely ſatisfied that the eſtate had been obtained by the moſt infernal practices; though a young man of a gay turn, and a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to what are ſoftened by the appelation of faſhionable follies and youthful diſſipation, he dropped on one knee, and with his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive eyes lifted to Heaven, energetically depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028632_0016_0FDA32EA16AD2D00"/>
it's vengeance; and ſolemnly vowed never to poſſeſs, what it was impoſſible to enjoy, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſhilling of that property which his father had, as he dreaded to reflect, purchaſed at the price of his immortal ſoul!</p>
            <p>In this juſt reſolve he was ſtrengthened by the Power to whom he had wiſely appealed; and, filled with a tranſport, which no vicious gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had for a moment ever conveyed to his boſom, he haſtened to fetch Harry Oldfield to the manſion of his forefathers.</p>
            <p>The interview which now took place, was a ſpectacle for angels: preſumptuous, indeed, muſt be the pen which attempted to give it tongue. It was the celeſtial communication of kindred ſouls, purged from every terrene groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in which each look, each motion, each feature, each accent, and even ſilence itſelf, ſpoke a language beyond the higheſt flights of human rhetoric.</p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice to add, that from this moment all the wealth of old Siniſter was at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of Harry Oldfield. Every argument that could be adduced proved inſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on the ſon to acceet the ſmalleſt portion of what he inſiſted would, in his cuſtody, contam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate every penny he might hereafter honeſtly acquire, and carry with it a curſe to the lateſt poſterity. It was by theſe participations, he was convinced that Heaven chiefly "viſited the ſins of the fathers, upon the children from generation
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028632_0016_0FDA32EA16AD2D00"/>
to generation." Nor would he conſent that a ſhilling ſhould be given to his father's infamous houſekeeper, which he inſiſted would only be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging vice; and ſhe was diſmiſſed, with her children, to follow him whoſe duty it was to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them. It turned out, however, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur had gone off for America, with the whole booty.</p>
            <p>At his own earneſt requeſt, Harry Siniſter was appointed to his father's original ſituation, as ſteward of the eſtate; and never was that import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant truſt confided to more able or faithful hands. Harry Oldfield built for him a noble houſe in his park; and, erecting another for his adored old man, he procured the widow of a worthy cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman to educate the daughter: and, it is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally thought, as he now uſually calls her his little wife, that this good old domeſtic's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, notwithſtanding her father's delicate ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and remonſtrances, will probably become the happy partner of the Heir of the Houſe of Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</p>

            <head>STORY OF PATTY ASHFORD. A TALE FOUNDED ON FACT.</head>
            <p>LET not the proud look with a ſcornful eye on the humble heroine whoſe ſtory ſolicits attention. Though nurtered in indigence, and educated but in the ſchool of ſorrow; ſhe was the care of Heaven, and man cannot be degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by tracing it's wonderful hand in her preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from irremediable miſery.</p>
            <p>Patty Aſhford's parents were two of thoſe thoughtleſs young people, who enter early into the cares of life, without ſufficiently reflecting on the conſequence. They knew, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were virtuous; and, whatever they might ſuffer, they determined to ſuffer together. Their union, though honorable, was a ſtolen one; and Patty, before her entrance into life, betrayed the ſecret of her parents. They were both, on this diſcovery, rendered deſtitute of a home. Her father was diſmiſſed by the uncle who had brought him up: her mother, by a rich, but cruel father; who cut her off with a ſhilling, and left the whole of his property to her brother, whom his brutality had driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028632_0017_0FDA32F06BB58788"/>
in the capacity of a common ſailor. Thus, like our firſt parents, but with the ſuperior con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of innocence in their boſoms—
<q>
                  <l>The world was all before them, where to chuſe</l>
                  <l>Their place of reſt, and Providence their guide.</l>
                  <bibl>MILTON.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>With a few ſhillings in their pockets, and their whole wardrobe in a couple of handkerchiefs, they ſet off they knew not whither. After tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling many miles, and furmounting innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hardſhips, a worthy farmer compaſſionated their diſtreſs; employed the huſband as a labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and gave them a little ſhed to live in, which their induſtry ſoon rendered a comfortable reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In this ſhed Patty Aſhford was born. But, as if life had been retained by the mother, only that ſhe might give it to her infant; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was no ſooner told he had got a daughter, than it was added, he had loſt his wife. This was too ſevere a ſtroke. His agony was beyond all deſcription; and, in three days, a fever at once cloſed his miſeries and his exiſtence.</p>
            <p>The farmer was worthy, but he was not rich. His rent had been nearly doubled, by the offers of manopolizing neighbours, eager to "lay field to field:" and, with a heart feelingly alive to the ſufferings of others, he had often been plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in difficulties which rendered himſelf a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine object of compaſſion. His wife was his true counterpart: ſhe was, in humble life, the Lady Bountiful of the ſurrounding country; a primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028632_0018_0FDA32F1A1E63518"/>
practiſer of phyſic. She had a balſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for every wound; and a diet-drink for every diſeaſe; and they were literally given to all who needed them. This worthy couple laid their heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The reſult was, that they buried the unhappy pair in the ſame grave; and agreed to bring up, with their only ſurviving ſon, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant not a year old, the tender orphan whom they were perſuaded Heaven had ſent to claim their protection, and whom they named after her mother.</p>
            <p>Little Patty, as ſhe grew up, was admired much for her beauty, but ſtill more for the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mildneſs of her diſpoſition. Her boſom was the ſent of all that is tender and good; and ſhe began to make conſiderable progreſs in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous domeſtic employments, though only about eleven years of age, when the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmer, who had ſuffered by becoming ſecurity for a friend, had his goods ſeized, and was himſelf ſent to the county-g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. This event broke his wife's heart; their ſon was taken by a poor relation, for the rich would have nothing to do with a perſon ſo extremely weak; and little Patty having no friend in the world, was conveyed to the pariſh work-houſe.</p>
            <p>In this miſerable place, ſhe remained untill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen; when ſhe was taken out by a lady, then on a viſit to her relations in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but who had married in London, and who wanted, a neat girl to aſſiſt in the nurſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028632_0018_0FDA32F1A1E63518"/>Poor Patty had been treated but indifferently by the unfeeling mercenaries who kept the poor-houſe. She had been made to labour much, and permitted to eat but little: yet, at the thought of parting from thoſe with whom ſhe had been long accuſtomed to live, and probably reflecting on what ſhe knew of her paſt hiſtory, ſhe ſhed many tears.</p>
            <p>Her miſtreſs, however, was a woman of good character, and of a very affable diſpoſition. She took pains to comfort her; told her of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine things ſhe would ſee in town; how well prudent young women frequently did there; and above all cheared her by the reflection, that ſhe was going to the place which had given birth to her deceaſed parents. This was at once a ſolace and a ſhock. The gleam of ſunſhine it convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her boſom, was that of April; it darted through a gloomy cloud and was accompanied by a copious ſhower of tears.</p>
            <p>In her new ſituation, ſhe was univerſally belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The children, in particular, were as fond of her as of their parents; and ſhe began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy comfort, at leaſt, if not felicity. She could not but occaſionally reflect on her lot, in being deprived of both parents at her birth; and the cruel circumſtances which had deprived her for ever from her kind foſter-father, who was all this time languiſhing in confinement. From the firſt moment in which ſhe could pen a letter,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028632_0019_0FDA32F30DBC9DE8"/>
ſhe had correſponded with him. She now ſent him every ſhilling ſhe could ſcrape together, and his truly parental letters were her chief conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He murmured at nothing; he was thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for every thing: and ſtill, with pious and a patient eye, contemnplated hope through the bars of his priſon. "Alas! alas! ſhould any priſon in a civilized country confine ſuch a man?"</p>
            <p>Patty had lived two years in town, when her miſtreſs, who had long been ill, died in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. This was a new calamity: it was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a greater one than ſhe imagined. Her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had for ſome time caſt a criminal eye on her beauties; and ſcarcely had his deceaſed lady been a month depoſited in her tomb, when his cruel intentions became abundantly manifeſt even to the unſuſpicious innocent whoſe deſtruction he meditated. On the firſt inſult, ſhe prudently ruſhed out of the houſe; and nothing could ever induce her again to enter it. She ſent for her cloaths, which the bounty of her miſtreſs had made conſiderable, as ſoon as ſhe had taken a lodging; and, with the ſmall part of her wages due, reſolved to live with the greateſt frugality, till ſhe ſhould be able to procure another place. What ſhe felt, on contemplating her forlorn ſtate, is eaſier conceived than expreſſed; but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſhe had ſuffered, with the reflection of what ſhe had ſo narrowly eſcaped, brought on a fever.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:028632_0019_0FDA32F30DBC9DE8"/>A nurſe was now neceſſary, and a nurſe was obtained. But this cruel wretch, while the poor unhappy girl lay inſenſible, purloined moſt of her little property; ſo that on her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſhe had ſcarcely a decent change of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; and the apothecary, as well as her landlady, though no ſtrangers to her misfortunes, were both clamorous for their bills. Thus was this poor young creature, by the brutality of him whoſe children ſhe was rearing not only to health but to virtue, torn from every gleam of comfort, and plunged in the depths of diſtreſs. She was ſoon inſtructed in the ſhocking practice of pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her cloaths for trifling ſums, to appeaſe her unfeeling creditors; and it now became neceſſary for the ſupply of ſuſtenance. Ten days did ſhe paſs with no other food than bread and water, before ſhe would conſent to part with the only gown ſhe had that was not on her back; nor could ſhe even then have been brought to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce, but that her landlady ſignificantly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſhe could not pay her rent with ſuch lodgers. It was therefore the dread of being houſeleſs, more than that of death, which finally prevailed; nor did a morſal thus dearly purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever reach her lips, that was not firſt bathed with her tears. At length, all that modeſty could ſpare, was by degrees diſpoſed of; and it was ſuggeſted by her landlady, that ſhe muſt part even with modeſty itſelf. The ſpecious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſhe uſed to leſſen the value of virtue,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028632_0020_0FDA32F67044DF60"/>
were loſt on her miſerable inmate; who petrified with horror at her infamous propoſal; became inſtantly motionleſs as a ſtatue. This dreadful ſhock coſt her another ſit of illneſs; in which ſhe languiſhed without food, without medicine, and without attendance. Nature, or rather the God of Nature did every thing for her. She recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlowly; but it was ſoon enough to be told, that ſhe muſt eat the bread of infamy, as ten thouſand women, once her betters, every day did, or be content to rot in a priſon, where ſhe would, after all, no doubt, ſuffer by compulſion, the evil ſhe ſo greatly dreaded.</p>
            <p>Partly by perſuaſion, and partly by force, was this miſerable creature, tottering with her own weight, led out to the ſtreet, in the gloom of the evening, and told that ſhe muſt bring money, or not expect re-admiſſion. As the door cloſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, ſhe wrung her hands in agony; but the fountains of grief refuſed to flow. Her ſoul was poured out to Heaven; and ſhe prayed with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to be delivered from life's direſt calamity. But, alas! ſhe ſeemed deſtined to experience ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery horror. The thunder began to roll, and the lightning fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhed around her. The heavy clouds, thus divided, poured down in torrents: ſhe durſt not return home; a dark unfrequented paſſage at a little diſtance, ſhe recollected to have ſeen, and thither ſhe haſtened for ſhelter. It was at the ſame moment occupied by a plain man; who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a cleanly looking girl, and taking her
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028632_0020_0FDA32F67044DF60"/>
for a common proſtitute, accoſted her in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which happily ſhe did not comprehend; and to which ſhe returned no anſwer, but ſeemed inclined rather to brave the ſtorm, than continue in ſuch company. He ſeized her with ardour, but not with roughneſs; and began to addreſs her in more ſoothing accents. But her trembling and agitated frame, and her pathetic voice, ſoon convinced him that ſhe was no daughter of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and, though a man of frailties, he would not for the univerſe have loaded his ſoul with the guilt of a deliberate ſeduction. He told her frankly what was his firſt deſign, but added, that he would endeavor to make her amends for the inſolence of his intentions. As the ſtorm ſtill continued, he began to enquire into her hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; of which ſhe candidly told him all ſhe knew. He appeared greatly affected by her nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; and ſoothed her with the attentions of a parent. She had no ſooner brought her ſad tale to a concluſion, than he exclaimed—"And is not your name Patty A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ford?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, Sir!"</p>
            <p>"Be not alarmed, (cried he) my love! my child! (claſping her with vehemence to his breaſt)—This is the work of Heaven! for I am your uncle; the brother of that dear ſaint, your mother."</p>
            <p>She became lifeleſs in his arms; and it was long before ſhe was reſtored to animation. The

inſtant ſhe revived, he procured a coach, and that evening conveyed her home to his houſe.</p>
            <p>In a few days, ſhe began to recover health; and her uncle being a widower, and having loſt all his children, aſſured her that ſhe ſhould, at his death, have the whole of his very ample for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, they agreed to viſit inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the poor farmer, and liberate him from his cruel confinement.</p>
            <p>They found him with his Bible before him; and his ſon by his ſide, an elegant and manly youth. Patty could not refrain from embracing them both: ſhe knew, ſhe ſaid, their worth; and with her uncle's permiſſion, if the young man had no objection, he ſhould be her huſband.</p>
            <p>To deſcribe the joy of all the parties is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: from that day they conſtantly lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and their poſterity inherit their virtues.</p>

            <p>BEING on a tour to the North, I was one evening arreſted in my progreſs at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a ſmall hamlet, by breaking the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel of my ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ton. This accident rendering it impracticable for me to proceed to the next town, from which I was now ſixteen miles diſtant, I directed my ſteps to a ſmall cottage, at the door of which, in a woodbine arbor, ſat a man of about ſixty, who was ſolacing himſelf with a pipe. In the front of his houſe was affixed a ſmall board, which I conceived to contain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, that travellers might there be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated. Addreſſing myſelf therefore to the old man, I requeſted his aſſiſtance, which he readily granted; but on my mentioning an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of remaining at his houſe all night, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted that it was not in his power to receive me, and the more ſo, as there was no inn in the village. It was not till now that I diſcovered my
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028632_0022_0FDA32F96BFDFA68"/>
error concerning the board over the door, which contained a notification, that there was taught that uſeful art, of which, if we credit Mrs. Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deley's Memoirs, a certain noble lord was ſo groſsly ignorant. In ſhort, my friend proved to be the ſchoolmaſter, and probably the ſecreaty to the hamlet. Affairs were in this ſituation when the Vicar made his appearance. He was one of the moſt venerable figures I had ever ſeen; his time-ſilvered locks ſhaded his temples, whilſt the lines of misfortune were, alas! but too viſible in his countenance. Time had ſoftened, but could not efface them. On ſeeing my broken equipage, he addreſſed me; and when he began to ſpeak, his countenance was illumined by a ſmile.—"I preſume, ſir, ſaid he, that the accident you have juſt experienced, will render it impoſſible for you to proceed. Should that be the caſe, you will be much diſtreſſed for lodgings, the place affording no accommodations for travellers, as my pariſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are neither willing nor able to ſupport an alehouſe; and as we have few travellers, we have little need of one; but if you will accept the beſt accommodation my cottage affords, it is much at your ſervice." After expreſſing the ſenſe I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of his goodneſs, I joyfully accepted ſo deſirable an offer. As we entered the hamlet, the ſun was gilding with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th the venerable oaks that overſhadowed their cottages, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028632_0022_0FDA32F96BFDFA68"/>
themſelves after the labours of the day, and liſtening attentively to the tale of an old ſoldier, who, like myſelf, had wandered thus far, and was now diſtreſſed for a lodging. He had been in ſeveral actions, in one of which he had loſt a leg: and was now, like many other brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"—Doom'd to beg</l>
               <l>"His bitter bread thro' realms his valor ſav'd."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>My kind hoſt invited me to join the croud, and liſten to his tale. With this requeſt I readily complied. No ſooner did we make our appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, than I attracted the attention of every one. The appearance of a ſtranger in a hamlet, two hundred miles from the capital, is generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ſurpriſe; and every one examines the next comer with the moſt attentive obſervation. So wholly did my arrival engroſs the villagers, that the veteran was obliged to defer the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of his narrative, till their curioſity ſhould be gratified. Every one there took an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of teſtifying the good will they bore my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable hoſt, by offering him a ſeat on the graſs. The good man and myſelf were ſoon ſeated, and the brave veteran reſumed his narrative, in the following words:—"After, continued he, I had been intoxicated, I was carried before a juſtice, who was intimate with the captain, at whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028632_0023_0FDA32FEAD48DD70"/>
he atteſted me before I had ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my ſenſes to ſee the danger I was encountering. In the morning when I came to myſelf, I found I was in cuſtody of three or four ſoldiers, who, after telling me what had happened, in ſpite of all I could ſay, carried me to the next town, without permitting me to take leave of one of my neighbors. When they reached the town it was market day, and I ſaw ſeveral of the people from our village, who were all ſorry to hear what had happened, and endeavored to procure my releaſe, but in vain, after taking an affecting leave of my neighbors, I was marched to Portſmouth, together with 100 more, and there embarked for the coaſt of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. During the voyage, moſt of our number died, or became ſo enfeebled by ſickneſs, as to make them unfit for ſervice. This was owing partly to the climate, partly to the want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to confinement in the ſhip. When we reached the coaſt of Africa, we were landed, and experienced every poſſible cruelty from our offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. At length, however, a man of war arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had loſt ſeveral marines in a late action, and I, with ſome others, was ſent on board to ſerve in that ſtation. Soon after we put to ſea, we fell in with a French man of war. In the action I loſt my leg, and was near being thrown overboard; but the humanity of the clergyman preſerved my life, and on my return to England procured my diſcharge. I applied for the Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028632_0023_0FDA32FEAD48DD70"/>
bounty, but it was refuſed me, becauſe I loſt my limb when acting as a marine: and as I was not a regular marine, I was not entitled to any protection from the Admiralty: Therefore I am reduced to live on the good will of thoſe who pity my misfortunes."</p>
            <p>The village clock now ſtriking eight, the worthy Vicar roſe, and ſlipping ſomething in the old man's hand, deſired me to follow him. At our departure the villagers promiſed to take care of the old man. We returned the farewell civilities of the ruſtics, and directed our ſteps to the vicarage. It was ſmall, with a thatched roof. The front was entirely covered with woodbine and honeyſuckle, which ſtrongly ſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the circumambient air. A grove of ancient oaks, that ſurrounded the houſe, caſt a ſolemn ſhade over, and preſerved the verdure of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent lawn, through the midſt of which ran a ſmall brook, that gently murmured as it flowed. This, together with the bleating of the ſheep, the lowing of the herds, the village murmurs, and the diſtant barkings of the truſty curs, who were now entering on their office as guardians of the hamlet, formed a concert, at leaſt equal to that on Tottenham-court-road. On entering the wicket we were met by a little girl of ſix years old. Her dreſs was ſimple, but elegant; and her appearance ſuch at ſpoke her deſtined for a higher ſphere. As ſoon as ſhe had informed her grandfather that ſupper was ready, ſhe dropped
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028632_0024_0FDA3304526E27A8"/>
a curteſey, and retired. I delayed not a moment to congratulate the good old man on poſſeſſing ſo great a treaſure. He replied, but with a ſigh, and we entered the houſe, where every thing was diſtinguiſhed with an air of elegant ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ſurpriſed me. On our entrance, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced me to his wife; a woman turned of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who, ſtill poſſeſſed great remains of beauty, and had much the appearance of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of faſhion. She received me with eaſy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, and regretted that ſhe had it not in her power to entertain me better. I requeſted her not to diſtreſs me with unneceſſary apologies, and we ſat down to ſupper. The little angel, who welcomed us at the door, now ſeating her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oppoſite to me, afforded me an opportunity of contemplating one of the fineſt faces I had ever beheld. My worthy hoſt, obſerving how much I was ſtruck with her appearance, directed my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to a picture which hung over the mantle. It was a ſtriking likeneſs of my little neighbor, only on a larger ſcale. That, ſir, ſaid he, is Harriet's mother. Do you not think there is a vaſt reſemblance? To this I aſſented, when the old man put up a prayer to Heaven, that ſhe might reſemble her mother in every thing but her unhappy fate. He then ſtarted another topic of converſation, without gratifying the curioſity he had excited concerning the fate of Harriet's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for whom I had already felt myſelf much intereſted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:028632_0024_0FDA3304526E27A8"/>Supper being removed, after chatting ſome time, my worthy hoſt conducted me to my bed-chamber, which was in the ground-floor, and lined with jeſſemin, that was conducted in at the windows. After wiſhing me good night, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, leaving me to reſt. The beauty of the ſcenery, however, and my uſual propenſity to walk by moon-light, induced me to leave my fragrant cell. When I ſallied forth, the moon was darting forth her temperated rays through the ſhade that ſurrounded the cottage, tipping the tops of the venerable oaks with ſilver. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking a turn or two on the lawn, I wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſpot,</p>
            <p>"Where the rude forefathers of the hamlet ſlept."</p>
            <p>It was ſmall, and for the moſt part ſurrounded with yew trees of an ancient date, beneath whoſe ſolemn ſhade many generations had mouldered in the duſt. No ſooner did I enter, than my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was caught by a pillar of white marble, placed on the ſummit of a ſmall eminence, the baſe of which was ſurrounded with honeyſuckles and woodbines, whilſt a large willow overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the pillar. As I was with attention pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing the epitaph, I was not a little alarmed by the approach of a figure, cloathed in a long robe. The apparition continued advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me with a ſlow a ſtep, and its eyes fixed on
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028632_0025_0FDA33048AF2A490"/>
the ground, which prevented it obſerving me till we were within ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of each other. Great was my wonder at recognizing my worthy hoſt in this ſituation; nor was his aſtoniſhment leſs at finding his gueſt thus courting the appearance of goblins and faries. After each had expreſſed the ſurpiſe he felt, I proceeded to enquire whoſe duſt was there enſhrined? To my queſtions he returned anſwer—There, ſir, ſleeps Harriet's mother, an innocent, but unfortunate woman. Pardon me, ſir, ſaid he, if for a moment I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge my ſorrow, and bedew my Harriet's grave with tears—a tribute that I often pay her much lov'd memory, when the reſt of the world are loſt in ſleep. Here he pauſed, and ſeemed much agitated. At length he requeſted my permiſſion to defer the recital of Harriet's woes till the next day, as he found himſelf unequal to the taſk of proceeding in the painful detail. To this propoſal I readily acceded, and we returned home. I retired to my room, but every attempt to procure ſleep proved ineffectual. Harriet had ſo wholly occupied my thoughts, that no moment of the night was ſuffered to paſs unnoticed. At length, "when ſoared the warbling lark on high," I left my couch, and rejoined my worthy land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, who was buſily employed in the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his garden. Though I declined men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the ſubject of our laſt night's adventure, yet he ſaw the marks of anxious expectation in my countenance, and proceeded to gratify the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028632_0025_0FDA33048AF2A490"/>
curioſity he had inſpired. It will be neceſſary, ſaid he, before I proceed to relate the woes that befel my daughter, to give a ſhort ſketch of my own life.—Six and twenty years ago, Mrs. — came hither for the benefit of her health, the air being recommended as highly ſalubrious. On her arrival, ſhe gave out that ſhe was the daughter of a clergyman, who was lately dead, and had left her in narrow circumſtances. I thought it my duty to viſit her, and offer her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little attention in my power. She received me with politeneſs, and expreſſed a wiſh to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate my acquaintance. I continued to repeat my viſits for ſome time without ſuſpecting that there was any thing particular in her hiſtory, till one morning I found her in tears reading a letter ſhe had juſt received. On my entrance ſhe gave it to me: it contained a notfication from Lord B—'s agent, that her uſual remittances would no longer be continued. On opening this letter, I was led to ſuppoſe that her connexion with Lord B— was not of the moſt honorable nature. But all my ſuſpicion vaniſhed on her producing ſeveral let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Lord B— to her mother, with whom he had been long connected.—From theſe letters I learnt, that Mrs.— was the daughter of Lord B— by Miſs M—, ſiſter to a Scotch baronet, whom he had ſeduced and ſupported during the remainder of her life. But he had, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſeems, determined to withdraw his protection from the fruit of their connexion. Mrs. —
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028632_0026_0FDA33056B50F188"/>
declared ſhe new not what ſtep to take, as her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were nearly exhauſted. I endeavored to comfort her, aſſuring her that ſhe ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand every aſſiſtance in my power:—On hearing this ſhe ſeemed a little ſatisfied, and became more compoſed. After fitting with her ſome time, I returned home to conſider in what manner I might moſt eaſily afford protection to the young or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, whoſe whole dependence was on my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.—If I took her home to live with me, as I was unmarried, it would give offence to my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners.</p>
            <p>My income was too confined to admit of my affording her a ſeperate eſtabliſhment. Thus circumſtanced, I determined to offer her my hand. You will, no doubt, ſay it was rather an imprudent ſtep for a man who had ſeen his fortieth year to connect himſelf with youth and beauty: but as my brother was then living, it was impoſſible for me to render her the leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance on any other plan. She received my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal with grateful ſurpriſe, and accepted it without heſitation.—In a few days we were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and have now lived together ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years in a ſtate, the felicity of which has never been interrupted by thoſe diſcordant jars which are ſo frequently the concomitants of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: though, alas! our peace has received a mortal wound from one, the bare mention of whoſe name fills me with horror! But not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: Before the return of that day which few
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028632_0026_0FDA33056B50F188"/>
me bleſſed with the hand of Emily, my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs received an important addition, by the birth of a daughter, who inherited all her mother's charms. It is ſuperfluous to add, that ſhe was equally the idol of both her parents; and as ſhe was the only fruit of our marriage, ſhe became every day a greater favorite. My wife had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch an education as rendered her fully capable of accompliſhing her daughter in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner far ſuperior to any thing her ſituation requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or perhaps could juſtify. To this agreeable employment, however, ſhe devoted her whole time, and when Harriet had reached her eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, ſhe was in every reſpect a highly accompliſhed woman. She was become what that picture repreſents her. With an amiable temper and gentle manners, ſhe was the idol of the village. Hitherto ſhe had experienced a ſtate of felicity unknown in the more exalted ſtations of life unconſcious, alas! of the ills that await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her future years.</p>
            <p>It is with reluctance I proceed in the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly narrative.—One evening, as a young man, attended by a ſervant, was paſſing through the village, his horſe ſtartled, and threw him. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to be on the ſpot at the time, I offered every aſſiſtance in my power, and conveying him to my cottage, diſpatch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d his ſervant in queſt of a ſurgeon, who declared our patient was not in any danger, but recommended it to him to delay
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028632_0027_0FDA330AB3FC3A40"/>
his departure for a day or two. His health, however, or rather his love, did not admit of his travelling for near a fortnight; daring which time he eſtabliſhed his intereſt with Harriet by the moſt pleaſing and unremitting attention to her ſlighteſt wiſhes. When about to depart, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted leave to repeat his viſit on his return from his intended tour, dropping, at the ſame time, ſome diſtant hints of his affection for Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, to whom ſhe was by no means indifferent.</p>
            <p>Mr. H— (for ſo our gueſt was named) inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, previous to his departure, that he had a ſmall independent fortune; but that from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant relation he had conſiderable expectation.— After bidding an affectionate adieu to Harriet, he ſet out on his intended tour which laſted for a month.</p>
            <p>During the time of Mr. H—'s abſence, Harriet appeared penſive; and I obſerved with pain, that he had made no ſlight impreſſion on her heart. At length Mr. H— returned, and Harriet's reception of him left us no room to doubt her attachment. During his ſecond viſit he was very affiduous to ſecure the favour of all the family: with Harriet he eaſily ſucceeded; nor was Mrs T— nor myſelf diſpoſed to diſlike him. His manners were elegant, and his wit lively. At length he obtained from Harriet the promiſe of her hand, provided her parents ſhould not object. Hitherto I had never been induced to make any inquiries concerning his circumſtances and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.

Now, however, by his direction, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a Mr. E—ns, a clergyman of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. This gentleman, now in an exalted ſtation in the church, then chaplin to Lord C—, informed me, that Mr. H— was in every reſpect a deſirable march for my daughter; and that whenever his couſin ſhould die, he would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to maintain her in affluence and ſplendor; he added, that his character was unexceptionable. Little ſuſpecting the villainous part Mr. E—ns was acting, I readily conſented to the propoſed union, and performed the ceremony myſelf. Mr. H— requeſted that their marriage might be kept a ſecret, till the birth of a ſon and heir. This propoſal rather alarmed me, but it was too late to retreat, and knowing no one in the great world, it was impoſſible for me, previous to the marriage, to procure any account of Mr. H—, but ſuch as his friend cammunicated to me. Thus circumſtanced, I could only conſent; and as Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet readily adopted every propoſal that came from one ſhe ſo tenderly loved, the matter was finally agreed on.</p>

               </gap>ivered of that little girl you ſo much admire. I now preſſed him to acknowledge my daughter as his wife. To this he anſwered, Had ſhe brought him a ſon he would readily have complied with my requeſt; but that his couſin was ſo great an
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028632_0028_0FDA330C2A053B90"/>
oddity, that he could not bear the idea (to uſe his own expreſſion) "of having his fortune laviſhed in a milliner's ſhop:" But, added he, if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, I will now riſk the loſs of all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and introduce my Harriet to his preſence. Harriet, however, again interfered, and deſired that Mr. H— might not be forced into meaſures that might in the end prove deſtructive of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſpect, and induce him to regret the day he ever ſaw her. Theſe arguments prevailed, and Mr. H— was ſuffered to continue as a member of the family without any farther notice being taken of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>In this manner had three years elapſed, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by any remarkable event, Mr. H— generally paſſing half a year with us, and the remainder in London, attending, as he ſaid on his couſin; when one day, as he was ſitting with us at dinner, a chaiſe and four drove up to the houſe. The ſervants enquired for Mr. H—, and on hearing he was there, opened the carriage-door. A gentleman, dreſſed like an officer, jumped out, followed by a lady in a travelling dreſs; they ruſhed immediately into the room. Their appearance amazed us; but Mr. H— be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the moſt viſible marks of conſternation. The lady appeared to be about thirty. She was a woman by no means deſtitute of perſonal char <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028632_0028_0FDA330C2A053B90"/>
by ſtriking her innocent rival. On ſeeing this, an old ſervant of mine ſeized the lady, and forcibly turned her out of the houſe, then faſtened the door. It was not till now that we perceived the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. H—, who had, it ſeems, retired with the lady's companion. Whilſt we were ſtill loſt in amazement at the tranſaction we had juſt witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we were alarmed to the higheſt pitch by the report of a piſtol. Harriet inſtantly fainted. Whilſt Mrs. T— was recovering her, I flew to the ſpot from whence the ſound proceeded, and there found Mr. H— weltering in his blood, with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol lying by him. I approached, and found him ſtill ſenſible. He informed me, that the lady's brother and he had fought, and that ſeeing him fall, they had both eſcaped as faſt as poſſible. I inſtantly procured aſſiſtance, and conveyed him to the houſe, where he was put to bed, and a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon was ſent for. Mean time, Harriet had ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral fits, and we were apprehenſive that the hour of her fate was approaching. On the arrival of the ſurgeon, he declared the wound Mr. H— had received would probably prove mortal, and recommended the arrangement of his affairs. Mr. H— received the news with great agony, and deſired that I might be left alone with him. No ſooner was this requeſt granted, than he ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſſed me in the following terms:</p>
            <p>"In me, ſir, behold the moſt unfortunate, and, alas! the moſt guilty of men. The lady,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028632_0029_0FDA330FE82348A8"/>
whoſe ill-timed viſit has loſt me my life, is—I tremble to pronouce the word—my wife! (See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me pale with horror, he proceeded.) No wonder, ſir, that you ſhould behold with horror one who has repaid <hi>unbounded hoſpitality by unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led villainy.</hi> The bare remembrance of my own guilt diſtracts me. The awful hour is now faſt appreaching, when I muſt receive my final doom from that Heaven whoſe laws I have ſo daringly violated. To redreſs the injuries I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is, alas! impoſſible. My death will be an atonement by no means ſufficient. I cannot, however, leave this world till you ſhall be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ten thouſand pounds, the whole of my property that is at my diſpoſal, has long ago been transferred by me into the hands of truſtees for the benefit of my much-injured Harriet, and her unhappy infant. In my own defence I have nothing to urge. Suffer me only to remark, that my misfortune aroſe from the avarice of my father, who forced me into a marriage with the woman you lately ſaw, and whoſe brother has been the inſtrument in the hand of Providence to inflict on me the doom I ſo much merited. If poſſible, conceal from Harriet that I was married. Picture, for her ſake, an innocent deception, and tell her that I was only engaged to that lady. This will contribute to promote her repoſe, and the deception may poſſibly plead the merit of prolonging a life ſo dear to you. For the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated mind of my Harriet would never ſurvive
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028632_0029_0FDA330FE82348A8"/>
the fatal diſcovery of my villainy. But, oh! when my unhappy child ſhall aſk the fate of him who gave her being, in pity draw a veil over that guilt which can ſcarcely hope to obtain the pardon of Heaven."</p>
            <p>There he ceaſed, and uttering a ſhort prayer, expired. Happily for Harriet, ſhe continued in a ſtate of inſenſibility for three days, during which time I had the body removed to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring houſe, there to wait for interment. Having addreſſed a letter to Mr. H—'s agent in town, he ſent orders for the body to be removed to the family-burying-place, where it was accordingly interred. Harriet recovered by ſlow degrees from the happy inſenſibility, into which the death of Mr. H— had plunged her. Her grief became ſilent and ſettled. Groans and exclamations now gave way to ſighs, and the bitter tears of deſponding grief. She ſeldom or ever ſpoke, but would cry for hours together o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her hapleſs infant, then call on the ſhade of her departed Henry, little ſuſpecting the irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable injury he had done her. It was with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite anxiety I beheld the decline of Harriet's health. Prone as we ever are to hope what we ardently deſire, I now deſpaired of her recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Whilſt in a ſtate of hopeleſs inactivity, I was doomed to witneſs the lingering death of my lamented Harriet, I received a viſit from an old friend. On his arrival I allotted him the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formerly occupied by Mr. H— and Harri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>et.

About midnight he was awakened by ſome one entering the apartment. On removing the curtain, he diſcovered by the light of the moon, my adored Harriet in a white dreſs. Her eyes were open, but had a vacant look that pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She advanced with a ſlow ſtep; then ſeating herſelf near the bed, remained there an hour, weeping bitterly the whole time, but without uttering a word. My friend, fearful of the conſequences, forbore to awake her, and ſhe retired with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate ſtep ſhe had, entered. This intelligence alarmed me exceſſively. On the next night ſhe was watched, and the ſame ſcene was repeated, with this difference, that after quitting the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal apartment, ſhe went to the room were her daughter uſually ſlept; and laying herſelf down on the bed, wept over her child for ſome time; then returned her to apartment.

            <p>****** IT was evening when Wolkmar and his dog, almoſt ſpent with fatigue, deſcended one of the mountains in Switzerland: the ſun was dilated in the horizon, and threw a tint of rich crimſon over the waters of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring like; on each ſide rocks of varied form, their green heads glowing in the beam, were,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028632_0031_0FDA3315F4A88B88"/>
ſwarded with ſhrubs that hung feathering from their ſummits, and at intervals was heard the ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a troubled ſtream.</p>
            <p>Amid this ſcenery, our traveller, far from any habitation, wearied, and uncertain of the road, ſought for ſome excavation in the rocks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might repoſe himſelf; and having at length diſcovered ſuch a ſituation, fell faſt aſleep upon ſome withered leaves. His dog ſat watching at his feet, a ſmall bundle of linen and a ſtaff were placed beſide him, and the red ray of the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun, having pierced through the ſhrubs that concealed the retreat, gleamed on the languid features of his beloved maſter.</p>
            <p>And long be thy reſt, O Wolkmar! may ſleep fit pleaſant on thy ſoul! Unhappy man! war hath eſtranged thee from thy native village; war, unnatural war, ſnatched thee from thy Fanny and her infant. Where art thou, beſt of wives? thy Wolkmar lives! 'twas error ſpread his death. Thou fled'ſt; thy beauty caught the eye of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; thou fled'ſt with thy infant and thy aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Unhappy woman? thy huſband ſeeketh thee over the wilds of Switzerland. Long be thy reſt, O Wolkmar! may ſleep ſit pleaſant on thy ſoul!</p>
            <p>Yet not long did Wolkmar reſt; ſtarting, he beheld the dog, who, ſeizing his coat, had
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028632_0031_0FDA3315F4A88B88"/>
ſhook it with violence; and having thoroughly awakened him, whining, licked his face, and ſprang through the thicket. Wolkmar, eagerly following, diſcerned at ſome diſtance a man gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walking down the declivity of the oppoſite hill, and his own dog running with full ſpeed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. The ſun yet threw athwart the vale rays of a blood-red hue, the ſky was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, and a few big round drops ruſtled through the drooping leaves. Wolkmar ſat him down, the dog now fawned upon the man, then bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ran before him. The curioſity of Wolkmar was rouſed, he roſe to meet the ſtranger, who, as he drew near, appeared old, very old, his ſteps ſcarce ſupporting with a ſtaff; a blue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was wrapped around him, and his hair and beard, white as ſnow, waving to the breeze of the hill, received from beneath a dark cloud, the laſt deep crimſon of the ſetting ſun.</p>
            <p>The dog now ran wagging his tail, firſt to his maſter, and then to the ſtranger, leaping upon each with marks of the utmoſt rapture, till too rudely expreſſing his joy, the old man tottering, fell at the foot of a blaſted beech, that ſtood at the bottom of the hill. Wolkmar haſtened to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> relief, and had juſt reached the ſpot, when ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, he exclaimed, "My father, O my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!" Gothre, for ſo the old man was called, ſaw and knew his ſon, a ſmile of ecſtacy lighted up his features, a hectic fluſhed his cheek, his
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028632_0032_0FD9BB42431083F0"/>
eyes beamed tranſport through the waters that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them, and ſtretching forth his arms, he faintly uttered, "My beloved ſon!" Nature could no more: The bloom upon his withered cheek fled faſt away, the dewy luſtre of his eye grew dim, and ſtraining Wolkmar with convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive energy, the laſt long breath of aged Gothre fled cold acroſs the cheek of his ſon.</p>
            <p>The night grew dark and unlovely, the moon ſtruggled to appear, and by fits her pale light ſtreamed acroſs the lake, a ſilence deep and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible prevailed, unbroken but by a ſhriek, that at intervals died along the valley. Wolkmar lay entrance upon the dead body of his father, the dog ſtood motionleſs by his ſide; but at laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, he licked their faces, and pulled his maſter by the coat, till having in vain endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to awaken them, he ran howling dreadfully along the valley; the demon of the night trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on his hill of ſtorms, and the rocks returned a deepening echo.</p>
            <p>Wolkmar at laſt awoke, a cold ſweat trickled over his forehead, every muſcle ſhook with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and, kneeling by the body of Gothre, he wept aloud. "Where is my Fanny," he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "Where ſhall I find her; oh! that thou had'ſt told me ſhe yet lived, good old man! if alive, my God, ſhe muſt be near; The night is dark, theſe mountains are unknown to me." As
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028632_0032_0FD9BB42431083F0"/>
he ſpoke, the illumined edge of a cloud ſhone on the face of Gothre, a ſmile yet dwelt upon his features; "Smileſt thou, my father," ſaid Wolk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "I feel it at my heart; all ſhall yet be well." Wolkmar, retiring a few paces from his father, threw himſelf on the ground.</p>
            <p>He had not continued many minutes in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, before the diſtant ſound of voices ſtruck his ear; they ſeemed to iſſue from different parts of the valley, and two or three evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the ſpot wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re Gothre lay; the name of Gothre was at length loudly repeated, and Gothre! Gothre! mournfully ran from rock to rock. Wolkmar, ſtarting from the ground ſighed with anxiety and apprehenſion, leaning forward he liſtened with fearful apprehenſion, but the beating of his heart appalied him. The dog who, at firſt alarmed had crept to his maſter's feet, began now to beark with vehemence; ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the voices ceaſed, and Wolkmar thought he heard the ſoft and quick tread of people faſt approaching. At this moment the moon burſt from behind a dark cloud and ſhone full on the dead body of Gothre. A ſhrill ſhriek pierced the air, and a young woman ruſhing forward fell on the body of Gothre. "Oh, my Billy," ſhe exclaimed to a little boy, who ran up to her out of breath, "ſee your beloved Gothre! he is gone for ever, gone to Heaven and left us: O my poor child! (claſping the boy, who cried
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028632_0033_0FDA331AF99948F8"/>
moſt bitterly) what ſhall we do without him, what will become of us, we will die alſo, my Billy! Gothre is gone to your own dear father, and they are both happy yonder, my Billy," pointing to the moon.</p>
            <p>Wolkmar, in the mean time, ſtood enveloped with ſhade, his arms ſtretched out, motionleſs, and fixed in ſilent aſtoniſhment; his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he faintly and with difficulty uttered, "My Fanny, my child!" His accents reached her ear, ſhe ſprang wildly from the ground, "It is my Wolkmar's "ſpirit," ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſky inſtantly cleared all around, and Wolkmar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

"God of mercies!" cried Wolkmar, "if thou wilt not drive me mad, reſtore her to life: She breathes, I thank thee, O my God, ſhe breathes! the wife of Wolkmar lives!" Fanny recovering, felt the warm em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace of her beloved huſband; "Dear, dear Wolkmar," ſhe faintly whiſpered, "Thy Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny—I cannot ſpeak; my Wolkmar, I am too happy; ſee our Billy!" The boy had crept cloſe to his father, and was claſping him round the knees. The tide of affection ruſhed impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly through the boſom of Wolkmar, "it preſſes on my heart," he ſaid, "I cannot bear it. The domeſtics, whom Fanny had brought with her, crouded round: "Let us kneel," ſaid Wolkmar, round the body of aged Gothre:"
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028632_0033_0FDA331AF99948F8"/>
They knelt around, the moon ſhone ſweetly on the earth, and the ſpirit of Gothre paſſed by; he ſaw his childern, and was happy.</p>

            <head>THE CASTLE OF COSTANZO. AN ITALIAN STORY.</head>
            <p>AMONG the Italian Nobles who embraced the French intereſt, and along with it were baniſhed from Lombardy, the Count de Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo was of the firſt diſtinction. On the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Imperial arms there, his eſtate fell to the Duke of Modena, and himſelf, with an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly child, withdrew into France, where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until he introduced Nicolo his ſon into the French army.</p>
            <p>Nicolo, by gallantry and conduct equal to his birth, ran a conſiderable length in the career of military advancement, till his progreſs was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely ſtopped, by a wound he received in one of the Flemiſh campaigns, which diſabled him from the exerciſe of his commiſſion. Upon this he retires, with a wife and daughter, into an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable privacy in a village of Auvergne, where he lived upon a proviſion allowed him by the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028632_0035_0FDA331BE7694F48"/>
King for ſome years, until the death of his wife, combining with other circumſtances, induced him at length to remove at the age of 50 to the place of his birth.</p>
            <p>On his arrival there under another name, which he aſſumed to prevent ſuſpicion or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, he found the poſſeſſions of his father oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by Manfredi, an officer placed over them by the Duke of Modena; and not far from the caſtle of Conſtanzo, in a ſmall and ſolitary houſe, he and his daughter took up their reſidence.</p>
            <p>His delight, his employment, his conſolation, centered in Leonora. To trace the dawning of her charms, and to aſſiſt the growth of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, were his only relief from that dejection, which the idea of a loſt wife, and the ſight of a forfeited inheritance hourly inſpired. Often would he take her through the woods of Coſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo—but the ſcene was ſtill too powerful for him. At every object he would gaze in pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſilence, or break into myſterious ejaculation— "But what do we here, Leonora!" would he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim—"theſe are not our grounds—O cruel uſurpers! have ye robbed her too? what had ſhe done? Unborn innocent! was ſhe alſo your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?" Alarmed, his lovely companion would inquire the meaning, but the fate of his family was ſtill concealed from her.</p>

               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:028632_0035_0FDA331BE7694F48"/>Their mode of living was as recluſe as their ſituation. Leonora never went abroad without her father, except to a neighbouring convent, where ſhe learnt of the Nuns ſome female accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; nor did ſhe ever appear in public, except at church. However, it was her fate to catch the greedy eye of Manfredi. She was then ſcarce fifteen, and though her beauty was not ripened into its full luxuriance, yet then it appeared a moſt alluring bloſſom.</p>
            <p>Manfredi, though enſlaved to luſt and revenge (for theſe were the two moſt forward features of his character) was nevertheleſs both able and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to maintain in his conduct the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of decorum. 'Twas by ſuch an appearance, that he at firſt won the eſteem of his Prince, and to ſuch he then owed his ſituation at Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanzo; for the Duke, generous to romantic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, thinking that the welfare of his vaſſals, which was the ruling object of his life, would be promoted by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ng ſuch a character as Manfredi over that part of his domain, ſacrificed an umb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he entertained againſt him, to ſuch a noble conſideration.</p>
            <p>Stung by the faſcinating eyes of Leonora, which, in ſpite of her purity, could look nothing but love, Manfredi at firſt conceived the baſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t deſigns on her innocence, and made ſome clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine efforts to accompliſh them; but by the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028632_0036_0FDA331E27C16610"/>
fond vigilance of her father, he was always baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, though never detected. At length his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite (for it was not love) grew too unruly for conſtraint; and one night he went in diſguiſe to Coſtanzo's houſe, where reconnoitering the window of Leonora's apartment, he attempted through it to gain admiſſion to her bed. The window was in the upper ſtory, and looked into a ſmall incloſure behind the houſe, which ſerved for a garden. The wall, on that ſide, was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the top with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, which on his applying the ladder whereby he was to get up, made ſuch a ſudden ruſtling as rouſed Leonora from ſleep. She remained, however, trembling in her bed, till ſhe heard and ſaw a perſon breaking open her caſement. Alarmed, ſhe ſprung up, flew to the window, and, by an impulſe of deſperation, thruſt the ruffian and his ladder down together. But the exertion exhauſted he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and ſhe ſunk on the floor in a ſwoon, during which Manfredi, though miſerably bruiſed, made ſhift to eſcape.</p>
            <p>The diſturbance awoke Coſtanzo—Leonora ruſhed into his thoughts; he roſe up, went into her apartment, and there, with unutterable ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, found her extended, ſenſeleſs, at the ſoot of her bed. By his tender aid, however, ſhe in a ſhort time recovered, and ſatisfied him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the occaſion of her fright; but who the perſon was, or how ſhe delivered herſelf from him remained inexplicable. The affair, at length,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028632_0036_0FDA331E27C16610"/>
was coſtrued into a purpoſe of robbery—things were ſet in ſecurity; ſhe removed into her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's apartment, and the remainder of the night was ſpent in repoſe.</p>
            <p>Next day Leonora, as uſual, repaired to the convent, and was engaged among the holy ſiſters till evening; but then, when ſhe returned home, what was her horror to find the houſe deſolate and empty, no father, no furniture there—the doors torn off their hinges, and the wind whilſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling dolefully through the diſmantled windows! The poor young forlorn, ran diſtractedly through every room, calling on her father; and ſhricking unregarded, till a monk, who was paſſing that way to the convent, heard her, and drew nigh, when learning the circumſtances of her diſtreſs, he endeavoured to appeaſe her anguiſh,</p>
            <p>He went with her to all the cottages around, but nobody could give them any tidings of Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanzo, or account for the ſtrange calamity. The Peaſants declared, ſome with looks of ſuſpicion, others of ſurpriſe, and all of pity, that they had not ſeen that day any glimpſe of ſuch an affair. Their ſearch continued till midnight? and Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora would have traverſed every inch of ground in the Duchy, ere ſhe ſtopped unſatisfied, had not the benevolent father inſiſted on her accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him to the convent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:028632_0037_0FDA3324F7D18148"/>When ſhe arrived there, her affliction aſſumed a new form. Such terror and exertion brought on a fever of the moſt dangerous aſpect, during which ſhe raved, day and night, about her father and her miſery. The efforts of medicine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, promoted by her youth, overcame the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but though her health was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſtored, the wound of ſorrow was ſtill freſh in her heart, for nothing as yet had been heard of Coſtanzo.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as her enfeebled body could reach the diſtance, and her religious protectors would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her, ſhe ventured forth to the deſolate houſe. There was ſomething ſo diſmal in the air of that premature ruin, as would damp the moſt indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpectator; what then muſt its effect have been on Leonora? Her heart ſickened within her, when on entering, ſhe behold the lower apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments employed in penning a few ſheep, and the floors of the upper defiled by the feathers and excrements of crows. But when ſhe entered her father's chamber, the ſhock became too mighty for her feelings. Recollection furniſhed its empty walls with every thing they once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: her eye, in a frenzy of ſorrow, ſeemed to devour the melancholy blank: when it came to that corner where Conſtanzo's bed uſed to lie, a thouſand thoughts crouded into her fancy —ſhe thought ſhe ſaw him expiring there—mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers and poignards, and blood aggravated the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028632_0037_0FDA3324F7D18148"/>
idea—ſhe recoiled from the phantom which ſhe formed; and ran down ſtairs, trembling at the echo of her own footſteps.</p>
            <p>At the threſhold ſhe ſunk down, and there gave vent to an accumilation of tears, till inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the approach of a ſtranger on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. This was no lower a perſonage than the Duke of Modena, who being then on an annual viſit to that part of his dominions, reſided at the caſtle of Coſtanzo, where Manfredi ſtill lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by his bruiſes. The Duke happened that day to be hunting in the neighbourhood; and obſerving at ſome diſtance, the beautiful young creature in a poſture of pictureſque affliction, rode up to her. An heart, ſo humanely noble as his, muſt be a party at ſuch a ſpectacle. He enquired her ſtory, and ſhe told it with ſuch melancholy ſweetneſs, as both wet his eyes, and warmed his heart. The circumſtance of the noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal aſſault drew his keeneſt attention—"a thought has ſtruck me" ſaid he "pray, was the window high?" Alas! ſo high Sir, "ſhe replied, I tremble at the miſchief the perſon may have received—but, if you pleaſe, I'll ſhow it you." They went round; and, as they were ſurveying the window, one of the Duke's hounds, that had overleap'd the hedge of the encloſure, returned, bearing in his teeth a ſcabbard encloſing half the blade of a ſword. The Duke's ſuſpicions were ſtrengthened. He went with Leonora into
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028632_0038_0FDA332A28748970"/>
the garden, and found, under the window that had been aſſailed, the remaining part of the ſword lying among ſome ſhurbs. Snatching it up, and obſerving a creſt, engraved on the hilt, "ha! I am righ—it was, it was Manfredi—This is the ruffian's ſword broken in the fall—his bruiſes confirm it. Courage, thou lovely ſufferer! thy father may yet be reſtored to thee. The monſter that could attempt thy ruin, would not ſhrink from his. Not a hole in Coſtanzo but ſhall be ranſacked, till we find him—let us go thither inſtantly—deliberation were now madneſs." Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora, loſt in aſtoniſhment and hope, ſuffered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be placed on the Duke's horſe, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her on foot to the caſtle.</p>
            <p>When they arrived there, he inſtantly repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Manfredi's chamber; and introducing Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora, aſked him whether he knew that lady— "No, (replied the alarmed criminal)—nor this ſword?"—"What? that ſword:—why"—but guilt ſhackled his tongue, and unhinged his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. "Attrocious wretch!" cried the Duke, "is this the honor, that the humanity that won my favor?—But where is her father? —Monſter of revenge!—that he ſhould ſuffer for the hurt his daughter occaſioned, a hurt you more than deſerved!—But where is he.—On your life produce him ſafe." Manfredi, having by this time recollected himſelf, hardily denied any knowledge or concern in the affair; but, on
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028632_0038_0FDA332A28748970"/>
the demand of his Prince, was obliged to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the keys of the caſtle.</p>
            <p>The Duke went himſelf, with Leonora and two officers, through every apartment, but could not find Coſtanzo. Hope ſhrunk away from their boſoms, and ſuſpicion began to follow it. Returning, however, through a paſſage under ground, they heard a deep groan proceeding from a contiguous vault which had eſcaped their ſearch. The door, though curiouſly concealed, they at laſt found out; but as none of the keys that were given them, could unlock it, the Duke impatiently ordered it to be forced open with a crow; and, entering with lights, found the ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figure of Coſtanzo ſtretched on the floor, he could ſcarce lift up his emaciated form ere it was claſped in his daughter's arms;—"my father," —"ha, my Leonora!—but the tears and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the interview deſcription muſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. At laſt, ſays Coſtanzo, art thou come, my child to ſee me dying in a dungeon of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's caſtle,—"what, interrupted the Duke, art thou Coſtanzo, thou the ſon of that unfortunate nobleman whoſe eſtate my father ſeized?—Yes, yes, the ſame, the companion of my youthful ſtudies at Ferrara—every feature of Nicoli ſtill languiſhes in that viſage, in ſpite of years and diſtreſs I can trace them; let me ſhare with thee, Leonora, in that embrace. They immediately left that place of horror, and repaired to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredi.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028632_0039_0FDA3330E902EE90"/>
The Duke could not ſpeak the tumult of his benevolent joy; what angel, cried he, has put ſo much of Heaven in my power, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a parent from the jaws of murder to the embrace of his child, to reſtore an Earldom, from the cuſtody of a villain, to the poſſeſſion of its heir. Coſtanzo, you are henceforth maſter here; I quit all property in whatever you were born to enjoy; your ſufferings have atoned for your father's hoſtility to our houſe. Coſtanzo, in amazement, threw himſelf at his feet—"my ſovereign," cried he—"my friend," interrupted the Duke—ſtifle theſe acknowledgments; and, it you would be grateful to your Prince, be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to your vaſſals,—As for thee luſtful revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hypocrite, but thy puniſhment is within thee —Duty, however, demands me to diſburden my dominions inſtantly of thy guilt,—hence,—and hereafter avoid theſe regions, as thy life ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it—hence, and let thy detection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement declare to other ſtates, as well as this, that providence, can draw good from the depths of vice, for thy luſt hath rent the veil of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotion, and thy revenge ſtopped the abuſe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

            <head>SOLYMAN AND ALMENA. AN EASTERN STORY.</head>
            <p>IN a pleaſant valley of Meſopotamia, on the banks of the Irwin, lived Solyman, ſon of Ardavan, the ſage. He was early inſtructed in all the oriential languages; but, as his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding opened, like the flower in the morning, when Aurora dawns in the eaſt, he thirſted only for the knowledge of mankind. He prevailed on his father, with much importunity, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to travel. The morning was ſpread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountains, and Solyman prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; but firſt proſtrating himſelf towards the ſun, he addreſſed that glorious luminary in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then paſſed over the Tigris, into the kingdom of Perſia.</p>
            <p>There is ſome ſecret attraction in the place, where we have paſſed the chearful innocence of childhood. No ſooner had Solyman aſcended an eminence which gave him a retroſpective view of the valley of Irwin, than he turned his eyes on
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028632_0040_0FDA33356D4A3918"/>
his native fields, and gazed on them with a kind of penſive complacency, till the declining day called him to proceed.</p>
            <p>When he had reached the foot of Mount Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, he ſought to repoſe himſelf in the valley of Abdat; but he was ſtopped by an exclamation of ſorrow which proceeded from an ajacent wood. As he was in hopes of relieving ſome diſtreſs, he drew near, and diſcovering two lovers, who had ſtolen a ſecret interview before their final ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Being made acquainted with the cauſe of their ſorrow, and finding it proceeded from the avariciouſneſs of the lady's father, who had ſold his daughter to a Khan of Buckharia, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them his aſſiſtance, which being accepted, he conducted them back to the banks of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris; and, recommending them to his father, continued his travels, till he arrived at Iſpahan.</p>
            <p>The beauty and magnificence of that city en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his attention for many days; but his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſure derived from the converſation of an Engliſh merchant, from whom he learnt many things relating to the manners and purſuits of men in different countries, particularly in Great Britain. With this merchant, he afterwards ſet out for the court of Baſſora; but, being driven by the heat of the ſun to ſeek for ſhelter on the declivity of a neighbouring mountain, they were led by accident to the cave of a hermit. The
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028632_0040_0FDA33356D4A3918"/>
good old father at firſt retreated from them, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the effects of human ferocity; but being ſoon convinced they were only inoffenſive travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, he afterwards acquainted them with the hiſtory of his life.</p>
            <p>The hermit told them that he was born of competent fortune; but, being left an orphan, was deprived of it, partly by the chicanery of a court of equity, and of the reſt through the treachery of a friend. This obliged him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a common ſoldier in the army of the Sophy, where he fell in love with the daughter of the commanding officer, which plunged him again into new misfortunes, and at laſt ended in his betaking himſelf to thoſe ſolitary mountains for a retreat.</p>
            <p>After having finiſhed his tale, the travellers took their leave, and, about the cloſe of the day, arrived at the village of Arden. At their entrance, they were met by a perſon in a plain dreſs, who invited them to partake of his houſe and table that night. The hoſpitality they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, gave Solyman very different ideas of the diſpoſitions of mankind, from what his own partial obſervation, aided by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of the two lovers, and the tale of the hermit, had enabled him to form. When the dawn of the morning broke, Solyman and the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028632_0041_0FDA3336E90870B8"/>
merchant left the village of Arden, and after a few days travel, arrived on the plain, on which ſtood the once glorious Perſepolis. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of its ruins filled their minds with proper reflections on the inſtability of human grandieur, and from thence they proceeded to the court of Baſſora.</p>
            <p>The merchant here finding the veſſel he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, told Solyman he could accommodate him, if he pleaſed, with a paſſage to Europe, which the deſire the latter had of ſeeing foreign countries induced him to accept: but as the ſhip was to remain ſome time in the gulph, he took that opportunity to make the tour of India, and, in his way viſited the iſle of Ormus. There he met with an exile from Iſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>an, who had been doomed to ſpend his life in that dreary ſpot, for no other crime, than that he had ſaid at court, he thought the Sultana Moratte extremely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. The unmerited ſeverity of his ſentence moved the tender heart of Solyman. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him his liberty, at his return from the excurſion he was making, and continued his route for India.</p>
            <p>Being come to Delhi, the capital of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul's empire, his heart, which had hitherto been a ſtranger to love, fell a victim to the charms of the accompliſhed Almena. He thought no more of performing his voyage to Europe; but the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028632_0041_0FDA3336E90870B8"/>
unhappy fate of the exile at Ormus recurring to his mind, he determined to fulfil the promiſes he had made him, and, quitting Almena, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Baſſora. Having ſettled every thing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the departure of the exile, he took the opportunity of the ſhip's delay in ſetting out, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit his father, from whom he learned the ſequel of the adventures of the two lovers who had been recommended by him to his care. Almena, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſtill continuing uppermoſt in his mind, and the time for the departure of the veſſel drawing near, he again left Arden, and, having ſeen the exile ſafely embarked at Baſſora, proceeded to Delhi.</p>
            <p>Solyman and Almena, being now a ſecond time together, mutual profeſſions of love and friendſhip enſued, in conſequence of which they agreed to quit Delhi, and to retire for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their days to the valley of Irwan. But a war at that time raging in India, and the lovers unhappily taking their paſſage in a veſſel belonging to one of the contending parties, they had ſcarcely got five leagues out to ſea, before they were purſued by the foe, and after an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate engagement, made priſoners. The enemy ſtripped the veſſel of every thing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, then diſmiſſed it; but they carried off Almena.</p>
            <p>What pen can deſcribe the grief of Solyman! his fair one carried he knew not whither, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028632_0042_0FDA3339E3CD4498"/>
the ſhip, unable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o proceed on her intended voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, obliged to return to the coaſt of India. Here he was told, that the veſſel, which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, belonged to the King of Sund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h; and having informed himſelf of the ſituation of that country, he went in queſt of Almena. For a long time he continued his miſerable ſearch in vain; but at length diſcovered by accident, that ſhe was confined in the caſtle of Sevaſor. This diſcovery only ſerved to increaſe his miſery. The governor, who was in love with Almena, finding him to be the perſon whom ſhe had long lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed after, and conſidering him, of courſe, as the principal obſtacle to his wiſhes, ordered him to be confined. He found means to break from this confinement juſt in time to reſcue Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena from the brutality of the tyrant, whom he killed; but the guards coming upon him in that inſtant, they were both made priſoners, and ſhut up in the caſtle, till it was taken by a party of the King of the Kanarians.</p>
            <p>This incident, from which the two lovers might have hoped for deliverance, only added to their woes. They were again ſeparated, and Almena ſelected for the pleaſures of the King of Kanaria. Solyman, however, having found means to introduce himſelf into the King's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, repaired to the palace, and acquainted him with the whole ſtory of their paſſion. A violent ſtruggle at firſt aroſe in the King's breaſt between
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028632_0042_0FDA3339E3CD4498"/>
love and virtue; but the latter triumphed, and Almena was reſtored to Solyman.</p>
            <p>The two lovers being thus, once more, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly brought together, and unwilling to riſque their happineſs again upon the ſeas, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to travel by land for the valley of Irwan. After many days tedious journey, they arrived at Delhi, from whence they continued their route to Iſpahan, where Solyman found his old friend the merchant. The cuſtomary congratulations over, and the merchant being informed of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of their adventures, Solyman then gave him an invitation to accompany him to the valley of Irwan, which was accordingly accepted. In their way, they viſited the two lovers mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preceding part of the ſtory, whom they found completely happy. Having been witneſſes of their felicity, they proceeded to the valley of Irwan, where Ardavan received them with the greateſt tenderneſs; and Solyman and Almena, happy in themſelves, and in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cloſed the returning day with prayer and praiſe to that Providence, which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them in all their dangers.</p>

            <head>MAHMUT AND IDRIS. AN ORIENTAL TALE.</head>
            <p>AMONG the dancers of the palace, in the reign of Abbas the Great, King of Perſia, there was a young maid, named Idris, whom the maſter of the revels, on the report of her charms, had ſent for from Caſbin to Iſpahan. Her mother being of the ſame profeſſion, ſhe had followed the ſame way of life; but as ſhe honorably diſtinguiſhed herſelf from her female-companions, ſhe demonſtrated that virtue is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable in every ſituation of life, however ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery or dangerous it may be.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had Idris appeared in the theatre of the capital, but ſhe found herſelf beſet by the grandees, who ſtrove to pleaſe her by the ſame means that had won others in that ſtation. One exhauſted all his rhetoric, in commending her ſhape and manner; another extolled the form of her face; her complexion, and the regularity of her features.—. third, to give weight to the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028632_0043_0FDA333EE4D0AEC0"/>
encomiums he had beſtowed upon her voice; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated an air he had heard her ſing, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his diſtraction to arive at that grace with which ſhe gave life to her words.—A fourth, boaſting his preciſion and ſkill in dancing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited inſtantly ſome of the attitudes he had learned of her. A firſt-rate Sir Fopling, gave her a liſt of the pretty women he had deſerted, from the moment he firſt ſaw her. A young Iman, by birth intitled to become a Mollah, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently diſplayed his figure and his dreſs. And old fingerer of the public money, dazzled her eyes with a diamond of the firſt water, and offered it, beſides the perquiſites of the contracts, which it was his cuſtom to beſtow upon his miſtreſs.—An officer of the crown made pompous deſcriptions of the preſents with which he had recompenſed the friendſhip of the little Zazi. In fine, every one exerted his faculties, and his addreſs, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to gain the preference over his rivals.</p>
            <p>But Idris was not to be caught by ſuch baits. At the palace, at aſſemblies, in the public walks; and in all places, the diſcourſe turned upon the new dancer, every one talked of her beauty, her wit, her engaging behaviour; and, which was more than they had ſaid of any other of her profeſſion; they agreed in acknowledging her to be very virtuous. It is the property of none but the moſt exalted virtue to gain the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and admiration of young courtiers. Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028632_0044_0FDA3340A1728FA0"/>
concieved a high opinion of Idris's virtue, from the extraordinary effect it produced.</p>
            <p>Mahmut bore among the lords of the court, the ſame character which Idris maintained among the dancers of her ſex; proof againſt the defects of his equals, and the vices of his ſtation.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he began to appear in the world, he became ſenſible of the ridiculouſneſs of that noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy obſtreperous giddineſs, which moſt young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of quality affect; and being happily prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the idle life he ſaw them lead, he took care not to follow their example, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeming to condemn them. While their days were divided between the toilet, the table, viſits, and gaming, he ſpent the morning in the cloſet among his books; or, with thoſe whoſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation could inſtruct him better.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon he frequented the manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and working places about the palace; talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ableſt hands in the ſeveral arts; and obſerved, with the utmoſt attention, how they proceeded in their works.</p>
            <p>In the evening was at ſome or other of the public entertainments, which he enjoyed with a moderation that is ever inſeparable from taſte and diſcernment. After which he repaired to ſome of the moſt brilliant aſſemblies of Iſpahan,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028632_0044_0FDA3340A1728FA0"/>
as well to avoid a ſingularity that would have rendered him odious as to acquire a greater ſhare of the complaiſance and politeneſs which reigned in them.</p>
            <p>Mahmut's wit, and the uſe he made of it, rendered him ſuperior to thoſe who were his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals in birth; and, beſides the advantage of a good figure and graceful air, he diſtinguiſhed himſelf no leſs among them by his natural and acquired talents. Idris could not behold this amiable Perſian without emotion—ſhe ſhunned all her importunate ſuitors, and complacently fancying him free from all their faults, ſhe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wiſhed that the beauty which they ſo highly extolled, might make an impreſſion on him. Her wiſhes were met more than half way. Mahmut ſoon let her know that he loved her moſt paſſionately; and her anſwer to his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on account of its ſingularity, deſerves to be given entire.</p>
            <p>"Doubtleſs you give the name of love, (ſaid ſhe, with a charming ſmile) to that which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an effect of your taſte for novelty: I will not, my lord, go farther, at preſent, on this head; it is your buſineſs to fix my judgment. I will ingeniouſly confeſs, though it will give you ſome unfavorable opinion of me, if you are not the man I take you to be, that I am not diſpleaſed at your liking me: but if ever I ſee occaſion to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028632_0045_0FDA3342264FF3F0"/>
the idea I have conceived of you, hope not that I ſhall, in the leaſt, indulge my inclination. I ſhall not take it ill if you give your heart to a woman more virtuous hand, therefore, do not complain of your lot, if I diſpoſe of mine, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of any man whom I may find ſuperior to you in virtue."</p>
            <p>Mahmut, ſtruck with admiration, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with joy, laboured to riſe to ſuch a pitch as might oblige Idris to be conſtant to him. He applied himſelf, with freſh vigor, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the arts and ſciences neceſſary for a man in his ſtation. He made it his buſineſs to relieve indigent merit and unfortunate virtue. His hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, generoſity, capacity, and modeſty, were equally conſpicuous; and Idris abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him for all the pains he took to pleaſe her. Praiſe grounded on truth, and coming from the mouth of ſo charming a perſon, filled the tender Mahmut's heart with joy and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He read, in the eyes of his beauteous miſtreſs, how dear he was to her. He talked of his paſſion, and deſcribed its violence. Idris liſtened to him with pleaſure, vowed ſhe would make him a juſt return; and thus animated him to give her no occaſion to repent her engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In theſe overflowings of their hearts, which none but true lovers can know, and feel the ſweetneſs of, they laid open to each other the moſt ſecret receſſes of their ſouls. Mahmut was grieved when he took leave of Idris, nor could
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028632_0045_0FDA3342264FF3F0"/>
ſhe bear his abſence without a viſible concern.— They always parted under the greateſt impatience to meet again.</p>
            <p>Between two neighbors, ſo powerful, as the Grand Signor and the King of Perſia, there can be no long peace, a war ſoon broke out, and Mahmut was obliged to ſet out for the army. He waited upon Idris to deplore with her the dire neceſſity that forced them aſſunder; but whilſt he lay at her feet, he durſt not diſcloſe to her all his grief. The fortitude of the fair-one daunted him. He was afraid of leſſening himſelf in her eſteem, by diſcovering any weakneſs.— Idris perceived the ſore conflict in his breaſt, and loved him for it more intenſely.</p>
            <p>Mahmut had not been gone a month when he gave way to his deſire of an interview with Idris. He ſlipped away privately from the army, and with the help of relays, which he had got ready on the road, he was at the gates of Iſpahan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they miſſed him in the camp. Alighting at the houſe of one of his old ſervants, he diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf in the habit of a peaſant, that he might not be known in the city; and, impatient for an interview with his Idris, he ſlew to her houſe.</p>
            <p>The charming maid was ſitting at a balcony, as Mahmut was advancing, and knew him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028632_0046_0FDA33B7E57660B8"/>
his diſguiſe. Grieved to ſee him thus neglect his glory, and his duty, ſhe ran di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to her cloſet, charging her ſlave to admit no viſitor whatever. She melted into tears at the weakneſs of her lover; but ſoon recovered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and wrote him the following billet:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <head>IDRIS TO THE PEASANT.</head>
                  <p>Friend, I know thou art to be forthwith at the army. Call upon Mahmut, and tell him from me, that I deſire him to remember the conditions on which the heart of Idris is to be ſecured.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Mahmut was too much confounded with theſe words to aſk any queſtions of the ſlave that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him the billet. He went back to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic's houſe, to put off his diſguiſe; and fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating between admiration, grief, and fear, he repaired again to the army with as much haſte as he had travelled up to Iſpahan, his chief ſtudy being to make amends for the fault he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: he behaved the reſt of the campaign with ſo much ardor, bravery, and conduct, that he was deſervedly promoted to a higher poſt, which the King conferred on him with the moſt honorable eulogies at the head of the army. Idris wrote him a congratulatory letter on his promotion, in which, without mentioning his weakneſs, ſhe gave him to underſtand that ſhe had forgiven him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028632_0046_0FDA33B7E57660B8"/>Mahmut, tranſported with joy, haſtened back to Iſpahan, as ſoon as the army was ordered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to winter-quarters, and liſtened to no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations but his eſteem for this virtuous girl. He intreated her to complete his happineſs in becoming his wife. "Your wife, my lord, (cried Idris, with an emotion that once diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tendereſt paſſion and concern for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her lover;) what! would Mahmut forget himſelf ſo far? In diſpoſing of your heart you may, indeed, conſult nothing but your inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but when the queſtion is to chuſe a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in your dignity and fortune, you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to thoſe of whom you hold both. I have the deepeſt ſenſe of gratitude for this ſignal teſtimony of your eſteem; but what will your relations ſay? What will all Perſia ſay, whoſe eyes are upon you, and who ſee nothing in me but the mean profeſſion I was bred to?—No; Mahmut, it muſt not be!—I ſee my error; I am aſhamed of my weakneſs.—I that am ready to ſacrifice my life, were it neceſſary, to preſerve your glory, cannot be inſtrumental myſelf in ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying it."</p>
            <p>Sentiments like theſe made the paſſionate Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut only more preſſing.—"What are thoſe things, (ſaid he) which create ſo great a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between us? An inſtant may deprive us of them; but the dowry which you will bring me,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028632_0047_0FDA3349EBA48BE0"/>
charming Idris, is a bleſſing that depends not on men, nor fortune." In uttering theſe words, his countenance began to be clouded with grief: freſh denials drove him to diſpair.—He drew his poignard, and was going to plunge it into his breaſt. The tender Idris could hold out no longer. "Ah! Mahmut, (cried ſhe) ſtop your hand and live.—To-morrow I ſhall be yours.— Grant me this ſhort reſpite!" She could utter no more.—Tears put an end to her ſurpriſe, and ſtopped her breath!</p>
            <p>The news of their marriage ſoon took wind; and thoſe who envied him the poſſeſſion of ſo much beauty, abuſed him for his meanneſs, while the ſober and thinking part of the world extolled their virtues; and only lamented that her birth and fortune had not rendered them more conſpicuous and attracting. She was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the king, who was charmed with her perſon! and finding her heart, and her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not diſgrace the higheſt quality, added that which reconciled all parties—a title and place at court.</p>

            <head>THE CHEVALIER BAYARD, AND MADAME DE RANDAN.</head>
            <head type="sub">A Tale of the Fifteenth Century.</head>
            <p>MADAME de Randan, of the illuſtrious houſe of Miranda, became a widow at twenty years of age, and was inconſolable. What grief was ever like her's, and whoſe eyes, ſo young and ſo charming, ever ſhed ſo many tears for a dead huſband! The whole talk at court was of the mourning of the young widow. She no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conſulted her mirror; ſhe deſpiſed the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of dreſs, and vowed to the ſhade of her huſband that ſhe would never more uſe them: ſhe muffled herſelf up in a hood like a nun; and yet, in that diſadvantageous attire, Madame de Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan was the lovelieſt of all the women of her time.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier Bayard, at the age of thirty, had already attained the appellation, of Bayard,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028632_0048_0FDA334B2287DBE8"/>
the dauntleſs and irreproachable. Palice was proud of having been named with univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe to the command of the army at Ravenna. Theſe two <hi>preux chevaliers,</hi> who acted a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous part in the field, were hardly known at court, and they reſigned to the gentle Bonnivet and many others, the entire poſſeſſion of court favour, content themſelves with military fame. Bonnivet, however, ſometimes courted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Palice and Bayard; his frigid ſoul came to warm itſelf at the fire which animated them when they talked of honour, and royalty, and deeds of arms. Bonnivet repayed them with tales of gallantry, with the news and anecdotes of the court. The fair widow had her turn. "What think you," ſaid he one day to the knights, "of Madame de Randan?" "By this hand, ſaid Bayard, I never ſaw ſo fair a dame." "Beſhrew me, added Palice, but it is too much to weep ſo long for the dead." "Don't you know, replied Bonnivet, that I have undertaken to put a ſpeedy termination to her widow hood? yes, indeed, the fair widow, let me tell you in confidence, will not be diſpleaſed when I attempt to dry her tears." "Thou art a vain creature, ſaid Palice," "He is a braggart," rejoined Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. "Very well gentlemen, ſaid Bonnivet, obſerve the end," and he took his leave.</p>
            <p>What a ſtrange man, ſaid Palice, is this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Bonnivet! When I conſider, replied Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028632_0048_0FDA334B2287DBE8"/>
his behaviour to a lady of high rank, into whoſe chamber he introduced himſelf by a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem I am convinced he is enterpriſing.</p>
            <p>After theſe ſhort reflections, the two knights ſat for ſome time ſilent; ſtrange thoughts were paſſing in their minds, for they were both in love. It was the firſt inſtant of their paſſion, and that inſtant is certainly ſometimes very embarraſſing. "It would be a meritorious act, ſaid Palice, to touch the heart of ſo fair and accompliſhed a lady." "Certainly, ſaid Bayard, and highly honourable:" and they relapſed again into ſilence. They looked at each other, and perceived that they were rivals. "Let there, however, be no difference between us, ſaid Palice. Let us ſwear by St. Dennis, that whoſoever ſhall be the unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful lover, ſhall immediately yield without complaint; and that if a third ſhall enter the liſts, the diſcared candidate ſhall aſſiſt the other, and be his companion in arms. Let us promiſe, on the faith of true knights, to relate our ſucceſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve." "I ſwear," ſaid Bayard. They embraced and ſeparated.</p>
            <p>The one took the road on the right hand, the other that on the left, but both directed their ſteps to the hotel of the fair widow. Bayard had already ſet his foot within the threſhold of her gate, when he ſaw Palice coming. He had all
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028632_0049_0FDA334E9F51DA50"/>
his life been above ſuſpicion or reproach. "En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my friend, ſaid he to Palice, you are my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior; good night and ſucceſs to you; I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to-morrow." At theſe words he retired, and Palice was to be announced to the widow.</p>
            <p>How ſhall I deſcribe Madame de Randan.— She wore a grey robe; her hair was unpowdered, and concealed beneath an immenſe hood which covered her face. A ſmall machine for weaving ſilk lace ſtood before her, and a young girl, who was reading certain ſelect pages from the ſtory of Godfrey of Boulogne, was often interupted by the widow with many a ſigh. This was the Helen for whom theſe two brave chevaliers were about to contend. She acknowledged the honor of the Captian's viſit, but it made her neither more talkative nor more at eaſe. "You ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you," ſaid Palice, "a true knight, who has juſt devoted himſelf wholly to your ſervice." "How ſay you?" ſaid ſhe, with ſurpriſe. "It is true, fair lady: My hand, my heart, I lay at your feet." At this the widow wept and was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Palice was affected, and had almoſt ſhed tears. The girl, by a ſign, brought forth the picture of M. de Randan, and the widow, as her only anſwer, pointed with her finger to this inſcription, I LOVE HIM STILL. Palice inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted this dumb refuſal, and took his leave for that time by declaring that he would never ceaſe imploring God to diſpoſe her heart to forget the dead, and to have pity on the living.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:028632_0049_0FDA334E9F51DA50"/>Bayard waited his return with a degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. "Alas!" ſaid Palice, "ſhe was all in tears, ſhe ſhewed me the portrait of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and I have been obliged to retire without hope!" Bayard knew the worth of Palice, and did not flatter himſelf. "I will however go to-morrow, ſaid he, and you ſhall know the event."</p>
            <p>The interview between our chevalier and the widow was not altogether the ſame. Bayard was younger than Palice, and his fame was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The beauteous widow wept; ſhe ſhewed the portrait, but ſhe liſtened to Bayard; and when he ſaid to her, "Madam, I will return," ſhe replied, in a low voice; "You will do me a great kindneſs.'</p>
            <p>The chevalier related to Palice the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion faithfully. "You will be the happy man," ſaid the Captain;" ſhe did not ſpeak half ſo much to me." Palice made another attempt.— The widow was ſtill in tears; the picture was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain preſented. Bayard returned; and while Palice was always treated in the ſame way, the Chevalier was making advances daily. The fair widow began to turn her eyes now and then to her mirror. There was however no change of dreſs, no kind looks; but ſhe wept no more, and always prolonged the converſation by queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that demanded long anſwers, which the Chevalier never gave with ſufficient preciſion.—
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028632_0050_0FDA3353CAB51AA8"/>
"Tell me," ſaid ſhe, one day, "the ſtory of your being made priſoner in Milan, by Ludovic." I was, ſaid Bayard, at the head of a party of French; we were met by a party of Italians who attacked us vigorouſly; both ſides were ſo animated that the one did not know they were retreating, nor the other that they were advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till we were at the gates of Milan, where the cry of turn, turn, was repeatedly and eagerly uttered. I, who was intent upon victory, was deaf to the cry, and thoughtleſſly purſued into the heart of the city. Immediately ſoldiers and citizens, and the very women attacked me; but a brave fellow, who had always defended himſelf from my ſtrokes, ſurrounded me with his party, and took me priſoner. Ludovic had ſeen my behaviour from his window and ſent for me. "What brought you hither, Chevalier?" ſaid he, "The deſire of victory," I anſwered. "And did you expect to take Milan alone?"— No, my Lord, but I thought I had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by my comrades." "Though you had, you could not have ſucceeded."—"They were wiſer than I; they are free, and I am a priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er."—"What is the ſtrength of the French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my"—"We never reckon by numbers; but I can aſſure you the ſoldiers are all choſen men, before whom your's will never ſtand."—"That time will determine; a battle will prove their valour."—"Would to God it were to-morrow, and that I were free."—"You are free; I like
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028632_0050_0FDA3353CAB51AA8"/>
your freedom, and your courage; if you have any thing further to aſk of me, it ſhall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."—I fell at his feet and beſought him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the rudeneſs of my replies. I begged my horſe and my arms and took leave. Thus ended my adventure at Milan. It was eaſy for Ludovic to give me back my liberty; but that which I have loſt with you it is impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
            <p>Palice was informed of this long converſation; for Bayard, faithful to his oath, concealed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him. The next viſit he paid the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow he thought to make his court by detailing the circumſtances of the battles he had fought from Marignan to Ravenna; but his labour was loſt; what intereſted the fair widow when told by Bayard, was inſiped when related by Palice. This at laſt he perceived. "The honor of this conqueſt," ſaid he, "is your's, Chevalier; I yield and retire. If a third rival appears, behold me your companion in arms."</p>
            <p>The fair widow grew inſenſibly enamoured of Bayard; and his converſation, which at firſt was only a pleaſure, became at laſt a neceſſity. She had quitted her grey attire, and had gradually reſumed her former dreſs. One would have ſaid that the certainty of being beloved inſpired her with the wiſh to pleaſe. She took a fancy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear at court, with a view of obſerving whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028632_0051_0FDA3358AB006C40"/>
ſhe did not ſtill retain the pre-eminence over all the beauties there. Bayard was the only man who forgave the widow her return to the world, and ſhe was accordingly always called at court the lady of the Chevalier.</p>
            <p>Spain having at that time renewed a truce with France, the ambaſſadors of that power were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at Paris with the greateſt pomp. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments given by Francis correſponded with the idea which the Spaniards entertained of his magnificence. The widow was one of thoſe who were choſen to figure in the ballets, and ſhe was always the moſt applauded. One of the noble Spaniards who attended the embaſſy, became e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namoured of her. But all his ſerenades, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther efforts of gallantry, were fruitleſs; and Don Alonzo ſoon learnt, that the heart, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him imprognable, had a weak ſide which lay open to Bayard. The high reputation of his rival did not intimidate him. The more of difficulty and of danger that appeared, but ſtimulated him the more to the attempt.</p>
            <p>Don Alonzo according challenged Bayard to ſingle combat, which the latter did not refuſe. Judges were appointed, and Palice had the guard of the liſts. The news of the duel was ſoon ſpread, and the Spaniards, conſidering Don A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo was the champion of their country, were anxious for his fate; while the French made
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028632_0051_0FDA3358AB006C40"/>
vows for the triumph of Bayard; and thus a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate quarrel became almoſt a national concern.</p>
            <p>But who can deſcribe the grief of the widow? She was the innocent cauſe of the combat, and accuſed herſelf for having appeared beautiful in the eyes of Don Alonzo. How intereſting a moment was this for the ſoul of our Chevalier, who heard the ſoft confeſſion which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dared to aſk for, now uttered amidſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of tears, of ſighs and ſobbings! He wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away her tears, and ſpoke comfort to her. As a pledge of love ſhe tied round his arm a rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and gave him a picture. It was a Cupid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving a widow's veil and wiping off her tears with leaves of roſes. The Chevilier received this picture on his knees, and after having kiſſed it a thouſand times, and a thouſand times kiſſed the fair hand that gave it, he placed it in his boſom, and took his leave.</p>
            <p>Palice led his friend to the liſts, mounted on a ſtately courſer; but the Spaniard chuſing to fight on foot, the Chevalier diſmounted; the judges diſtributed the arms to each, and both before engaging recommended themſelves to God.— Then riſing and making the ſign of the croſs, they proceeded to combat.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not detain the reader with a particular account of the proweſs and addreſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028632_0052_0FDA335BEEDAA100"/>
combatants, nor with a deſcription of the hopes and fears that agitated their friends.— Let it be ſufficient to ſay, that, after an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and bloody encounter, the Chevalier Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſlew his opponent and came off victorious. He immediately threw himſelf upon his knees, and returned thanks to God, three times kiſſing the ground. He was led away in triumph with the ſound of trumpets to the church, again to give thanks for his victory, and thence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the fair widow.</p>
            <p>No one can paint the joy of this lady, but one who could paint her charming eyes, and her whole perſon. All was ſoul, and all, even her very ſighs, was joy. From this moment love united their hearts with his ſtrongeſt bonds.</p>
            <p>Madame de Randan, ſurrounded with a crowd of importunate lovers, now began to dread the effects of her beauty. The life of Bayard was become ſo dear to her that ſhe could not think of expoſing it again to another hazard.</p>
            <p>She therefore reſolved to retire to a ſequeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manſion that belonged to her in the country. She did not however inform Bayard of her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, but ſhe ſaid to herſelf, HE WILL PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAPS COME; and ſhe furniſhed a magnificent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment for him in the caſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:028632_0052_0FDA335BEEDAA100"/>The ladies of our age, ſo decent and ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, will perhaps be aſtoniſhed that the widow ſhould provide an apartment in her houſe for one not a huſband: but this was the cuſtom, in days of old, <hi>preux Chevaliers</hi> were diſcreet and reſpectful lovers, and never failed to ſay, <hi>honni ſoit qui mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y pence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our widow was occupied with Bayard alone: the ladies of theſe times are diſtracted with ſo many lovers that they can afford to one but a ſmall portion of ſenſibility; and this diſtraction no doubt is the ſafeguard of their honour. But alas! when one thinks of none but one, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary does that one become! eſpecially when that one is a Bayard!</p>
            <p>The lady departed for her retirement in the country, and the Chevalier, it is needleſs to ſay, did not remain behind. They arrived in great ſtate at Ferte, where magnificent preparations had been made for their reception; the old ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers welcomed the gallant Chevalier with honeſt hearts and military honours, while the young girls, of all the neighbouring villages, in their beſt array, came out to meet the widow, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her with flowers.</p>
            <p>How happy were our two lovers! How ſhort did the days appear to them, thoſe days which
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028632_0053_0FDA336115E5AEB0"/>
others think ſo tedious in the country! Reading, and rural amuſements were their moſt ſerious bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. In ſhort, the widow conſented to be a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow no longer. She had ſworn never to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the name of Monſ. de Randan.—She could not break her oath. Her marriage therefore with Bayard was performed in private, and long remained a ſecret.</p>
            <p>To judge of the happineſs of this fond pair, is it neceſſary to have ſeen them. Madame de Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan had brought the Chevalier a daughter, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to inherit her mother's beauty, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's honour. To ſee Bayard, like another Hector, take of his helmet not to frighten with its black and ſpreading plumes, the little infant which his wife, in an ecſtacy of conjugal love and maternal affection, held out to him; to ſee Bayard, the flower of chivalry, and the dread of the foes of France, lying on the green ſod, with a little child on his knees, playing with the hilt of his ſword; one muſt be a father one's ſelf to conceive it.</p>
            <p>One day as he was amuſing himſelf in this way, his friend Palice came to ſummon him to the field. He was not ſurpriſed to find Bayard thus employed. People in thoſe days had not deviated from nature ſo far as we have, and there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating charm which attends every action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to her. The captain ſaw at once how
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028632_0053_0FDA336115E5AEB0"/>
matters ſtood. "This is your daughter, Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier, ſaid he: what a charming little innocent!" and he lifted her up, and preſſed her to his heart. Bayard bluſhed, "I give you joy, my brave friend, ſaid Palice; allow me to pay my reſpects to your wife.—Madame de Randan, was in ſome confuſion, but ſhe ſoon recovered herſelf, and accepted the ſalutations of the Captain with a good grace. "You are going, ſaid ſhe to take the Chevalier from me, and to lead him to the field of danger." "To the field of honour, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame." "The King's will ſhall be obeyed," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſhe with a ſigh. She went immediately and prepared with her own hands the field equipage of the Chevalier; and ſhe communicated to Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din, his faithful ſquire, the ſecret of dreſſing all ſorts of wounds: with a box of medicines care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made up from herbs of ſovereign virtue by herſelf.</p>
            <p>Bayard departed. Let us paſs over the adieus. In the firſt battle he was wounded at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the action: he was carried off the field and taken to the houſe of perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe fears he calmed by his diſcourſe, and by the precaution of placing two ſoldiers as a guard, to whom he gave a preſent of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred crowns as an indemnification for the pillage of the houſe to which they were entitled. When his impatience to join the army rather than his cure, which was not compleated, determined
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028632_0054_0FDA33627B982638"/>
him to depart, the miſtreſs of the houſe threw herſelf at his feet. "The right of war, ſaid ſhe, makes you maſter not only of our property but of our lives; and you have ſaved our honour: we hope however from your generoſity, that you will not treat us with rigour, and that you will accept of a preſent more ſuited to our fortune than to our gratitude. At the ſame time, ſhe preſented him with a box full of golden ducats. Bayard looked at her, and aſked how many there were.</p>
            <p>"Two thouſand five hundred, my Lord, ſaid ſhe; but if yor are not ſatisfied, we will do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in our power to procure ſomething more." No, Madame, ſaid Bayard, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of no money; the care you have taken of me is beyond any recompence I can make to you; I only aſk your friendſhip, and beg you to accept of mine." A moderation ſo unuſual affected the lady more with ſurpriſe than with joy. She threw herſelf again at the Chevalier's feet, and ſaid ſhe would not riſe if he did not accept of that proof of her gratitude. "Since you will have it ſo, ſaid Bayard, I will not refuſe you; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I have the honour of ſaluting your daughters before I go?" When they came in he thanked them for their attention to him, for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and their kind endeavours to amuſe him in his diſtreſs. "I would willingly teſtify my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements to you, ſaid he; but military
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028632_0054_0FDA33627B982638"/>
men ſeldom have any jewels fit for perſons of your ſex. Your mother has made me a preſent of two thouſand five hundred ducats; I hope each of you will accept of a thouſand as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to your dowry. I deſtine the remaining five hundred to the Nuns of this city who have been plundered, and I beg you will take the trouble to ſee them properly deſtributed."</p>
            <p>It was thus that Bayard endeavoured to ſoften the horrors of war. But while he thus did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his country, and was gloriouſly ſhedding his blood for the ſtate, there were not wanting perſons at court who were forming plots againſt his domeſtic peace. Certain favorites who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Francis I, in a ſhameful inactivity, and who attacked, at their pleaſure, the reputations of the brave and the beautiful, did not ſpare the fair inhabitant of the caſtle in Forte. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis chid the calumny of that quarter, but ſtill he believed more of it than he ought to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. He loved the ſex, and Madame de Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan was ſo beautiful, that he grew deſirous of ſeeing her; and as he was an amiable, a gallant prince, and a king, was it not natural for him to indulge ſome pleaſing hopes! but as he was ever courteous, he wrote the lady a letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her of his intention to pay her a viſit with only two attendants. The lady anſwered reſpectfully, and the monarch ſoon arrived at the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028632_0055_0FDA3363EDD1CC20"/>
caſtle, where he found her ready to receive him without the court. As ſoon as he ſaw her he diſmounted, took off his hat, and coming up, pulled off his glove, then kiſſing the hand ſhe preſented to him, led her into the caſtle.</p>
            <p>After the firſt compliments had paſſed and the king had refreſhed himſelf with a ſlight colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the two noblemen who attended him, on various pretences, withdrew. Francis immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately began to addreſs the widow in a tone of gallantry, and nobody knew better how to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the monarch or the lover as occaſion requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But on finding in the preſent caſe an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected reſiſtence, he threw himſelf at the lady's feet. "Sire, ſaid ſhe, burſting into tears, you muſt have a very contemptuous opinion of me when you put yourſelf in that humble poſture before me. Have you forgotten that I am the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Monſ. de Randan, who formerly render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you ſuch ſignal ſervices?" The king piqued at this unexpected cataſtrophe, forgot for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the reſpect he always ſhewed to the ſex. "And have you, Madam, ſaid he, not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten M. de Randan?" Theſe words brought a bluſh into the cheeks of the lady. "Ah! Sire, ſaid ſhe, what have you been told of me?" Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he, inſtantly aware of his imprudence, and aſſuming as much reſpect as poſſible, I have been told that you are as virtuous as you are fair." "I know, Sire, returned ſhe, that it is
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028632_0055_0FDA3363EDD1CC20"/>
to other reports of me, that I am indebted for the honour of this viſit; you have been flattered, you have been impoſed upon. Yes, Sire, you have been impoſed upon: it is true I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten M. de Randan; the Chevalier de Bayard is now—my huſband." At theſe words ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a caſket and took out the contract of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage written by the Chevalier's own hand. The king read it. "I know, ſaid ſhe, and I am happy in thinking, that it was not the wife of Bayard that you meant to ſeduce." "No, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replied Francis, no; upon the honour of a gentleman, juſtice ſhall be done to your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I own I have been impoſed on, but I ſhall repair my fault. Bayard ſhall always find a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in me when the honour of his fair ſpouſe is attacked."</p>
            <p>So ſaying he ſummoned his attendants and mounted his horſe: "Gentlemen, ſaid he as he took leave of the lady, I have been paying a viſit to the wife of the Chevalier Bayard; <hi>Honi ſoit qui mal y penſe.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The lady, ſatisfied with the manner in which this viſit had terminated, waited with impatience for the return of the Chevalier; but alas! ſhe was never to ſee him more.</p>
            <p>Innumerable faults, committed in that cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign by Bonnivet, to whom the king had given
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028632_0056_0FDA336A0A04CDD8"/>
the command of the army, made it neceſſary for the troops to abandon their enterpriſe. The flower of the French army was given in charge to Bayard, in order to ſecure their retreat, which he effected, but at the expence of his own life. He was mortally wounded by the ſhot of a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, then uſed for the firſt time; and having fallen from his horſe he was carried to a little diſtance and laid at the foot of a tree.</p>
            <p>Here, with his face turned to the enemy and his eyes fixed on the croſs of his ſword, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended himſelf to Heaven and patiently waited his end. But did he forget Madame de Randan? No: he dictated a letter to Boudin; his whole ſoul, tender and full of thoſe virtues that dignified the character of the ancient cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, was poured forth in that letter. "Take, ſaid he, take the name of Bayard, and thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the memory of a true knight who has loved you while he lived, and who was all his life without fear and irreproachable, ever zealous for glory, faithful to his king and true to his love."</p>
            <p>The conſtable of Bourbon, as he was in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the fugitives, paſſed by him and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eply affected with his fate. "I am not to be pitied, ſaid this brave man; I die in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my duty; but it is you who deſerve pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who are in arms againſt your country, your king, your friends, your oath, your honour and
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028632_0056_0FDA336A0A04CDD8"/>
your intereſt." At this moment a page arrived from the king with a letter for the Chevalier. By this Francis invited him to return to court that he might acknowledge his wife in public; and in conſideration of his marriage, the king conferred on him the government of Burgundy. "Ah! my moſt gracious liege, cried Bayard; how well do you deſerve the love I ever had for you! I would now die content but for the tho't of leaving a widow in deſpair." Peſcaire, the greateſt enemy of the French, but full of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Bayard, had no ſooner learned that he was wounded than he ran to him and cried, "Ah! Chevalier, would to God I had kept you ſafe and ſound as my priſoner, that you might have experienced by the civilities I would have ſhown you, how much I eſteem your valour and high proweſs; but ſince there is no remedy for death, I pray God to receive your great ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, as I am ſure he will." He then ſet a guard over the Chevalier, with orders on pain of death, to defend him, and not to quit him as long as he had life. Bayard ſoon after expired.</p>
            <p>Madame de Randan, in her retirement at Ferte, was wholly employed in thinking on her honoured Lord, whoſe return ſhe was fondly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating, without dreaming of the ſad tidings that were about to be announced to her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:028632_0057_0FDA336FE33B60F0"/>Francis had been informed by a page of the death of the Chevalier. This conſiderate prince took meaſures for preventing the fatal news from reaching her by ſurpriſe, and went to pay her a viſit that he might weep with her, and endeavor to comfort her when it ſhould arrive.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time Palice ſuddenly entered the caſtle; the widow met him with looks of joy which ſhe ſaw were not returned: "Alas! ſaid ſhe, I know it, my huſband is dead." "He is, ſaid Palice; he has fallen in the field of glory; the pride of his friends, the admiration of his enemies. He recommended you to Heaven with his lateſt breath, and his laſt requeſt was that you would live for the ſake of his child."</p>
            <p>The widow made a ſign to Palice to leave her alone for a few moments; after which ſhe ſent for her child, took her in her arms, and kiſſed her; then recommending her to the care of the king and of Palice, ſhe fell back in her chair and expired.</p>

            <p>CELADON, a young man of faſhion and fortune, paid his addreſſes to the blooming Amelia, and as his character was as unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as his manners were elegant, ſhe made no

objection to his propoſals, nor were they diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by her friends; they were, indeed, like himſelf, very worthy of her acceptance; the hymenal rights were performed and the birth of a ſon in the firſt year of their union conſiderably increaſed their conjugal felicity, all was joy and gladneſs within their happy habitation, and their rural excurſions awakened feelings, ſo beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed by the poet—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—"Oh! ſpeak your joy,</l>
               <l>"You whom the ſilent tear ſurpriſes often,</l>
               <l>"When nothing meets your eye but ſights of bliſs!"</l>
            </lg>
            <p>As they were mutually attached to each other in conſequence of the ſincereſt mutual affection, they reciprocally endeavored to oblige each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on every occaſion; but as all ſublunary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments muſt have their alloy, the happineſs of this affectionate pair began at laſt to diminiſh, and each grew leſs ſolicitous to pleaſe: They felt the ſame affectionate regard for each other, but it wanted its firſt animation! Time, which alleviates afflictions, by rendering them habitual, produces, by making happineſs familiar, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of our pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Celadon, though amiable, was rather inclined to be ſuſpicious, and could not bear the leaſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling: Amelia, though in general extremely
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028632_0058_0FDA3376A39200B8"/>
agreeable, was ſometimes rather haughty and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious. The delicate apprehenſion of giving offence in the ſlighteſt degree, gradually wore off, they took leſs pains to conceal their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive foibles, and at length, from mere inattention and negligence, ſuffered them to appear in as ſtrong a light as their good qualities.—This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant reverſion became diſguſting to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and gave birth to little cavals and diſputes, which naturally prompted them to vent their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets to a third perſon.</p>
            <p>Amelia's confidant was her ſiſter, younger than herſelf and of a lively pleaſant diſpoſition, too much attached to her ſiſter not to condemn her brother's behaviour, ſhe very kindly however, ſtrove to bring about a reconciliation between them. Of a different and an oppoſite temper was the confidential friend of Celadon—a man of family, nearly of his own age, young, fond of women, (av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſe to marriage) artful and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Of Johnſon's real intentions Celadon's frankneſs harboured not the leaſt idea; but Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte ſuſpected the ſincerity of his favored friend. She had reſided with her ſiſter from the time of her father's deceaſe; on <hi>her</hi> Johnſon had deſigns, but his inclination led him firſt to attempt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over Amelia. Charlotte with a great ſhare of diſcretion had alſo a great ſhare of ſagacity, and felt a particular averſion to Johnſon on account
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028632_0059_0FDA33716184A488"/>
of his character. And his principal pleaſure was to ſeduce every female who fell in his way, he took no ſmall delight alſo in corrupting thoſe men whoſe minds were better framed. Actuated by this propenſity, he was at this very time prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing upon a young fellow related to Celadon, who had lately come there on a viſit.</p>
            <p>Neville was not only an agreeable but a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy young man, but not having ſeen ſo much of the world as thoſe with whom he now reſided, and their acquaintance; he was not at firſt aware of Johnſon's character, he ſuppoſed, indeed from the air of gallantry in his behaviour to Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, that he intended to make honorable propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to her, though he was always ridiculing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony to him.</p>
            <p>Neville ſoon conceived a violent paſſion for Charlotte, which made his uneaſineſs great with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er might, from his inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating manners, prevail on the former to become as finiſhed a libertine as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Celadon indeed ſaw not Johnſon in his true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, yet he was far from thinking as he did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſubject of a very intereſting nature: He ſtill loved his wife with a ſincere affection; though their diſputes had weakened the force of his firſt ardour; yet he was ſufficiently ſenſible of the value of domeſtic felicity, to wiſh for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; for that he often ſighed, hourly lamented the change diſcernable in his lady, and the change which he felt in himſelf.</p>
            <p>By a diſpute in which they were one day warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged, concerning their little ſon, the breach between them was conſiderably widened. Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in direct oppoſition to his wife's judgment, took him from her, at an age when boys uſually remain under the tuition of the female part of the family, in order to place him at a boarding ſchool, though his own fondneſs could ſcarcely brook the ſeperation—Amelia, on the other hand, who loved her huſband's likeneſs in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, ſighed at the abſence of her amiable little
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028632_0060_0FDA3376A5DA8D40"/>
Harry, but knew that her ſolicitations for his return would be to no purpoſe; domeſtic debates at length became ſo frequent, and ſo fierce, that the former began to drop hints about a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Amelia, though ſhe trembled at the ſound of that word, was too proud to let him who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it ſee that it affected her.</p>
            <p>Johnſon, who was ever upon the watch, and ever ſpiriting up his friend to proceed with the greateſt violence, determined to ſeize this very favourable opportunity (as he imagined) to pay his court to Amelia, reſolving at the ſame time, to prevent Neville from forming an alliance with Charlotte. To facilitate the execution of the laſt deſign, and prompted alſo by his conſumate vanity, he careleſsly hinted one day, that he was ſure of the heart of Amelia, and that he had no doubts with regard to the poſſeſſion of her ſiſter's, whenever he ſhould have leiſure to to attempt ſuch a conqueſt: This bold aſſertion juſtly raiſed Neville's indignation, and he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to acquaint each party with what he had delivered.</p>
            <p>Johnſon anſwered him firſt with a loud laugh, and then dared him to the commiſſion of ſo capital a folly, as he called it, aſſuring him that there was nothing particular in what he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as all people who knew any thing of life, thought and acted preciſely in the ſame manner?
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028632_0060_0FDA3376A5DA8D40"/>
adding, that he would make himſelf appear in the moſt ridiculous light, by publiſhing any thing of his ruſtic and obſolete notions, which were quite contrary to the ton.</p>
            <p>Neville, who had by this time formed his plan, made a ſhort reply: He then left him and went in ſearch of Charlotte, whom he found ready to reproach him for his attachment to Johnſon, and who declared, that ſhe had a worſe opinion of him than of any other man in the world.</p>
            <p>Tranſported at this declaration, which cofim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the falſity of Johnſon's aſſertions, he ſeized that moment to tell every thing he had been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to preſs his ſuit with more ardour than ever. She gave him in return the moſt flattering encouragement, but not 'till he had promiſed her to break off all connexions with Johnſon, and to aſſiſt her in paving the way for a reconciliation between her brother and ſiſter; vindicating the latter in the warmeſt terms, and aſſuring her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that whatever faults ſhe had, they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from an exceſs of ſenſibility, and from an uncommon delicacy of diſpoſition, which ſhe was afraid had been carried too far.</p>
            <p>Highly pleaſed with having put things in this promiſing train, ſhe flew to her ſiſter, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her of all ſhe had learnt from Neville, who
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028632_0061_0FDA33789024C830"/>
would, ſhe was certain, endeavour to make her huſband ſenſible of the miſtakes into which he he had been led by Johnſon, his falſe friend in every ſenſe of the word.</p>
            <p>Amelia thanked her ſiſter for her information: and aſked her if ſhe thought the interpoſition of her little Harry might not alſo be of conſiderable ſervice: "Though we have long ceaſed to be fond of each other," continued ſhe, "we both dote on our child, I will go and fetch him this moment from ſchool; Celadon cannot be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my love for my dear boy; when he has made us friends, he may be ſent again to ſchool if his father chuſes it." Accordingly ſhe ſet out with her ſiſter, but when ſhe arrived at the ſchool, ſhe was told, that Celadon, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Neville, had juſt carried her ſon away. The latter of theſe gentlemen, indeed, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on the former to liſten to reaſon, and to be reconciled to his lady, who had been baſely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented to him by Johnſon, whoſe infamous deſigns, both upon her and her ſiſter, were no longer of a queſtionable nature.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Celadon was convinced of the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of his pretended friend, he began to doubt whethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Amelia who had been, he was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſenſible, very ill treated by him, would ever forgive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m. Upon his expreſſing this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, Neville told him that the ſight of her
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028632_0061_0FDA33789024C830"/>
ſon would, in his opinion, diſarm her reſentment. The little fellow was rejoiced to come home.— On his eagerly flying to look for his mamma, Celadon ſtopped him, and bade him conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the cloſet till he ſent for him; the boy whimpered and obeyed: In the mean while Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia and Charlotte returned very much diſſatisfied from the ſchool.</p>
            <p>Charlotte, by queſtioning the ſervants cloſely, ſoon found out the little Harry, and brought him privately to his mother. While ſhe was careſſing him, Johnſon, who began to ſuſpect that he was found out, but who alſo believed he had ſtill ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power to impoſe on Celadon, came and diſcovered him with Neville. Very ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his arrival, Amelia, followed by her ſiſter, led in Harry, and bade him regain his father's heart for her. Celadon could not immediately recover from his ſurpriſe and embarraſſment, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as Johnſon ſtood cloſe at his elbow, ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating him to reject every offer towards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; but the modeſt appearance and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der behaviour of Amelia, a recollection of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that Neville had told him, and the ſight of his engaging child, who diſcovered the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fondneſs both for him and his mother, quite ſoftened his heart. He embraced his wife and child with unutterable tranſport, and then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Johnſon, forbade him the houſe. He
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028632_0062_0FDA3379B8DECEB0"/>
quitted it in a rage, and Charlotte gave her hand to Neville ſoon after.</p>
            <p>Celadon and Amelia, now as ſenſible of their own errors as of Johnſon's criminal conduct, were perfectly reconciled, and the revival pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a laſting ſource of their connubial happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <l>Still prone to mark ſuſpicion's ſecret ſnare,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>HAIL native ſtream, ſaid Edmund, ſetting himſelf down upon the graſſy plot, thy ſlowery banks invite me here to reſt my weary limbs—Thy gentle murmers cannot however ſooth my ſorrow. Oh! ſcenes of my juvenile amuſements, you bring not along with you your former endearments. An old man approached him, he leaned on his ſtaff, his ſilvered locks waved to the gentle breeze, experience and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity marked his venerable countenance:—You ſeem to be faint with travel, ſaid Mr. T—, to
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028632_0063_0FDA337F1004F3C0"/>
Edmund. I am very much ſo, replied Edmund, If you pleaſe to retire to my houſe, which is juſt at hand, a little reſt and refreſhment will enable you more agreeably to purſue your journey. I intended to have gone a few miles farther before I had ſtopt, but, as I find myſelf exceedingly fatigued, I cheerfully accept of your friendly invitation. So ſaying, he roſe and followed Mr. T— to his villa.</p>
            <p>You are a ſtranger, I ſuppoſe, in this part of the country? ſaid Mr. T—. I was born at a vallage no great diſtance from this; I believe, however, very few here will now know me, I am much altered, beſides I am poor: I have brought nothing home with me but a few ſcars, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſervice of my country, looking at: ſtump, the remains of his left arm. Oh, thoſe are marks of glory, exclaimed the old gentleman infinitely more valuable than riches: May I be allowed to aſk your name? My name is R—, if you have reſided here any conſiderable time, you perhaps are not a ſtranger to my family—Do you know my father? I have often heard of him, but never had the pleaſure of his acquaintance. From your parlour window I can ſee the gently ſlooping hills where roam his ſnowy flocks and the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groves which ſhelter his little farm; Oh! delightful ſpot, reſidence of exalted virtue, place of my nativity, inexpreſſibly endeared to me by the indulgence of the beſt of parents—a parent,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028632_0063_0FDA337F1004F3C0"/>
perhaps ere now intombed in earth—Dreadful thought! Why was I torn from him, in his old age? Torn from him, did you ſay? Yes in the cruelleſt baſeſt manner. I feel myſelf intereſted in your concerns, do favor me with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany till to-morrow, and a recital of your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Edmund yielding to his entreaties proceeded.</p>
            <p>My mother died when I was but a boy, my father remained a widower: Though but little acquainted with the world, or the ſciences, by a cloſe attention to nature he acquired ſome of the moſt important principles of uſeful knowledge; The cultivation of his little farm afforded him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne an education ſuitable to ſuch a ſtation. At the grammar-ſchool of our pariſh I contracted an intimacy with a lad about my own age, the ſon of a gentleman in our neighbourhood; this connexion in time advanced to a moſt perfect friendſhip,</p>
            <p>Having one day taken the diverſion of hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the purſuit of our game carried us f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028632_0064_0FDA33842133F448"/>
us that it was dinner time; I carried Mr. Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams, which was the name of my friend, to the houſe of a widow lady in that neighbourhood, where I had before once viſited. We were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the politeſt manner. It was then I was firſt bleſſed with a ſight of my Maria! Bleſſed did I ſay? No ſurely, it deſerves another appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſince it proved the commencement of my misfortunes. I will not attempt to diſcribe this lovely maid, any repreſentation I could delineate would fall infinitely ſhort of the original. Her charms inſpired me with the ſincereſt paſſion, and I had every reaſon to think it mutual. Oh! I was miſtaken, ſhe was not ſincere; at leaſt, ſhe was not proof againſt the ſolicitations of another.</p>
            <p>By permiſſion of my father, whom I had made acquaintaned with the whole matter, I went one day to viſit her. At my arrival I found the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the utmoſt diſorder; Maria was miſſing! She had gone the day before on a viſit to a lady, who reſided at a little diſtance, and had not from that time been heard of. I was ſo ſtruck with this intelligence, that I remained for ſome time in a manner inſenſible; I ſoon however recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf: Concluding ſhe muſt have been forced away, I reſolved not to looſe a moment in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting her recovery. I diſpatched a ſhort note to my father, and one to my friend, briefly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with what had happened, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to take a different route from that which
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028632_0064_0FDA33842133F448"/>
I intended, and appointing a place where to meet. This done, I took leave of the family.</p>
            <p>Having ſpent the day in fruitleſs inquiries, I arrived late at night at the place of rendezvous, Mr. Williams was not come; I waited with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience till next morning. Have you heard any thing of Maria? cried I, as ſoon as he appeared. —I have—Where is ſhe?—At Mr. Oſburn's—I ſtretched forth my arms to embrace him. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your joy, Edmund, ſaid he this diſcovery only adds to your misfortunes.—What do you mean?—She is there by her own choice!—Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.—That will but too well convince you of its reality, ſaid he, puting a letter into my hand, which he ſaid he received from herſelf. I tore it open—its contents informed me, that ſhe had particular reaſons for diſcontinuing her correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with me, and at the ſame time adviſing me to think no more of her. The letter drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from my hand, I ſtood for ſome time mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs with ſurpriſe: I had, it is true, never before ſeen her hand writing, but I had the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt confidence in my friend. Come, Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams, ſaid I, I muſt ſee the faithleſs Maria once more; I ſhall at leaſt have the pleaſure of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing her ſeducer.—Take care, ſaid he, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of chaſtening your rival, you do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an additional injury: You know he is a profeſſed libertine; A man who can commit a
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028632_0065_0FDA3386502FB128"/>
crime like this, will not heſitate to crown it with another, perhaps of a worſe nature. I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firm to my purpoſe. Having found I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, he agreed to accompany me. When we were within a little diſtance of Mr. Oſburn's he ſaid, it was thro' one of the domeſtics of the family, with whom he had a ſlight acquaintance, he had got acceſs to Maria; and if I pleaſed, he would go a little before and endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me an interview by the ſame method. I approved of his propoſal. He was hardly out of ſight, when ſeveral men ruſhed ſuddenly from, a concealment, one of them ſeized my horſe by the bridle; while I ſtruck at him with the but end of my whip, I received a blow on my head which brought me ſenſeleſs to the ground. When I recovered I found myſelf in a paltry looking apartment, ſurrounded by a number of fellows, whoſe countenances told me I had no good to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them. I aſked them the meaning of all this, and was anſwered, I ſhould know that in proper time. I was ſoon after forced into a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, one of the fellows placed on each ſide of me carried to Portſmouth, and put on board a tranſport which ſailed next day for Germany.</p>
            <p>Time will not permit me to relate particularly the various circumſtances which happened dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different campaigns in which I have ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Surrounded by the enemy, I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainly have fallen a victim to their ferocity, had
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028632_0065_0FDA3386502FB128"/>
not Mr. Douglaſs, who perceived my ſituation, come to my relief. The victory was glorious, it was deciſive, but I loſt my friend: He was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly killed, or at leaſt taken priſoner, for from that hour to this I never could learn what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of him. The loſs of ſo much blood, and a long and tedious recovery, made a return to my native country neceſſary, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit my debilitated conſtitution. In the boſom of a parent, in the company of my friend, Mr. Williams, I now expect to find a ſolace to my affliction: This remaining happineſs, how is it embittered by the recollection of Maria, once the ſum of my felicity, and ſcource of my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; now, as I was long ſince but too well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, hid in the ſhades of death for ever from my view!</p>
            <p>I ſee, ſaid Mr. T—, you expect the higheſt pleaſure from the enjoyment of your friend.—I do indeed: Oh, how ſweet at this moment is the recollection of our paſt endearments, how pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hope of their revival.—How vain is ſuch a hope! Him you call your friend is the blackeſt villain.—What do you ſay? ſaid Edmund, with a look of aſtoniſhment and indignation, you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do not know him.—I ſhould indeed be aſhamed of ſuch an acquaintance; you may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be aſſured of what I tell you, that he is the baſeſt of villains and the worſt enemy you ever had.—My enemy, exclaimed Edmund, what do
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028632_0066_0FDA3387363E94D8"/>
you mean? Sure I can read ſincerity and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in your countenance, you would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon me, nor willingly make me wretched- Oh! for Heaven's ſake explain yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Know then, Williams betrayed you and your Maria! Excited by a guilty paſſion, and finding her proof againſt every deluſive art, he found means to carry her off by force. The letter he brought you was a baſe forgery: In caſe you ſhould be inclined to examine more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, as he apprehended you would, he hired thoſe ruffians, who carried you away in the manner you have yourſelf related. I need ſay no more; this is the truth of the matter; for the confirmation of which I can produce the moſt undeniable proof, if you demand it.—Edmund trembled and turned pale; a thouſand minute circumſtances now ruſhed on his memory, which tended to ſhake, in ſome degree, the confidence he had placed in his friend —Mr. T— perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſtreſs, and attempted to ſoothe the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his mind.—May I be allowed, ſaid Edmund, to aſk you, by what means you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with thoſe circumſtances.—You behold in me the father of the unfortunate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.—The father of Maria! cried Edmund, in the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, and can you behold with ſuch a placid countenance, the wretch, who has, tho' unintentionally, been the occaſion of her misfortunes?—You was deceived, you was cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028632_0066_0FDA3387363E94D8"/>
diſabled from diſcovering the deception. The lady with whom Maria reſided, continued Mr. T—, is my ſiſter; ſhe wrote me concerning your viſits, and her apprehenſion of the conſequences: The day after receiving her letter I ſet out to ſee my daughter; I had not got half way when I was alarmed with cries from a carriage which drove paſt; fortunately I had brought a ſervant along with me, by whoſe aſſiſtance I reſcued my child. We returned home: I queſtioned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria concerning your correſpondence with her; ſhe gave me a circumſtantial detail of the matter, concluding with an account of her being ſeized and carried off by two men, whom ſhe had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeen before, not a quarter of a mile from her aunt's houſe. I was inclined to think this to be a contrivance of yours, and not hearing any more of you, confirmed me in that opinion. It was but very lately I was undeceived: A ſevere illneſs produced a confeſſion, of the whole affair, from the wretch whom you fondly call your friend.</p>
            <p>Oh! how am I diſappointed, exclaimed Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, betrayed by one whom I eſteemed as my boſom friend. Maria—loſt for ever! Diſtracting thought—What now remains for me? Oh! hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly friendſhip, ſoul of happineſs, where ſhall I now find thee? Who ſhall now lead me to thy abode? Young man, ſaid Mr. T—. you need
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028632_0067_0FDA3388EB2B1A08"/>
not go far to find her, ſhe dwells beneath this humble roof; you have yet a friend.—Edmund ſtretched out his hand to the old gentleman, his feelings were too big for utterance, the tear ſtarted in his eye. Look on me as your father, continued Mr. T—, I have yet a daughter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in her you may find ſome traces of your Maria. Edmund remained ſilent, except the ſigh which burſted from his agitated boſom.— Mr. T— retired, but ſoon returned leading in a woman. Heavens, what do I ſee, exclaimed Edmund, the moment he ſet his eyes on her.— My Maria—Sure I cannot be miſtaken.—You are not, ſaid Mr. T—, it is ſhe herſelf, though brought indeed by ſorrow to the brink of the grave, Heaven was pleaſed to reſtore her to her aged parent, to preſerve her as a bleſſing to her Edmund, as the reward of his virtues, as the compenſation of his ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Sweet was the embrace of love, beyond the power of words to expreſs; the charming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria hid her modeſt face in her Edmund's boſom, while the tears of ſenſibility flowed plentifully from her eyes. He appeared not now the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly youth ſhe had once beheld him—The bloom of health glowed not on his cheeks—Care had ſilvered o'er his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the ſtrongeſt, the tendereſt manner, the power of parental and filial affection: Edmund was ſtruck with the appearance of a gentleman who accompanied Mr. Roberts, he ſuddenly quitted the embraces of his father, and ruſhed with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour into the arms of the ſtranger. It was Mr. Douglaſs! He had been taken priſoner, but, on his parole, had returned home, and called on Mr. Roberts in his way. Edmund was united to his Maria, her father removed along with them to Mr. Roberts's, where they where long bleſſed with every domeſtic felicity and ſocial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment. Heavenly peace dwelt in the boſom of Edmund, joy ever ſparkled in his Maria's eyes; happineſs increaſed with their increaſing years, and diffuſed his richeſt ſweets through their rural habitation.</p>

            <head>THE HONOURABLE SEDUCER: OR, HISTORY OF OLIVIA.</head>
            <head type="sub">(Extracted from the life of an unfortunate female.)</head>
            <p>OLIVIA was born in a remote part of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and was the eldeſt daughter of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who lived in a ſtile of gentility beſpeaking competence indeed, but not affluence. As the family was numerous, much ſhe could not expect to be proportioned with; but if her pecuniary expectations were ſlender, nature ſeemed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the want of wealth, by treaſuring in her perſon every female charm, which ought perhaps to be conſidered rather as a misfortune than an advantage, ſince it lays us the more open to ſeduction; add to this, her being miſtreſs of many polite accompliſhments, with a heart form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nature's moſt delicate mould, endued with a ſenſibility too exquiſite to guard againſt the ſnares of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:028632_0068_0FDA3390C4FC1B98"/>At the age of ſeventeen ſhe left the ſchool, and lived under the eye of a mother, whoſe fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her ſhe requited with every token of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial affection. Many were her admirers, but no ſuitor appeared amongſt them; no lure, however, was thrown out, no extravagance of dreſs indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in to aſſiſt her native attractions; indeed ſhe ſeemed "when unadorned, adorned the moſt."</p>
            <p>A ball given upon ſome public occaſion was the firſt opportunity that offered for introducing her to the public eye. Among the company preſent was a ſtudent belonging to one of the Univerſities, and then on a viſit to ſome perſon of note in that part of the country. His addreſs was genteel, his perſon elegant; he hoped the pleaſure of being her partner for the evening, and was gratified: An acquaintance from that moment and circumſtance commenced, which led to overtures of a tender kind.</p>
            <p>The reſpectable connexions, and honourable views he was ſuppoſed to have, added to the unbounded confidence placed in Olivia's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion by her parents, made them indifferent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the addreſſes paid to her without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and, indeed, ſuch a ſanction is a needleſs ceremony where the affections of the child has been previouſly beſtowed, as was her caſe; her heart was diſpoſed of but not without an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, his was given in exchange; yet no propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal

of marriage was made, and an union of hands, which diſarms the cenſorious, was unthought of by either in the delirium of happineſs they were in, as if no moment could be borrowed for that end from the time they ſpent in the interchange of every token of unfeigned affection.</p>
            <p>Olivia was at laſt waked from this lethargy of love, but not until the fear of diſhonor had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the miſt from her eyes. She propoſed a day on which he was to ſolicit the concurrence of her parents to their nuptials; her propoſal was received with demonſtrations of unabated ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; but, he that had been ſo aſſiduous in his attendance till then, abſented himſelf that day and returned to the purſuit of his ſtudies without even taking leave of her family, by whom he had been always treated with reſpect and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. They were ſurpriſed; ſhe, as may be imagined, was alarmed, the more as he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after having triumphed over that which gives dignity to love, and to native beauty an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional luſtre. She was in an agony of deſpair, which diſcovered it in the effects it had upon her health. Her mother marked the progreſs of a pain that undermined her daughter's peace, and endeavored to alleviate it by arguments calculated to comfort her under her diſappointments, all of which failed of the end propoſed. She did not ſuſpect the cauſe of her daughter's affliction to be ſo ſerious as it was; yet finding her continue
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028632_0069_0FDA3391A6E61588"/>
diſconſolate, ſhe urged her not with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the tenderneſs of a fond parent, to be explicit in revealing the minuteſt circumſtances relative to her ſituation. Poor Olivia's tongue faultered in the attempt, but at laſt, after having confeſſed a partiality for Mr. —, (which was viſible enough) owned the advantage that had been taken of it, with an ingeniouſneſs that ſhewed ſelf-gratification had not made her ſwerve from the path of virtue ſo much as her inability to refuſe to the man ſhe loved the laſt pledge of her ardent paſſion for him.</p>
            <p>Having got over the painful taſk of ſelf-accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſhe ſwooned in the arms of her afflicted parent, whoſe ſituation ſeemed now as pitiable as her child's; yet, ſenſibly as ſhe was affected by the idea of her Olivia's ruin, and the diſgrace that would inevitably be reflected on a family hitherto unblemiſhed, ſhe forbore to torture with unavailing reproaches a breaſt already <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>acked with the moſt poignant feelings; and after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcloſed the heart-rending ſecret to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, it was reſolved, as the beſt expedient to baniſh the melancholy which might endanger the reaſon or health of a child ſtill dear to them, as well as to place her beyond the reach of malev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent aſperſions, to ſend her to London, whither ſhe ſoon after came, and was apprenticed to a miliner. Here ſhe found me, and diſburdened her heart of part of its ſorrow, by making me privy to its ſecrets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="unknown:028632_0070_0FDA339365EDF9E8"/>Not long after ſhe had been in town, a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage was the conſequence of a haſty and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing journey; during the illneſs that attended it, I was happy enough to endear myſelf to her by every little kind office in my power to do her, which ſhe was grateful for, and returned on ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery occaſion, until a <hi>faux pas</hi> threw me at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from her; ſhame would not have been my portion had I followed her example, which was ſtrictly virtuous. Many have been the attempts made to ſeduce her to a violation of her chaſtity, but to no overtures would ſhe liſten; her firſt lover, though ſuppoſed faithleſs, retained poſſeſſion of her heart, which fluttered whenever ſhe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his name.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he had returned to that part of the country whence he ſo abruptly departed, and made many fruitleſs enquiries; and being diſappointed in his reſearches, as his courſe of ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

A ſettled gloom appeared on his countenance, which ſhe could not account for, and in order to diſpel it, ſhe adviſed him to travel; agreeably to her advice, he prepared for his tour, and having been to make ſome farewel viſits, one evening overtook a genteel girl with a band-box in her hand, whom he politely accoſted, but without being able to extort a word from her;
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028632_0070_0FDA339365EDF9E8"/>
ſtill he followed, and ſhe, to get rid of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, beckoned a coach off a ſtand, while he liſtening to learn the place of her reſidence, after he had heard her voice, exclaimed, "Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heaven! 'tis ſhe, 'tis my Olivia—I have loſt her again!"</p>
            <p>At his return, his mother told him ſhe expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every moment from the miliner's ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which ſhe intended as a preſent for him. The words were hardly uttered when a footman brought word that a young woman from the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liner's was in the next room, and waited her pleaſure; "Let me ſee the ruffles and frills I beſpoke," ſaid the lady, upon which he brought in a box that excited a ſtrange emotion in the young gentleman; indeed he thought it could be no other than the one his fair fugitive carried, and ſhe being deſired to walk in, as ſoon as they recognized each other, ſhe fainted, which had an effect upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Olivia's concurrence, you may imagine, was eaſily obtained to an excurſion that originated from ſo generous a motive, excluſive of the pleaſure ſhe hoped to feel in her parents retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opinion of him on whom ſhe had fixed her affections: Vanity, in ſome degree, cleave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their intended journey, and the object of it, were no ſooner propoſed to the old lady for her approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhe acquieſced in the propriety of the purpoſe; not without applauding the generous
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028632_0071_0FDA339515EE7C98"/>
principle that actuated her ſon upon this occaſion, for in what regarded an inviolable fidelity to the fairſex, uninfluenced by lucrative conſiderations, ſhe profeſſed an enthuſiaſm that would have done credit to the days of chivalry. To give the whole weight of her ſanction to a meaſure ſhe ſo highly approved of, ſhe not only inſiſted on their mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of her equipage on the occaſion, in token of her reſpect towards her daughter-in-law, as well as in teſtimony of her hearty conſent to their nuptials, ſhe reſolved to accompany the young couple, thereby adding much to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their journey; which accordingly took place, after ſufficient time had been allowed for acquainting Olivia's parents and kindred what viſitants they were ſhortly to expect.</p>
            <p>Olivia, urged by the impulſe of a ſanguine temper, natural to youth, was for ſurpriſing the old folks with the happy viciſſitude of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and elevating their ſpirits with a jerk, as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly as they had been depreſſed; "No child," remonſtrated the old lady; "your dutiful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and tender concern for them, muſt not miſguide you in preſcribing ſo violent a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to blunt the edge of ſorrow: let not your youth envy my maturer years the conſolation of knowing by experience what will be beſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe of riper years, and what, indeed, is propereſt for any ſtage of life under the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; I mean a gradual, at leaſt a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

intimation of the change a little time has made in your condition; for a ſudden tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from ſadneſs to joy has been obſerved to have more fatal effects on the ſpirits than from exceſſive joy to its oppoſite extreme; as though it were intended by nature that we ſhould bear adverſity better than proſperity." Great as was Olivia's impatience to be the meſſenger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to her afflicted parents, ſhe had too great a ſhare of underſtanding not to allow the impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of burſting upon them with the full ſplendour of happineſs, before a letter had, in part, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the cloud of melancholy with which they were overcaſt, and relinquinſhed her deſire with becoming reſignation, to the will and advice of her mother-in-law, who, unwilling to put Olivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's patience to a trial, too ſevere, retarded their journey but for a week. This was keeping Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via a tedious fortnight from a place whither her eager wiſhes had flown before her, for the journey could not be performed in leſs than a week. In the mean while, a letter reached the manſion of her father, who immediately diſpatched the glad tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to his wife, then at Bath, where ſhe had been adviſed to ſpend ſome time to recruit her health and ſpirits; he had the ſame time hinted a deſire that, if her health would permit, ſhe would not a moment delay her return, which he by no means would have inſinuated, were he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that all the ſanitive properties aſcribed to that faſhionable rendezvous of infirmity, would
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028632_0072_0FDA33962E89ECD8"/>
be leſs conducive to the re-eſtabliſhment of her health, than folding to her boſom her long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and beloved child.</p>
            <p>This amiable young lady, with her huſband and mother, had arrived within a few ſtages of the town that gave her birth, anticipatig the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py meeting, and reviewing in Fancy's glaſs, ſcenes which ſhe had every reaſon to hope would ſoon be realized, when an event happened that deranged in an inſtant all her immagination had been framing during the journey.—A loud ſhriek was heard to proceed from a ſtage coach that ſtopped at the inn where they were changing horſes, a ſomething like ſympathy made Olivia return it; her huſband ſhared her emotion, for they were united in every ſenſe of the word, and what diſcompoſed her, was conveyed to him by that iviſible link which couples hearts in uniſon, one with the other as no untoward accident was known to cauſe the alarm, you will ſuppoſe, I make no doubt, that either Olivia's ſenſibility made her feel for the perſon whom ſhe thought a ſufferer, or that ſome former acquaintance of her's, unable to ſuppreſs her joy on having a tranſient view of one ſhe recognized, vented it in the foregoing manner: indeed, the ſhriek was uttered by no other than Olivia's mother, whom chance led to the inn at ſo critical a juncture, and whoſe well-known voice thrilled through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb facs="unknown:028632_0073_0FDA339EB91AA318"/>
of her daughter, cauſing the agitation ſhe was ſuddenly thrown into. They, who a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before ſeemed unnerved, and whoſe ſpirits were unequal to the tender ſcene nature was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, now flew to each other's embrace as if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by a magnetic power, and gave way to effuſions which hearts of a coarſer mould than were thoſe of Olivia's huſband and mother-in-law, would have been affected by it: this debt being paid to ſincere and reciprocal affection, and ſerenity reſtored, Olivia's mother and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law contracted and acquaintance with leſs ceremony than cordiality: her huſband, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of having violated the laws of hoſpitality, was not forward to ſolicit a haſty forgivneſs, which he did not think himſelf entitled to, the leſs, after he had witneſſed the tranſport of his mother in-law, on ſeeing her daughter reſcued from infamy, and thence inferred the pangs that muſt have preceded ſuch demonſtrations of joy; yes, his conſcience ſmote him, and his heart was too honeſt to harbour the impudence of a profeſſed libertine, and brazen it out: which Olivia's mother obſerving, ſhe would ſpare him the humiliating taſk of exculpating himſelf, and taking his hand, ſaid with an affability that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke no lurking reſentment in her breaſt; "My child, ſince you have performed ſo generous an act towards my Olivia, it would ill become me not to acquit myſelf of ſome part of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I can no otherwiſe do at preſent, than
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028632_0073_0FDA339EB91AA318"/>
by paſſing an act of oblivion in your favour." This diffuſed general chearfulneſs, after which they proceeded together in the ſame carriage, to the place of their deſtination: when arrived, the young gentleman took the earlieſt opportunity to eraſe any unfavorable impreſſion that might dwell on the mind of his father-in-law, by aſſuring him that his ſeeming dereliction of his daughter, was not the effect of juvenile caprice, but was owing to his wiſh to receive the parting breath of a valued friend at college, whoſe diſſolution approaching faſt, allowed him no time then to ſubſtantiate his profeſſions to the lady whom he was ſince happy to make his own. Here ended all apologies and juſtifications; now the tongue of ſlander, that did indeed but whiſper before, became mute; and a happier couple than appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at church the following Sunday, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Olivia and her huſband, the ſeniors of the pariſh could not recollect.</p>

            <head type="sub">[FROM THE FRENCH, OF M. D' ARNAUD.]</head>
            <p>LORD WHATLEY had attained to thoſe years, that may not improperly be called the reign of the paſſions. His diſpoſition was naturally good, he had great ſenſibility, and an inſtinctive love of juſtice. But the thoughtleſs period of two-and-twenty, wealth, birth, and bad company (by which it is needleſs to ſay one means great company)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe, together with the facility of boundleſs gratification, all equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of reaſon and ſentiment, had overborne the voice of nature, that guardian voice, which, whenever we attend to it, calls us to the paths of truth: Diſtinguiſhed in the diſſipated circle at Newmarket, the perfect model of every faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028632_0074_0FDA339EC17A9DC8"/>
folly, Whatley had all that was politely careleſs or agreeably extravagant, and, what was the foundation of the whole, a very fine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the county of Salop.</p>
            <p>Sir Thomas Ward was his favorite. That gentleman had an engaging addreſs, and a ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive wit. He was a moſt eloquent profeſſor of vice, a moſt powerful advocate of pleaſure; for he had the art of giving a prevailing charm to every ſubject he undertook to defend. He, therefore found no great difficulty in making a diſciple of Whatley:—A young mind is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the ſenſes, and eaſily yields to every flattering overture.</p>
            <p>This nobleman, after having been agreeably entertained at dinner with his companions, his head full of voluptuous images, was walking alone in one of the viſtas of his park. It led him, inſenſibly, to the houſe of one of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants whoſe name was Adams.</p>
            <p>Lord Whatley was ſtruck with the figure of a girl who ſeemed to be about ſixteen, and was one of the farmer's youngeſt daughters Ireland, ſo boaſted for beauties, never produced ſo fine a creature. Fanny was literally an angel from heaven; the dignity of her mind was diſplayed in her countenance, and modeſty gave a deeper bluſh to the roſes on her cheek. Her mouth,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028632_0075_0FDA339FDFBA8348"/>
her glowing mouth was the ſeat of ten thouſand graces. Her ſkin was white as the gliſtening ſnow; her hair the moſt beautiful brown, and her eyes had a charm, of which words can give no idea. Suffice it to ſay, that it was impoſſible to look upon, her without two ſentiments that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the heart; that is, admiration, and the whole energy of love. The latter ſoon made in inroads on the heart of this young lord.</p>
            <p>When Fanny ſpoke, every word went to the ſoul of Whatley, and completed her conqueſt. He would have laid his commands on Adam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but he was no longer the lord the maſter of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, his farmer's daughter. He let fall ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken expreſſions; Fanny had confuſed him.</p>
            <p>Adams had given his daughter an excellent education. She was cited as an example of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and politeneſs, through the whole diſtrict of Salop.—One of her relations, miniſter of a neighboring pariſh, had taken a pleaſure in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and embelliſhing her mind; and to whom ſhe was indebted for attainments far above her years. The precepts of the miniſter had not, however, prevented her from diſcovering that ſhe had a heart: The ſight of our young lord convinced her of it at once. He frequently repeated his viſit to the farmer, or rather to his daughter; and ſhe every time made a new impreſſion on him He became penſive, melancholly; the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028632_0075_0FDA339FDFBA8348"/>
of the baronets humour was played upon him in vain. It could not baniſh that dear, that delightful penſiveneſs which forever carried his heart towards the amiable daughter of Adams.</p>
            <p>Fanny, one day, preſented him with a noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay. My lord, ſaid ſhe, blaſhing, I could wiſh theſe flowers were better: I gathered them on purpoſe for your lordſhip.—Flowers from your hand, moſt beautiful Fanny, muſt always be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. This compliment, or rather this real expreſſion of what he felt, ſoon found its way to the heart of Fanny.—Her fine complexion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a deeper bluſh. Her parents had not heard the anſwer his lordſhip had made her.— Upon his return home, he gave the flowers a thouſand kiſſes. He addreſſed himſelf to them as if he had been ſpeaking to Fanny. The ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet did not fail to treat him like a Celadon, or an Artemenes. My dear friend, ſaid he, you muſt certainly have read thoſe piteous French ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. You muſt never ſhew your face in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; you will be pointed at as you paſs along the ſtreet. I thought you would have made an incomparable Lovelace, but you are Menalcas by a fountain ſide.</p>
            <p>Sir Thomas accompanied his friend to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's. He ſaw Fanny. He was diſconcerted; he had need of the whole force of his wit and humour to defend himſelf againſt the ſtroke that
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028632_0076_0FDA33A164C40878"/>
had wounded Whatley. He attempts to addreſs himſelf in the language of the town to the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable villager. She ſpeaks. He is in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Sir Thomas, at length, reſumes his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry. He retires to have ſome private conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Adams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The worthy old man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, lifting up his eyes to heaven, diſtracted, pale, ready to ſink into the ground, death in his countenance. Go, my children. Ah, my lord! throwing himſelf with folded hands, and ſtreaming eyes, at the feet of Whatley, what have I done, that you have ſworn my ruin and diſgrace? That gentleman, ſaid he, my dear, addreſſing himſelf to his wife, and pointing to the baronet, has offered me money to give up Fanny to my lord. To think us capable of ſuch baſeneſs, of proſtituting the dear child we have brought up!—Take our lives, my lord, but leave us our honour; it is the only poſſeſſion we have. Are we then no longer worthy to be your ſervants? You, you then, had no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. It is you, ſir, who have given his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſuch counſel as this. Alas! what would my lord his father have ſaid? He treated us like his children.</p>
            <p>No, my dear Adams, interrupted Whatley, I never had any ſuch horrid idea. This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable pleaſantry of my friend. Set your heart at eaſe. Certainly, my lord, anſwered he, I never could apprehend that you ſhould ſo far
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028632_0076_0FDA33A164C40878"/>
forget your former goodneſs to the grateful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are always bleſſing you. As to you, ſir, ſaid he, turning to ſir Thomas, I muſt tell you, that if theſe are your pleaſantries, they are very vile ones; we may be poor, but we have a ſenſe of honour as well as you. If one of my equals, added he, with a voice choaked up with grief, had made me ſuch an infamous propoſal, I ſhould have gone to theſe extremities which have now been prevented by reſpect. I tell you once more, my dear Adams, my friend did not mean to inſult you; he was only in jeſt; I aſk your pardon for him; and he goes.</p>
            <p>Do you aſk pardon for me, ſaid Sir Thomas? Undoubtedly, and you ought to aſk it of the meaneſt perſon you have offended; then he is our ſuperior, our maſter. How cruel to be the occaſion of my ſufferings! you have offended the father of Fanny.</p>
            <p>I have deſcribed Whatley, as one of thoſe young lords, that conceal all their defects under the varniſh of politeneſs. I am not now incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent;—but love works miracles. It had made of a frivolous and inſolent lord, a timorous and reſpectful lover; and had opened his mind to the influences of virtue. The complaints of poor Adams had vexed him, and Sir Thomas muſt have been connected with him in the cloſeſt intimacy,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:028632_0077_0FDA33A71E622320"/>
as the conduct of that worthleſs man of faſhion was not followed by an open rupture.</p>
            <p>Whatley was diſtreſſed. He adored Fanny, yet he did not dare to ſee her. He was equally afraid of ſeeing the father and daughter. His friends dragged him to London, and plunged him once more in all thoſe faſhionable follies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, which the world calls pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Adams, from that moment, had loſt that chearfulneſs which is the happy portion of the inhabitants of the country. He was not ſatisfied with lord Whatley's promiſes. He looked upon his daughter's growing beauties with a ſigh, and the tear was ſometimes ready to overflow the eyelid.</p>
            <p>My dear father, ſaid Fanny, may I aſk you the reaſon why you appear ſo ſad? I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that for ſome time your looks have been fixed on me; and you ſhed tears: Can I have given you, my tender parent, any reaſon to be diſſatisfied? will you no longer love your poor Fanny?—Child, obſerve what I ſay, and anſwer me ingeniouſly. Indeed, dear ſir, I have always ſpoke the truth to you.</p>
            <p>Tell me, then, what are your ſentiments of my lord? what do you think of him? ſpeak the truth. I think, father, ſaid ſhe, with bluſhing
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028632_0077_0FDA33A71E622320"/>
cheeks and down-caſt eyes,—I think him very amiable; do you not think the ſame? My dear child, you muſt learn to know men. This lord, whom you think ſo amiable, would have brought me and your poor mother with ſorrow to the grave; would have deprived me of all I hold moſt dear—of my beloved Fanny!—Sir! what is it you ſay? He would, my dear child, (claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to his boſom, and bathing her with his tears) he would have diſhonoured me; would have taken you for the indulgence of a licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſion—for his miſtreſs. (Upon this he ſunk down into the arms of his daughter)—Heavens, what horrid wretches are men! who could have thought this of my lord? Take care, my dear Fanny, reſumed the father, take care of the ſnare that may be laid for you. Receive no letters from my lord; never be a moment alone; be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, if poſſible, in the boſom of your father and mother. Remember that the greateſt of all poſſeſſions is innocence. Embrace me, my dear child, and be the glory and comfort of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>Fanny wept. No, my worthy father, no, you never ſhall have reaſon to bluſh for me. I did not apprehend any thing like this from my lord. What a barbarous man to diſturb our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! O that he may never come here! Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and reſpect, my child, are due to him; and
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028632_0078_0FDA33ADA12E1460"/>
it will be your duty to obſerve a profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; only be directed by my advice.</p>
            <p>Fanny, when alone, a thouſand times repeated, how can ſo amiable a man have ſuch ungenerous ſentiments? O that vile London: how has it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved the heart of my lord Whatley! had he always lived here, certainly he would never have debaſed himſelf by ſuch a conduct.</p>
            <p>His idea, nevertheleſs, was ſtill with Fanny; and, poſſibly, ſhe partook of the impreſſion he had made. Her lover, in vain, had recourſe to the diſſipation of his former amuſements. He had received a wound which the art of London could not cure. Every pleaſure yielded to the remembrance of Fanny; ſhe was in every ſcene, in every object.</p>
            <p>Without waiting for the ſpring, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into the country, accompanied by his friends, who all united to reſcue him from a paſſion ſo degrading, as they called it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. What! ſhould a Peer of England ſigh under the influences of romantic love for a poor country girl! Inceſſantly ſtunned with ſuch reproaches as theſe, his vanity revolted againſt the attachment. Whatley, in the hour of gaity and intoxication, ſometimes promiſed to think no more of Fanny; but the enſuing day renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a warmer intereſt, the idea of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028632_0078_0FDA33ADA12E1460"/>
miſtreſs, for ſo he called her. He roſe more inflamed, and, if the expreſſion may be pardoned, more infatuated with love.</p>
            <p>Our noble lord, as may very well be ſuppoſed, was no ſooner arrived at his eſtate, than he went to the houſe of his tenant. The timorous and reſpectful behaviour of love made him more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He could not get over that embarraſſing confuſion which the ſight of Adams always occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned. Fanny would fain have perſuaded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to look upon him with averſion, but he had acquired new charms.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he entered her father's houſe, ſhe withdrew; but ſhe ſtole a glance that ruined her repoſe, and made her repeat inceſſantly, he is extremely amiable. Whatley thought of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pretences for paying his devotions to his hidden divinity,</p>
            <p>One day he met Fanny at a little diſtance from the farm; ſhe appeared more beautiful, more engaging than ever he had ſeen her. A well-fancied hat on her head, the neighboring flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that fell negligently by her ſide, her hair in a diſorder preferable to all the elegance of art, her heaving boſom, the tears that fell from her fine eyes upon, the roſes of her cheeks; theſe were the circumſtances of that enchanting figure,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028632_0079_0FDA33AF5C658030"/>
in which he then ſaw the miſtreſs of his ſoul. She was ſeated at the foot of a tree, and it was eaſy to perceive that her young heart laboured under ſome oppreſſive ſentiment. Whatley threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her feet in tears. My ſweet angel! ſaid he. At the ſame moment, ſhe roſe, and cried, my lord! He would have taken her hand; ſhe withdrew it haſtily, would have forced herſelf from him, and fled to the farm. No, my divine creature, you will not leave me. What have I done, beautiful Fanny? What crime have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? Ah, my lord, leave me, let me fly to my father; he has forbidden me to ſpeak to you, or to ſee you. It was very cruel, my lord, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, with tears, to think of taking advantage of our poverty; you have given great diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to my father, and all my relations. I have not deſerved ſuch treatment from your lordſhip.</p>
            <p>In pronouncing the laſt words, ſhe was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards the farm-houſe, and wept, letting fall her hand, which his lordſhip ſeized a ſecond time. Ah! divine Fanny! do not accuſe me, my friend alone ſhould bear the blame: Never had I ſuch an execrable thought; is it poſſible that I, who love you to diſtraction, ſhould treat you without reſpect? He perceived Adams com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them, with a look of anger, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating a deſign to reprove his daughter.—Yes, my dear Adams, I will repeat it before you, and in the face of Heaven, that I adore your charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028632_0079_0FDA33AF5C658030"/>
daughter. She is virtue itſelf, dreſſed by the graces, and it is my pride to lay at her feet, myſelf, my fortune, my honors, and my heart. (Fanny bluſhed; ſhe turned her fine eyes, that were full of tears, on her lover, thought him leſs criminal than her father had repreſented him, and again caſt thoſe eyes on the ground.) Yes, Adams, I declare it; Fanny has taught me that prejudice ſhould yield to reaſon; and now that I am in your houſe, before your wife and your children, I declare that I will marry her; that my name, my title, my fortune, and my whole ſoul ſhall be her's. Yes, my adorable Fanny, you ſee your lover and your huſband at your feet.</p>
            <p>What tranſport! what agitations in the heart of poor Fanny! What are you about, my lord? ſaid Adams, raiſing Whatley; it is our buſineſs to kneel before you. I am thoroughly ſenſible of your goodneſs, but ignorant and artleſs as we are, we know what is due to ourſelves. My daughter was not born to the dignity of lady Whatley; that title belongs to ladies of equal rank with yourſelf. Fanny, my lord, is your humble ſervant; ſhe has but one maſter that has a ſuperior claim, and that is honor. No, my lord, I will never agree that you ſhould marry beneath yourſelf; I ſhould be very unworthy of your favors, and thoſe of my lord, your father, whoſe memory will be ever dear and ſacred to me, if I ſhould indulge that paſſion which now
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028632_0080_0FDA33B061F98280"/>
blinds you; my wife, and Fanny herſelf, will be of the ſame opinion, and I have the honor, in their ſtead, to point out to you what is your duty on this occaſion, and what is ours. Fanny, once more looked on lord Whatley, and wept. Are not theſe, child, your ſentiments? Yes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid ſhe. But that YES was pronounced with a trembling accent, her heart would have ſnatched up what her tongue had let fall.</p>
            <p>What a triumph for Fanny! ſhe loved lord Whatley, and what ſecret tranſport muſt ſhe have felt to find his paſſion ſo great as to offer her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage! Her lover did not let the thing reſt here. Every day he viſited Adams. The ſame perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of demanding Fanny in marriage on his part, the ſame fortitude of refuſal on the worthy father's. My lord at length determined to write to the miſtreſs of his fate. He leaves a letter at the foot of a tree. He knew that Fanny muſt paſs this way, and depended on her curioſity for taking up the paper, on which he wrote no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription. Fanny comes to the tree beholds the billet, but in doubt whether ſhe ſhould touch it. She proceeds without taking it up, looks back, returns to the place, yields to an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary impulſe, unfolds the paper, and trembling, reads the following addreſs:—</p>
            <p>
               <q>You will eaſily diſcover who is the writer of this letter, and to whom it is addreſſed: It
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028632_0080_0FDA33B061F98280"/>
proceeds from the moſt tender, the moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate of men; it is addreſſed to the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable, but the moſt cruel, the moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of women. Can the beautiful Fanny be ignorant, that the happineſs of Whatley de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ſolely on herſelf and her reſpectable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I can only give her my hand and my heart, the ſacrifice is not ſufficient to expreſs my love. I know it well, my charming Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but it is all that is in my power. If you loved me, if you had the leaſt ſenſe of pity for your unhappy Whatley, I ſhould be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The lover, the adorer of the divine Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would become her huſband. But ah, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el! Have I a ſigh that breathes not for you? And yet theſe ſighs muſt ſoon expire in death. Solicit your father to make me happy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you will be the happieſt, the moſt adored of women. Virtue and beauty level all diſtinctions. You have read Pamela: a woman like her, in virtues and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould, like her, be diſtinguiſhed and rewarded. But ah, angelic creature! can it be an adequate recompence to you, to make you ſovereign miſtreſs of a man who has not the moſt diſtinguiſhed throne on earth to offer you.—Your anſwer will determine whether Whatley ſhall end the moſt wretched of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or live the moſt happy of men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:028632_0081_0FDA33B701A40B40"/>Ah, my lord, cried Fanny, why was I not nobly born? If I were a queen, you ſhould have no wiſh ungratified.—Oh! he ſuffers not what I endure.—Would we could change condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! I would throw myſelf at the feet of my father and mother, and ſhould ſoon be his wife. Poor lord! How he loves me! No, no, he nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er meant to diſhonor me. I always thought it the contrivance of that wicked baronet.</p>
            <p>Fanny kept the letter in her hand, peruſed it an hundred times, and always with the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſenſibility, with repeated exclamations of tender ſorrow. She conſiders whether ſhe ſhall ſhew it to her father. She is afraid, by ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, of breaking her promiſe. She ſees him, runs towards him, and with tears that interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, ſhe cried, Take it, father, ſee here a letter from my lord which I ſlave found. Poor lord!—he is very unhappy. If he ſhould die.—</p>
            <p>Adams read the letter. Fanny you never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed any thing from me. Do you love my lord?—ſhe ſobbed violently. My dear child, you have told me all; you are not in the hands of a ſevere judge, inveſted with parental autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but of a tender friend. What do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from this unhappy paſſion? Your honor is dear to you. Oh, ſir! a thouſand times more than my life. Well, and could you ever flatter
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028632_0081_0FDA33B701A40B40"/>
yourſelf with being lady Whatley?—Would you have me take an advantage of a moment of weakneſs or illuſion, to infringe every duty I owe to my maſters and benefactors? Are you aſhamed of your humble condition—of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's poverty?</p>
            <p>My father, ſaid Fanny, with folded hands and floods of tears, Heaven is my witneſs, how much I love and honor you. If you love me, then, child, you will overcome that tenderneſs, which to you may be a ſource of miſery, and perhaps of endleſs ſhame. We will part for ſome time. You ſhall go to your aunt Harris, who lives about ten miles from hence; there you will remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed until my lord leaves this place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to town, where he will forget you. Alas! would my lord forget me?—Go, my dear Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, you know not the great; you imagine that they are like us country people. I lived for ſome time in town, and I know that their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are ſhort lived. Marry a man of your own rank if you would be loved by your huſband, and make your family happy. To-morrow you ſhall go: I will tell your mother that your aunt has ſent for you, and I ſhall pre-acquaint her with the affair. Go and prepare for your journey.</p>
            <p>This was a thunderſtroke to Fanny. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left her alone. It was then ſhe felt the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028632_0082_0FDA3343A5570560"/>
whole force, the whole influence of love. She ſat down, or rather fell upon her chair, her head ſupported by her hands, and her heart heaving as if it would burſt. Shall I no more ſee my lord—be driven from him—ſcorn his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs—refuſe to make him or myſelf happy— break my heart? How, how can I bear it! O my father! what is it you require of me! Can I have fortitude enough to obey you, to draw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into exile, into my grave? Yes, my aunt will receive my laſt ſighs. Ah, lord Whatley, lord Whatley!</p>
            <p>Fanny paſſed a miſerable night. Adams had ſagacity to ſee into the heart of his daughter, and to perceive the cauſe of her agitation.— He loved her tenderly, and thought he ſhould give her a proof of his affection, by obviating the effects of the young nobleman's paſſion.— The moment is fixed for the fatal departure.— No body about the farm knew whither Fanny was going, except only her mother, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of her daughters diſtreſs, when ſhe beheld her labouring under thoſe afflictive ſenſations, which ſhe, in vain, endeavoured to conceal.</p>
            <p>Fanny, in preparing for her journey, often ſighed. She met one of the young men belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the farm, who had a great regard for her; and ſhe was afraid every moment of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by her father. Tell him, ſaid ſhe, my
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028632_0082_0FDA3343A5570560"/>
dear Williams, that I ſhall never forget him, and that I am very unhappy. Pray, Miſs, to whom ſhall I carry this meſſage? Did I not tell you my friend? to my lord, who loves me, and would be glad to marry me, but my father is againſt it —A moment after—No, my friend, ſaid ſhe, tell him nothing; I ſhould offend my parents—I ſhould tranſgreſs my duty. Poſſibly, one day, he will hear that I am dead, and then he will—</p>
            <p>While this poor girl was torn by conflicting ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, Adams appeared.—Come, child, take leave of your mother, your brother and ſiſters, and let us go. I will attend you myſelf, and do you take care to keep every thing a ſecret.</p>
            <p>What did not poor Fanny feel at this moment? She quitted the ſcenes where ſhe had ſpent her happy childhood—the ſcenes where ſhe had drawn her firſt breath, and which received her laſt ſighs. She caſt her tearful eyes on the ſeat of Whatley; ſhe was a victim that was dragged to receive the mortal blow. At this inſtant a ſervant arrives from lord Whatley. Mr. Adams, ſaid he, my lord deſires to ſpeak with you this moment: He is in bed, very ill. Ill! cried Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny—and her heart was then in new agitations.</p>
            <p>Adams haſted to the ſeat of his lord. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually found him in bed, and in a high fever.—
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028632_0083_0FDA33BB4640BD10"/>
Whatley gave orders that he ſhould be left alone with his tenant. Set down, my dear Adams, ſaid he, with a feeble voice; you ſee the effects of your conduct. How, my lord?—Yes, Adams, you obſtinately refuſed me your Fanny; you will ſoon be ſet free from future ſolicitation: I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that what I ſuffer from this diſappointment will bring me to the grave. Ah! my lord! replied the old man, you pierce me to the ſoul! Can I be the occaſion of your death, who would lay down my life for you a thouſand times?—This paſſion will go off. Your preſent infatuation will vaniſh. No, Adams, no; I ſhall never ceaſe to adore your charming daughter; I ſhall indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy her for the injury fortune hath done her, by raiſing her to the dignity of my own; and my intentions are fixed unleſs you are inclined to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten my paſſage to the grave. Conſider, my friend, whether you are really determined to murder the tendereſt of maſters. And with theſe words he held out his arms to embrace him.</p>
            <p>The good old man, diſtracted with a thouſand different ſenſations, cried out, But, my lord, what will your family, the town, the whole world ſay? How is it poſſible for me to conſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the brink of the grave. By this means you will complete my happineſs, that of your adorable daughter, and your family. You will be my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, continued he, embracing Adams, who was quite overpowered. Once more grant me my life, for it entirely depends on my union with Fanny. Come, my dear Adams, be not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that my relations, or that the court ſhould be offended. Let them but ſee, but know Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and all will applaud my choice.</p>
            <p>Honeſt Adams was confounded: He ſighed: he caſt his eyes on the ground. Whatley called his ſervants. They riſe and dreſs him. He gets into the coach with Adams, and drives to the farm. He throws himſelf at the feet of Fanny, who had run to the gate, followed by her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yes, this, ſaid he, is my adorable con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort, the wife of my heart, and I will never have any other.</p>
            <p>To Fanny every thing appeared like the illuſion of a dream; when lord Whatley addreſſed her with preſſing tenderneſs. Beautiful Fanny, it is your<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to confirm that conſent, which muſt be the joy of my life.</p>
            <p>She ſuffered him to take her hand, which he devoured with kiſſes. Whatley, at length, read his triumph in her ingenious aſpect. Fanny was ſilent; but her eyes ſpoke: Sometimes ſhe tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028632_0084_0FDA33BC6CCDC1D0"/>
them towards her father, as if ſhe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult him what anſwer ſhe was to make. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the worthy girl once more made the ſtrongeſt remonſtrances; their paſſionate lord ſtill found means to ſet them aſide; until after many conflicts, denials, tears and intreaties, it was at length determined that his lordſhip ſhould marry Fanny. He flies to his friends. Sir Thomas Ward had arrived ſome days before. My lord, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupper, when the ſervants were gone, and the glaſs went round, informs the company of his intention to marry Fanny. Sir Thomas receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the intelligence with indignation; and with a burſt of ſarcaſtic laughter, he drank to the health of lord Whatley, the ſon of farmer Adams.</p>
            <p>The poor lord underwent the ſevereſt raillery, the moſt humiliating ſarcaſms. He defended his intentions; he inſiſted on the charms, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the virtues of the farmer's daughter: But theſe remonſtrances were followed by more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting ſallies of ridicule; and the arguments ſtill ended in the peer diſhonored, diſgraced by ſuch an alliance. It would be needleſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that his lordſhip had great pride, and that this vice frequently triumphs over love and nature.</p>
            <p>Yet ſtill he died, if he poſſeſſed not Fanny. That was the anſwer to all the objections of his
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028632_0084_0FDA33BC6CCDC1D0"/>
friends, and to poſſeſs her without marriage was impoſſible. Should he employ any other means, he would break the hearts of a whole family that was dear to him: Fanny herſelf would look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as a monſter, and her love, without her eſteem, would not gratify his heart. In ſhort he could have no happineſs diſtinct from her's. Yet how was he to render this paſſion conſiſtent with what he owed to the dignity of his birth, to the world and to his friends?</p>
            <p>Sir Thomas, after declaiming profuſely on impracticable projects, cried, This ſcheme, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you will certainly approve. But do you really, my dear Whatley, long to poſſeſs your little Fanny?—I had rather have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of looking upon her, than make a conqueſt of all the beauties in London. And I tell you very ſeriouſly, that my life depends entirely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. Well, my friend, then I expect your thanks for an expedient which will at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile your honor, your pleaſure, and your rank; which will neither render you obnoxious to your uncle, to your own reflections, nor to the reproaches of the world. Depend upon me for the entire management of this affair. What is it you propoſe? ſaid Whatley: Let me know your ſcheme.—Do not you mean to marry Fanny? —Moſt certainly.—Well, hear then, and admire my ingenuity when I would ſerve my friends.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028632_0085_0FDA33C245F49CC8"/>
There is a clergyman in this neighborhood, who will oblige me in any thing; we ſhall alſo be able to find managable witneſſes. In ſhort, my friend, you ſhall be married, and yea ſhall not be married.</p>
            <p>What! cried Whatley, be a traitor to Fanny! and he roſe from his ſeat with indignation. My dear lord, one moment's leave; pray be ſeated. By this ſuppoſed marriage, you gratify your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without expoſing yourſelf to the juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your uncle. Your love will wear off with time, and when your enthuſiaſm ſhall be over, you may indemnify Fanny for this little deception by a proper ſettlement. This will be a ſufficient price for the virtue of a country girl. Deteſtable! Odious council! What! ſhould I, under the ſanction of ſuch an infamous artifice, tear a child from the boſom of her father! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray my Fanny! added he, unable to reſtrain the riſing tears. How can you have the cruelty to propoſe it?—I will marry her in the face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—in the face of the world. Let my marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age continue a ſecret until the proper time, but let it be honeſtly executed, with the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oaths.</p>
            <p>Without enlarging on the defence of Whatley, the attacks of his friends, and, above all, thoſe of the depraved baronet, who employed all his wit to draw this young lord into the moſt attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028632_0085_0FDA33C245F49CC8"/>
of crimes, be it ſufficient to obſerve, that their attempts were ſucceſsful.—The treacherous Ward was the principal agent in this horrid plot, and every thing was prepared for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended marriage. Whatley, ſtung by remorſe, was frequently on the brink of defeating this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal ſcheme. But W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Behold him in the raptures of thoſe pure, thoſe high-ſet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which alone ſhould be the fruits of unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated virtue, yet here they were the portion of guilt.</p>
            <p>Whatley, in the midſt of theſe charms, ſunk under the influence of a heart-felt poiſon. It is true, that he conſtantly confirmed himſelf in the deſign of eſtabliſhing thoſe nuptials, which fraud and impoſture had pretended. Fanny had never left her father's houſe; her huſband was the idol of her ſoul. She was that tender Eve, whom Milton has deſcribed, ſo gently ſubmiſſive to the pleaſure of Adam. Yet there were moments when her heart was a prey to ſadneſs, though the cauſe was unknown: Her parents too were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and felt the ſame unaccountable melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But what were the pangs of Whatley, when his eyes were fixed on that adorable creature, ſo touching, ſo ingenuous, ſo innocent in the very lap of pleaſure, and yet ſo wronged! When
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028632_0086_0FDA33C327F4CA50"/>
that angelic woman flew to meet him, with all the prodigality of chaſte embraces, conſcious of her injury, he would decline to meet her; would ſometimes ſhed tears. His crime roſe up againſt him. Perfidious Ward! he cried, perfidious Ward!</p>
            <p>This uncle ſent for him to town. Fanny muſt now be left, though now more than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and adored. The Baronet did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to go out of his ſight; he was afraid that his diſſimulation ſhould abandon him, and accompained him when he took his leave. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley vowed inviolable love to Fanny, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon to return to her boſom. The tender creature was with difficulty torn from the arms of her huſband. It was in thoſe trying moments that Whatley felt all the vengeance of injured truth and honor. He beheld Fanny bathing his feet with her tears. No, cried he, interrupted by the agitations of his heart, no, excellent creature, I am not worthy to poſſeſs you; ſuch charms, ſuch virtues deſerved a better fate.</p>
            <p>Ward at length carries him off, and ſteals him from thoſe reflections that weighed down his heart, and were ready to eſcape from his lips. Fanny fainted away in the boſom of her mother, when her eyes could no longer perceive her lord. He was now in the chaiſe with the Baronet, who
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028632_0086_0FDA33C327F4CA50"/>
exerted all his wicked art to ſtifle that remorſe which perſecuted and purſued him to London.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers and the learned deny the exiſtence of pre-ſentiments, and treat them as chimeras and abſurdities. I muſt take the liberty, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to differ from them, There is no man that honeſtly puts the queſtion to himſelf, but muſt own that there have been ſome critical circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in his life, wherein he has been warned, as it were by an inward voice, that ſeemed to foretel ſome approaching evil. This ſecret, and gloomy herald, came in all its horrors before the mind of Fanny; nor was the hour of repoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the ſame inward alarm, The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflections of the day were followed by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous dreams in the night.</p>
            <p>Whatley, arrived in town, is hurried by Sir Thomas round the circle of pleaſures. The baſe Baronet knew the human heart, and wanted not to be told that foibles lead to crimes. He drew his freind into thoſe companies, where the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſentiment is deſtroyed, and every ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day he thought of Fanny with leſs ſenſibility, and ſome feature of her image vaniſhed from his mind.</p>
            <p>Sir Thomas had communicated in confidence to lord Darnton, this adventure of his nephew; and it was in concert with this nobleman, that he
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028632_0087_0FDA33C509B638A8"/>
endeavoured to draw Whatley into that round of diſſipation, where the greater paſſions die away —for it is only with ſolitude and reflection that they can live.</p>
            <p>Whatley found leſs frequent opportunities to write to Fanny. He received her letters with leſs ardour. In one word, his love was abated. Not a day paſſed, but the fineſt girls in town, like ſo many Circes, ſought by their embraces to rob him of his tenderneſs and his virtue.</p>
            <p>Fanny's greateſt misfortune was the youth of Whatley: Who at his years, has the fortitude to call his heart to an account, or to rouze it from that unſentimental ſtate to which it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by diſſipation? True pleaſures are never enjoyed but by maturer years. Upon our firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into life, we are generally under ſuch an intoxication, as is no leſs deſtructive to pleaſure than to reaſon.</p>
            <p>Ward, among the reſt of his ſeductive arts, did not fail to cheriſh and encourage the vanity of his noble friend. By this he undoubtedly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a more mortal blow to the intereſt of poor Fanny, than any ſhe could ſuffer from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of rival beauty. When he thought himſelf tolerably ſure of the ſucceſs of his artifices, he acquainted lord Darnton with the diſpoſition to which he had brought his nephew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:028632_0087_0FDA33C509B638A8"/>Whatley had beheld, with ſome emotion, the growing beauties of Miſs Barry, the daughter of lord Ravenſtone. This impreſſion, ſo favourable to the deſigns of lord Darnton, was immediately communicated to him. He concerted with the father of that lady, the proper means of drawing Whatley into an attachment. The houſe of lord Ravenſtone was open to him; was the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at every viſit, appeared more charming. Sir Thomas, like Milton's devil, employed every artifice, and every temptation. He added new force to Miſs Barry's attractions. He ſpoke par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of her high birth, and of the dignity it would confer on the perſon who ſhould have the good fortune to marry her. In ſhort, lord Darnton, acquainted with the progreſs of his ſcheme, propoſes to his nephew to marry lord Ravenſtone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s daughter. Everything, added he, is already ſettled: You are beloved by the lady, and nothing is wanting but your conſent. I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf that you will not diſavow my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. She is one of the greateſt and moſt brilliant matches in England. Whatley changes countenance throws himſelf at the feet of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle declares with tears his ſituation; his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Fanny, and the neceſſity he was under of confirming them by a lawful marriage. Lord Darnton embraces and careſſes his nephew, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers him with a diſſembled kindneſs, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys every art to dazzel and overcome his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; but he remains inflexible. Rage and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028632_0088_0FDA33CA36696D98"/>
menaces ſucceed—he drives him from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the poor lord flies for refuge, into the boſom of the ſerpent, Ward: Who more inſinuating, more dangerous, conducts him back to his uncle. In ſhort, after many tumults, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conflicts Fanny is ſacrificed, and the weak, the guilty Whatley marries Miſs Barry. Were it allowable to paint the horrid crime in leſs hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous colours, one might ſay that he was in ſome meaſure, dragged to the alter; that, even in the arms of his new bride, he bewailed the wife of his heart—the wife whom heaven had deſtined and devoted to him; and that the image of Fanny was ever in his mind. The cruel lord Darnton took upon him to convey the fatal news to the daughter of Adams. He had promiſed his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to ſettle ſuch an income on her, as ſhould be, to uſe his own expreſſion, a ſufficient conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for her diſappointment.—The crafty uncle, however, was not ſatisfied with this triumph. He was ſtill afraid, that Fanny would recover her former influence; and therefore got Whatley nominated to one of the remoteſt foreign courts. Our young lord ſet off with his new-married lady, accompanied by Sir Thomas Ward, who never left him a moment to his own reflections, and who was always flattering him on his dignities and diſtinctions; the poor recompence of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed innocence and faithful love.</p>

               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:028632_0088_0FDA33CA36696D98"/>The anxieties, the painful penſiveneſs of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny encreaſed. Already ſome weeks were paſſed ſince ſhe had heard from Whatley. She could no longer reſiſt the moſt cruel ſuſpicions. In vain was ſhe comforted by her father and the reſt of the family. How could ſhe avoid being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at the ſilence of the man ſhe adored? She counted the days, the hours, and the minutes ſhe had to waſte in tears, until the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the lord's return ſhould arrive. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs arrives from lord Darnton, with a letter to Adams. The good old man received the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger with his uſual politeneſs, deſired him to ſet down, took the fatal paper, and read as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:—</p>

He was alone; his wife and his daughter came in and raiſed him. By the application of cordials he recovered his ſenſes; he ſaw his daughter, and was ſeized with a trembling. Ah, my deareſt child! Come, my poor Fanny, come into my arms. My dear father, what is the cauſe of this? Why this diſtreſs? Theſe tears? This agitation? My father! My child, we are undone, our fears were but too juſt. lord Darnton—Hah! What? —Is determined to diſannul your marriage, and has had the inhumanity to inſult you with the offer of money. My lord will not own you as his wife. Not as his wife! What then ſhould I be! Fanny was juſt able to pronounce theſe words before ſhe fainted away. She was carried to her chamber, where ſhe continued in a kind of ſtupefaction.</p>
            <p>Take back, ſaid the indigant old man to the meſſenger, take back his odious favours. I am a poor man, it is true; but my lord ſhall not rob me of my honor. It is my natural inheritance: I hold it from heaven, and no man on earth, ſhall ever deprive me of it. My lord may act the ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian to my children, and murder their father, but he ſhall never oblige us, to give up our rights, nor will we ever conſent to the diſſolution of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. I will drag my wretched age to the feet of lord Darnton. Let him throw me into priſon. I
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028632_0089_0FDA33CF2A1A0F98"/>
will take my trial. The rights of juſtice are above nobility; and an honeſt man, who has always behaved as a faithful ſervant to his lord, will not be injured with impunity. What is it you mean! interrupted the meſſenger, who could not forbear to weep with theſe honeſt people: On what are your complaints founded? The marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of lord Whatley will not be annulled. What marriage do you ſpeak of? Do you not know that lord Darnton's nephew is married to lord Ravenſtone's daughter? Married! My lord Whatley!—with any body but Fanny? Yes, and he is gone abroad. O Heavens! cried Adams, in the utmoſt agonies, and has he then made a jeſt of the moſt ſacred ties? Can my lord have any other wife but Fanny? I will go immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to London, I will have juſtice, or death; lord Darnton cannot refuſe it.</p>
            <p>He went into his daughter's chamber, who was juſt opening her eyes. Child, you do not know all your wrongs, not all the treachery of lord—He is married. Married! Yes, married to another woman. But take courage, we have yet honour and juſtice left us. I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to London, and at my return, expect better news. Can lord Darnton be ſuch a ſavage that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſoften him? My dear child (and he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to his heart) you ſhall find a father in me.</p>

               <pb n="172" facs="unknown:028632_0090_0FDA33D283E233A0"/>The ſituation of Fanny admits of no deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The departure of lord Whatley was more intolerable than all the reſt. Adams, after tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tender and ſorrowful leave of his wife and children, ſet off for London, accompanied by the meſſenger of lord Darnton.</p>
            <p>Lord Darnton's meſſenger entered his houſe, followed by the unfortunate old man. No ſooner did his lord ſee him, than he aſked him concerning the event of his meſſage. He gave him, for anſwer, the thouſand pound note. What! cried his lordſhip, had he the impudence to refuſe my favour? He is here, replied the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Let him come in, ſaid my lord, in wrath; I know how to treat people of his ſtamp. Adams entered, and threw himſelf at his lordſhip's feet. Yes, my lord, ſaid the unhappy father, with floods of tears, I refuſed the price of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, becauſe my honour is not to be purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I am ſenſible that I am a dependent of your family, and that reſpect and ſubmiſſion are my duty. I did every thing in my power to prevent my lord, your nephew, from ſo diſproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a match; but he would not liſten to me: He was determined to poſſeſs my daughter, but he previouſly married her. Our fate is in your hands, my lord, but the knot has been tied in the face of heaven, and it is heaven alone that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it. Our only misfortune is my humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and my poverty: My family has over
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028632_0090_0FDA33D283E233A0"/>
been irreproachable.—Would you, my lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive a father, a mother, and a daughter of their lives—poor unhappy people—that eſteem their honeſty their greateſt bleſſing?—Let me embrace your knees; and look upon a miſerable father, that appeals to your humanity and your juſtice. To do you juſtice, replied his lordſhip, I ſhould drive you this moment out of my houſe. How could you have the impudence to refuſe my favour? Though you had an hundred daughters, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent old man, a thouſand pounds would be too great a price for them. Hear me—do not abuſe my kindneſs—take back the bill—go; and do not think of ſeeing me any more.</p>
            <p>No, ſaid the couragious Adams, with that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indignation which raiſes the ſpirit above all rank, I will not go. I only aſk for juſtice, my lord, and I will have it. You ſhall either this moment run me through the body, or I will have recourſe to every court of juſtice in London. I will petition his majeſty: I will lay before him my grievances, my diſtreſſes, and my rights. I am, proceeded, the honeſt man, with all the eloquence of anguiſh, I am a poor farmer; but, my lord, I am a father, and an injured father. My comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laints will be heard—they will be echoed from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very heart—and the world will pronounce between us. I have reaſon and juſtice on my ſide. My grief diſtracts me, my lord!—No—I never can
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028632_0091_0FDA33D31468F9C0"/>
think that lord Whatley has formed any other connections—This is only a pretence to try my integrity. Ah! my lord! once more behold at your feet an unhappy father, who will never quit this poſture until he moves your compaſſion. You cannot be capable of an action ſo unworthy of your rank. Come, ſaid lord Darnton, I will give you two thouſand pounds, and let me hear no more of you or your daughter. My lord, you will not hear me: Your ſecond propoſal, I preſume to ſay, is a freſh attack on my life, and honour. You ſhall take that life, my lord; you ſhall embrue your hands in my blood; I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more to my daughter. Inſolent man! Do you threaten me?—I will die, or obtain your conſent to a marriage that will not diſcredit you.—Fanny was a girl of virtue. My lord, expect the utmoſt from my diſtraction; it is very dreadful. Do you threaten me, you audacious earth-worm? Know the inſignificancy of your pretenſions. I perceive on what your obſtinacy and your haughtineſs are founded: You imagine that your daughter was legally married to my fooliſh nephew. I would have owed to your compliance and your duty, what I ſhall obtain by law. Know then, that your claims are a jeſt; that your daughter has been the inſtrument of Whatley's pleaſures; in ſhort, that the marriage you have the preſumption to inſiſt on, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a ſtratagem. What! My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028632_0091_0FDA33D31468F9C0"/>
not married to lord Whatley!—She never was; ſhe has only been his miſtreſs, my friend; and I think in that inſtance, his lordſhip (my nephew) did you no little honour.</p>
            <p>A thunderſtroke could not have ſmitten poor Adams more violently. He fell ſenſeleſs to the ground. Lord Darnton went out of the room, and coldly ordered his people to take the poor man to the air until he ſhould come to himſelf, and then to pay him two thouſand pounds. There was a ſcene that might have moved the heart of a ſavage. The poor old man lay extended on the floor, his grey hairs ſoiled with duſt and tears —He hardly breathed, and the paleneſs of death was on his countenance. A ſervant, who had more humanity than his maſter, was moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the unfortunate man; he took him by the arm, and endeavoured to recover him. Adams opened his eyes, and with a bitter excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, threw himſelf again on the floor, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, They have deceived my daughter—ſhe is not married. O my God! my God!—He roſe haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was going to ſeek lord Darnton, but his ſtrength failed him; he was obliged to ſet down, and could do nothing but vent his anguiſh in a torrent of tears. The compaſſionate domeſtic endeavoured to comfort him; he exhorted him to be reconciled to his misfortunes—repreſented the quality and power of lord Darnton, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, with relating to him all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028632_0092_0FDA33D3A6126620"/>
of Whatley's pretended marriage with Fanny, Adams in diſtraction, tore his hair, and talked of ſtabbing lord Darnton. The ſteward brought him two thouſand pounds ready told. Adams daſhed them from him with all the rage of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt indignation.—Wretch let your maſter keep his infamous wealth! Go, he has already inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my grey hairs—I ſee that I have no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, nor other avenger than my God—I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his aſſiſtance; and he will puniſh the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains that have deceived my child, my poor Fanny. Ah! my friend, continued he, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the charitable domeſtic that took him by the hand, and would have ſoothed him if you knew what a woman they have injured!— Ah! my poor children! How ſhall I bear to tell you this dreadful ſtory! I find I ſhall die in this place —Here my body ſhall lie, and call down the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance. The Supreme Juſtice can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the meaneſt of his creatures, and He will not refuſe his ſuccour.</p>
            <p>The ſervant by degrees, brought him to a ſenſe of his ſituation; told him that every extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, even death itſelf, would be vain; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him the authority of the great, who always trample on the rights of the poor with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. At length he drew him to a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from lord Darnton's houſe, and conveyed him to the lodgings of his wife. She received the unhappy Adams with that humanity peculiar
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028632_0092_0FDA33D3A6126620"/>
to thoſe whom the inſolence of grandeur and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has denominated the meaner-ſort of people; a humanity which is certainly preferable to the ſuperficial and heartleſs politeneſs of the ſplendid and the gay.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of Adams is not to be deſcribed: His general exclamations were, My poor daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Child of my heart! How have they diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thee?—Thee, to whom honour was more precious than life!—Ah! why did not the traitor Whatley rather ſacrifice you in the boſom of your father? Then the poor man would weep, as if his ſoul would waſte itſelf in tears.</p>
            <p>The generous domeſtic, ſtill more moved at his ſufferings, pretends ſickneſs, that he might continue with Adams, who had the ſpirit to write a letter to lord Darnton, filled (to uſe an expreſſion of Satius) with all the majeſty of grief. It will be no way ſurpriſing to hear a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer talk in this ſtrain, when it is remembered, that Adams had a liberal education. Beſides, a virtuous mind calls forth its powers, is elevated and exalted, acquires a kind of conſcious digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſuperiority in thoſe circumſtances which ſtrongly affect its intereſts. It is obſervable that men have acted prodigies of valour, firmneſs, and eloquence, when they were excited by the great emotions of nature, the only ſource of ſhining deeds, and diſtinguiſhed talents, The

Your execrable nephew—I have already ſummoned him to the tribunal of God; that tribunal which is not to be corrupted—He will give us vengeance. You will one day ſuffer remorſe for your abominable crime, but it will be too late; your wretched victims will be in the grave, and from that grave their voices ſhall pierce the ſky. You have diſgraced my old age—You have ſunk, under a load of infamy, a man, a whole family, that ſerved, loved you and grew under the ſhadow of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection—You have trod upon weakneſs and innocence.

to bathe with our tears, ſome other place, to give up our torn hearts to miſery and anguiſh, and there loſe our laſt ſighs. May this letter urge to your heart, every painful arrow you have ſunk in mine! A man reduced to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as I am, is above all fear—Diſpatch us quickly, for that is the crime you will add to thoſe you have already committed.—It will undoubtedly be leſs horrible, and it is all that Adams is willing to owe you.</q>

Adams claſped her to his breaſt—He would have ſpoke—Fanny ſaw his diſtreſs, and therein read her fate. I am not lord Whatley's wife: I have nothing to do but to die. They ſat down.— Adams, as well as his anguiſh would give him leave, related to them the barbarous manner in which he had been received by lord Darnton. When he came to the horrid treachery of What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; to the pretended marriage—Hah! cried Fanny, am I then deceived? Am I not his wife? —Scarce had ſhe pronounced theſe laſt words, when ſhe fell to the ground, as if ſhe had been ſmitten with a thunder-ſtroke. Lord Darnton's domeſtic was extremely affected at this ſhocking ſcene—Fanny was conveyed to her bed, which ſhe had not left but to drag herſelf to meet her father. Adams ceaſed not to embrace and weep over her—At length ſhe recovered her ſenſes— But is it, ſaid ſhe, lord Whatley, who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, betrayed, me?—Ought I to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſuch a blow? As ſoon as the unfortunate woman aroſe, ſo to expreſs it, out of the arms of death, ſhe ſeemed to be animated with ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſtrength; ſhe ſeemed, by ſome miracle to have obtained another heart. She raiſed herſelf upon her arm. Her features, that had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by languor, began to be animated. She ſeemed to command her tears to ceaſe—Come, my father, ſaid the majeſtic beauty, let us forget even the name of that villain who meant to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor me. My honor is ſtill the property of my
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028632_0094_0FDA33DDAF436D20"/>
heart—It is he—it is the execrable traitor, who has forfeited his own. He has abuſed the moſt ſacred ties—he has deceived me—He has not robbed me of the innocence of my ſoul. Can I be criminal in your eyes—in the eyes of God?— Since I have nothing now to hope for in life, how eaſy were it for me to die?—But I will live for your conſolation, your ſupport. You and my mother ſhall be the world to me. Let us fly from this deteſted farm; this ſcene of guilt and horror!—Let us go, where Lord Whatley, where even, his idea, ſhall not follow me, (and at theſe words ſhe wept.) Let not even his name be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced among us!—We will—we will forget him—I will tear him from my heart. My ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der father—I am willing to ſubmit to the moſt toilſome labors, the moſt humble employments— to any thing, provided you will be careful of your life—provided you will love your Fanny— who is not a guilty creature.—At theſe words her fortitude gave way to a freſh flood of tears. At length the unhappy family leaves the fatal place—But Fanny forſakes it not without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turning her eyes towards it—without ſome regretful looks—She ſeemed to leave in that place, the moſt ſenſible part of her faculties, the moſt lively principle of her ſoul. Under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of that aſſumed fortitude, love had not loſt its force. That Fanny, ſo magnanimous, poſſibly wept the more in ſecret. Virtuous minds
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028632_0095_0FDA33DF1D06A618"/>
are always moſt ſuſceptible of great paſſions. Thoſe unfortunate people went to the houſe of the miniſter, their relation, who had ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the education of Fanny. The domeſtic who had accompanied Adams from London, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither; but diſdaining to ſerve a man of lord Darnton's principles, he deſired his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>Lord Whatley, though married to a charming woman, in the boſom of pleaſures and honors, and ſurrounded with the pomp of dignity, was far from taſting any true happineſs. His lady had all the airs of a woman of quality; behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a diguſting coldneſs to her huſband, and countenancing the attention of others, in the genuine ſpirit of coquetry—ſhe was handſome, vain, and haughty: Yet that haughtineſs was not ſo ſevere, as to ſwerve her from many ſcandalous adventures, the report of which came to the ears of her Lord. He would have urged his affection, but was not heard: He threatened her with the authority of an injured huſband, but his threats were anſwered by the moſt glaring indecorums. The daughter of Lord Ravenſtone was ſupported by a great name, and a powerful intereſt at court. Whatley was therefore obliged to put up with his affronts—The conduct of his lady, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times brought to his remembrance, his poor Fanny, who loved, who adored him, and whom he had diſhonored at the expence of the pureſt
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028632_0095_0FDA33DF1D06A618"/>
and tendereſt love. But this image that aroſe in his mind was ſoon deſtroyed by the induſtry of the baronet. He hurried him round a circle of continual diſſipation—He plunged him into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry debauchery of heart and mind, and while he was repelling the remembrance of Fanny, he was extinguiſhing, by the ſame means, the natural ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of honor and virtue.</p>
            <p>Some years paſſed, while Whatley continued in his death of reaſon, and honeſt ſenſibility. He returned to London with his wife, who did not fail to torment him with the moſt cruel chagrins. She diſhonored him by her continual intrigues, embroiled him with her relations, and rendered him contemptible in the eyes of the court. Yet in theſe mortifying circumſtances, he had one conſolation. His lady died, leaving him debts, enemies, inſult and ſhame. It was then that Whatley gave himſelf up to the moſt boundleſs diſſipation: There was not a noted ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in London where he was not the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hero of libertiniſm, and Sir Thomas Ward partook of his reputation. They went, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, with ſome other friends, to Brown's cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe—The converſation of the company turned on the ſubject of honor, a ſubject ſo trite, and yet ſo new—But why gentlemen, do you make this your ſubject, ſaid a perſon who was a ſtranger to them, but whoſe years, and ſimplicity of appearance rendered him reſpectable; why do
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028632_0096_0FD9BB4542C71328"/>
you not talk of matters with which you are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted?—Of horſe-races and faſhions?— What do you mean, interrupted Whatley, briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?—That you are a very unfit perſon to diſcuſs the ſubject of honor—How! know I not what honor is?—You!—there are a very few people that know what it is—Inſolent! I am not inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent—I only ſpeak the truth—Immediately ſome perſon enquires for this ſingular man, and draws him out of the coffee-houſe, the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany remained in aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, cried Lord Whatley, you may be very ſure I know what I ought to do on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and I ſhall ſoon convince you whether I have a right to be called a man of honour. He went out along with Ward, who heightened his reſentment. The next day, early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tley goes to the the houſe where this man had an ordinary lodging. He knocks at the door.—The ſtranger, who had no ſervant, opened it, ſaying, my Lord, I did not expect you ſo ſoon. By your leave, I will go to bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain—Expect me! Then, did you expect me?— Certainly—I am glad to find you did me that juſtice; but, in the firſt place, Sir, who are you? Who am I? a man—What is your title?—My heart, and the love of truth. Do you know who I am?—They call you a Lord, and I ſuppoſe you are one, for you reſemble the reſt of that frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity—But neither you, nor they, I repeat it,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028632_0096_0FD9BB4542C71328"/>
have any right to talk of honour—You inſult me and I expect ſatisfaction; whoever you may be, you ſhall take your chance with me—You think, then, you have a right to take away my life, or to ſacrifice your own—Imprudent young man!— What familiar inſolence!—Do you imagine that I owe you reſpect?—I will convince you of it— What, by running me through the body?—You ſuppoſe that fortune will favour you—If, in fact, it ſhould, and if I ſhould have time to expreſs my ſentiments, do not look for reſpect, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contempt, perhaps pity—Contempt!—Your pity! Get out of bed, friend, this moment; and let this diſpute be quickly ended, on the one ſide or the other. How audaciouſly this impudent fellow treats me! I am not impudent, and I ſhall get up immediately. The ſtranger riſes, and dreſſes himſelf with great tranquility, while Lord Whatley walked backwards and forwards in the chamber, in the utmoſt agitation. Come, ſays he, let us go behind Hyde-Park, and there I ſhall make you know what it is to offend a man of my rank—A man of your rank ought to ſupport his ſuperiority by probity and virtue; without thoſe diſtinctions, he is on a level with the loweſt Plebian—What do I ſay?—He is not comparable to the latter, if he acts his humble part honeſtly. Whatley ſtormed with anger. Scarce were they arrived on the ſpot, when his Lordſhip drew, and called upon his antagoniſt to
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028632_0097_0FDA33F8037F10B8"/>
do the ſame. One word by your leave. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will that I fight. This acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may appear ſingular; you may deem me a coward, a po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame, you will do me juſtice. Duelling is an infamous thing; it is contrary to all laws, both divine and human, and is nothing elſe but aſſination. But I ſhall comply with your deſire, and, as you are determined to have it ſo, ſhall do myſelf the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to cut a throat with you. I have only one thing to deſire. What is that? I have offended you by ſaying that you had no knowledge of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Before we fight, do me the favour to tell me what you mean by the word honour, and try to do it calmly. I believe this man is mad No I am not mad. What is that honour? Tell me what idea you have formed of it?</p>
            <p>Lord Whatley made uſe of all thoſe defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are ſo well known, and ſo ill-founded. Have you done, my Lord?—Yes. You ſeem to be very little acquainted with your ſubject, and perhaps you have forgot the principal parts of it. Does honor conſiſt in keeping one's word?—Without diſpute; and the weaker, and more defenceleſs the perſon is to whom that word is given, the more ſacred a man of honor ſhould hold his faith. Is it not, in ſhort, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ankeſt, the moſt degrading vileneſs to break it, I to betray in ſuch an inſtance, and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028632_0097_0FDA33F8037F10B8"/>
to ſnatch by treachery the rewards of truth? Would you, my Lord, make a purchaſe with falſe or forged bills?—At theſe words Whatley ſtormed with indignation.—Forged bills! But you, my Lord, have been guilty of an action a thouſand times more baſe.—Draw, Sir! Hear me, and as ſoon as I have explained myſelf we will fight.—Though I had a thouſand lives, and ſhould loſe them all by your hand, you would not be leſs culpable. Would you not forge a bill? Barbarous man! What did you then, when you impoſed on innocence, love, and truth; When yielding to the dictates of your vile ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accomplices, under pretext of the moſt ſacred and ſolemn oaths, you diſhonored an unhappy creature, who received you into the arms of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, under the ſanction of the altar?—What did you, when tearing in pieces the pureſt and tendereſt heart? Your conduct was followed by death and ruin: When you brought an aged father to the grave with ſhame? Thoſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people, that were honored with the name of your dependents; who conſidered the boſom of their Lord as their aſylum; whom you ought to have protected: And was it you that ſacrificed them? You underſtand me: True love and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence betrayed; your heart, yes, your heart it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, my Lord, if you dare look into it, all theſe will raiſe againſt you. You ſeem diſturbed. Ah! ſaid Lord Whatley, and a tear roſe in his eye; too true! I have acted diſhonorably; and
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028632_0098_0FDA33E24B3BA410"/>
this is what honor calls upon me to do. Upon this he threw down his ſword. Embrace me, generous ſtranger: You open my eyes; you touch my heart; you bring me to myſelf: Then ſaying into his arms—Ah! tell me, tell me, ſaid he, what is become of Fanny? Yes, I am indeed a wretch; the vileſt of criminals. This, my Lord, is honor; it returns to your heart; and I acknowledge the man. Fanny and her family live in bitterneſs and miſery: They have taken refuge with a relation, who ſupports them in their deplorable circumſtances; and the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Fanny ſtill loves you. Loves me, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Whatley, with tears; ſtill loves me!— Ah! Sir, let me ſee her; let me throw myſelf at her feet: Will you have the goodneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me?</p>
            <p>Ward, who had followed his friend at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, runs up to him, and finds him in tears. Come on, Sir, ſaid Whatley; behold the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of ſentiment!—Yes, I acknowledge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf culpable; and this gentlemen had a right to tell me that I could not with propriety talk of honor; he has opened my eyes, my friend, and I fly to repair the injury I have done. Whatley explained the circumſtances of this adventure. Ward was outrageous, reproached him with mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, and draws upon the very perſon who had brought him back to virtue. The ſtranger trie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by the ſtrongeſt remonſtrances, to evade fighting with the enraged Baronet; but at
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028632_0098_0FDA33E24B3BA410"/>
laſt, being conſtrained to it, cries, it was you, wretched Ward, who corrupted the virtuous Whatley. You oblige me to the crime either of ſacrificing your life, or my own. Neither my words, nor my tears, (for I bluſh not to weep) have any effect upon you. Take then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, or may my death ſoften your rigid heart, and bring you to repentence. Whatley would have parted them, but Ward would not hear him.</p>
            <p>They fight: The ſtranger diſarms him, and gives him back his ſword, ſaying, Live, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the privilege of repentance. Whatley now made new efforts to appeaſe his friend: But he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell with greater fury on his generous adverſary, and at laſt received a mortal thruſt that laid him on the ground. The ſtranger immediately took him by the arm, aſſiſted by Whatley, who ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed his friend with tears. The conqueror gave himſelf up to the moſt piercing grief. O heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! ſaid he, with groans, that I ſhould be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch a crime! That I ſhould ſhed human blood; the blood of a fellow creature! Ah! my Lord, continued he to Whatley, I partake in your diſtreſs: Sir Thomas Ward has involved me in this guilt; I ought rather to have let him run me thro' the heart: I never ſhall ſurvive this accident. Whatley's ſervants came and took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the body of Ward, while his lordſhip and the ſtranger returned to town in the carriage,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028632_0099_0FDA33E3711EAD30"/>
ſtruck with the deepeſt concern and melancholy. The people in the neighborhood, who had been preſent at the combat, all depoſed in favor of the conqueror.—Whatley having recovered from his firſt emotions of grief, diſcovered at length that the perſon who had killed the Baronet, was an officer of birth, and diſtinguiſhed for his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and his bravery. He had retired from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and lived like a true philoſopher; that is, like a man who had the ſupport of honor and virtue at heart. He employed the greateſt part of his fortune in the relief of indigence: He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided ſplendor, and lived under the productive and pleaſing ſhade of his own integrity. His name was Windham. Whatley flew to his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whom he no ſooner perceived, than he cried, Ah! my Lord, I ſhall ſoon follow my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy victim to the grave. I cannot bear to think of this event; to think that I have depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man of his life! I ought to have evaded a circumſtance ſo horrible. Fatal prejudice! How long ſhall it triumph over reaſon! Is it thus a a man ſerves his country?—How nearly doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuch virtue border on a crime!</p>
            <p>This worthy man was pierced with grief and melancholy; nevertheleſs, he recovers the health that he apprehended he ſhould no longer enjoy. Whatley, while he bewailed the fate of his friend, was obliged to own that he alone had been to blame, and that he had obliged Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028632_0099_0FDA33E3711EAD30"/>
to come to extremities. He was no leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to acknowledge that the Baronet had been the cauſe of all his irregularities; that he had led him into that ſhameful treachery, the diſgrace of his life: In one word that he had been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all Fanny's ſufferings. Theſe reflexions rendered the memory of Sir Thomas leſs dear to his friend.</p>
            <p>Windham informed his lordſhip of the cruel behavior of Lord Darnton, with regard to the unfortunate Adams. What a deſcription for Whatley! His ſoul had recovered all its honeſty, all its ſenſibility. Windham was a kind of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior being, who reſcued him from that gulph of depravity into which Ward had plunged him; and Whatley wiſhed for nothing but the moment that ſhould reſtore him to his Fanny, the only wife of his heart.</p>
            <p>Windham related ſuch circumſtances as ſtill heightened his impatience to ſee her. That worthy man, in travelling over the different counties of England, had been led by accident to the houſe of that clergyman with whom Fanny and her family had taken refuge. It was from them he learnt their misfortunes, and the perfid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious behavior of Lord Whatley. Windham, with pleaſure indulged his impatience; and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ook their way to the village where the clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="unknown:028632_0100_0FDA33EA255E19E0"/>Whatley already felt the happineſs of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his injuries, and at length they arrived: But what a thunder-ſtroke to the penitent Lord! They found the clergyman dead; and the place where Adams and his family had retired was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. It was only obſerved, that wherever their were, they muſt be very miſerable.—This, cried Lord Whatley, is what I have done. I am the cauſe why theſe unfortunate people, perhaps, are now no more. It is I who have murdered the moſt adorable of woman. Let us go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my generous friend! Here I will die: Here, where my Fanny has wept and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. No, angelic creature! you never could love me after ſuch enormities; my conduct is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable even in my own eyes. Let us go, my Lord, ſaid Windham, let us not idly give up our ſearches here. Why ſhould we diſtruſt the goodneſs of heaven? It is that which has opened your eyes. Let us believe that we are under the conduct of Providence, and that your Fanny will be reſtored to your arms, that you you may make reſtitution for all the injuries you have done to her and her relations. Virtue has its rewards ſometimes even in this world. Thus he encouraged the deſpairing Whatley: They pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued their journey, and made the moſt dilligent enquiries.</p>
            <p>Windham himſelf at length begun to deſpair of ſucceſs, and the unhappy Lord was in the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028632_0100_0FDA33EA255E19E0"/>
greateſt diſtreſs. They were on horſe-back, and unattended, when they met a Baronet of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's acquaintance; he ſtopped a little to talk with him, and Whatley rode forward.</p>
            <p>A child was weeping very bitterly at a little diſtance from the road. The poor innocent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be about ſix or ſeven years of age. It had an air of delicacy which was touching, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſadvantages of a poor dreſs. Its tears, its native comelineſs, greatly moved his lordſhip. He looked upon the child with pity, and could not draw his eyes from it. What makes you weep, my little dear, ſaid he? My poor mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma! ſhe told me ſhe ſhould die ſoon, and ſhe wept when ſhe kiſſed me.—Mamma is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy—We have nothing to live upon—Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma cries, and grand-papa is ſick in bed. Thus the child, with mingled tears and ſighs, uttered its little complaints. Poor child! but your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my dear—Oh! Sir, I never ſaw my papa: It is my papa that makes us all unhappy: Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma often talks of him: She ſays ſhe loves him, and ſhall love him as long as he lives: Though to be ſure he has given us a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. She makes me pray to God for him every day. Poor papa is in a very bad way, added the child, weeping as if its little heart would break.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:028632_0101_0FDA33EEB2B5D790"/>Lord Whatley was affected, and alighting from his horſe, run towards the child, who did not ſeek to ſhun him, but ſtretched out its arms to embrace him. Embrace, my little angel! you are a ſweet child—And what are your parents? They work the field—Your mother too?—She is always the firſt that goes to work, Sir, though ſhe has not much ſtrength—She takes care of my grand-papa—I wiſh I were rich that I could help my poor mamma, ſhe is ſo very good—And where do you live, my dear child?—Below there, Sir! Shewing him a wretched cottage. Will you go with me to your dear mamma? Oh! ſhe would chide me, Sir! My mamma ſees nobody. Fear not, ſaid his lordſhip, ſtill embracing the child, I will make your excuſe. The child he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated, looked at him, and gave him its hand— He took it into one of his, and with the other held his horſe's bridle. Windham followed him at a diſtance. He went along with the child, who conducted him to a poor hut covered with thatch, and ſurrounded by a miſerable hedge. A few paces from the cottage he ſaw a woman ſitting upon the ſide of a ditch, with a matlock in her hand, and ſeemingly oppreſſed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and melancholy. The child goes up to her: Pray, mamma, do not chide me for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this gentleman, who wanted to ſee you. She looked up. Whatley fell at her feet: My dear Fanny. My Lord Whatley! She fainted away. Her child threw itſelf into her arms.
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028632_0101_0FDA33EEB2B5D790"/>
And at the ſame moment Windham came up. Whatley firſt recovered. My dear Fanny! Is it you! O my friend! I have found the miſtreſs of my heart. My excellent, my only love, ſee me at your feet! Lift up your eyes! Behold your lover! your huſband—who repents from his ſoul! My dear Fanny to what a condition have I reduced you!</p>
            <p>Whatley was proſtrate at her feet, which he preſſed to his lips and bathed with his tears. Fanny recovers from her ſwoon, and falling into his boſom, is it you, ſaid ſhe, my Lord Whatley?—Yes, my adorable love, it is your huſband, who, repenting of all his follies and vices, returns to virtue and your embraces, and to that tenderneſs which now poſſeſſes his ſoul, and makes him die to repair your injuries! —My Lord! have you embraced your child, ſaid Fanny, tenderly—Go, my dear, and embraces your father—My child! O God! My child!— This perfectly overcome him—He carreſſed Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and her child by turns, and preſſed them to his boſom. Yes, my Lord, continued Fanny, it is your child—the fruit of our unhappy love—I have brought him up to love you, that when he ſurvived me, he might tell you of his unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mother; for had you come a few days later, you would not have ſeen me here—I ſhould have left a letter in his hands, and might have flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf—Her ſwelling boſom would not give
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028632_0102_0FDA33F027DC8760"/>
her utterence, and Whatley took her again into his arms—Ah! tell me not of my crimes! I am ſeverely puniſhed for them—I feel it at my ſoul —But oh! could I then reduce to ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt valuable of women? My deareſt life—May I, by every inſtance of love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, prevail on you to forget my barbarity, my treachery—My undeſerved treachery?—Then he ſpoke, and wept upon her hand as he preſſed it to his mouth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not pretend to excuſe myſelf by telling you that Ward led me into this ſcene of villainy. I would appear to you a criminal, as I really am, that I may owe every thing to your generoſity and your tenderneſs. Forgive me, forgive the man who ſhall eſteem it an honor to bear the name of your huſband, and that of a father to this amiable child (preſſing it again to his heart) —But where is your father?—My father?—May I ſee him?—He is in bed, anſwered Fanny, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring with ſickneſs and ſorrow; for ſorrow has preyed upon him more than want—Want! ſaid Whatley, O God—My heart will break. Ah! worthy Windham! What a wretch have I been —Yes, my poor Fanny, it is I who have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you to theſe extremities—And—What is that I ſee?—The bread we live upon—The bread that is earned by our toil, and ſteeped in our tears—It was a coarſe brown loaf. Whatley could ſcarcely ſupport himſelf at the ſight—He
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028632_0102_0FDA33F027DC8760"/>
raiſed his hands to heaven, and in broken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents cried, What, my dear, my virtuous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was this your food—While I—O, my God! My God!—I ſhall die—I cannot ſurvive theſe horrid thoughts—Ah, my Lord! What charms in this repentance for your Fanny! Live that ſhe may yet adore you—ſhe never ceaſed to love you (embracing him) could ſhe hate you?—Yes, you ſhall be my wife, my ſovereign miſtreſs. London has been witneſs to my irregularities—It ſhall behold my reformation; I can never make my acknowledgments to you ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed —Yes, you ſhall be the wife of my heart—Come, let me throw myſelf at the feet of my worthy father.</p>
            <p>Fanny deſired him to wait until ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with his arrival. She feared that the ſudden ſight of her Lord might be fatal to the languiſhing old man. She did not know how to teſtify her gratitude to Windham. Lord Whatley had told her, in a few words, all that the worthy man had done to bring him back to a ſenſe of truth and honor. Fanny flew to her father—My dear father, ſaid ſhe, take comfort— I have good news to tell you—My Lord What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley is come—He acknowledges his faults—And will he own you for his wife? Shall I have that conſolation before I die?—Yes, worthy Adams, cried his Lordſhip, running to embrace the old
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028632_0103_0FD9BB443209B528"/>
man, you ſee your daughter's huſband, your ſon who comes to bewail his faults in your boſom, and would give his life to repair them. Adams, overcome with ſurprize and joy, could only ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—Ah, my Lord!—The tears flowed from his eyes; he would have got up, and attempted at ſome expreſſions of reſpect—Lie ſtill my father, ſaid Whatley, it is my duty to do you honour and reſpect:—I have injured you; I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed my faith, and virtue, and Fanny—I am ready to make ſatisfaction for every thing—I humbly aſk pardon of you, of your dear daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of humanity itſelf, which I have wounded, through the heart of the worthy Adams. Yes, you ſhall be my father, and your daughter ſhall be my wife, the only miſtreſs of my ſoul. He then enquired of Fanny concerning her mother— Alas! replied the old man, ſhe is no more!— She adored her daughter. Ah! I underſtand you—This is my doing—Wretched and guilty Whatley, how ſhalt thou expiate thy crimes?— Ah, my father! Ah, my Fanny!</p>
            <p>Situations like theſe, admit of no adequate deſcription; but the heart may feel, and the mind may conceive what the pen can never paint.</p>
            <p>Our poor cottagers went to dinner: How did their extreme indigence then pierce the ſoul of Whatley! Scarce had they a ſufficiency of that
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028632_0103_0FD9BB443209B528"/>
coarſe bread, the very ſight of which, ſtruck him with horror—The dying Adams was another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that might have ſmitten the heart of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity itſelf—Every thing that appeared in this manſion of miſery was a dagger in the breaſt of this penitent Lord. But when his looks were fixed on that woman whom he adored; when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ead in her pale countenance the cruel impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of pain and poverty, and ſaw thoſe arms that were locked in his with ſo much tenderneſs, faded and emaciated, he was torn with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, thoſe torments of the ſoul, which are ten thouſand times more acute than any external tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Every inſtant he cried, with tears that bled from the heart—My virtuous Fanny! To what miſery have I reduced you!—And is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that you can ſtill love me?—Fanny, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, anſwered, Yes, my Lord!—You were always dear to me; and you ſhould have pierced me to the heart, if you would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to kiſs your hand.</p>
            <p>If there is a ſcene in this world that can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the eye of the Supreme Being, it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, that of ſincere repentance, of pure and honeſt love, the triumph of ſentiment and reaſon.</p>
            <p>Lord Whatley learned that Fanny's two ſiſters had not long ſurvived their mother: That her brothers, obliged by their misfortunes to leave
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028632_0104_0FDA33FC2596B9F8"/>
their fathers houſe, were in the ſervice of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; that ſhe and her father, after the death of the clergyman, their relation, being reduced to extreme indigence, tilled, with their own hands a piece of ground, where they had built a kind of ſhed to live in, and that this had been ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient for the ſupport of their miſerable lives. Fanny loved her Lord too much to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him with a detail of ſuch circumſtances: He learnt them from Windham.</p>
            <p>Whatley removed Adams to his own ſeat, where the old man ſoon recovered his health. A very elegant apartment was prepared for Fanny, who, a few days after their arrival, dreſſed in a magnificent ſuit, was married to her Lord. It is needleſs to add, that Windham was one of the principal aſſiſtants on this feſtive occaſion. Lord Whatley agreeably ſurprized Adams, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him his two ſons, dreſſed in a manner becoming their change of fortune. I was willing, my dear father, ſaid he, to make all our family happy. The brothers of Fanny ought to be mine, and it is my intention that they ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of my happineſs.</p>
            <p>In the evening, when Whatley had diſmiſſed his attendants, he threw himſelf at the feet of lady W—, and, at laſt, ſaid he, my excellent Fanny, you will embrace an huſband, whoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudy will be to make you forget your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028632_0104_0FDA33FC2596B9F8"/>
Will you pardon me all the injuries, all the wrongs I have done you! My dear, my ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wife! your misfortunes have not robbed you of your beauty; it will bloom afreſh when cheriſhed by my kiſſes, and watered by my tears, I ſee the effect of my own conduct, and you are more dear to me: You have been my victim, you ſhall be my ſovereign, be all that is dear to me, with the lovely child that pleads for its father's pardon. Let it not plead in vain, my dear Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny! She could only anſwer with tears of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the ſtrong, though inarticulate expreſſions of the ſoul, and overpowered by the intoxicating tenderneſs, ſhe ſunk into his arms. O charm inexpreſſible of pure and tender attachments! Pleaſures of love! What are you without thoſe of virtue.</p>
            <p>Windham was about to take leave of Whatley. What! Sir, ſaid his lordſhip, will you refuſe to reap the fruits of your labor? And what ſcenes can you find more intereſting than theſe? You have united two hearts, my dear friend, that know how to be grateful for the favors you have done them. Enjoy the pleaſure of beholding the effects of your kindneſs. You have reſtored me to virtue, to Fanny, and to happineſs; but can that happineſs be perfect, if you add not the pleaſures of friendſhip to thoſe of love! Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028632_0105_0FDA3404CCA72A90"/>
embraced his friend with thoſe tears that ſpring from the heart. Well, my dear children, I accept your offer: It will be ſome conſolation to my old age to find that there are yet on earth, ſenſible and virtuous ſouls. They removed to London, where Fanny proved herſelf the moſt charming and amiable of women. She was a model for thoſe who had long ſhone in the circle of diſtinguiſhed life, and ſhewed by her beauty and her deportment, that the virtues and the graces are the natives of villages, rather than of cities. She went yearly to viſit that poor cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage where Whatley and Windham had found her. There ſhe ſeemed to find her virtues ſtrengthened, her principles improved. Scenes of poverty call us back to that modeſty, and that ſubdued frame of mind, which are the beſt ſupport of virtue.</p>
            <p>Whatley deſpiſed, doſhonoured, chagrined by his marriage with Lord Ravenſtone's daughter, was indebted, in ſome meaſure, for a ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence to the daughter of the farmer. Led by the tender influences of chaſte love, he returned to the duties of a man, a citizen, and a ſubject: He entered once more into the ſervice he had quitted, diſtinguiſhed himſelf, and obtained the moſt honourable appointments. Lord Darnton himſelf made a kind of public ſatisfaction to
<pb facs="unknown:028632_0105_0FDA3404CCA72A90"/>
Adams and Fanny; he declared Whatley his heir, and died in the arms of his niece. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as a recompence to Adams, prolonged his life to an advanced and happy old age; and Fanny had ſeveral children, the delight and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of their family and their country.</p>
