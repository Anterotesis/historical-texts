            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN APPEAL To the Men of <hi>New England,</hi> with a short Account of Mr. <hi>Randolphs</hi> PAPERS.</head>
            <p>IT is the Unhappiness of this present Juncture, that too many Men relinquish their Stations of <hi>Privacy</hi> and <hi>Subjection,</hi> and take upon them too freely to descant upon affairs of the <hi>Publick</hi>; and those generally <hi>such</hi> as have manifestly no <hi>Love</hi> for, nor <hi>Interest</hi> in the welfare of this Country, who yet assume a strange liberty to themselves of justifying the Conduct of the late Usurping Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and censuring the Justice and Order of the late Revolution; and by clandestine Libells, and open Coffee-house talks, endeavour to sow <hi>Factions</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> among us. It has been therefore thought fit (in order to the unity of the People, and healing the present discomposures) to propose the insuing <hi>Queries</hi> and <hi>Cases,</hi> upon which 'tis desired every man would exercise his faculty of judging, that hereby he may know how to encounter the <hi>Sophistries</hi> and stop the mouthes of these pestilent <hi>Gain-sayers.</hi>

               <p>Whether the Charters of <hi>New-England</hi> were not invaded and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in pursuance of the very same ends that caused the General Attempt lately made upon the Charters throughout all the <hi>English Dominions</hi>?</p>
               <p>Whether the Destruction of the <hi>English Charters</hi> were not one of the most considerable Branches of the late <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> for the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and utter extinction of the Protestant Religion?</p>
               <p>Whether it be rational to suppose that our late Superiours at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> did receive or could propose any advantage by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of our Charter-Government but only to bring us within the reach of <hi>Popish Counsels,</hi> when it should be time for them to work upon us?</p>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>Whether (supposing our <hi>Charters</hi> forfeitable) we had forfeited them by breaking any one Article or Condition in them?</p>
               <p>Whether therefore the late Conspirators in the Court at <hi>White-Hall</hi> did not rob us in the <hi>Massachusets Colony</hi> of our Charter, by first letting fall their <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> when we had sent Agents to stand a Trial at Law; and then by issuing out a Writ of <hi>Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> against us, requiring us to appear suddenly after at <hi>Westminster</hi> and so entring Judgment against us for our non-appearance, whilst in the mean time it was perfectly impossible we should have any timely notice of it?</p>
               <p>VVhether it be not a great Article in the Declaration publisht by his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning the Reasons of his Discent into <hi>England, That all Magistrates who have been unjustly turned out, shall forthwith Reassume their former Imployments and the English Corporations return to their ancient Prescriptions &amp; Charters</hi>?</p>
               <p>VVhether <hi>Connecticut</hi> died not as a <hi>Fool Dieth,</hi> and were not baub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of their Charter, and whether they are not more knaves than fools, who would go about to make them <hi>twice dead,</hi> when not only their <hi>Charter</hi> was actually restored by the Proclamation of King <hi>James,</hi> but also his present Majesty has declared (as we have undoubted information) <hi>That their Charter is as Good as ever</hi>?</p>
               <p>VVhether we have not Received an Attested Copy of a Bill past in the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> which expresly Declares, <hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against our Charter were Illegal, and a Grievance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhether notwithstanding the sence of all <hi>England</hi> Assembled in a full and free Parliament to the contrary, we should not rather lick up the Spittle of some of our Learned Jayl-birds, who ever now and then spawn a Pamphet to tell us, <hi>That we have been fairly dealt with</hi>?</p>
               <p>Whether when 'tis considered that for the meer hope sake of a lasting Peace and Settlement under the protections and priviledges of our <hi>Charters,</hi> we have with an incredible expence and labour

subdued a dismal <hi>Wilderness</hi> into a famous, &amp; flourishing <hi>Teritory,</hi> of no small advantage to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; we may expect that it will be thought just and fair for us to be deprived of those Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Injoyments by which we were hereunto decoy'd and ruined by the miseries of an Arbitrary Government?</p>
               <p>Whether upon the little glimmering prospect which we now have of our being freed from the wretched circumstances under which we laboured by the loss of our <hi>Charter-Priviledges,</hi> we may not be allowed to wear a little joy in our faces, and return thanks to our God, the Soveraign Bestower of all the good we have in Possession or Expectation?</p>
               <p>Whether if our late <hi>President</hi> should make it appear, either that he did not contribute to the loss of our <hi>Charter,</hi> or that he has a just and due regret for doing it, this might not reconcile him to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the people, of which among so many that have desired to see him <hi>humbled,</hi> so few desire to see him <hi>ruined</hi>?</p>
