            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>T<hi>He</hi> Sermons <hi>emitted herewith (both that of</hi> mine, <hi>and that also delivered by my</hi> Son) <hi>are published to gratify some, who have been perhaps too importunately desirous to have it so. The Person that</hi> occasioned <hi>the Preaching of them is now</hi> uncapable <hi>of receiving Benefit by them. Whether they</hi> were <hi>blessed for any saving. Good to his Soul, the Lord knowes; and it becomes us to leave</hi> Secret things <hi>with GOD.</hi> Late Repentance is seldom true <hi>There are who think that many who perished in the</hi> Floud, <hi>were by means of that</hi> Judgment, <hi>brought to</hi> true Repentance. <hi>To this sense some interpret that Scripure,</hi> 1. Pet. 4. 6. <hi>otherwise we read not of more than</hi> one <hi>man in all the</hi> Book of God, <hi>that was brought home to Christ bnt a few hours before his death. Nevertheless, the Lord knows how to make the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death (as to his</hi> Body) <hi>of a great Sinner, to occasion the</hi> Conversion <hi>and</hi> Salvation <hi>of many</hi> Souls.</p>

man: and if these</hi> Sermons (<hi>such as they are) may be a meanes to further the work of</hi> Repentance towards God, &amp; Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ <hi>in</hi> any <hi>that shall read them; the Design of this</hi> Publication <hi>will be attained.</hi>

                     <hi>As for the</hi> Exhortation <hi>annexed to these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, it was delivered on the same day with that</hi> Sermon <hi>preached by my</hi> Son, <hi>(whom the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus hath fixed in the</hi> same Church <hi>to which I am related) but in the</hi> after part <hi>of the day. The Reverend and worthy Author has not had time to transcribe his</hi> whole <hi>Sermon, only that</hi> part <hi>of it which concerned the then Condemned</hi> Malefactor. <hi>Many have earnestly desired that it might in this way be made publick. And because it is most suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the</hi> Best <hi>should come</hi> last, <hi>it is in this Publication</hi> added <hi>to the other Sermons</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> prosper his Truth, by whomsoever spoken or written for the Good of Souls.</p>

Verily I say unto you, <hi>all</hi> the sins in the world will not damn like this: Suppose a man to have bin guilty of Adultry, or Murder, or the most horrid Transgressions against the Law of God, these will not damn his Soul like that of <hi>Despising</hi> the Word of God.  <hi>For this is</hi> the <hi>Condemnation, that</hi> Light <hi>is come into the world, and men love</hi> Darkness <hi>rather than Light.</hi>  And <hi>How shall we escape, if we</hi> neglect so great <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>  They that shall be found guilty of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the great Salvation offered in the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> cannot escape the wrath of God, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of it.

See wither lesser sins will lead you, even unto <hi>greater</hi> till at <hi>last</hi> you come to the <hi>Great Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi> Your frequent <hi>swallowing of Gnats</hi> will make you not to stick at <hi>Camels.

                  <p>To Conclude in a few words more to <hi>this</hi> Bloody Sinner.</p>
                  <p>Consider, that all who live under the Gospel, are brought to Jesus the Mediator of the New-Covenant, and to the blood of <hi>sprinkling,</hi> that speaks <hi>better</hi> things than that of <hi>Abel,</hi> Heb. 12. 24.

Thy <hi>Sins</hi> speak bitter things against thee, old sins, sins of youth, a Course of sin, and this <hi>bloody</hi> sin cries aloud &amp; <hi>speaks</hi> most <hi>bitterly,</hi> but that blood of <hi>Christ</hi> can out-speak, <hi>out</hi>-cry all these. It was from Hence that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when under the Anguish of soul for his Blood-Guiltiness, expected pardon and <hi>had</hi> it, and so mayst thou, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</p>
                  <p>Let thy heart leap to hear such Language of this blood. Goe thy way and spend that little time that is left thee in studying the Vileness of thy sins committed, &amp; the Misery unto which

thou art thereby exposed, together with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and Preciousness of Jesus Christ, and Him crucified, who is ready to save thee from Sin present and wrath to come. And tho' thou art not able to come, yet the glorious lifting up of Christ in the Gospel, together with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Invitation unto all that need Him, are the means appointed &amp; blest by God to draw Men to come.</p>

                  <p>Look up to Him for the gift of Faith.</p>
                  <p>The good Lord open thine Ear, that thou may'st be no longer rebellious, but help thee <hi>so</hi> to hear as that thy Soul may live.</p>

                  <p>Min. <hi>And</hi> all <hi>these</hi> 30 <hi>years have you been sinning against the holy God. Ever since you knew how to do</hi> any <hi>thing, you have every day bin guilty of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sins: you deserve the dreadful wrath</hi> &amp; <hi>curse of the infinite God. But God has brought you here, to a place where you have enjoy'd the means of grace. And here you have added unto your</hi> old <hi>Sins, most fearful Iniquityes: you have bin such a matchless, prodigious Transgressor, that you are now to</hi> dye <hi>by the stroke of civil Justice; to</hi> dy before your time, <hi>for</hi> being wicked over much. <hi>There is hardly any sort of Wickedness which you have not wallowed in-That sin particularly which you are now to die for, is a most</hi> monstrous <hi>Crime.

Min. <hi>And let me seriously tell you, Your</hi> Despise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ is a most dreadful sin indeed. <hi>You have, for whole</hi> years <hi>together had the Call of</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>to seek an</hi> Interest <hi>in him,</hi> &amp; <hi>you would</hi> now <hi>give all the</hi> world <hi>for that</hi> interest, <hi>but you</hi> would take no notice <hi>of him.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mor.</hi> But is there not Mercy for me in Christ?</p>
                  <p>Min. <hi>Yes, and its a</hi> wonderful <hi>thing that I have now further to tell you: Mind, I entreat you. The</hi> SON of GOD <hi>is become the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> Man; <hi>the</hi> Lord Jesus Christ <hi>is both</hi> God &amp; <hi>man in</hi> one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>&amp; he is both sufficiently able</hi> &amp; <hi>willing also, to be</hi> your Saviour. <hi>He lived a most</hi> righteous <hi>life, and this was that such as</hi> you &amp; I <hi>might be able to say before God,</hi> Lord, accept of me as if <hi>I</hi> had

liv'd righteously. <hi>He died at length a most</hi> cursed death, <hi>and this was that we might be able to say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God,</hi> Lord, let not <hi>me die</hi> for sin, since thy <hi>Son</hi> has died in my room. <hi>This glorious Redeemer is now in the highest heaven, pleading with God for the Salvation of His chosen ones.—And He</hi> pours out his Spirit continually upon <hi>them</hi> that do <hi>believe</hi> on him: <hi>might</hi> you <hi>then be enabled by his</hi> grace <hi>to carry your poor, guilty, condemned, enslaved, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> soul <hi>unto</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>and humbly put your trust in him for deliverance from the</hi> whole <hi>bad state which you are</hi> brought into. <hi>Oh then his voice is to</hi> you <hi>the same that was to the penitent Thief,</hi> This day shalt thou be with me in <hi>Paradise.</hi>

Min. <hi>But be very careful about this matter: if you build</hi> on your own good Affections instead of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the only Rock, <hi>if you think</hi> they <hi>shall recommend you to God,</hi> He that <hi>made</hi> you will not have mercy on you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mor.</hi> I would be clothed with the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Min. <hi>But you can't sincerely desire that Christ should</hi> justify you, <hi>if you don't</hi> also <hi>desire that He should</hi> sanctify you: <hi>those</hi> 2 <hi>alwdies</hi> go together. <hi>Is ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> lust <hi>that has hitherto had</hi> possession <hi>of your heart become so</hi> loathsom <hi>to you, that is would fill your soul with</hi> joy <hi>to hear Jesus Christ say,</hi> I will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due those Iniquities of thine; I will make a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heavenly, a spiritually minded person of <hi>thee.</hi>
