            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS eminent and pious ſervant of Chriſt, Mr. GEORGE WHITE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD, was born at Glouceſter, on the 16th day of December, O. S. 1714. His father, Thomas Whitefield, nephew of the Rev. Mr. Samuel Whitefield of Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, in Glouceſterſhire <note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. Samuel Whitefield, great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of George, was born at Wantage in Berkſhire, and was Rector of North Ledyard in Wiltſhire. He removed afterwards to Rockhampton. He had five daughters, two of whom were married to clergymen, Mr. Perkins and Mr. Lovingham: And two ſons, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, who ſucceeded his father in the cure of Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, and died without iſſue; and Andrew, who was a private gentleman, and lived retired upon his eſtate. Andrew had fourteen children, of whom Thomas was the eldeſt, the father of Mr. George Whitefield.</note>, was firſt bred to the employment of a wine merchant in Briſtol; but afterwards kept an inn in the city of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013298_0026_0F8FFAD3CB1C44D0"/>
Glouceſter. In Briſtol he married Miſtreſs Elizabeth Edwards, who was related to the Blackwells and the Dimours of that city; by whom he had ſix ſons and one daughter <note n="*" place="bottom">Elizabeth, the daughter, was twice reputably married at Briſtol. John, his ſon, lies interred with the family in St. Mary Decrypt church in Glouceſter. Joſeph died an infant. Andrew ſettled in trade at Briſtol, and died in the twenty-eighth year of his age. James was Captain of a ſhip, and died ſuddenly at Bath. Thomas and Richard are ſtill living. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died December 1716. The mother continued a widow ſeven years, and was then married to Mr. Longden, an ironmonger in Glouceſter, by whom ſhe had no iſſue. She died December 1751, in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-firſt year of her age.</note>. Of theſe, George was the youngeſt, who being bereaved of his father, when only two years old, was regarded by his mother with a peculiar ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and educated with more than ordinary care.</p>
               <p>He was early under religious impreſſions; but the bent of his nature, and the general courſe of his younger years, as himſelf acknowledges <note n="†" place="bottom">See the two firſt parts of his life at the beginning. Confeſſions of a like nature, are to be found in the writings of St. Auguſtin.</note> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſhame and ſelf-condemnation, was of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different kind.</p>
               <p>Between the years of twelve and fifteen, he made a good progreſs in the Latin claſſics, at the public
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013298_0027_0F8FFAD48946DCD8"/>
ſchool: and his eloquence began to appear, even at that early period, in the ſpeeches which he delivered at the annual viſitations. It is probable, the applauſe he received on theſe occaſions, contributed to his fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for theatrical amuſements: From whence it has been inſinuated, that he learned his oratory upon the ſtage. This, however, ſeems to have no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than his acting a part ſometimes with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſcholars; particularly, in certain dramatic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances prepared for them by their maſter: For that he was more indebted as an orator to nature, than to art of any kind, muſt be evident to all perſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment who were acquainted with him. Such could not fail to obſerve, that his eloquence was in a great meaſure the effect of his genius, and proceeded chiefly from that peculiar aſſemblage of extraordinary talents with which God had endowed him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, it appears from his conduct, that he either had not yet diſcovered where his talents lay, or could not find means to qualify himſelf for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into any profeſſion where they might be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed: for, when he was about fifteen years of age, he declined the purſuit of learning, and talked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>About this time, the impreſſions of religion began again to recover their influence in his breaſt: And when he was ſeventeen years of age, he received the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper. He now became more and more watchful, both over his heart and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was frequently employed in faſting and prayer; ſpentmuch of his time in reading books of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; attended public worſhip twice every day; and ſo deeply was he engaged in theſe exerciſes, that his thoughts were conſtantly ſet on the great things of religion.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHEN Mr. Whitefield arrived at eighteen, he was ſent to the Univerſity of Oxford, where he was again expoſed to the ſociety of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But remembering his former danger and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by the grace of God, he reſiſted all their ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, and cultivated an acquaintance with the Methodiſts, as the only perſons that ſeemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſenſe of religion, through the whole of their deportment.</p>
               <p>It would be going beyond our purpoſe, to give an account of the riſe of Methodiſm: For this, the reader is referred to the Rev. Mr. John Weſley's firſt Journal. But it may not be improper to notice the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013298_0029_0F904F576718FCC8"/>
ſpirit of the age, when it firſt appeared. At that time, ſerious and practical chriſtianity in England was in a very low condition; ſcriptural, experimental religion, (which in the laſt century uſed to be the ſubject of the ſermons and writings of the clergy) was become quite unfaſhionable; and the only thing inſiſted on, was a defence of the out-works of chriſtianity againſt the objections of infidels. What was the conſequence? The writings of infidels multiplied every day, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity made a rapid progreſs among perſons of every rank, not becauſe they were reaſoned into it by the force of argument, but becauſe they were kept ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Chriſt and the power of the goſpel. We have a moſt affecting deſcription of this, by Biſhop Butler, whom none will ſuſpect of exaggerating the fact:
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to his Analogy, May 1736.</note> It is come, I know not how, to be taken for granted, by many perſons, that chriſtianity is not ſo much as a ſubject of inquiry; but that it is, now at length, diſcovered to be fictitious; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they treat it, as if in the preſent age, this were an agreed point among all people of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; and nothing remained but to ſet it up as a principal ſubject of mirth and ridicule; as it were by way of repriſals, for its having ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the pleaſures of the world.</q>
Such was the ſtate of religion in England, and Scotland was greedily ſwallowing down the poiſon, when it pleaſed God to raiſe up the Methodiſts, as inſtruments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his work in the midſt of abounding impiety, and to bring multitudes who had ſcarcely a form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to experience its quickening and renewing power.</p>
               <p>Happy was it for Mr. Whitefield, that there was a Society of Methodiſts, at that time, in Oxford, but eſpecially, that he became acquainted with the Rev. Mr. Charles Weſley, by whom he was treated with particular kindneſs. Such benefit did he receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013298_0030_0F8FFAD60F69ADC0"/>
his miniſtry, that he always accounted him his ſpiritual father. And Mr. Weſley's reciprocal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him, ſtands recorded in the verſes at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Mr. Whitefield's ſecond and third Journals.</p>
               <p>Like the other Methodiſts, Mr. Whitefield now began to live by rule, and to improve every moment of his time to the beſt advantage. He received the communion every Sabbath, viſited the ſick, and the jail priſoners, and read to the poor. For daring to be thus ſingularly religious, he ſoon incurred the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his fellow-ſtudents, and felt the effects of it in their unkind behaviour. In the mean time, he was greatly diſtreſſed with melancholy thoughts, which were augmented by exceſſive bodily auſterities. And at laſt, by reading, and perhaps miſunderſtanding ſome myſtic writers, he was driven to imagine, that the beſt method he could take, was to ſhut himſelf up in his ſtudy, till he had perfectly mortified his own will, and was enabled to do good without any mixture of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt motives. He likewiſe imagined, that he muſt relinquiſh external duties, and public worſhip; and laſtly, (which was no ſmall trial and affliction to him) that he muſt deny himſelf the pleaſure of converſing with his religious friends. In this pitiable ſtate of mind, Mr. Charles Weſley found him one day, when he went to ſee him; apprized him of his danger, if he perſiſted in that way of life, and recommended to him his brother, as a perſon of greater experience; who readily gave him, from time to time, his friendly advice. Soon after this, however, he carried his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence and faſting to ſuch an extreme, that his body was ſo emaciated and feeble, that he could hardly walk up ſtairs. His tutor therefore thought proper to call a phyſician, and it appeared by the event, he had rightly judged in doing ſo: for it pleaſed God to make the phyſician's care and medicines ſucceſsful to his recovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:013298_0031_0F904F57D24F60C0"/>His bodily health being reſtored, his ſoul was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe filled with peace and joy in believing on the Son of God. This joy was ſo great for ſome time, that go where he would, he could not help praiſing God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in his heart, and with ſome difficulty reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf from doing it aloud. As he was urged to go into the country for confirming his health, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his native air at Glouceſter, where (his mind being now happily enlightened) he preferred the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writings to all other books, and read them with conſtant prayer; in which exerciſe he found unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able delight and benefit. But inclination conſpired with duty, to hinder him from conſining his religion to himſelf: Having a heart formed for ſociety and friendſhip, he could not think of ſhutting himſelf up in his cloſet; but made it his buſineſs to converſe with young perſons, about his own time of life, in order to awaken them to a ſenſe of religion. God was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon to give ſucceſs to his endeavours this way; for ſeveral of them joined with him, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the contempt they knew it would bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, met together from time to time for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes. He alſo there read to ſome poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the town, twice or thrice a week, and read and prayed with the priſoners in the county goal every day.</p>
               <p>Being now about twenty-one years of age, he was ſent for by Doctor Benſon, Biſhop of Glouceſter; who told him, That though he had purpoſed to ordain none under three and twenty, yet he ſhould reckon it his duty to ordain him whenever he applied. Upon which, at the earneſt perſuaſions of his friends, he prepared for taking orders.</p>
               <p>His behaviour on this occaſion was very exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He firſt ſtudied the thirty-nine articles, that he might be ſatisfied of their being agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Then he examined himſelf by the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Miniſter mentioned in the New Teſtament,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013298_0032_0F904F59C5396AE8"/>
and by the queſtions that he knew were to be put to him at his ordination. On the Saturday, he was much in prayer for himſelf and thoſe who were to be ordained with him. On the morning of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, (which was at Glouceſter, Sunday, June 20, 1736) he roſe early, and again read, with prayer, St. Paul's Epiſtles to Timothy, and after his ordination, went to the Lord's Table.</p>
               <p>The Sunday following, he preached his ſermon on <hi>The Neceſſity and Benefit of Religious Society,</hi> to a very crowded auditory; and that ſame week he ſet out for Oxford, whither he inclined to go, rather than to the pariſh which the Biſhop would have given him; becauſe it was the place where he might beſt proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his ſtudies, and where he hoped his labours might be moſt uſeful.
<q>Laſt Sunday in the afternoon, I preach'd my firſt ſermon in the church where I was baptized, and alſo firſt received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Curioſity drew a large congregation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The ſight, at firſt, a little awed me. But I was comforted with a heart-felt ſenſe of the Divine preſence: And ſoon found the advantage of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been accuſtomed to public ſpeaking, when a boy at ſchool; and of exhorting and teaching the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and poor people at their private houſes, whilſt at the univerſity. By theſe means, I was kept from being daunted over much. As I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, I perceived the fire kindled, till at laſt, though ſo young, and amidſt a crowd of thoſe who knew me in my childiſh days, I truſt I was enabled to ſpeak with ſome degree of Goſpel au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Some few mocked; but moſt for the preſent ſeemed ſtruck: and I have ſince heard, that a complaint had been made to the Biſhop, that I drove fifteen mad, the firſt ſermon. The worthy Prelate, as I am informed, wiſhed that the madneſs might not be forgotten, before next Sunday <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter xvi.</note>.</q>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:013298_0033_0F904F5B0B52D1A8"/>
Soon after this, he was invited to officiate at the chapel of the Tower of London. The firſt time he preached in London, was Auguſt 1736, at Biſhopſgate Church. Having a very young look, the people were ſurpriſed at his appearance, and ſeemed to ſneer as he went up to the pulpit; but they had not heard him long, when their contempt was turned into eſteem, and their ſmiles into grave attention. He continued at the Tower two months, preaching, catechiſing, and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoldiers; and ſeveral ſerious young men came to hear his morning diſcourſes on the Lord's day. In the mean time the letters which the Rev. Meſſieurs Weſleys and Ingham wrote home from Georgia, made him long to go and preach the Goſpel in thoſe parts; yet he waited till Providence ſhould make his way more clear, and returning to Oxford, he found himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy in his former employments, and had much pleaſure in reading Henry's Commentary on the Bible, and in the company of ſome religious young men, who met together in his chamber every day.</p>
               <p>In November 1736, he was again called from Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, to Miniſter at Dummer in Hampſhire. This was a new ſphere of action among poor illiterate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but he was ſoon reconciled to it, and thought he reaped no ſmall profit by converſing with them. Nevertheleſs, he continued his ſtudies with unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried application: Dividing the day into three parts; eight hours for ſleep and meals, eight for public pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, catechiſing and viſiting; and eight for ſtudy and retirement. During his ſtay here, he was invited to a very profitable curacy in London; but did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, as he was ſtill intent upon going abroad. Providence, at length, ſeemed to open a door to him; for he received letters, containing what he thought to be an invitation, to go to Georgia, from Mr. John Weſley, whoſe brother came over about this time to procure labourers. It is eaſy to judge, how readily this propoſal would be embraced: and now that he thought himſelf clearly called, (many things concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013298_0034_0F904F5C8DA15588"/>
to make his ſtay at home leſs neceſſary) he ſet his affairs in order, and in January 1737, went to take leave of his friends in Glouceſter and Briſtol. At Glouceſter, the congregations when he preached, were very large, and very ſerious. At Briſtol, many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were forced to return from the churches where he was invited to preach, for want of room. He went alſo to Bath, where he was kindly received, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice. But he did not ſtay long at any of theſe places, being obliged to go to Oxford about the latter end of February; from whence he came up to London, to wait upon General Oglethorp and the Truſtees for Georgia. He was ſoon introduced to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and the Biſhop of London, who both approved of his going abroad. While he continued at London, waiting for General Oglethorp, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more frequently than he had done before, and greater numbers of people flocked to hear him. But finding that the General was not likely to ſail for ſome time; and being under particular obligations to the Rev. Mr. Sampſon Harris, Miniſter at Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in Glouceſterſhire, he went at his requeſt, to ſupply his charge, till he ſhould diſpatch ſome affairs in London. There he was very happy in his public miniſtrations, but eſpecially in his retirements, which he uſed afterwards to reflect upon with great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="*" place="bottom">See Letter xxi.</note>. On Mr. Harris's return, he left Stonehouſe, and upon repeated invitations went a ſecond time to Briſtol, where he preached as uſual about five times a week. Here the multitudes of his hearers ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed

                     <p>
                        <q>Some hung upon the rails, others climed up the leads of the church, and all together made the church itſelf ſo hot, with their breath, that the ſteam would fall from the pillars like drops of rain.</q>

                     </p>
                  </note>. He was attended by perſons of all ranks
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013298_0035_0F904F5CED78EE20"/>
and denominations; private religious ſocieties were erected; a collection for the poor priſoners in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, was made twice or thrice a week; and large encouragement was offered to him, if he would not go abroad.—During his ſtay at Briſtol, which was from the end of May to the twenty-firſt of June, he paid a ſecond ſhort viſit to Bath, were the people crowded, and were ſeriouſly affected as at Briſtol, and not leſs than 160<hi>l.</hi> was collected for the poor of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</p>
               <p>June 21, he preached his farewell-ſermon at Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol; and towards the end of the diſcourſe, when he came to tell them, "it might be they would ſee him no more," the whole congregation was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affected; high and low, young and old, burſt into a flood of tears. Multitudes, after ſermon, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him home weeping; and the next day he was employed from ſeven in the morning till midnight, in talking and giving advice to thoſe who came to him, about the concerns of their ſouls and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>From Briſtol he went to Glouceſter, and preached to a very crowded auditory; and after ſtaying a few days went to Oxford, where he had an agreeable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with the Methodiſts, and came to London about the end of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>Here he was invited to preach and aſſiſt in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering the Sacrament in a great many churches. The congregations continually increaſed; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally on the Lord's-days, he uſed to preach four times to very large and very much affected auditories, and to walk ten or twelve miles in going to the different churches. His friends began to be afraid he would hurt himſelf; but he uſed to ſay,
<q>He found by experience, the more he did, the more he might do for God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His name was now put into the news-papers, (though without his conſent or knowledge) as a young Gentleman going volunteer to Georgia, who
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013298_0036_0F904F5DD3AEB628"/>
was to preach before the ſocieties at their general quarterly meeting. This ſtirred up the people's cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity more and more. He preached on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, his ſermon on <hi>Early Piety,</hi> which was printed at the requeſt of the ſocieties. After this, for near three months ſucceſſively, there was no end of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's flocking to hear him, and the managers of the charity ſchools were continually applying to him to preach <note n="*" place="bottom">See Letter xxviii.</note> for the benefit of the children; for that purpoſe they procured the liberty of the churches on other days of the week beſides the Lord's-day; and yet thouſands went away from the largeſt churches, not being able to get in. The congregations were all attention, and ſeemed to hear as for eternity. He preached generally nine times a week, and often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered the Sacrament early on the Lord's-day morning, when you might ſee the ſtreets filled with people going to church with lanthorns in their hands, and hear them converſing about the things of God.</p>
               <p>As his popularity increaſed, oppoſition increaſed proportionably. Some of the clergy became angry; two of them ſent for him, and told him, they would not let him preach in their pulpits any more, unleſs he renounced that part of the preface of his ſermon on <hi>Regeneration,</hi> (lately publiſhed) wherein he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<q>that his brethren would entertain their audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories oftener with diſcourſes upon the new-birth.</q>
Probably ſome of them were irritated the more, by his free converſation with many of the ſerious Diſſenters, who invited him to their houſes, and repeatedly told him,
<q>That if the doctrines of the new-birth, and juſtification by faith, were preached powerfully in the churches, there would be few Diſſenters in England.</q>
Nor was he without oppoſition even from ſome of his friends. But under theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he had great comfort in meeting every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a band of religious intimates, to ſpend an hour in prayer, for the advancement of the Goſpel,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013298_0037_0F904F5E90EFE830"/>
and for all their acquaintance, ſo far as they knew their circumſtances. In this he had uncommon ſatisfaction: once he ſpent a whole night with them in prayer and praiſe; and ſometimes at midnight, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been quite wearied with the labours of the day, he found his ſtrength renewed in this exerciſe, which made him compoſe his ſermon upon <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nearer the time of his embarkation approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more affectionate and eager the people grew. Thouſands and thouſands of prayers were put up for him. They would run and ſtop him in the alleys of the churches, and follow him with wiſhful looks. But above all, it was hardeſt for him to part with his weeping friends at St. Dunſtan's, where he helped to adminiſter the Sacrament to them, after ſpending the night before in prayer: This parting was to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſupportable.</p>

               <p>IN the latter end of December, 1737, he embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Georgia<note n="*" place="bottom">Here begins a Manuſcript of Mr. Whitefield's, from which ſeveral paſſages are taken in the following account. It is referred to by M. S.</note>. This was to him a new, and at firſt appearance, a very unpromiſing ſcene. The ſhip was full of ſoldiers, and there were near twenty women among them. The Captains, both of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013298_0038_0F904F5F3A0086A8"/>
and ſailors, with the ſurgeon, and a young cadet, gave him ſoon to underſtand, that they looked upon him as an impoſtor, and for a while treated him as ſuch. The firſt Lord's day, one of them played on the hautboy, and nothing was to be ſeen but cards, and little heard but curſing and blaſphemy. This was a very diſagreeable ſituation; but it is worth while to obſerve, with what prudence he was helped to behave among them, and how God was pleaſed to bleſs his patient and perſevering endeavours to do them good.</p>
               <p>He began with the officers in the cabin, in the way of mild and gentle reproof; but this had little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
<q>I could do no more for a ſeaſon, than whilſt I was writing, now and then turn my head by way of reproof, to a Lieutenant of the ſoldiers, who ſwore as though he was born of a ſwearing conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Now, and then, he would take the hint, return my nod with a, <hi>Doctor I aſk your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and then to his cards and ſwearing again<note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
He therefore tried what might be done between decks, among the ſoldiers. And though the place was not very commodious, he read prayers and expounded twice a day. At firſt he could not ſee any fruit of his labour, yet it was encouraging to find it ſo kindly received by his new red-coat pariſhioners, (as he calls them) many of whom ſubmitted cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be catechiſed about the leſſons they had heard expounded.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation things continued for ſome time. But all this while, he had no place for retirement, and there was no divine ſervice in the great cabin, both which he greatly deſired. At laſt he obtained his wiſh: one day finding the ſhip Captain a little inclined to favour him, he aſked him to ſuffer him now and then to retire into the round-houſe, where the Captain ſlept, and offered him money for the loan
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013298_0039_0F904F60193F9F80"/>
of it. The Captain would not take the money, but readily granted his requeſt. Soon afterwards, the military Captain, having invited him to a diſh of cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, he took the liberty to tell him,
<q>That though he was a volunteer on board, yet as he was on board, he looked upon himſelf as his Chaplain, and as ſuch, he thought it a little odd, to pray and preach to the ſervants, and not to the maſter;</q>
and added withal,
<q>That if he thought proper, he would make uſe of a ſhort collect now and then, to him, and the other Gentlemen in the great cabin.</q>
After pauſing a while, and ſhaking his head, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<q>I think we may, when we have nothing elſe to do.</q>
This aukward hint was all he got for the preſent; yet he was encouraged thereby to hope, that the deſired point would ſoon be gained.</p>
               <p>They were detained in the Downs, by contrary winds, for near a month; the ſoldiers on board be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came by this time more and more civilized, and the people at Deal heard him gladly. There he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thrice, at the invitation of the Miniſters, and often expounded in the houſe where he lodged. This work was very delightful to him; but he was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called away by a fair wind, about the end of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1738, juſt after he had preached in Upper-Deal church.</p>
               <p>Being returned to the ſhip, he began to comfort himſelf with ſome promiſing appearances of doing good in the great cabin. As he had no better place, he generally every night retired with his friend Mr. Haberſham, and his brother, and two ſervants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the round-houſe, for prayer and other religious exerciſes. Sometimes, he perceived Captain Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was hearkening within. One day finding on the Captain's pillow the Independent Whig, he exchang-it for a book entitled, <hi>The Self-Deceiper.</hi> Next morning the Captain came ſmiling, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired who made that exchange; Mr. Whitefield
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013298_0040_0F904F60C0C766E0"/>
confeſſed the charge, and begged his acceptance of the book, which he ſaid he had read, and liked very well. From thenceforward, a viſible alteration was ſeen in him. The other Captain alſo, about the ſame time, met him as he was coming from between decks, and deſired,
<q>that they might have public ſervice and expounding twice a-day in the great cabin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In about a fortnight, they reached Gibraltar, whither they were bound to take in ſome more ſoldiers. There, one Major Sinclair had been ſo kind as to provide a lodging for him unaſked, who, with the other military Gentlemen, even Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Sabine, and General Columbine, received him moſt courteouſly. Being apprehenſive, that at a public military table, he might be more than hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitably entertained, by way of prevention, he begged leave to remind his Excellency of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made in the book of Eſther, on the Court of the great Ahaſuerus, "That none did compel." He took the hint, and genteely replied,
<q>That no compulſion of any kind ſhould be uſed at his table.</q>
And every thing was carried on with great decorum. The officers attended at public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with order and gravity; the Miniſters alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with great civility; and all concurred to give him invitations to preach, which he did twice or thrice in the week:
<q>Strange and unuſual was the ſcene, both with reſpect to the place and people. The adjacent promontories, and the largeneſs of the rock of Gibraltar, helped me to enlarge any ideas of him, who in <hi>his ſtrength ſetteth faſt the mountains, and is girded about with power.</hi> And the place being, as it were, a public rendezvous of all nations, I thought I ſaw the world in epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome<note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
In the evenings and mornings, when on board, he expounded, converſed and prayed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013298_0041_0F904F6179F6C690"/>
with a religious ſociety of ſoldiers, who had liberty from the Governor to aſſemble at any time in the church. His evening expoſitions were attended, not only by the ſoldiers, but by officers, Miniſters and town's-people; and from all that could be judged, his labours were not without the divine bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Finding another ſociety of religious ſoldiers there, belonging to the church of Scotland, he ſent them, as well as the former, ſome proper books, talked with ſeveral of them, and endeavoured to unite both ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties together; urging on them the neceſſity of a catholic, diſintereſted love, and of joining in prayer for the advancement of the kingdom of Chriſt. This exhortation alſo, by the bleſſing of God, had a good effect; and two or three of the latter ſociety being draughted out for Georgia, deſired leave to go in the ſhip with Mr. Whitefield, which was readily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them.</p>
               <p>Before the embarkation of the ſoldiers, by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's conſent, he gave them a parting diſcourſe in the church. And after embarkation, from time to time, as the weather permitted, he preached to them on board their reſpective ſhips <note n="*" place="bottom">He not only preached to them; but gave them notice, that he intended ſpeaking to them, one by one, to ſee what account they could give of their faith.—<hi>Ibid.</hi> At this time he began his
<q>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on ſelect paſſages of Scripture turned into catechetical queſtions,</q>
printed in vol IV. of his works.</note>. Colonel Cochran, who commanded, was extremely civil: and ſoon after their ſetting ſail, there was ſuch a change upon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mackay, that he deſired Mr. Whitefield would not give himſelf the trouble of expounding and praying in the cabin, and between decks; for he would order a drum to be beat morning and evening, and himſelf would attend with the ſoldiers on the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013298_0042_0F904F6231DD6568"/>
deck. This produced a very agreeable alteration; they were now as regular as in a church. Mr. Whitefield preached with a Captain on each ſide of him, and ſoldiers all around; and the two other ſhips companies, being now in the trade winds, drew near, and joined in the worſhip of God. The great cabin was now become a-Bethel; both Captains were daily more and more affected; and a crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, were the uſual topics of their converſation. Once after public ſermon, Captain Mackay deſired the ſoldiers to ſtop, whilſt he informed them, that to his great ſhame, he had been a notorious ſwearer himſelf, but by the inſtrumentality of that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, pointing to Mr. Whitefield, he had now left it off, and exhorted them, for Chriſt's ſake, that they would go and do likewiſe. The children were cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed; there was a reformation throughout the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. The women cried,
<q>What a change in our Captain.</q>
The bad books and packs of cards which Mr. Whitefield exchanged for Bibles, and other religious books (abundance of which were given him to diſperſe by the <hi>Society for promoting Chriſtian knowledge</hi>) were now thrown overboard; and a fever, that prevailed in general through the whole ſhip, helped to make the impreſſions ſink deeper. For many days and nights, he viſited betwixt twenty and thirty ſick perſons, crawling between decks upon his knees, adminiſtring medicines or cordials to them, and ſuch advice as ſeemed ſuitable to their circumſtances. The ſailors did not eſcape the fever; Captain Whiting gladly went with him to viſit them. One of them in particular, who had been a moſt notorious ſcoffer, ſent for him in a bitter agony, crying out upon, and lamenting his wicked life. The cadet, who was a cabin paſſenger, being alſo ſeized, was wounded deeply, told Mr. Whitefield the hiſtory of his life, and informed Captain Mackay of his deſire to leave
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013298_0043_0F904F62E760DF20"/>
the army, and to return to his original intention (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had an univerſity education) of devoting himſelf to the ſervice of the church of God. Mr. Whitefield himſelf was alſo ſeized, but by the bleſſing of God, he ſoon recovered, and was ſtrong enough, in about a week, to come out to the burial of the cook of the ſhip, who had boaſted,
<q>That he would be wicked till two years before he died, and then he would be good.</q>
But he was ſuddenly taken ill and died in about ſix hours<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>This was the only adult, except a ſoldier (who had killed himſelf at Gibraltar by perpetual drinking) that died out of all that were on board.</q>

               <p>It was the beginning of May, when they drew near to land. After preaching his farewell ſermon, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the parſonage-houſe at Savannah, May 7, 1738, about four months after his firſt embarkation at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Upon this voyage (many years after) he made the following reflection:
<q>A long, and, I truſt, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unprofitable voyage. What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his mercies? Beſides being ſtrengthened to go through my public work, I was enabled to write letters and compoſe ſermons, as though I had been on land. Even at this diſtance of time, the remembrance of the happy hours I enjoyed in religious exerciſes on the deck, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to my ſoul. And though nature ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times relented at being taken away from my friends, and little unuſual inconveniences of a ſea-life; yet, a conſciouſneſs that I had in view the glory of God, and the good of ſouls, from time to time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me unſpeakable ſatisfaction <note n="†" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One Mr. Delamot, who had gone volunteer with Mr. Weſley, and was left behind by him as ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013298_0044_0F904F63A45F14B8"/>
at Savannah, received Mr. Whitefield at the parſonage-houſe, which he found much better than expectation. Here ſome ſerious perſons, the fruits of Mr. Weſley's miniſtry, ſoon came to ſee him. On the morrow he read prayers, and expounded in the court houſe, and waited upon the magiſtrates; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken ill, he was confined for above a week with a fever and ague.</p>
               <p>When he was recovered, and able to look about him, he found every thing bore the aſpect of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant colony: and, what was more diſcouraging ſtill, he ſaw it was likely to continue ſo, by the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its conſtitution.
<q>The people (ſays he) were denied the uſe both of rum and ſlaves. The lands were allotted them, according to a particular plan, whether good or bad; and the female heirs prohibited from inheriting. So that in reality, to place people there on ſuch a footing, was little better than to tie their legs and bid them walk. The ſcheme was well meant at home; but, as too many years experience evidently proved, was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impracticable in ſo hot a country abroad. However, that rendered what I had brought over from my friends, more acceptable to the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and gave me an occular demonſtration, which was what I wanted, when the hint was given <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>It was firſt propoſed to me by my dear friend Mr. Charles Weſley, who, with General Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe, had concerted a ſcheme for carrying o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Saltzburgers at Ebenezer, I found had one; and having heard and read of what Profeſſor Franck had done in that way in Germany, I confidently
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013298_0045_0F904F646711C138"/>
hoped that ſomething of the like nature might be owned and ſucceeded in Georgia. Many poor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans were there already, and the number was likely ſoon to increaſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As opportunity offered, I viſited Frederica, and the adjacent villages, and often admired, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circumſtances and diſpoſition of the firſt ſettlers, that ſo much was really done. The ſettlers were chiefly broken and decayed tradeſmen from London and other parts of England; and ſeveral Scotch adverturers; ſome Highlanders, who had a worthy Miniſter, named Maclcod; a few Moravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and the Saltzburghers, who were by far the moſt induſtrious of the whole. With the worthy miniſters of Ebenezer, Meſſrs. Grenaw and Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius, I contracted an intimacy. Many praying people were in the congregation, which, with the conſideration that ſo many charitable people in England had been ſtirred up to contribute to Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, and ſuch faithful labourers as Meſſrs. Weſleys and Ingham had been ſent, gave me great hopes, that, unpromiſing as the aſpect at preſent might be, the colony might emerge in time out of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſtate. Some ſmall advances Mr. Ingham had made towards converting the Indians, who were at a ſmall ſettlement about four miles from Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah. He went and lived among them for a few months, and began to compoſe an Indian gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar; but he was ſoon called away to England; and the Indians (who were only ſome run-away Creeks) were in a few years ſcattered or dead. Mr. Charles Weſley had chiefly acted as Secretary to General Oglethorpe, but he ſoon alſo went to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to engage more labourers; and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his brother, Mr. John Weſley, having met with unworthy treatment, both at Frederica and Georgia, ſoon followed. All this I was apprized of, but think it moſt prudent not to repeat grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013298_0046_0F904F6526E945F0"/>
Through divine mercy, I met with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful treatment from magiſtrates, officers and people. The firſt I viſited now and then, the others, beſides preaching twice a day, and four times of a Lord's day, I viſited from houſe to houſe: I was, in general, moſt cordially received; but from time to time found, that <hi>Coelum non ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mutant, qui trans mare currunt</hi>: Though lowered in their circumſtances, a ſenſe of what they formerly were in their native country, remained. It was plain to be ſeen, that coming over was not ſo much out of choice, as conſtraint: chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be poor in an unknown country abroad, than beholden to relations, or live among thoſe who knew them in more affluent circumſtances at home. Among ſome of theſe, the event however proved, that the word took effectual root. I was really happy in my little foreign cure, and could have cheerfully remained among them, had I not been obliged to return to England, to receive prieſt's orders, and make a beginning towards lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a foundation to the Orphan-houſe. And thus the place I intended to hide myſelf in, became, through my being obliged to return for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a means of increaſing that popularity which was already begun, but which by me was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unforſeen, and as abſolutely undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. During my ſtay there, the weather was moſt intenſely hot, ſometimes burning me almoſt through my ſhoes. Seeing others do it who were as unable, I determined to enure myſelf to hardineſs, by lying conſtantly on the ground; which by uſe, I found to be ſo far from being a hardſhip, that afterwards it became ſo, to lie on a bed<note n="*" place="bottom">M.

after an affectionate parting with his flock, he ſet out for Charleſtown, in South-Carolina.</p>
               <p>Here he paid his firſt viſit to Commiſſary Garden, and at his entreaty preached the next Sunday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, in a grand church, reſembling one of the new churches in London. The inhabitants ſeemed at his firſt coming up to deſpiſe his youth; but their countenances were altered before worſhip was over. Mr. Garden thanked him moſt cordially, and apprized him of the ill treatment Mr. Weſley had met with in Georgia, and aſſured him, that were the ſame arbitrary proceedings to commence againſt him, he would defend him with his life and fortune. He alſo ſaid ſomething about the colony of Georgia that much encouraged him, as if he thought its flouriſhing was not very far off; and that Charleſtown was fifteen times bigger now, than when he (Mr. Garden) firſt came there.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SEPTEMBER 6, 1738, Mr. Whitefield em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a ſhip bound from Charleſtown to London. They had a very uncomfortable paſſage, for near a fortnight, they were beat about not far from the bar; they were ſoon reduced to an allowance of water; and the ſhip itſelf was quite out of repair. They were alſo very poorly off for proviſions. When they were about a third part of their paſſage, they met with a Jamaica man who had plenty of every thing. He ſent for Mr. Whitefield on board, and offered him a moſt commodious birth; but he did not think it right to leave his ſhip-mates in diſtreſs, and therefore returned to his own ſhip, with ſuch things as they were pleaſed to give him. The remaining part of the voyage was ſtill more perilous. The only thing comfortable, was, that in the midſt of theſe trials, deep impreſſions were made on ſome that were on board. All conſtantly attended public worſhip twice and ſome thrice a day. Once the Captain cried out,
<q>Lord, break this hard heart of mine.</q>
Others were impreſſed: particularly one Captain Gladman a paſſenger, on whom a great change was wrought, and afterwards, at his own earneſt requeſt, became Mr. Whitefield's fellow-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller. At length, after nine weeks toſſing and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro they found themſelves in Limerick harbour.
<q>I wiſh I could never forget what I felt, when water and other proviſions were brought us from aſhore. One Mr. MacMahon, a country gentleman came from his ſeat at midnight on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013298_0049_0F904F6764963218"/>
to relieve us, and moſt kindly invited me, tho' unknown, to his houſe to ſtay as long as I pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note n="*" place="bottom">M. S. and Journals.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At Limerick, Biſhop Burſcough received him very kindly, and engaged him to preach in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, the good effects of which he heard of many years after. From thence he went to Dublin, where he preached, and was courteouſly received by Dr. Delany, Biſhop Rundel, and Archbiſhop Bolton, who had heard of him from a gentleman of Gibraltar. And after a paſſage of twenty-four hours from Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin, he arrived at Park-gate, Thurſday, November 30, preached twice on the Lord's-day at Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and came to London the Friday following, December 8.</p>
               <p>Here, he had a conference with the Moravian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who were lately come to London; and tho' he could not directly fall in with their way of expreſſing themſelves, yet he heartily agreed with them in the old Proteſtant Doctrine of Juſtification in the ſight of God, by Faith alone in the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and was not a little delighted to find a great increaſe of the work of God, both as to light and love, doctrine and practice, through the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of Mr. Charles, and eſpecially of Mr. John Weſley.</p>
               <p>Some of the clergy now began to ſhew their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure more and more; ſo that in two days time, five churches were denied him. And tho' the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, and the Biſhop of London, both received him civilly, it was but coldly: And the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enquired,
<q>Whether his Journals were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tinctured with enthuſiaſm?</q>
He replied, That they were written only for himſelf, and private friends and were publiſhed entirely without his conſent, or knowledge, or ſo much as his conſent being aſked at all. It was certainly wrong to publiſh them, without
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013298_0050_0F904F6A31E60C40"/>
his conſent and reviſal; otherwiſe, the publication of them was a very proper way to prevent the miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of facts, either by calumny and detraction on the one hand, or by exaggeration on the other. And it is a great pity he did not continue them. They would have been the beſt poſſible memoirs of his life. But we ſee how the offence given by, or taken at, ſome paſſages, might help to determine him
<q>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (as he afterwards ſays) in a more compendious way.</q>
The Journals were, indeed, moſtly written amidſt his inceſſant labours in preaching, travelling, and writing a multitude of letters. And the whole was told with that unguarded ſimplicity, which tho' it charms the candid, and diſpoſes them to forgive or overlook many things, yet gives frequent handle to the critical and ſevere. It muſt alſo be owned, that his unſuſpecting honeſty made him ſometimes receive, with too little caution, the characters of perſons and ſocieties, from thoſe whom he took to be friends of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and who, perhaps, were really ſo, but were miſinformed. Being therefore convinced, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, that both his Journals, and the two firſt parts of his Life, needed correction, he promiſed a new edition of them, which he accordingly publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1756. And in the preface he ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
<q>That upon a review, he had found many miſtakes, (which are now rectified) and many paſſages that were juſtly exceptionable,</q>
(which are now eraſed.) And in a note, upon <hi>September</hi> 24, 1740, he ſays,
<q>In my former Journal, taking things by hearſay too much, I ſpoke and wrote too raſhly, both of the Colleges and Miniſters of <hi>New England;</hi> for which, as I have already done when at Boſton laſt, from the pulpit, I take this opportunity of aſking public pardon from the preſs. It was raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and though well-meant, I fear, did hurt.</q>
But theſe corrections, while they ſhew the author's candour and humility, do not affect the hiſtory
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013298_0051_0F904F6BB3578630"/>
of his extraordinary labours and ſucceſs in the work of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Truſtees for the Colony of Georgia received him more cordially, were pleaſed to expreſs their ſatisfaction at the accounts ſent them of his conduct, during his ſtay in the colony, and being requeſted, by letters ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, from the Magiſtrates and Inhabitants, they moſt willingly preſented him to the Living of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah, (though he inſiſted upon having no ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) and as readily granted him five hundred acres of land, whereon to erect an Orphan-houſe; to collect money for which, together with taking Prieſt's Orders, were the chief motives of his returning to England ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>Near a month elapſed, before a board ſat to make him theſe returns. But during that interval, he was not idle. He and his brethren went on in their uſual courſe, taking hold of every opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and preaching occaſionally as churches were allowed them <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>God gave us a moſt pleaſant Goſpel Chriſtmas ſeaſon, and ſuch a happy beginning of a New-Year as I had never ſeen before.</q>
M. S.</note>. And tho' the church-wardens and clergy were averſe, yet the common people were rather more eager than ever. But what ſurprized him moſt was, to ſee many of the heads and members of the London Societies, (who, by the accounts given by Dr. Woodward and Horneck <note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Woodward's Account of the Riſe and Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ut oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. However, numbers of them were of another mind, and other Societies were ſoon formed in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of the town. A large room in Fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane was the general place of rendezvous, where they had frequent meetings, and great ſatisfaction in ſocial prayer.
<q>It was a Pentecoſt ſeaſon indeed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013298_0052_0F904F6BE5510638"/>
whole nights were ſpent in prayer. Often have we been filled as with new wine. And often have I ſeen them overwhelmed with the Divine Preſence, and cry out,
<q>Will GOD, indeed, dwell with men upon earth! How dreadful is this place! This is no other than the houſe of GOD, and the gate of Heaven!<note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>
                     </q>
                  </q>
At the ſame time, in the churches that were open, the people crowded, and were affected more than ever. And he and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were ſo much engaged, that for ſome days he could walk, and preach, and viſit Societies with very little ſleep, and religious exerciſes ſeemed to be their meat and drink.</p>
               <p>January 11, 1739, he ſet out for Oxford to receive Prieſt's Orders from his good friend Biſhop Benſon, which he did the next Lord's-day; and having preached and adminiſtred the Sacrament at the Caſtle, and preached again in the afternoon, to a crowded congregation, he returned to London, January 15.</p>
               <p>As he had collected ſo much for the Charity ſchools laſt year, he reaſonably ſuppoſed that the pulpits would not be denied him for the uſe of the Georgia Orphan-houſe this year. But the religious concern advancing, and ſpreading more and more, oppoſition alſo increaſed. A pamphlet was publiſhed againſt his ſermon, On Regeneration. Several Clergymen made ſtrong objections againſt him and his brethren for expounding in ſocieties; and ſome people were threatened with proſecution by their pariſh miniſters, for ſuffering them to expound in their houſes. Yet this did not diſcourage either preachers or hearers. The more they were oppoſed, the more they were ſtrengthened. New awakenings were heard of in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts; and, "What ſhall I do to be ſaved?" was the repeated queſtion of every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:013298_0053_0F8FFAD734B7CDC8"/>All the pulpits were not as yet ſhut up: Two or three churches were allowed him to preach in, and to collect for the Georgia Orphans, and for erecting a church for the poor Saltzburghers at Ebenezer. One Mr. Broughton behaved nobly on this occaſion. Application being made to him, to deny Mr. Whitefield his pulpit, he anſwered,
<q>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got the Lectureſhip of St. Helen's by Mr. Whitefield's influence; if he inſiſts upon it, he ſhall have my pulpit.</q>
Mr. Whitefield did inſiſt upon it, but (Mr. Broughton loſing the Lectureſhip) he afterwards blamed himſelf much for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <p>In Briſtol he had the uſe of the churches for two or three Sundays, but ſoon found they would not be open very long. The Dean was not at home: The Chancellor threatened to ſilence and ſuſpend him. In about a fortnight every door was ſhut, except Newgate, where he preached, and collected for the poor priſoners, and where people thronged, and were much impreſſed; but this place, alſo was ſoon ſhut againſt him, by orders from the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</p>
               <p>Before his firſt embarkation for Georgia, when he talked of going abroad, numbers in Briſtol uſed to reply,
<q>What need of going abroad? Have we not Indians enough at home?</q>
If you have a mind to convert Indians, there are colliers enough in Kingſwood. And before he left London, whilſt preaching at Bermondſey Church, and ſeeing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands that could not come in, he had a ſtrong inclination to go out and preach to them (though he then uſed notes) upon one of the tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones in the church-yard. And this he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome friends, who looked upon the motion, at firſt, very unfavourably; yet were willing to take it into farther conſideration. At Briſtol he thought he had a clear call to try this method. The colliers, he
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013298_0054_0F904F6CA54E7210"/>
had heard, were very rude, and very numerous; ſo uncultivated, that no body cared to go among them; neither had they any place of worſhip; and often, when provoked, they were a terror to the whole ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Briſtol. He therefore looked upon the civiliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe people; and much more, the bringing of them to the profeſſion and practice of chriſtianity, as a matter of great importance.
<q>I thought it might be doing the ſervice of my Creator, who had a mountain for his pulpit, and the heavens for a ſounding board; and who, when his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was refuſed by the Jews, ſet his ſervants into the high ways and hedges<note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
After much prayer, and many ſtruggles with himſelf, he one day went to Hannam Mount, and ſtanding upon a hill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach to about a hundred colliers, upon Matt. v. 1, 2, 3. This ſoon took air. At the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third time the numbers greatly increaſed, till the congregation, at a moderate computation, amounted to near twenty thouſand. But with what gladneſs and eagerneſs, many of theſe deſpiſed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts, who had never been in a church in their lives, received the word, is above deſcription.
<q>Having (as he writes) no righteouſneſs of their own to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, they were glad to hear of a Jeſus who was a friend to publicans, and came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. The firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their being affected, was to ſee the white gutters made by their tears, which plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fell down their black cheeks, as they came out of the coal pits. Hundreds and hundreds of them were ſoon brought under deep convictions, which (as the event proved) happily ended in a ſound and thorough converſion. The change was viſible to all, though numbers choſe to impute it to any thing, rather than the finger of God. As the ſcene was quite new, and I had
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013298_0055_0F904F6D664349C0"/>
juſt began to be an extempore preacher, it often occaſioned many inward conflicts. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when twenty thouſand people were before me, I had not, in my own apprehenſion, a word to ſay, either to God or them. But I was never totally deſerted, and frequently (for to deny it would be lying againſt God) ſo aſſiſted, that I knew by happy experience, what our Lord meant by ſaying, <hi>Out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water.</hi> The open firmament above me, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of adjacent fields, with the ſight of thouſands, ſome in coaches, ſome on horſeback and ſome in the trees, and at times all affected and drenched in tears together, to which ſometimes was added, the ſolemnity of the approaching evening, was almoſt too much for, and quite overcame me<note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the colliers, and thouſands from neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring villages, perſons of all ranks flocked daily out of Briſtol. And he was ſoon invited to preach, by ſome of the better ſort, in a large bowling-green in the city itſelf. Many indeed ſneered, to ſee a ſtripling, with a gown, mount a table, upon what they called unconſecrated ground. And for once, or twice, it excited the contempt and laughter of the higher rank, who formerly were his admirers, when he preached in the churches. But God enabled him to ſtand the laugh, and to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt with earneſtneſs and conſtancy; and was pleaſed to attend it with his bleſſing. From all quarters, people flocked under great concern about their ſouls. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was employed almoſt from morning to night, giving anſwer to thoſe who came in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, crying out, "What ſhall we do to be ſaved?" More aſſiſtance was wanted; he therefore wrote to Mr. John Weſley, who had never yet been at Briſtol, and having received a favourable anſwer, recommended him and his brother, in the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013298_0056_0F8FFAD78A7D7C60"/>
manner, to the people, and earneſtly prayed that the laſt might be firſt; for he was determined to purſue his ſcheme of the Orphan-houſe, and return again to his retreat at Georgia.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weſley being come, he took an affectionate leave of his friends at Briſtol, and made a ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion to Wales, where an awakening had begun ſome years before, by the inſtrumentality of the Rev. Mr. Griffith Jones, and was now carried on by the miniſtry of one Mr. Howel Harris, a layman. They met at Cardiff, and in company with many others went to Huſk, Ponty-pool, Abergavenny, Comiboy, Carleon, Trelex, and Newport, and preached in all theſe places, Mr. Whitefield firſt in Engliſh, and Mr. Harris afterwards in Welch, to many thouſands. The ſerious perſons among them, of the Free Grace Diſſenters, rejoiced; but many of high-flying principles, and of another ſtamp, were equally enraged, and expreſſed their diſlike by mockings and threats. All theſe, however, he was enabled to bear with patience, and without the leaſt diſcouragement.</p>
               <p>About the 8th of April, from Wales he went to Glouceſter, the place of his birth, where a church was allowed him for once or twice, but no more. However, he preached frequently in Boothall, (the place where the judges ſit) and in his brother's field, to many thouſands. At the time of Mr. Whitefield's preaching in Glouceſter, old Mr. Cole, a diſſenting Miniſter, uſed to ſay,
<q>Theſe are days of the Son of Man indeed.</q>
This Mr. Cole, Mr. Whitefield when a boy, was taught to ridicule. And being aſked once by one of his congregation, What buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he would be of? He ſaid,
<q>A Miniſter; but he would take care never to tell ſtories in the pulpit like old Cole.</q>
About twelve years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the old man hearing him preach, and tell ſome ſtory to illuſtrate the ſubject he was upon,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013298_0057_0F904F6E29233830"/>
and having been informed what he had before ſaid, made this remark to one of his elders,
<q>I find that young Whitefield can now tell ſtories, as well as old Cole.</q>
He was much affected with Mr. Whitefield's preaching, and ſo humble, that he uſed to ſubſcribe himſelf his curate; and went about preaching after him in the country from place to place. But one evening, whilſt preaching, he was ſtruck with death, and then aſked for a chair to lean on, till he concluded his ſermon, when he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up ſtairs, and died. Mr. Whitefield's reflection upon this (Letter DXXIII.) is,
<q>O bleſſed God! if it be thy holy will, may my exit be like his!</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to Mr. Whitefield's telling ſtories in the pulpit, ſome perhaps may find fault; but beſide, that he had an uncommon fund of paſſages, proper enough to be thus told, and a peculiar talent of telling them; it was certainly, a mean of drawing multitudes to hear him, who would not have attended to the truths of the Goſpel, delivered in the ordinary manner.</p>
               <p>His concern for his countrymen, his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and his own relations, made him forget all bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakneſs, (to which about this time he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubject) and readily to comply with invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations given to preach at Painſwick, Chaltenham, Eveſham, Badſey, Strou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, Chafford, places abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with inhabitants, and where there is ground to hope, many received much ſpiritual benefit. To wander thus about from place to place; to ſtand in bowling-greens, at market-croſſes, and in highways, eſpecially in his own country, where had he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with fleſh and blood, he might have lived at eaſe; to be blamed by friends; and have every evil thing ſpoken againſt him by his enemies; was (eſpecially when his body was weak, and his ſpirits, low) very trying; but ſtill he was inwardly ſupported.</p>
               <p>April 21. He again went to Oxford, and after ſtaying a few days with the Methodiſts there, came
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013298_0058_0F904F6EE65B4A48"/>
to London, where he attempted to preach at Iſlington church, the incumbent, Mr. Stonehouſe, being a friend to the Methodiſts; but in the midſt of the prayers, the church-warden came and demanded his licence, or otherwiſe he forbad his preaching in that pulpit. He might perhaps have inſiſted on his right to preach, yet for peace ſake he declined; and after the communion ſervice was over, he preached in the church-yard.</p>
               <p>Opportunities of preaching in a more regular way being now denied him, and his preaching in the fields being attended with a remarkable bleſſing, he judged it his duty to go on in this practice, and ventured the following Sunday into Moorfields. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic notice having been given, and the thing being new and ſingular, upon coming out of the coach, he found an incredible number of people aſſembled. Many had told him, that he ſhould never come again out of that place alive. He went in, however, between two of his friends, who, by the preſſure of the crowd, were ſoon parted entirely from him, and were obliged to leave him to the mercy of the rabble. But theſe, inſtead of hurting him, formed a lane for him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him along to the middle of the Fields, (where a table had been placed, which was broken in pieces by the crowd) and afterwards back again to the wall that then parted the upper and lower Moorfields; from whence he preached without moleſtation, to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great multitude in the lower Fields. Finding ſuch encouragement, he went that ſame evening to Kennington-Common, a large open place, near three miles diſtant from London, where he preached to a vaſt multitude, who were all attention, and behaved with as much regularity and quietneſs, as if they had been in a church <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>FOR ſeveral months after this, Moorfields, Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington-Common, and Blackheath, were the chief ſcenes of action. At a moderate computation, the auditories often conſiſted of above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. It is ſaid, their ſinging could be heard two miles off, and his voice near a mile. Sometimes there were upwards of a hundred coaches, beſides waggons, ſcaffolds, and other contrivances, which particular perſons let out for the convenience of the audience. Having no other method to take, he was obliged to collect for the Orphan-houſe in the fields, or not at all, which was humbling to him and his friends, who aſſiſted him in that work. But the readineſs with which the people gave, and the prayers which they put up when throwing in their mites, were very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Once upwards of twenty pounds were collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in halfpence.</q>
M. S.</note>. In the mean while, Mr. John Weſley was labouring with great zeal at Briſtol, his brother Mr. Charles, in London and elſewhere, Mr. Ingham had been preaching in many churches of Yorkſhire, Mr. Kinchin in Oxford, and Mr. Rogers in Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire. Thus the ſeed ſown was gradually increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the embargo which was now laid on the ſhipping, gave him leiſure for more journeys through various parts of England; and God was pleaſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>wn his labours with amazing ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Some demur happening in Briſtol, he went there a few days; put Mr. John Weſley (who had now
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013298_0060_0F904F70AEAC3630"/>
made a progreſs in building the Kingſwood ſchool, and alſo had begun a room at Briſtol) in full power; and took him along with him, and introduced him as a field preacher, at Glouceſter and other places. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where the word ſeemed to ſink deeper and deeper into the hearts of the hearers. Singing and praying were heard in Kingſwood, inſtead of curſing and ſwearing; and in many other places the fruits of righteouſneſs evidently appeared.</p>
               <p>Many falſe reports were now ſpread abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. Not a journey he could make, but he was either killed or wounded, or died ſuddenly. One groundleſs fiction was continually invented after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the Biſhop of London laid hold of this occaſion for publiſhing a charge to his clergy, to avoid the extremes of enthuſiaſm and lukewarmneſs. But amidſt theſe diſcouragements, he was not left without the countenance and friendſhip of ſeveral perſons of influence.</p>
               <p>The embargo being taken off, and upwards of a thouſand pounds collected for the Orphan-houſe, he ſailed the ſecond time for America, Auguſt 14, 1739, with a family conſiſting of eight men, one boy, and two children, beſides his friend Mr. Seward.</p>
               <p>After a paſſage of nine weeks <note n="*" place="bottom">For the manner in which he employed his time on board, ſee his Journals and Letters of this period. A little before he ſailed, he finiſhed his Anſwer to the Biſhop of London's Paſtoral letter. And during the voyage, he wrote his Letter to the Religious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of England. See vol. IV. of his works.</note>, he arrived at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia in the beginning of November, and was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately invited to preach in the churches, to which people of all denominations thronged, as in England. From thence he was invited to New-York, by Mr. Noble, the only perſon with whom he had any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in that part of America. Upon his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013298_0061_0F904F71320C5508"/>
they waited on the Commiſſary; but he refuſed him the uſe of his church. Mr. Whitefield, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, preached in the fields, and on the evening of the ſame day, to a very thronged and attentive audience in the Rev. Mr. Pemberton's meeting-houſe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to do ſo twice or thrice a day for above a week; and by all that could be judged, with very great ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>On his way to and from Philadelphia, he alſo preached at Elizabeth-Town, Maidenhead, Abingdon, Neſhamini, Burlington, and New-Brunſwick, in the New-Jerſeys, to ſome thouſands gathered from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts, among whom there had been a conſiderable awakening, by the inſtrumentality of one Mr. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linghauſen, a Dutch Miniſter, and the Meſſrs. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, Blair and Rowland. He had alſo the pleaſure of meeting with old Mr. Tennent, as well as his ſons, and with Mr. Dickinſon.
<q>Mr. Tennent, and his brethren in preſbytery, intend breeding up gracious youths for our Lord's vineyard. The place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the young men ſtudy now, is a log-houſe, about twenty feet long, and near as many broad. From this deſpiſed place, ſeven or eight worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Jeſus have lately been ſent forth, and a foundation is now laying for the inſtruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. The work, I am perſuaded, is of God, and therefore will not come to nought<note n="*" place="bottom">Journals, Nov. 22, 1739.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The event has verified his judgment about this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. It is now a large College at Princeton in New-Jerſeys; and has already had many worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, (ſome of whoſe names are well known in the learned world) ſuch as Mr. Dickinſon, Mr. Burr, Mr. Jonathan Edwards, Mr. Samuel Davies, Dr. Finley, and at preſent Dr. Witherſpoon, by whoſe abilities, care, and activity, it is, under Providence, in a very flouriſhing condition.</p>
               <p>And there has been lately, (ſummer 1770) a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable revival of religion among the ſtudents, both in the college and grammar ſchool.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:013298_0062_0F904F71E5395F88"/>It was no leſs pleaſing than ſtrange to him, to ſee ſuch gatherings in a foreign land; Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhedding tears; ſinners ſtruck with awe; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſons, who had been much run down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, filled with joy. Mean time, the Orphan-houſe affairs went on well. The things brought from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, were ſold for their benefit. A ſloop was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, of which Captain Gladman was maſter; and a young man, who had lately received ſerious impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions under Mr. Whitefield's preaching, willingly offered himſelf as mate. Many little preſents were made to his family for ſea ſtores, and the intended houſe. And about the end of November, he took his leave of his family, and ordered them to proceed in their voyage to Savannah, while himſelf, with Mr. Seward and two more, determined to go thither by land.</p>
               <p>Numbers followed, ſome twenty, ſome ſixty miles out from Philadelphia. He preached at Cheſter, Wilmington, Newcaſtle, (where he was met on the way by Mr. Roſs, Miniſter of the place) Chriſtian-Bridge, and Whitely-Creek, where Mr. William Tennent (whoſe meeting-houſe is in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) had erected a tent for him. Here he obſerved new ſcenes of field-preaching, or rather preaching in the woods, opened to him. At Whitely-Creek, perhaps the congregation did not conſiſt of leſs than ten thouſand. Earneſt invitations were given him to come and preach elſewhere; which he had great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to do, from the viſible ſucceſs of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but he haſted to be with his family at Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</p>
               <p>In his way thither, he alſo preached in Maryland, at North-Eaſt and Joppa, and at Annapolis, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, where he was received with much civility by the Governor; and at Upper-Marlborough.</p>
               <p>In Virginia alſo, he preached at Williamſburgh, where he was courteouſly received by the Governor,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013298_0063_0F904F730A5051E0"/>
and by Mr. Blair the Commiſſary, whom he ſpeaks of with great regard.</p>
               <p>When he came to North-Carolina, he thought it ſeemed to be the greateſt waſte, and the moſt uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated of ſpots, both in a temporal and ſpiritual ſenſe. Yet here, in a place called Newburn-Town, his preaching was attended with an uncommon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. And it was not without effect at Newton on Cape-Fear River, where were many from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land amongſt the congregation, who had lately come over to ſettle in North-Carolina.</p>
               <p>Immediately on coming into South-Carolina pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, (he ſays) a viſible change was obſervable in the manners of the people. And when he came to Charleſtown, (which was on Saturday, January 3, 1740) he could ſcarce believe but he was amongſt Londonners, both in reſpect of gaiety of dreſs, and politeneſs of manners.</p>
               <p>Here he ſoon perceived, that by field-preaching he had loſt his old friend the Commiſſary, who once promiſed to defend him with life and fortune. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at the requeſt of the Independent Miniſter, (who continued his friend to his dying day) he preached in his meeting-houſe. At the firſt ſermon, all was gay and trifling, no impreſſion ſeemingly made at all. But next morning in the French church, the ſcene was quite altered. A viſible, and almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal concern appeared. Many of the inhabitants earneſtly deſired him to give them one ſermon more; for which purpoſe he was prevailed upon to put off his journey till the next day; and there was reaſon to think his ſtay was not in vain.</p>
               <p>Next morning, he and his companions ſet out in an open canoe for Savannah; and in their way, for the firſt time, lay in the woods, upon the ground, near a large fire, which keeps off the wild beaſts; upon which he makes this reflection,
<q>An emblem,

I thought, of the divine love and preſence keeping off evils and corruptions from the ſoul <note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On his arrival at Savannah, January 11, he was very happy to meet his family, who had got there three weeks before him; and to find by letters from England, New-York, &amp;c. that the work of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered. But it was a melancholy thing to ſee the colony of Georgia reduced even to a much lower ebb than when he left it, and almoſt deſerted by all but ſuch as could not well go away. Employing theſe, therefore, he thought would be of ſingular ſervice, and the money expended, might be alſo a means of keeping them in the colony.</p>
               <p>Before his arrival, Mr. Haberſham had pitched upon a plot of ground for the Orphan-houſe, of 500 acres, about ten miles from Savannah, and had already begun to clear and ſtock it. The orphans, in the mean time, were accommodated in a hired houſe. On this, many years after, he makes the following reflections:
<q>Had I proceeded according to the rules of prudence, I ſhould have firſt cleared the land, built the houſe, and then taken in the orphans; but I found their condition ſo pitiable, and the inhabitants ſo poor, that I immediately opened an infirmary, hired a large houſe at a great rent, and took in at different times, twenty-four orphans. To all this I was encouraged, by the example of Profeſſor Franck. But I forgot to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, that Profeſſor Franck built in Glaucha, in a populous country, and that I was building in the very tail of the world, where I could not expect the leaſt ſupply, and which the badneſs of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which every day I expected would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, rendered by far the moſt expenſive part of all his Majeſty's dominions. But had I received more and ventured leſs, I ſhould have ſuffered leſs, and others more <note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:013298_0065_0F904F751C00E648"/>The firſt collection he made in America, was at the Rev. Mr. Smith's meeting-houſe in Charleſtown, whither he went about the middle of March, to ſee his brother, the Captain of a ſhip from England. He was deſired by ſome of the inhabitants, to ſpeak in behalf of the poor orphans; and the collection amounted to ſeventy pounds ſterling. This was no ſmall encouragement to him at that time, eſpecially as he had reaſon to think it came from thoſe who had received ſpiritual benefit by his miniſtrations.</p>
               <p>Having returned to Savannah, he went to the ſpot of ground, where he intended the Orphan-houſe ſhould be built, and upon the 25th day of March, 1740, laid the firſt brick of the great houſe, which he called <hi>Betheſda,</hi> i. e. <hi>a houſe of mercy.</hi> Long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he writes,
<q>Bleſſed be God, I have not been diſappointed in the hope, that it would be a houſe and place of mercy to many, both in reſpect to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul <note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
By this time, near forty children were taken in, to be provided with food and raiment; and counting the workmen and all, he had near a hundred to be daily fed. He had very little money in bank; and yet he was not diſcouraged, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the beſt thing he could do at preſent for the infant colony, was to carry on the work.</p>

               <p>MR. Whitefield again, therefore, ſet off in a ſloop for Newcaſtle in Pennſylvania, where he arrived about the middle of April. In this ſhort paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ten days, he was much diſcouraged both by weakneſs of body, and low ſpirits. But, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved afterwards, Providence was infinitely better to him than his fears, and exceeded his moſt ſanguine expectations. For during the ſpace of two months, he was ſtrengthened to preach, generally twice, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, beſides travelling, thrice a day. At Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, the churches were no longer allowed him; but he preached in the fields to congregations that conſiſted ſometimes of near ten thouſand, and with great apparent ſucceſs. Large collections were made for the Orphan-houſe; once, not leſs than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten pounds ſterling. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Some were wrought upon in a more inſtantaneous, others in a more progreſſive, ſome in a more ſilent, others in a more violent manner <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>At New-York, New-Brunſwick, Statten-Iſland, Baſkenridge, Whitely-Creek, Frogs-Manor, Reedy-Iſland, there was great concern upon the minds both of the preacher and hearers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:013298_0067_0F904F78031ED018"/>Sometimes he was almoſt dead with heat and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. Thrice a day he was lifted up upon his horſe, unable to mount otherwiſe; then rode and preached, and came in and laid himſelf along upon two or three chairs. He did not doubt but ſuch a courſe would ſoon take him to his deſired reſt. Yet he had many delightful hours with Meſſrs, Tennents, Blair, &amp;c.
<q>Night, ſays he, was as it were turned into day, when we rode ſinging through the woods. I could not help recommending theſe men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I went, in the ſtrongeſt manner, beeauſe I ſaw they gloried in the croſs of Chriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In a journal written by Mr. William Seward, (Mr. Whitefield's companion in travel) we have the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars belonging to this period.</p>
               <p>April 9, 1740. Mr. Whitefield propoſed my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to England upon ſeveral important affairs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to bring over Mr. Hutchins to take care of the Orphan-houſe in his abſence—To acquaint the Truſtees of Georgia with the ſtate of the colony, and the means, under God, for the better eſtabliſhment thereof, it being now upheld al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly by the ſoldiery and Orphan-houſe, moſt of the people who are unconcerned in either, being gone or going—The proper means are principally three, 1. An allowance of negroes. 2. A free title to the lands. 3. An independent magiſtracy, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are able and willing to ſerve without fee or reward. My buſineſs with the Truſtees will be farther, to bring over the money, lodged in their hands for building the church at Savannah. I am, moreover, to collect ſubſcriptions for a Negroe ſchool in Pennſylvania, where our brother Whitefield propoſes to take up land, in order to ſettle a town for the reception of ſuch Engliſh friends, whoſe hearts God ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to come and ſettle there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:013298_0068_0F904F794E2E7E40"/>April 13. Mr. Tennent informed us of the great ſucceſs which had attended our brother Whitefield's preaching, when here laſt. For ſome time, a general ſilence was fixed by the Lord on people's minds, and many began ſeriouſly to think on what foundation they ſtood—A general out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reformation has been viſible. Many miniſters have been quickened in their zeal to preach the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. Congregations are increaſed, and ſome few, it is hoped, will be brought, through their convictions, into a ſound and ſaving converſion.</p>
               <p>April 14. Mr. Jones, the Baptiſt miniſter, told us of two other miniſters, Mr. Treat and Mr. Morgan, who were ſo affected with our brother Whitefield's ſpirit, that the latter had gone forth, preaching the glad tidings of ſalvation, towards the ſea-coaſt in the Jerſeys, and many other places which lay in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death. The former told his congregation, that he had been hitherto deceiving himſelf and them; and that he could not preach to them at preſent, but deſired they would join in prayer with him.</p>
               <p>April 15. We were informed, that an Indian trader was ſo affected with brother Whitefield's doctrine, that he is gone to teach the Indians, with whom he uſed to trade.</p>
               <p>April 18. This day was publiſhed our brother Whitefield's Letter to the Inhabitants of Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, about their abuſe of the poor negroes <note n="*" place="bottom">See his works, vol. IV.</note>.</p>
               <p>Heard of a drinking club that had a negroe boy attending them, who uſed to mimic people for their diverſion. The Gentlemen bid him mimic our brother Whitefield, which he was very unwilling to do; but they inſiſting upon it, he ſtood up and ſaid, 'I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, I lie not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013298_0069_0F904F796C4A64E8"/>
you repent you will all be damned.' This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſpeech broke up the club, which has not met ſince.</p>
               <p>—Notice was given of a new lecture at Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Town every Thurſday, by four Miniſters.</p>
               <p>April 22. Agreed with Mr. Allen for five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand acres of land on the forks of Delaware, at 2200 l. ſterling, the conveyance to be made to Mr. Whitefield, and after that aſſigned to me, as ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for my advancing the money. Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field propoſes to give orders for building the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe ſchool on the purchaſed land, before he leaves the province.</p>
               <p>April 24. Came to Chriſtopher Wigner's plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Skippack, where many Dutch people are ſettled, and where the famous Mr. Spalemburg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided lately. It was ſurprizing to ſee ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people gathered together in ſuch a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs country, thirty miles diſtant from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. —Our brother was exceedingly carried out in his ſermon, to preſs poor ſinners to come to Chriſt by faith, and claim all their privileges, <hi>viz.</hi> Not only righteouſneſs and peace, but joy in the Holy Ghoſt: and after he had done, our dear friend Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Boehler preached in Dutch, to thoſe who could not underſtand our brother in Engliſh.</p>
               <p>Before our brother left Philadelphia, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to viſit one who was under a deep ſenſe of ſin from hearing him preach. And in praying with this perſon, he was ſo carried beyond himſelf, that the whole company (which were about twenty) ſeemed to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the God of heaven.</p>
               <p>April 25. Roſe at three o'clock; and though our brother Whitefield was very weak in body, yet the Lord enabled him to ride near fifty miles, and to preach to about five thouſand people at Amwell, with the ſame power as uſual.—Mr. Gilbert Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013298_0070_0F904F7C043E0770"/>
Mr. Rowland, Mr. Wales, and Mr. Campbell, four godly Miniſters, met us here.</p>
               <p>April 26. Came to New-Brunſwick.—Met Mr. Noble from New-York, a zealous promoter of our Lord's kingdom. He ſaid their ſociety at New-York was increaſed from ſeventy, to one hundred and ſeventy, and was daily increaſing; and that Meſſrs. Gilbert and William Tennents, Mr. Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſeveral others, were hard labourers in our Lord's vineyard.</p>
               <p>April 28. Had a moſt affectionate parting with our dear brother Whitefield, and our other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren<note n="*" place="bottom">The reſt of Mr. Seward's journal was written moſtly during his paſſage to England, where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived June 19, and with which it concludes.

<q>April 28, 1740. This was the laſt time I ſaw my worthy friend; for, before my return to England, he was entered into his reſt, having left behind, a glorious teſtimony of the transforming efficacy of converting grace.

               <p>With great joy he reached Savannah on the 5th of June, bringing his orphans, in money and proviſions, upwards of five hundred pounds ſterling. Next day, when they came to public worſhip, young and old were all diſſolved in tears. Some, who came to viſit them, were alſo deeply impreſſed; particularly Mr. Hugh Bryan and his family, and ſome <note n="†" place="bottom">For a more particular account of Mr. Bryan's family, and of his viſit to Mr. Whitefield, and what followed upon it, See No. I. of Living Chriſtianity delineated in the Diaries and letters of Mr. Hugh Bryan and Mrs. Mary Hutſon.

Several from Beauford in South-Carolina, then received their firſt impreſſions. All theſe things gave him great encouragement. And though his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was now great, (near a hundred and fifty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding workmen) and the plan laid down would have required ſome thouſands to ſupport it; and although very often he had not twenty pounds in caſh, he was ſtill kept from being diſheartened; and his friends, believing the work to be of God, continued cheerfully to aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Though he was very weak in body, yet the cry from various quarters for more preaching, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſupplying ſo large a family, made him go again to Charleſtown, where, as well as at Dorcheſter, Aſhley-Ferry, Ponpon, and John's-Iſland, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to very attentive and affected auditories. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtown was the place of the greateſt ſucceſs, and of the greateſt oppoſition. The Commiſſary poured out his anathemas, refuſed to give him the ſacrament, and publiſhed ſome letters againſt him. But all in vain. He preached twice almoſt every day, to great crowds, in the independent and Baptiſt meeting-houſes; beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding in the evening in merchants houſes. Thus he went on ſucceſsfully (though often ready to die with the exceſſive heat) till the end of Auguſt: when having received moſt preſſing invitations from the Rev. Dr. Colman, and Mr. Cooper, miniſters in Boſton; and being deſirous of ſeeing the deſcendants of the good old Puritans, and their ſeats of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and having encouragement that ſomething might be done for the Orphan-houſe, he embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Orphan-houſe ſloop for New-England, in company with ſeveral Charleſtown friends; and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Rhode-ſland, September 14.</p>
               <p>Here ſeveral Gentlemen ſoon came to viſit him, among whom was the Rev. Mr. Clap, an aged diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting miniſter, in whom he thought he ſaw what manner of men the old Puritans were who firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013298_0072_0F904F7D360A2AE0"/>
New-England, and was much delighted with his converſation. They went together to the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent's houſe, to aſk the uſe of the church, which was granted; and in it he preached three days, twice a day, to deeply affected auditories.</p>
               <p>This he thought was a happy entrance into New-England. But he was ſtill more agreeably ſurpriſed, when, before he got to Boſton, he was met ſeveral miles from the city, by the governor's ſon, and ſome of the miniſters, and principal inhabitants, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to Mr. St—nf—rd's (brother-in-law to Dr. Colman) who, with his colleague Mr. Cooper, and many others, came and joined in prayer.</p>
               <p>Jonathan Belcher, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was then Governor of the Maſſachuſett's colony, and Joſiah Willard, Secretary. Both theſe Gentlemen were his ſincere friends, ſo were the Miniſters, Meſſrs. Web, Foxcraft, Prince, Dr. Sewald, Gee, &amp;c. To avoid, however, giving any juſt offence, he went to the Engliſh church to morning prayers; but finding, by converſation with the Commiſſary, and ſome other clergy, that there was no acceſs there, he began preaching in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, at Dr. Colman's meeting-houſe, and ſo went round (except when he preached on the common) to the other meeting-houſes, eſpecially the largeſt of them, for ſome time together.</p>
               <p>Governor Belcher, generally attended; Secretary Willard, and ſeveral of the Council, ſet the ſame example; and all ſeemed to vie who ſhould ſhow the greateſt reſpect. Congregations were exceeding large, both within and without; and were much affected. Old Mr. Walter, who ſucceeded Mr. Elliot, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the apoſtle of the Indians, at Roxbury, ſaid it was Puritaniſm revived; and Dr. Colman ſaid, when preaching at his meeting-houſe the Sunday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that
<q>it was the happieſt day he ever ſaw in his life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:013298_0073_0F904F7E275B4970"/>He preached alſo at Cambridge, Marblehead, Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Newbury, Hampton, York, Portſmouth, Salem, and Moulden, to large congregations. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the greateſt repute had their houſes open, in every place; collections were readily made for the orphans: and, in about a week, having preached ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times, and rode a hundred and ſeventy miles, he returned to Boſton, October 6.</p>
               <p>Here the congregations were ſtill increaſed. At his farewell ſermon, it was ſuppoſed there were near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand people. He received a great number of letters, and could have ſpent whole days in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with thoſe that came to him under ſoul concern. Miniſters and ſtudents attended. Little children were impreſſed. The contributions for the orphans were very conſiderable, amounting, in town and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to near five hundred pounds ſterling.</p>
               <p>He ſet out next for Northampton: having read in England, an account of a remarkable work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there, publiſhed by their Paſtor the Rev. Mr. Jonathan Edwards; and having a great deſire to ſee him, and to hear the account from his own mouth.</p>
               <p>At Concord, Sudbury, Marlborough, Worcheſter, Leiceſter, Hadley, places all lying in the way, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits and houſes were every where opened, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued influence attended his preaching. At Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton, when he came to remind them of what God had formerly done for them, it was like putting fire to tinder. Both Miniſter and people were much moved; as were the children of the family, at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation which their father deſired Mr. Whitefield to give them.</p>
               <p>After leaving Northampton, he preached in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Springfield, Suffield Windſor, Hertford, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield, Middleton, and Wallingford, to large and affected congregations. And October 23, reached Newhaven, where he was affectionately received by
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013298_0074_0F904F7EA5F8CF58"/>
Mr. Pierpont, brother-in-law to Mr. Edwards, and had the pleaſure of ſeeing his friend Mr. Noble of New-York, who brought him letters from Georgia. Here alſo he was much refreſhed with the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſeveral Goſpel Miniſters. It being aſſembly time, and the Governor and Burgeſſes then ſitting he ſtayed till Lord's-day, and had the pleaſure to ſee numbers daily impreſſed, The good old Governor was particularly much affected; and at a private viſit which Mr. Whitefield paid him, ſaid,
<q>Thanks be to God, for ſuch refreſhings in our way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday morning he ſet forward, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with uſual ſucceſs at Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Newark, and Stanford, where he was viſited by ſome Miniſters under deep concern.</p>
               <p>This was on the borders of New-York province, into which he now again entered, and preached at Rye and Kingſbridge, on his way to the city of New-York, where he arrived October 30. Here for three days ſucceſſively, and afterwards at Statten-Iſland, Newark, Baſkenridge, his preaching appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be attended, with more ſucceſs than ever. At Trenton he had a long conference with ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters about Mr. Gilbert Tenent's complying with an invitation to go and preach in New-England. After prayer, and conſidering the arguments both for and againſt this propoſal, they thought it beſt he ſhould go; which, however diffident of himſelf, he was perſuaded to do. And his miniſtrations were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an extraordinary bleſſing to multitudes, as is particularly narrated elſewhere <note n="*" place="bottom">See Prince's Chriſtian Hiſtory, or, hiſtorical collections of the ſucceſs of the Goſpel, vol. II. where the facts are ſet down in the order of time.</note>.</p>
               <p>About this time Mr. Whitefield wrote his Letter to ſome church-members of the Preſbyterian perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

You raiſed our expectations of him very much, as did his Journals more, and Mr. P. of New-York, concurred with them; but we own now, that we have ſeen and heard him, that our expectations are all anſwered and exceeded, not only in his zealous, and fervent, abounding labours, but in the command of the hearts, and affections of his hearers.—He has been received here as an angel of God, and fervant of Jeſus Chriſt.—I hope this viſit to us, will be of very great uſe and benefit to Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He has found his heart and mouth much opened to ſpeak freely and boldly to us, and he finds it received with joy.</p>

               <p>The ſame Gentleman, November 29, 1740, writes thus:—
<q>Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field left us ſeven weeks ago; the laſt week we heard of him at Philadelphia. I heard that much of the preſence of God is with him. He has left a bleſſing behind him, we hope with us. Our people, high and low, old and young, are very ſwift to hear. The excellent meekneſs of Mr. Whitefield's anſwer to the queriſts, will honour him to you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another, in a Letter, October 22, 1740. expreſſes himſelf thus: <q>Though it is always a ſingular
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013298_0076_0F904F80317B9A40"/>
pleaſure to me to hear from you, yet your two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by Mr. Whitefield, had a new circumſtance of pleaſure from the dear hand that preſented them. I perceive you was impatient to know what ſort of entering in he had among us. We (Miniſters, rulers, and people) generally received him as an angel of God. When he preached his farewell ſermon in our common, there were twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three thouſand, at a moderate computation. We are abundantly convinced, that you ſpoke the words of truth and ſoberneſs in your ſermon relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, ſuch a power and preſence of God with a preacher, and in religious aſſemblies, I never ſaw before; but I would not limit the Holy One of Iſrael. The prejudices of many are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and expectations of others vaſtly outdone, as they freely own. A conſiderable number are awakened, and many chriſtians ſeem to be greatly quickened. He has preached twice at Cambridge; he has one warm friend there, Mr. —, the tutor, who has followed him to Northampton, and will, for what I know, to Georgia. But Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field has not a warmer friend any where, than the firſt man among us. Our Governor has ſhewn him the higheſt reſpect, carried him in his coach from place to place, and could not help following him fifty miles out of town. I hope the religion of the country will fare the better for the impreſſions left on him.</q>
—The ſame Gentleman writes, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 2, 1740,
<q>The man greatly beloved, I ſuppoſe, may be with you before now. That his viſit here will be eſteemed a diſtinguiſhing mercy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by many, I am well ſatisfied. Every day gives me freſh proofs of Chriſt's ſpeaking in him. A ſmall ſet of Gentlemen amongſt us, when they ſaw the affections of the people ſo moved under his preaching, would attribute it only to the force of ſound and geſtures. But the impreſſions on
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:013298_0077_0F904F80E78566B0"/>
many are ſo laſting, and have been ſo transforming as to carry plain ſignatures of a divine hand going along with him.—Another Gentleman writes, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 21, 1740, and thanks me for recommending to him, ſo worthy a perſon as the Rev. Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, who has preached Chriſt, and the great truths of the Goſpel among them, with remarkable fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſpirit, and to a general acceptance, and hopes that there are many awakened by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. —Another of the ſame date writes, That he had conceived very highly of him by ſome clauſes in my private letters, and the ſermon I preached by way of apology, &amp;c. but confeſſes he had not gone high enough in his opinion of him, and that his expectations are more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in him.—Another, November 21, 1740, bleſſes God that he was ſent thither; that he had ſo many opportunities of ſeeing him, and ſitting under his miniſtry. That he appeared to him a wonderful man indeed; that his preaching was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a divine power, and energy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any man's he had ever heard before: and the effects of his miniſtry were very marvellous among them.—I ſhall conclude with the following paſſage of another Gentleman, in a letter of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1, 1740. I received yours by the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, with whom I coveted a great deal more private converſation than I had opportunity for, by reaſon of the throngs of people almoſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with him. But he appears to be full of the love of God, and fired with an extraordinary zeal for the cauſe of Chriſt, and applies himſelf with the moſt indefatigable diligence, that ever was ſeen among us, for the promoting the good of ſouls. His head, his heart, his hands ſeem to be full of his Maſter's buſineſs. His diſcourſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he goes into the expoſitory way, are very entertaining. Every eye is fixed upon him,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:013298_0078_0F904F822E7FBF60"/>
and every ear chained to his lips. Moſt are very much affected; many are awakened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; and a general ſeriouſneſs excited. His addreſs more eſpecially to the paſſions, is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and beyond what I have ever ſeen. I think I can truly ſay, that his preaching has quickened me, and I believe it has many others beſides, as well as the people. Several of my flock, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the younger ſort, have been brought under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions by his preaching; and there is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable amongſt them of the good effect of his preaching, that the word now preached by us, ſeems more precious to them, and comes with more power upon them. My prayer for him is, that his precious life may be lengthened out, and that he may be an inſtrument of reviving dying religion in all places whitherſoever he comes, who ſeems to be wonderfully fitted for, as well as ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Saturday November 8, Mr. Whitefield came back to Philadelphia, and next day preached to ſeveral thouſands in a houſe built for that purpoſe, ſince his laſt departure. Here he both heard of, and ſaw many, who were the fruits of former miniſtrations; and continued among them till November 17, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice a day. Afterwards he preached in Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Greenwich, Piles-Grove, Cohenſie, Salem, Newcaſtle, Whitely-Creek, Fog's Manor, Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; in many or moſt of which places, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were numerous and deeply affected.</p>
               <p>November 22, he got to Bohemia in Maryland, and from thence he went to Reedy-Iſland. At both places his preaching was attended with great influence. And at laſt (their ſloop being detained by contrary winds near a week) he preached frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All the Captains and crews of the ſhips that were wind-bound conſtantly attended, and great numbers crowded out of the country, ſome as far as from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia:
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013298_0079_0F904F8269739E38"/>
and as great concern as ever came upon their minds.</p>
               <p>December 1, he ſet ſail from Reedy-Iſland for Charleſtown in South-Carolina, and here he makes the following remark:
<q>It is now the ſeventy-fifth day, ſince I arrived at Rhode-Iſland. My body was then weak, but the Lord has much renewed its ſtrength. I have been enabled to preach, I think an hundred and ſeventy-five times in public, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides exhorting frequently in private. I have travelled upwards of eight hundred miles, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upwards of ſeven hundred pounds ſterling in goods, proviſions and money, for the Georgia orphans. Never did I perform my journeys with ſo little fatigue, or ſee ſuch continuance of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence in the congregations to whom I have preached. Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoul<note n="*" place="bottom">Journals, December 1, 1740.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After a pleaſant paſſage of eight or nine days, and preaching again at Charleſtown and Savannah, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the 14th of December at the Orphan-houſe, where he found his family comfortably ſettled. At Rhode-Iſland he had providentially met with one Mr. Jonathan Barber, whoſe heart was very much knit to him, and who was willing to help him at the Orphan-houſe. Him, therefore, he left ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent for the ſpiritual, and Mr. Haberſham for the temporal affairs; and having ſpent a very comfortable Chriſtmas with his orphan family, he ſet off again for <note n="†" place="bottom">At Charleſtown, the Commiſſary was going to proceed againſt him for correcting and preparing for the preſs, a letter written by Mr. Hugh B—n, in which it was hinted, that the clergy break their canons. He alſo laid him under ſuſpenſion for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to uſe the form of prayer, preſcribed in the communion book, when officiating in a diſſenting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.—But Mr. Whitefield gave ſecurity for his appearance, and appealed home.</note> Charleſtown, where he arrived January 3, 1741,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013298_0080_0F904F832D3739D0"/>
and preached twice every day as uſual, to moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate auditories, till the ſixteenth of January, when he went on board for England. He arrived the 11th of March at Falmouth, rode poſt to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and preached at Kennington Common the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> From his Arrival in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> in the Year 1741, to his leaving <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> the ſame Year.</head>
               <p>THE new and unexpected ſituation in which he now found himſelf, will be beſt deſcribed in his own words:
<q>But what a trying ſcene appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here! In my zeal, during my journey through America, I had written two well-meant, though injudicious letters, againſt England's two great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> and Archbiſhop Tillotſon, who, I ſaid, knew no more of religion than Mahomet. The Moravians had made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads upon the ſocieties. Mr. John Weſley, ſome way or other, had been prevailed on to preach and print in favour of perfection, and univerſal redemption; and very ſtrongly againſt election, a doctrine, which I thought, and do now believe was taught me of God, therefore could not poſſible recede from. Thinking it my duty ſo to do, I had written an anſwer at the Orphan-houſe, which though reviſed, and much approved of by ſome good and judicious divines, I think had ſome too ſtrong expreſſions about abſolute reprobation, which the Apoſtle leaves rather to be inferred, than expreſt. The world was angry at me for the former, and numbers of my own ſpiritual children for the latter. One that got ſome hundreds of pounds by my ſermons, being led away by the Moravians, refuſed to print for me any more. And others wrote to me, that God would deſtroy me in a fortnight; and that my fall was as great as
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013298_0082_0F904F85433F6008"/>
Peter's. Inſtead of having thouſands to attend me, ſcarce one of my ſpiritual children came to ſee me from morning to night. Once at Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington-Common, I had not above a hundred to hear me. At the ſame time, I was much embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed in my outward circumſtances. A thouſand pounds I owed for the Orphan-houſe. Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty pounds bills, drawn upon Mr. Seward, now dead, were returned upon me. I was alſo threatened to be arreſted for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds more. My travelling expences alſo to be defrayed. A family of a hundred to be daily maintained, four thouſand miles off, in the deareſt place of the King's dominions. Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times would I rather have died, than part with my old friends. It would have melted any heart to have heard Mr. Charles Weſley and me weeping, after prayer, that, if poſſible, the breach might be prevented. Once I preached in the Foundery, (a place which Mr. John Weſley had procured in my abſence) on Gal. iii. but no more. All my work was to begin again. One day, I was exceedingly refreſhed in reading Beza's life of Calvin, wherein were theſe words, 'Calvin is turned out of Geneva, but behold a new church ariſes.' A Gentlewoman lent me three hundred pounds to pay the preſent Orphan-houſe demand: and a ſerious perſon (whom I never ſaw or heard of) giving me one guinea; I had ſuch confidence, that I ran down with it to a friend, and expreſſed my hope, that God who ſent this perſon with the guinea, would make it up fifteen hundred: which was the ſum I thought would be wanted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Never had I preached in Moorfields on a week day. But in the ſtrength of God, I began on Good-Friday, and continued twice a day, walking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward from Leadenhall, for ſome time preaching under one of the trees, and had the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013298_0083_0F904F857B31B790"/>
mortification of ſeeing numbers of my ſpiritual children, who but a twelvemonth ago could have plucked out their eyes for me, running by me whilſt preaching, diſdaining ſo much as to look at me, and ſome of them putting their fingers in their ears, that they might not hear one word I ſaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A like ſcene opened at Briſtol, where I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied preaching in the houſe I had founded: Buſy bodies, on both ſides, blew up the coals. A breach enſued. But as both ſides differed in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not in affection, and aimed at the glory of our common Lord; though we hearkened too much to tale-bearers on both ſides, we were kept from anathematizing each other, and went on in our uſual way; being agreed in one point, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to convert ſouls to their ever bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About this time he was ordered to attend in the Parliament Houſe, to give information concerning the ſtate of the colony in Georgia.
<q>April 10, 1741. I have been at the Parliament Houſe. The Georgia affair was adjourned. It was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a trial to be in the houſe. I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered what the Apoſtle ſaid, 'We are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſpectacle to men' My appeal will come to nothing, I believe. I have waited upon the Speaker. He received me kindly<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter CCLXXIV.</note>.</q>
Again,
<q>He treated me kindly, and aſſured me, that there would be no perſecution in this King's reign.<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter CCLXXXVI.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In conſequence of this, one Mr. Cennick, a preacher, who could not fall in with Mr. Weſley's ſentiments, and one or two more in like circumſtances, having joined Mr. Whitefield, they began a new houſe in Kingſwood, and ſoon eſtabliſhed a ſchool among them, that favoured Calviniſtical principles. And here, and in ſeveral other places, they preached
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013298_0084_0F904F86408A4E40"/>
to very large and ſerious congregations, in the ſame manner as he had done in America.</p>
               <p>Thither he intended to return as ſoon as poſſible. Mean time, it being inconvenient, on account of the weather, to preach morning and evening in Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields; ſome free-grace Diſſenters, (who ſtood by him cloſely in that time of trial) got the loan of a piece of ground, and engaged with a carpenter to build a large temporary ſhed, to ſcreen the auditory from cold and rain, which he called a Tabernacle, as it was only intended to be made uſe of for a few months, during his ſtay in his native country. The place fixed upon, was very near the Foundery, which he diſliked, becauſe he thought it looked like erecting altar againſt altar; but upon this occaſion he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
<q>All was wonderfully over-ruled for good, and for the furtherance of the Goſpel. A freſh awakening immediately began. Congregations grew exceeding large, and at the people's deſire, I ſent (neceſſity reconciling me more and more to lay-preaching) for Meſſieurs Cennick, Harris, Seagrave, Humphries, &amp;c. to aſſiſt <note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Freſh doors were now opened to him, and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſent to him from many places, where he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ver been. At a common, near Braintree in Eſſex, upwards of ten thouſand perſons attended. At Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, Dedham, Coſsleſhall, Whethersfield, Colceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Bury, Ipſwich, the congregations were very large and much affected.
<q>Sweet was the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation I had with ſeveral Miniſters of Chriſt. But our own clergy grew more and more ſhy, now they knew I was a Calviniſt; though no doubt (as Mr. Bedford told me when going to the Biſhop of London) our Articles are Calviniſtical <note n="†" place="bottom">M.

Erſkines, ſome time before <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>See his Journals, and his Letters to the Rev. Mr. R. E. and the Rev. Mr. E. E.</p>
                     <p>In his laſt to Mr. E. E. before coming to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (Letter CCLXXX) he writes,
<q>May 16, 1741. This morning, I received a kind letter from your brother Ralph, who thinks it beſt for me wholly to join the Aſſociate Preſbytery, if it ſhould pleaſe God to ſend me into Scotland. This I cannot altogether come into. I come only as an occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preacher, to preach the ſimple Goſpel to all that are willing to hear me, of whatever denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I write this, that there may not be the leaſt miſunderſtanding between us. I love and honour the Aſſociate Preſbytery in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt: but, let them not be offended, if in all things, I cannot immediately fall in with them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the ſame purpoſe he writes to Mr. R. E. May 23, 1741. Letter CCLXXXVIII.</p>
                  </note>, and he had a great deſire to ſee them. He therefore took his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from London to Leith, where (after five days which he employed in writing many execellent letters to his Orphans, &amp;c. See Letters CCCXI. to CCCXXXVII.) he arrived July 30, 1741. Several perſons of diſtinction moſt gladly received him, and would have had him preach at Edinburgh directly; but he was determined that the Rev. Meſſieurs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkines ſhould have the firſt offer; and therefore went immediately to Dumfermlin, and preached in Mr. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkine's Meeting-houſe.</p>
               <p>Great perſuaſions were uſed to detain him at Dumfermlin, and as great to keep him from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for and viſiting the Rev. Mr. Wardlaw, who had been colleague to Mr. Ralph Erſkine above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and who, as well as the Rev. Mr. David<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a diſſenting Miniſter in England, that went along
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013298_0086_0F904F86F9B10330"/>
with Mr. Whitefield, were looked upon as perjured, for not adhering to the Solemn League and Covenant. This was new language to him, and therefore unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. But that he might be better informed, it was propoſed that the Rev. Mr. Moncrief, Mr. Ebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer Erſkine, and others, members of the Aſſociate Preſbytery, ſhould convene in a few days, in order to give him farther light.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Mr. Ralph Erſkine accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him to Edinburgh, where he preached in the Orphan-houſe Park, (field-preaching being no novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Scotland) to a very large and affected auditory, upon theſe words,
<q>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
The next day he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Weſt Kirk, and expreſſed great pleaſure in hearing two Goſpel ſermons from the Rev. Mr. Guſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart, and the Rev. Mr. MacVicar. And the following day, he preached in the Cannongate church, where Mr. Ralph Erſkine went up with him into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</p>
               <p>According to promiſe, he returned with him to Dumfermlin, where Mr. Ebenezer Erſkine, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Aſſociate Preſbytery were met together. When Mr. Whitefield came, they ſoon propoſed to proceed to buſineſs. He aſked them for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? They anſwered, to diſcourſe, and ſet him right about Church Government, and the Solemn League and Covenant. He replied, they might ſave themſelves that trouble, for he had no ſcruple about it, and that ſettling Church Government, and preaching about the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was not his plan. He then told them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his experience, and how he was let into his preſent way of acting. One of them, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſaid he was deeply affected. And Mr. Ebene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer Erſkine deſired they would have patience with him, for that having been born and bred in England,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013298_0087_0F904F87D45ADC78"/>
and never ſtudied the point, he could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be perfectly acquainted with it. But Mr. M. inſiſted, that he was therefore more inexcuſeable, for England had revolted moſt with reſpect to Church Government; and that he being born and educated there, could not but be acquainted with the matter in debate. Mr. Whitefield told him, he had never yet made the Solemn League and Covenant the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſtudy, being too buſy about matters which he judged of greater importance. Several replied, that every pin of the Tabernacle was precious. He anſwered, that in every building, there were outſide and inſide workmen; that the latter, at preſent, was his province; that if they thought themſelves called to the former, they might proceed in their own way, and he would proceed in his. He then aſked them ſeriouſly, what they would have him to do? The anſwer was, that he was not deſired to ſubſcribe immediately to the Solemn League and Covenant, but to preach only for them, till he had further light. He aſked, Why only for them? Mr. Ralph Erſkine ſaid, "They were the Lord's people." He then aſked, Were no other the Lord's people but themſelves? If not, and if others were the devil's people, they had more need to be preached to; that for his part, all places were alike to him; and that if the Pope himſelf would lend his pulpit, he would gladly proclaim in it the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Something paſſed about taking two of their brethren with him to England, to ſettle Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery there; and then with two more, to go and ſettle Preſbytery in America. But he aſked, ſuppoſe a number of Independents ſhould come, and declare, that after the greateſt ſearch, they were convinced that Independency was the right Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and would diſturb no body, if tolerated; ſhould they be tolerated? They anſwered, No.—Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the company broke up. And Mr. M. preached
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013298_0088_0F904F886F397A40"/>
upon Iſ. xxi. 11, 12.
<q>Watchman, what of the night? &amp;c.</q>
And took occaſion to declaim ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the ceremonies of the Church of England, and to argue,

<q>April 20, 1742 <note n="*" place="bottom">Glaſgow Weekly Hiſtory, No. XXVII.</note>. Rev. and dear Sir, Knowing that many are careful to inform you, from time to time, what paſſes here, I have hitherto delayed anſwering your moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Letter, until I ſhould tell you with the greateſt certainty, what were the bleſſed effects of your miniſtrations amongſt us; and can now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that they were not more ſurpriſing than laſting. I don't know, or hear of any wrought upon by your miniſtry, but are holding on in the paths of truth and righteouſneſs. They ſeem poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a truly chriſtian ſpirit. Jeſus is precious to their ſouls; and like the morning light, they are advancing with increaſing brightneſs to the perfect day. Since you left Scotland, numbers in different corners have been awakened. Many in a hopeful way. Religion in this ſinful city revives and flouriſhes. Ordinances are more punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually attended on. People hear the word with gladneſs, and receive it in faith and love. New meetings for prayer and ſpiritual conference are erecting every where. Religious converſation has baniſhed ſlander and callumny from ſeveral

tea-tables, and chriſtians are not aſhamed to own their dear Lord and Maſter. Praiſe is perfected out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings; and ſome ſtout-hearted ſinners captivated to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I cannot eaſily expreſs, with what pleaſure I write theſe things; and doubtleſs, they will give you no leſs joy in reading them. Should not theſe droppings of the dew of heaven encourage our faith and hope of a plentiful effuſion of the Spirit, which will at once change our barren wilderneſs into a fruitful field? Should not this haſten your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that we may take ſweet counſel together, and enter into the houſe of God in company? You are often on our hearts. We long to ſee you face to face. May much of your great Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's preſence ever attend, and come along with you.</q>

<q>Edinburgh, Auguſt 8, 1743. As you deſired, I have with the aſſiſtance of Mr. Archibald Bowie, Mr. Dun, and the <note n="†" place="bottom">See Letter CCCCXXII.</note> ſerjeant, informed myſelf a little, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the number and ſituations of the praying ſocieties in this place, which you will take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: They are, as near as we can gueſs, between twenty-four and thirty in number, ſome of which will neceſſarily be obliged to divide, by reaſon of too many meeting together; and that will increaſe the number. Amongſt them are ſeveral meetings of boys and girls, who, in general, ſeem not only to be growing in grace, but really increaſing in knowledge. The little lambs appear to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to reſt upon duties, or any thing ſhort of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013298_0092_0F904F8C4EAEC618"/>
Chriſt; as a young Gentleman of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance told me, when under a temptation to think, that he was ſurely ſeeking ſome imaginary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, inſtead of the Saviour, he was made to cry out in prayer, 'Lord, I want nothing elſe, and will have nothing ſhort of the very Chriſt of God.' There are ſeveral meetings of young women, who (although I never, as yet, viſited any of them) I am informed, hold on very well. The ſerjeant tells me, that at one of theſe meetings, on the morning of the Lord's-day, he has known them all wet with floods of tears, melted down with love to Chriſt, and affection to one another for Chriſt's ſake. I have myſelf been much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed (when in a meeting in the room below, where ſome of theſe reſort) to hear them ſing the Lord's praiſes with ſuch melodious voices. There are numbers of young men who meet for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent purpoſe of glorifying God, and promoting chriſtian knowledge; amongſt ſome of whom I have the honour to be a member; many of them are Divines, who are uſeful in inſtructing the weaker ſort of us; and that they endeavour to do with the greateſt anxiety and deſire. A good number of old men, ſubſtantial, ſtanding chriſtians, meet for their edification and inſtruction (the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their God being always their chief end) and are thereby often revived, and very much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The generality of theſe ſorts, above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do walk very circumſpectly, and really make it appear to the world, that they have been with Jeſus: which is very much evidenced in their chearfully bearing reproaches for Chriſt's ſake. And upon the whole, we hope there is ſuch a flame kindled, as ſhall never be extinguiſhed. And with reſpect to two particular ſocieties, whereof Mr. Bowie is a member, he gave me

                        <p>To Mr. Muir.
<q>Edinburgh, Auguſt 6, 1743. As you deſire a ſhort account of the two ſocieties I am concerned in, I ſhall give it in a very few words. They conſiſt of twenty-five or twenty-ſix members each; and, except a very few, are all perſons whoſe concern about religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the late awakening. I never ſaw the ends of ſuch ſocieties anſwered near ſo well, as among theſe. I think, I may ſafely declare, that I was never witneſs to ſo much of real chriſtian exerciſe among any perſons I have known, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, to my great ſatisfaction, among moſt of them. It is moſt amazing to obſerve, how much ſome of them, who at their firſt concern, were brutiſhly ignorant of every thing good, have now made ſuch advances in knowledge, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel thoſe who were formerly far before them. The concern about their own ſalvation is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarkable, but the abiding earneſtneſs they ſhow in their prayers, for the increaſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's kingdom, is moſt deſirable; and the care they ſhow in watching over one another, is one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence of their brotherly love, and true chriſtian tenderneſs. I might ſay a great deal more, but muſt conclude. I am, &amp;c. A. Bowie.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is alſo notice taken of ſome remarkable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, and of the reformation obſerved in the Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh Hoſpitals. In Numbers X. XI. XV. of Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow Weekly hiſtory.</p>

This is not all; for ſeveral country people are beginning to aſſemble together in little meetings, to worſhip their God: parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the ſerjeant informs me of one, about two miles from this place, where ſeveral plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and other illiterate perſons, meet for theſe moſt noble ends and purpoſes; and are going moſt ſweetly on, much increaſed in grace and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:013298_0094_0F904F8DB52BA9F0"/>
and ſome are daily added to their number. I am informed from the eaſt country, (where there have been no ſocieties ſince the ſeceſſion) that about Old Cambus, ſix miles from Dunbar, many are now meeting together for ſocial prayer, and mutual converſation about matters of religion, wherein the Lord is with them of a truth. And in that place, there is more eager thirſting for the word, than uſual, and the Miniſters are learning to ſpeak with new tongues. And one of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who was in this place laſt winter, has happily been the Lord's inſtrument in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe ſocieties. How beautiful and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is it, my dear friend, to hear of ſo many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after the deſpiſed Jeſus? Should we not take it as a token for good, that young ones, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſpending their ſpare hours in idle, vain, and unprofitable play, do now aſſemble, and join in calling upon the Lord. Is it not a good ſign to hear many poor fooliſh virgins, (inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employed in the vanities of the generality of their ſex) meeting together for prayer; and many prodigal youths, inſtead of revelling, and drunkenneſs, chambering, and wontonneſs, now breathing after the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified? O that the Lord would more and more exert his almighty power amongſt us. There are ſeveral other ſocieties for prayer, near about this city, proſpering very well.</q>

<q>As it is matter of great joy and thankfulneſs to God, who ſent you here, and gave you ſo much countenance, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably crowned your labours when here at Glaſgow with ſucceſs; ſo I doubt not, but the following account, of the many ſeals to your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in and about that city, will be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing

               <p>
                  <q>I am well informed by ſome Miniſters, and other judicious and experienced chriſtians, that there are to the number of fifty perſons already got notice of, in and about Glaſgow, that by all that can be judged by perſons of the beſt diſcerning in ſpiritual things, are ſavingly converted, by the bleſſing and power of God, accompanying your ten ſermons in that place; beſides ſeveral others under convictions, not reckoned in this number, whoſe ſtate remains, as yet, a little doubtful. And beſides, ſeveral chriſtians of conſiderable ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who were much ſtrengthened, revived, and comforted, by means of hearing your ſermons; being made to rejoice in hope of the glory of God, having obtained the full aſſurance of faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Among thoſe lately converted, here are ſeveral young people who were formerly openly wicked and flagitious, or at beſt but very negligent as to ſpiritual concerns, but are now in the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Some young converts are yet under doubts and fears; but a conſiderable number of them have attained to joy and peace in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Several lately wrought upon in a gracious way, ſeem to outſtrip chriſtians of conſiderable ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſpiritual mindedneſs, and many other good qualifications: and particularly, in their zeal for the converſion of others, and love to the ordinances, without a ſpirit of bigotry, or party zeal.</q>

                  <q>Theſe converts by your miniſtry are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from time to time; a good many are but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got notice of, that were not known before; which was pattly occaſioned by their convictions not being ſo ſtrong and pungent at the firſt, as

they proved afterwards, partly by the diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they met with in the families where they reſided, and partly by the reſerved tempers of the perſons themſelves, and their baſhfulneſs, becauſe of their former negligences and open enormities.

                  <q>They have all a great love to one another, and all good chriſtians, and a great ſympathy, with ſuch of their number, as are under doubts and fears.

The firſt in mercy, we ſtill have in ſome good meaſure (though complaints of the want of this are very open) but the laſt, we ſadly confeſs the want of, and this is what attends the Goſpel diſpenſed by him. And ſure, I am, that even the credible reports of it ſhould much endear him to all, who wiſh well to the intereſt of our dear, though too unknown, and altogether lovely Lord Jeſus.</q>

                  <q>His calmneſs and ſerenity under all he meets with, yea his joy in tribulation, is to me ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that I often think, the Lord ſent him to this place, in particular, to teach me how to preach, and eſpecially how to ſuffer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>His attachment to no party, but to Chriſt, and true grace alone, has long appeared to me a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar excellency in him. Chriſtianity has been ſo long broken into ſo many different ſects and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that an honeſt pagan might juſtly be at a loſs, was he among us, where to find the religion of Jeſus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>One now appears, who loudly calls us (and whoſe voice the Lord ſeems to back with power) to look into the original plan of that religion we profeſs: ſure nothing more juſt, nothing more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. He tells us, wherein the kingdom of God does conſiſt. And yet how ſad is it, he ſhould be deſpiſed. Who knows but this may be the Lord's laſt voice to us, before he takes his kingdom from us?</q>

                  <q>As to what you aſk of his reception in this city; I invited him, nay, urged him, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this journey, in conſequence of a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, for more than two or three years. I did it with the concurrence of a very few. His journey was delayed, till bad reports had imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of almoſt all againſt him: ſo that when he came, I could ſcarce obtain liberty for him to preach even in the fields. All that I could do, was what I had reſolved long before; I gave him with great pleaſure, and full freedom, my pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, which, for that day, was in the church which our Magiſtrates and principal people of note fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. And at once, the Lord, by his preaching, melted down the hearts of his enemies, (except — and—) ſo that, contrary to our cuſtom, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſame place and pulpit in the evening of that

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>While he ſtayed among us in this city, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered our expectations ſo much, that he has ſcarce more friends any where of its bulk, than here, where, at firſt, almoſt all were againſt him. And the word came alſo with ſo much power, that I hope ſeveral of different denominations, will bleſs the Lord for evermore, that ever they heard him. And in his way from us, I ſaw in part, and have heard more fully ſince, what ſatisfies that this was of the Lord, and for the good of many.</q>

                     <hi>P. S.</hi> I ſuppoſe you have heard, that our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates waited on him while here, and made him free of this place; though that is a compliment, rarely allowed to ſtrangers, of late.</q>

               <p>Mr. Williſon, Miniſter at Dundee, wrote as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, to his friend at Edinburgh.
<q>October 8, 1741<note n="*" place="bottom">Glaſgow Weekly Hiſtory, No. XIII.</note>. Honoured Sir, I am favoured with yours, wherein you deſire my thoughts of Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and an account of his labours and ſucceſs with us. Although my ſentiments may be little regarded by many, yet when you put me to it, I think I am bound to do juſtice to the character of this ſtranger, which I ſee few willing to do. I am not much ſurprized, though the devil, and all he can influence, be up in arms againſt the youth, ſeeing he makes ſuch bold and vigorous attacks upon his kingdom and ſtrong holds. As you, Sir, do obſerve it to be with you, ſo it is with us. He is hated, and ſpoken againſt, by all the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal party, and even the moſt of our clergy do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to diminiſh and expoſe him: this is not to be wondered at, ſeeing his inceſſant labours for Chriſt and ſouls, is ſuch a ſtrong reproof to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what he ſays publicly, againſt the ſending out of unconverted Miniſters, and their preaching
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:013298_0101_0F904E8200D5CE60"/>
an unknown Chriſt; this muſt be galling to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men. I look upon this youth, as raiſed up of God, for ſpecial ſervice, and ſpirited for making new and ſingular attempts, for promoting true chriſtianity in the world, and for reviving it where it is decayed; and I ſee him wonderfully fitted and ſtrengthened, both in body and mind, for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through his projects, amidſt the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and difficulties. I ſee the man to be all of a piece; his life and converſation to be a tranſcript of his ſermons. It is truly a rare thing, to ſee ſo much of God about any one man. To ſee one ſo eminent for humility, in the midſt of applauſe; for meekneſs and patience, under reproaches and injuries; for love to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for deſire to glorify Chriſt, and ſave ſouls; contentment in a mean lot, acquieſing in the will of God in all caſes, never fretting under any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, but ſtill praiſing and giving thanks for every thing. It is rare to ſee in a man, ſuch a flaming fire for God and againſt ſin, when in the pulpit; and yet moſt eaſy and calm in converſing with men out of it; careful not to give offence to them, and yet never courting the favour of any. God has beſtowed a large meaſure of gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon him, for the work he is engaged in, and has made him a choſen veſſel, to carry his name among the Gentiles, and to revive his work in ſeveral other churches. O that God may order his coming to poor Scotland, in ſuch a cloudy time, for the ſame end! And who knows, but God might be entreated, if we could wreſtle with him, notwithſtanding all our provocations! Things appeared moſt unlikely, in other places, ſome while ago, where now Chriſt is riding in triumph, going forth conquering and to conquer. This worthy youth, is ſingularly fitted to do the work of an Evangeliſt; and I have been long of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013298_0102_0F904E82A8670C50"/>
that it would be for the advantage of the world, were this ſtill to be a ſtanding office in the church. And ſeeing the Lord has ſtirred him up to venture his life, reputation, and his all for Chriſt; refuſe the beſt benefices in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and run all hazards by ſea and land, and travel ſo many thouſand miles to proclaim the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, and riches of his free-grace, of which he himſelf is a monument; and eſpecially, ſeeing God has honoured him to do all this with ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſucceſs, among ſinners of all ranks and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, and even many of the moſt notorious, in awakening and turning them to the Lord; I truly think we are alſo bound to honour him, and to eſteem him highly in love for his maſter's, and for his work's ſake, according to 1 Theſſ. v. 13. And for thoſe who vilify and oppoſe him, I wiſh they would even notice a Gamaliel's words, Acts v. 'Let him alone, leſt haply ye be found to ſight againſt God:' Or rather, that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Apoſtle Peter's words, apologizing for his going in with the uncircumciſed, Acts xi. when the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them; 'What was I that I could withſtand God?' I have my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf been witneſs to the Holy Ghoſt falling upon him and his hearers oftener than once, I do not ſay in a miraculous, though in an obſerveable manner. Yea, I have already ſeen the deſireable fruits thereof in not a few; and hope, through the divine bleſſing on the ſeed ſown, to ſee more. Many here are bleſſing God, for ſending him to this country, though ſatan has raged much againſt it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Lord is a ſovereign agent, and may raiſe up the inſtruments of his glory, from what churches or places he pleaſes; and glorifies his grace the more, when he does it from thoſe ſocieties, whence and when it could be leaſt expected.

Though Mr. Whitefield be ordained, according to his education, a Miniſter of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; yet we are to regard him as one, whom God has raiſed up, to witneſs againſt the corruptions of that church; whom God is ſtill enlightening, and cauſing to make advances towards us. He has already conformed to us, both in doctrine and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and lies open to light to conform to us in other points. He is thoroughly a Calviniſt, and found to the doctrines of Free Grace, in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Original Sin, the New Birth, juſtification by Chriſt, the neceſſity of imputed righteouſneſs, the operations of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. Theſe he makes his great theme, drives the point home to the conſcience, and God attends it with great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And as God has enlightened him gradually in theſe things, ſo he is ſtill ready to receive more light, and as ſoon as he gets it, he is moſt frank in declaring it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>God, by owning him ſo wonderfully, is pleaſed to give a rebuke to our intemperate bigotry, and party-zeal, and to tell us, that neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion nor uncircumciſion availeth any thing. But a new creature.</q>

                     <hi>P.

Such are Miniſters of Chriſt's ſending, and of ſuch he ſaith, 'He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me;' which is a rule of duty to us.</q>

                  <q>Our journey to the north was as comfortable as any we had. In ſeveral places as he came along, the Lord countenanced him in a very convincing manner, particularly at a place called Lundie, five miles north from Dundee, where there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of ſerious chriſtians, who hearing that he was to come that way, ſpent moſt part of the night before in prayer together. Although his preaching there was only in a paſſing way, having to ride to Dundee after it, and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt three and four before he reached the place; yet he had but ſcarce well begun, before the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God was indeed very diſcernable. Never did I ſee ſuch a pleaſing melting in a worſhipping aſſembly. There was nothing violent in it, or like what we may call ſcrewing up the paſſions: for it evidently appeared to be deep and hearty, and to proceed from a higher ſpring.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The compiler lately received a tranſcript, from the diary of a very worthy chriſtian in Edinburgh, who died about two years ago, in which are the following paſſages.
<q>
                     <hi>Sabbati,</hi> Auguſt 9, 1741. What is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, is, that numbers of all ranks, all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and all characters, come conſtantly to hear him, though his ſermons abound with thoſe truths which would be unwelcome from the mouth of others. He is indefatigable in his works. Three hours before noon he appoints, for people under diſtreſs to converſe with him, when he is much confined. Then he writes numbers of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And this week he is to add a morning lecture to his work. I have reaſon, among many others, for bleſſing God, for ſending him to this place.</q>

the park, and gathered 25 l. 7s. 6d. for the poor Highlanders. Next day he went to Newbottle, and preached twice. On Thurſday to Whitburn; Friday morning at Torphichen; Friday evening at Linlithgow; Saturday morning and afternoon both at Falkirk. And this day he is at Airth. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow he will preach twice at Sirling. Culroſs, Tueſday forenoon; Dumfermlin, afternoon. Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday, twice at Kinroſs. Thurſday, Perth. From Friday to Monday, at Dundee. Monday, Kinglaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and came to Edinburgh on Tueſday. Bleſſed be God, he ſeldom preaches without ſome one or other laid under concern. Surely God has ſent him to this place for good. The devil never raged more by his emiſſaries. It is remarkable, there never was a Miniſter, no nor any other man, againſt whom the mouths of the licentious have been more opened. Since he came, I have found myſelf more deſirous to be watchful, leſt my foot ſlipt at any time, and to guard againſt many things, which before I thought indifferent.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Thurſday, October 29, 1741. Yeſterday Mr. Whitefield left this place, to return to England. His departure was a great grief to many, whom the Lord has mercifully awakened, under his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, the number of which, I believe, is very great. Mr. W—r alone, among about thirty young communicants that came to converſe with him, found about a dozen, who told him, They were firſt effectually touched under his miniſtry; and gave very good accounts of a work of God upon their ſouls. Some of the moſt abandoned wretches are brought to cry, 'What ſhall I do to be ſaved?' I have often had the opportunity of converſation with him, and, I think, I never heard him, or converſed with him, but I learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome good leſſon. I do not remember to have heard one idle word drop from him, in all the times I have been in company with him, and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013298_0106_0F904E85B27F75B0"/>
others that have been much more with him, give him the ſame teſtimony. On Tueſday laſt, he preached and exhorted ſeven times. I heard him to my great ſatisfaction the fourth time, in the park. From that he went to the Old People's Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, to give them an exhortation; but indeed, I never was witneſs to any thing of the kind before. All the congregation (for many followed him) were ſo moved, that very few, if any, could refrain from crying out. I am ſure, the kingdom of God was then come nigh unto them, and that a woe will be unto them that ſlighted the offers of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour then made to them. From that, he went to Heriot's Hoſpital, where a great change is wrought, upon many of the boys; for there, as well as in the Maiden-Hoſpitals, fellowſhip-meetings are ſet up, which is quite new there; for the boys of that Hoſpital were noted for the wickedeſt boys about town. I was with him in a private houſe in the evening. When he came there, he was quite worn out. However, he expounded there, which was the ſeventh diſcourſe that day; and, what was very ſurprizing, he was much freſher after he had done, than at the beginning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>November 29, 1741, I had agreeable accounts of ſome of the children who were wrought upon by the miniſtry of Mr. W—d. I heard this day of a good many I heard not of formerly, who were not only laid under concern, but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a work of grace wrought upon their heart, appearing by a moſt remarkable change in their converſation, and eager deſires after far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees of knowledge of the Lord's ways, which leads them to attend every opportunity they can have for inſtruction.</q>

of which I have had this by paſt week, in ſeveral places where I have been. I had occaſion to ſee a ſoldier, who was lately wrought upon by Mr. Whitefield's means. He ſeems to have come a great length in a little time, and gives a very judicious account of the Lord's dealings with his ſoul.</q>

               <p>As a concluſion of this article, concerning Mr. Whitefield's firſt reception and miniſtrations in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the reader will not be diſpleaſed to ſee the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing extract from the papers of a Gentleman deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who was eminent for his learning and knowledge of the world, and who had a general acquaintance with thoſe who profeſſed the greateſt regard to religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Meſſieurs Ebenezer and Ralph Erſkine correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with him for two or three years, and invited him to Scotland. But afterwards reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if they held communion with an epiſcopal Miniſter, becauſe a good man and ſucceſsful preacher, they could not vindicate their renouncing commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſuch Miniſters in the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: They wrote to him not to come. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, on the invitation of ſome Miniſters and people of the eſtabliſhed church he came, and preached his firſt ſermon in Mr. Ralph Erſkine's pulpit at Dumfermlin (a town ten or twelve miles from Edinburgh on the other ſide of Forth.) At a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond viſit to Dumfermlin, he had a conference with all the ſeceding brethren, where he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly avowed that he was a member of the Church of England, and as he thought the government and worſhip of it lawful, was reſolved, unleſs violently thruſt out of it, to continue ſo, rebuking ſin and preaching Chriſt: And told them the reckoned the Solemn League and Covenant a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oath, as too much narrowing the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſaints, and that he could not ſee the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013298_0108_0F904E8728672B90"/>
right of Preſbytery. On this they came to a preſbyterial reſolution to have no more to do with him; and one of them preached a ſermon to ſhew that one who held communion with the Church of England, or backſlidden Church of Scotland, could not be an inſtrument of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This, however, did not hinder multitudes, both of the Seceders and eſtabliſhed Church of Scotland, from hearing his ſermons. His ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the faith, his ſervent zeal, and unwearied diligence for promoting the cauſe of Chriſt; the plainneſs and ſimplicity, the affection and warmth of his ſermons: and the amazing power that had accompanied them in many parts of England, and in almoſt all the North American colonies, joined to his meekneſs, humility, and truly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and catholic ſpirit, convinced them there was reaſon to think well of him, and to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his miniſtry. Converſions were become rare, little livelineſs was to be found even in real chriſtians, and bigottry and blind zeal were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing animoſities and diviſions, and turning away the attention of good men from matters of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater importance. In this ſituation, an animated preacher appears, ſingularly qualified to awaken the ſecure, to recover chriſtians to their firſt love, and firſt works, and to reconcile their affections one to another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The epiſcopal clergy gave him no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though ſome few of their people did. And in the eſtabliſhed Church of Scotland, ſome of the more rigid Preſbyterians would not hold communion with him, on account of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the Church of England, and his ſeeming to aſſume the office of an Evangeliſt, peculiar, in their apprehenſion, to the firſt ages of the church: while ſome, who affected to be thought more ſenſible, or more modiſh and polite,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013298_0109_0F904E88709FEFE0"/>
were mightily diſſatisfied with him for preaching the Calviniſt Doctrines of Election, Original Sin, Efficacious Grace, Juſtification through Faith, and the Perſeverance of the Saints; and for inveighing againſt the play-houſe, dancing aſſemblies, games of chance, haunting taverns, vanity and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in dreſs, and levity in behaviour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Some Gentlemen and Ladies who went to hear, would not go a ſecond time, becauſe he diſturbed them, by inſiſting on man's miſerable and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtate by nature, and the ſtrictneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs eſſential to the chriſtian character. But upon many of his hearers in Edinburgh of all ranks and ages, eſpecially young people, deep impreſſions were made, and many of them waited on him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, lamenting their former immoral lives, or ſtupid thoughtleſsneſs about religion, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their anxious concern about obtaining an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and the ſanctifying influences of of the Spirit. In the greateſt part of theſe, the impreſſions have appeared to be ſaving, from their circumſpect examplary conduct ſince that time, or from their comfortable, or triumphant deaths. Many Preſbyterians begin to think more mildly and candidly than before, of the Miniſters and members of the Church of England<note n="*" place="bottom">This year 1741, he received the compliment honorary Burgeſs tickets from the towns of Stirling, Glaſgow, Paiſley, and Aberdeen.

               <p>MR. Whitefield having left Edinburgh in the in the latter end of October 1741, ſet out for Abergavenny in Wales, where, having ſome time ago formed a reſolution to enter into the married ſtate, he married one Mrs. James<note n="*" place="bottom">Her maiden name was Elizabeth Burnell.</note>, a widow, between thirty and forty years of age; of whom he ſays (Letter CCCLXXVI.)
<q>She has been a houſe-keeper many years, once gay, but for three years laſt paſt, a deſpiſed follower of the Lamb of God.</q>
From Abergavenny he went to Briſtol, where he preached twice a day with his uſual ſucceſs. Upon returning to London in the beginning of December, he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed letters from Georgia concerning his orphan-family, which, with reſpect to their external circumſtances, were a little diſcouraging. On the other hand, he had moſt comfortable accounts of the fruits of his miniſtry in Scotland. This made him think of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another viſit there in the ſpring. Meantime, he had the pleaſure of ſeeing his labours attended with the divine bleſſing at London and Briſtol. And from Glouceſter he thus writes,
<q>December 22, 1741. Laſt Thurſday evening the Lord brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I preached immediately to our friends in in a large barn, and had my Maſter's preſence. On Friday and Saturday, I preached again twice. Both the power and the congregation increaſed. On Sunday Providence opened a door for my preaching in St. John's, one of the pariſh churches.

Great numbers came. On Sunday afternoon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had preached twice at Glouceſter, I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Mr. F—'s at the hill, ſix miles off, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yeſterday morning I preached at Painſwick in the pariſh church, here in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and again at night in the barn. God gives me unſpeakable comfort, and uninterrupted joy. Here ſeems to be a new awakening, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of the work of God. I find ſeveral country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were awakened when I preached at Tewkſbury, and heard of three or four that have died in the Lord. We ſhall never know what good field-preaching has done, till we come to judgment. Many who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt me, begin to be of another mind; and God ſhows me more and more, that when a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he will make even his enemies to be at peace with him. Tomorrow morning I purpoſe to ſet out for Abergavenny, and to preach at Briſtol, in Wilts, Glouceſter, and Glouceſterſhire, before I ſee London.</q>

<q>The everlaſting God reward all their benefactors. I find there has been a freſh awakening among them.

               </p>
               <p>Upon his return to London, he went on with greater zeal and ſucceſs, if poſſible, than ever.
<q>Our Saviour (ſays he, writing to a brother <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter CCCCVII.</note>, April 6, 1742) is doing great things in London daily. I rejoice to hear that you are helped in your work. Let this encourage you: go on, go on; the more we do, the more we may do for Jeſus. I ſleep and eat but little, and am conſtantly employed from morning till midnight, and yet my ſtrength is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed. O free grace! It fires my ſoul, and makes me long to do ſomething for Jeſus. It is true, indeed I want to go home; but here are ſo many ſouls ready to periſh for lack of knowledge, that I am willing to tarry below as long as my Maſter has work for me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this principle of compaſſion to periſhing ſouls, he now ventured to take a very extraordinary ſtep. It had been the cuſtom for many years paſt, in the holiday ſeaſons, to erect booths in Moorfields, for mountebanks, players, puppet ſhows, &amp;c. which were attended from morning till night, by innumerable multitudes of the lower ſort of people. He formed a reſolution to preach the goſpel among them; and executed it. On Whitmonday, at ſix o'clock in the morning, attended by a large congregation of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:013298_0113_0F904E8AA48AE390"/>
people, he began. Thouſands, who were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, gaping for their uſual diverſions, all flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round him. His text was, John iii. 14.
<q>And as Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up.</q>
They gazed, they liſtened, they wept: and many ſeemed to be ſtung with deep conviction for their paſt ſins. All was huſhed and ſolemn.
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">M. S. and Letters CCCCXI. CCCCXII.</note> Being thus encouraged, (ſays he) I ventured out again at noon, when the fields were quite full; and could ſcarce help ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſee thouſands, when a merry-andrew was trumpeting to them, upon obſerving me mount a ſtand on the other ſide of the field, deſerting him, till not ſo much as one was left behind, but all flocked to hear the goſpel. But this, together with a complaint that they had taken near twenty or thirty pounds leſs that day than uſual, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the owners of the booths, that when I came to preach a third time in the evening, in the midſt of the ſermon, a merry-andrew got up upon a man's ſhoulders, and advancing near the pulpit, attempted to ſlaſh me with a long heavy whip ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times. Soon afterwards they got a recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerjeant, with his drum, &amp;c. to paſs through the congregation. But I deſired the people to make way for the King's officer, which was quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. Finding theſe efforts to fail, a large body, quite on the oppoſite ſide, aſſembled together, and having got a great pole for their ſtandard, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſound of drum, in a very threatening manner, till they came near the ſkirts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Uncommon courage was given both to preacher and hearers. I prayed for ſupport and deliverance, and was heard. For juſt as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached us with looks full of reſentment, I know not by what accident, they quarrelled among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, threw down their ſtaff, and went their way,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013298_0114_0F904E8D132DF538"/>
leaving, however, many of their company behind, who, before we had done, I truſt were brought over to join the beſieged party. I think I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in praying, preaching, and ſinging, (for the noiſe was too great at times to preach) about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> hours. We then retired to the Tabernacle, where thouſands flocked. We were determined to pray down the booths; but bleſſed be God, more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial work was done. At a moderate computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I received, I believe, a thouſand notes from perſons under conviction; and ſoon after, upwards of three hundred were received into the ſociety in one day. Some I married, that had lived together without marriage. One man had exchanged his wife for another, and given fourteen ſhillings in exchange. Numbers, that ſeemed as it were to have been bred up for Tyburn, were at that time plucked as firebrands out of the burning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I cannot help adding, that ſeveral little boys and girls, who were fond of ſitting round me on the pulpit, while I preached, and handing to me peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's notes, though they were often pelted with eggs, dirt, &amp;c. thrown at me, never once gave way; but on the contrary, every time I was ſtruck, turned up their little weeping eyes, and ſeemed to wiſh they could receive the blows for me. God make them, in their growing years, great and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing martyrs for him, who out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings perfects praiſe.</q>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> From his Arrival in <hi>SCOTLAND 1742,</hi> to his Return to <hi>LONDON</hi> the ſame Year.</head>
               <p>SOON after this, he embarked a ſecond time for Scotland and arrived at Leith, June 3, 1742.</p>
               <p>From the Diary, formerly quoted, we have the following,
<q>Edinburgh, Sabbath, June 6, 1742. On Thurſday laſt our dear friend Mr. Whitefield returned to this place, to the great comfort of many honeſt chriſtians, eſpecially of thoſe to whom he was made a mean of conviction and converſion when laſt here.—He ſeems to have improved much in chriſtian knowledge. He is much refreſhed with the accounts of the work of God in the weſt country. I have heard him preach five excellent diſcourſes, all calculated for the building up of chriſtians, (though he never fails to put in a word for the conviction of ſinners) and I think, can ſay, that I have never heard him without ſome influence attending his preaching, eſpecially in private houſes. O may the impreſſions made on my heart never wear off, leſt at any time I ſhould be in danger of dropping my watch, and becoming untender.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sabb. Oct. 17, 1742. It is a great recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Mr. Whitefield to me, that though the Seceders give him every bad character that can be deviſed, viz. a ſorcerer, &amp;c. yet he takes all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and wherever he goes, ſpeaks well of them, ſo far as he can: for none can approve of thoſe groſs parts of their conduct: therefore theſe he chooſes to caſt a mantle of love over.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But here it is proper to take a view of the ſtate of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013298_0116_0F904E8DE7AEC870"/>
things in that country upon his arrival. It had pleaſed God to bleſs his firſt viſit to Scotland, not only for the converſion of particular perſons, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and quickening of private chriſtians, but to rouſe them to more than ordinary concern about the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their neighbours, and to excite pious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Miniſters to greater diligence in their work. Prayers were put up, with ſome degree of faith and hope, that God would now give ſucceſs to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and not ſuffer them always to complain that they ſpent their ſtrength in vain. Nor were theſe prayers long unanſwered: for in the month of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1742, an extraordinary religious concern began to appear publicly at Cambuſlang; and ſoon after at Kilſyth and other places; the news of which quickly ſpread through the land, and engaged general atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of this, a juſt though ſhort deſcription is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the following letter, written by the Rev. Mr. Hamilton (then Miniſter in the Barony pariſh, now in the High-Church of Glaſgow) to Mr. Prince, Miniſter in Boſton <note n="*" place="bottom">Prince's Chriſtian Hiſtory, No. x.</note>.
<q>Glaſgow, September 13, 1742. We in the ſouth and weſt of Scotland, have great reaſon to join in thankfulneſs to God, with you, for the days of the Redeemer's power that we are favoured with. Mr. Whitefield came to Scotland in ſummer 1741, for the firſt time: and in many places where he preached, his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations were evidently bleſſed, particularly in the cities of Edinburgh and Glaſgow, where a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of perſons were brought under ſuch impreſſions of religion, as have never yet left them; but they are ſtill following on to know the Lord. However, this was only the beginning of far greater things: for about the middle of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary laſt, a very great concern appeared among the people of Cambuſlang, a ſmall pariſh, lying four miles ſouth-eaſt of Glaſgow, under the paſtoral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:013298_0117_0F904E8FCF50C6C0"/>
of the Rev. Mr. William MacCulloch, a man of conſiderable parts and great piety. This concern appeared with ſome circumſtances very unuſual among us: to wit, ſevere bodily agonies, outcryings, and faintings in the congregation. This made the report of it ſpread like fire, and drew vaſt multitudes of people from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to that place. And I believe, in leſs than two months after the commencement of it, there were few pariſhes within twelve miles of Cambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang, but had ſome, more or fewer awakened there, ſo a very deep piercing ſenſe of ſin: and many at much greater diſtance. I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded with your worthy brother Mr. Cooper, in his preface to Mr. Edwards's ſermon, that God has made uſe of theſe uncommon circumſtances, to make his work ſpread the faſter. But, bleſſed be God, Cambuſlang is not the only place where theſe impreſſions are got. The ſame work is ſpreading in other pariſhes, and under their own Miniſters, particularly at Calder, Kilſyth, and Cumbernaud, all to the north, and north-eaſt of Glaſgow. And I doubt not, that ſince the middle of February, when this work began at Cambuſlang, there are upwards of two thouſand perſons awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and almoſt all of them, by the beſt accounts I have, in a promiſing condition: there being very few inſtances of impoſtors, or ſuch as have loſt their impreſſions; and many whom we are bound to think are true Scripture converts, and evidencing it by a ſuitable walk and converſation. There is evidently a greater ſeriouſneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about religion appearing in moſt of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, than formerly: a greater deſire after the word; people applying themſelves more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their duty; and erecting new ſocieties for prayer and ſpiritual conference: which gives us
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013298_0118_0F904E9118CCEC38"/>
the joyful proſpect of a conſiderable enlargement of the Meſſiah's kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>My pariſh has likewiſe had ſome ſhare in this good work. There has been above an hundred new communicants among them this ſummer, who never did partake of the bleſſed ſacrament before: which is five times as many as ever I admitted in any former year: moſt of them were awakened at Cambuſlang; ſome of them in their own church; and in others the impreſſions have been more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and not attended with theſe uncommon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances before mentioned. And, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that before we admit any perſon to the Lord's table, we particularly examine them, and are ſatisfied with their knowledge of the principles of religion, of the nature and ends of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the impreſſions of religion they have on their minds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe is the Rev. Mr. Williſon's letter to Dr. Colman, Miniſter in Boſton, dated Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Prince's Chriſtian Hiſtory, No. XI.</note> I muſt inform you a little of the work of God begun here. I told you in my laſt, that after Mr. Whitefield's firſt coming and preaching three months in Scotland, there were ſome beginnings of a revival of religion in ſome of our principal cities, as Edinburgh and Glaſgow, which ſtill continue and increaſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince Mr. Whitefield's ſecond coming in June laſt. But beſides theſe cities, the Lord hath been pleaſed to begin a work much like that in New-England, in ſeveral places in the weſt of Scotland. The firſt pariſh awakened, was Cambuſlang; the next was the pariſh of Kilſyth, about nine miles north eaſt of Glaſgow, and afterward the pariſhes of Calder, Kirkintilloch, Cumbernaud, Campſie, Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marneck, Gargunnock, and a great many others in the country. The awakenings of people have been, in a good many, attended with outcryings,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013298_0119_0F8FFAB5C9BD9B48"/>
faintings, and bodily diſtreſſes: but in many more, the work has proceeded with great calmneſs. But the effects in both ſorts are alike good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and hitherto we hear nothing of their fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from what they have profeſſed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: and ſtill we hear of ſome new pariſhes falling under great concern here and there, though the great cryings and outward diſtreſſes are much ceaſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Lord, in this backſliding time, is willing to pity us, and ſee our ways and heal them, however crooked and perverſe they have been. O ſhall not this wonderful ſtep of divine condeſcenſion, lead us all to repentance, and to go out to meet a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning God, in the way of humiliation and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The Magiſtrates and Miniſters in Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, are beginning to ſet up ſocieties for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of manners, and new lectures on week days. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay all our cities follow their example. There is a great increaſe of praying ſocieties alſo in Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and other towns and villages; and in them they are keeping days of thankſgiving for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial waterings the Lord is giving us: thoſe in Edinburgh ſend printed memorials to others thro' the nation, to excite them to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Macknight of Irvine, thus writes to Mr. Whitefield, June 21, 1742.
<q>Bleſſed be our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, there are ſome awakenings amongſt us at Irvine; not only of thoſe who have been at Cambuſlang, but ſeveral others are lately brought into great concern about their eternal ſtate, and among them ſeveral children; the news of which I know will rejoice you, and I hope will encourage you to viſit us, to help forward this great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work of converting ſinners.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Extract of a letter from a perſon of diſtinction to the Compiler.
<q>Edinburgh, February, 1772. I would not aſcribe all the revival of religion in
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013298_0120_0F904E92E0654238"/>
Scotland, to the inſtrumentality of Mr. Whitefield. At Cambuſlang, it began, before he had been there; but in Edinburgh, and all the other places in Scotland, that I heard of, after diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it began with <hi>his</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt viſit. This honour he had from his divine Maſter, and it ought not to be taken from him. And every time he came to Scotland, it is an undoubted fact, that an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon power attended his miniſtry: and many were always brought under ſerious and laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt ſtrangers to religion could not avoid hearing of theſe things, but they were very different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with them. Whilſt ſome became more thoughtful and ſerious, many mocked, and ſome were even filled with rage. On the other hand, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and behaviour of thoſe who were the ſubjects of this remarkable work, was the ſtrongeſt of all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that it came from above. Their earneſt deſire to be rightly directed in the way to heaven; their tender and conſcientious walk; their faithfulneſs in the duties of their ſtations; their readineſs to make ample reſtitution for any act of injuſtice they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly committed; their diſpoſition to judge mildly of others, but ſeverely of themſelves; their laying aſide quarrels and law-ſuits, and deſiring to be reconciled, and to live peaceably with all men; ſuch amiable and heavenly qualities, eſpecially when appearing in ſome who had formerly been of a very oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, could not fail to ſtrike every ſerious obſerver. In ſhort, it was ſuch a time for the revival of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as had never before been ſeen in Scotland<note n="*" place="margin">Particulars may be found in the atteſted narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the work at Cambuſlang; Dr. Webſter's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influence the true Spring, &amp;c. and in Mr. Robe's Narratives and Monthly Hiſtory. A view of the moſt memorable paſſages, is given in vol. II. book IV. chap. vi. of Hiſt. Coll. relating to the Succeſs of the Goſpel, printed in 1754; where is alſo ſome account of the abiding fruits of theſe religious impreſſions.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:013298_0121_0F904E93290F2F48"/>The enmity which wicked and profane men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered againſt this work, and the deriſion with which they treated it, is no more than what might naturally be expected. But it is not ſo eaſy to account for the conduct of the Seceders. Theſe, not ſatisfied with forbearing to approve of it, went the length even to appoint a general faſt among them, one of the grounds of which was, the receiving Mr. Whitefield into Scotland; and another, the deluſion, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, at Cambuſlang and other places.

<q>I heartily thank you for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about unworthy me. Though I am not very ſolicitous what the world ſay of me, yet I would not refuſe to give any one, much leſs a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, (and ſuch an one I take you to be) all reaſonable ſatisfaction about any part of my doctrine or conduct. I am ſorry that the aſſociate preſbytery, beſides the other things exceptionable in the grounds of their late faſt, have done me much wrong. As to what they ſay about the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, my ſentiments, as to the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the civil magiſtrate as to ſacred things, agree with what is ſaid in the Weſtminſter Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, chap. xxiii. paragraph 3 and 4. And I do own the Lord Jeſus to be the bleſſed head and king of his church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Solemn League and Covenant I never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, neither was it ever propoſed to me to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured: and as for my miſſives, if the aſſociate preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery will be pleaſed to print them, the world will ſee that they had no reaſon to expect I would act in any other manner than I have done. What that part of my experience is, that ſavours of the groſſeſt enthuſiaſm, I know not, becauſe not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; but this one thing I know, when I converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, they were ſatisfied with the account I then gave of my experiences, and alſo of the validity of my miſſion; only, when they found I would preach the Goſpel promiſcuouſly to all, and for every Miniſter that would invite me, and not adhere only to them, one of them particularly ſaid, 'They were ſatisfied with all the other accounts which I gave of myſelf, except of my call to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at that time.' They would have been glad of my help, and have received me as a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, had I conſented to have preached only at the invitation of them and their people.

But I judged that to be contrary to the dictates of my conſcience; and therefore I could not comply. I thought their foundation was too narrow for any high houſe to be built upon. I declared freely when laſt in Scotland (and am more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it ſince) that they were building a Babel<note n="*" place="margin">The event verified this conjecture. In his M. S. notes, ſeveral years after, he makes the following remark:
<q>Such a work (the religious concern at Cambuſlang) ſo very extenſive, muſt meet with great oppoſition. My collections for the orphans gave a great handle; but the chief oppoſition was made by the Seceders, who, though they had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me at the moſt extravagant rate, now gave out that I was agitated by the devil. Taking it for granted, that all converted perſons muſt take the covenant, and that God had left the Scotch eſtabliſhed churches long ago, and that he would never work by the hands of a curate of the Church of England, they condemned the whole work, as the work of the devil; and kept a faſt through all Scotland, to humble themſelves, becauſe the devil was come down in great wrath, and to pray that the Lord would rebuke the deſtroyer (for that was my title.) But the Lord rebuked theſe good men; for they ſplit among themſelves, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated one another. Having afterwards a ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with Mr. Ralph Erſkine, we embraced each other, and he ſaid, We had ſeen ſtrange things.</q>
                     </note>. At the ſame time, they knew very well, I was very far from being againſt all church-government (for how can any church ſubſiſt without it?) I only urged, as I do now, that ſince holy men differ ſo much about the outward form, we ſhould bear with, and forbear one another, though in this reſpect we are not of one mind. I have often declared in
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:013298_0124_0F904E95896CA4B8"/>
the moſt public manner, that I believe the Church of Scotland to be the beſt conſtituted national church in the world. At the ſame time I would bear with, and converſe freely with all others, who do not err in fundamentals, and who give evidence that they are true lovers of the Lord Jeſus. This is what I mean by a catholic ſpirit. Nor that I believe a Jew or Pagan continuing ſuch, can be a true chriſtian, or have true chriſtianity in them; and if there be any thing tending that way in the late extract which I ſent you, I utterly diſavow it. And I am ſure, I obſerved no ſuch thing in it, when I publiſhed it, though upon a cloſer review, ſome expreſſions ſeem juſtly exceptionable. You know how ſtrongly I aſſert all the doctrines of grace as held forth in the Weſtminſter Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, and doctrinal articles of the Church of England. Theſe I truſt I ſhall adhere to as long as I live, becauſe I verily believe they are the truths of God, and have felt the power of them in my own heart. I am only concerned that good men ſhould be guilty of ſuch miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But this teaches me more and more to exerciſe compaſſion toward all the children of God, and to be more jealous over our own hearts, knowing what fallible creatures we all are. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I am a poor blind ſinner, liable to err, and would be obliged to an enemy, much more to ſo dear a friend as you are, to point out to me my miſtakes, as to my practice, or unguarded expreſſions in my preaching or writing. At the ſame time, I would humble myſelf before my Maſter, for any thing I may ſay or do amiſs, and beg the influence and aſſiſtance of his bleſſed Spirit, that I may ſay and do ſo no more.</q>

               <p>So much for Mr. Whitefield's difference with the Seceders. But notwithſtanding all this, upon his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond arrival in Scotland, June 1742, he was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<q>Edinburgh June 4, 1742. This morning I received glorious accounts of the carrying on of the Mediator's kingdom. Three of the little boys that were converted when I was laſt here, came to me and wept, and begged me to pray for and with them. A Miniſter tells me, that ſcarce one is falling back, who was awakened, either among old or young.

<q>Societies (or fellowſhip meetings) I found ſet up for prayer, eſpecially at Glaſgow and Edinburgh. Several young Gentlemen dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated themſelves to the miniſtry, and became burning and ſhining lights.</q>
At Edinburgh he preached twice a day, as uſual, in the Hoſpital park, where a number of ſeats and ſhades, in the form of an amphitheatre, were erected for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of his hearers. And in conſequence of earneſt invitations, he went to the weſt country, particularly to Cambuſlang, where he preached no leſs than three times upon the very day of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, to a vaſt body of people, although he had preached that ſame morning at Glaſgow. The laſt of theſe exerciſes he began at nine at night, continuing till eleven, when he ſaid, he obſerved ſuch a commotion among the people, as he had never ſeen in America. Mr. MacCulloch preached after him, till paſt one in the morning, and even then could hardly perſuade the people to depart. All night in the fields might be heard the voice of prayer and praiſe. As Mr. Whitefield was frequently at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſlang during this ſeaſon, a deſcription of what he obſerved there at different times, will be beſt given in

<q>Perſons from all parts flocked to to ſee, and many from many parts, went home convinced, and converted unto God. A brae, or hill, near the manſe at Cambuſlang, ſeemed to be formed by Providence, for containing a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. People ſat unwearied till two in the morning, to hear ſermons, diſregarding the weather. You could ſcarce walk a yard, but you muſt tread upon ſome, rejoicing in God for mercies received, or crying out for more. Thouſands and thouſands have I ſeen, before it was poſſible to catch it by ſympathy, melted down under the word and power of God. At the celebration of the holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, their joy was ſo great, that at the deſire of many, both Miniſters and people, in imitation of Hezekiah's paſſover, they had, a month or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, a ſecond; which was a general rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of the people of God. The communion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table was in the field; three tents, at proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, all ſurrounded with a multitude of hearers; above twenty Miniſters (among whom was good old Mr. Bonner) attending to preach and aſſiſt, all enlivening and enlivened by one another.</q>

               <p>Beſides his labours at Glaſgow and Cambuſlang, it is ſomewhat ſurpriſing to think, how many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the weſt of Scotland he viſited within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a few weeks, preaching once or twice at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, and at ſeveral three or four times. It is worth while to ſet down the journal <note n="†" place="margin">Letter CCCCXXVI.</note> of a week or two.

<q>When Mr. Whitefield was preaching at Kilmarnock, on the 23d of Auguſt, 1742, from theſe words, <hi>And out of his fulneſs have all we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and grace for grace,</hi> I thought I never heard ſuch a ſermon on the fulneſs of grace that is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in Chriſt Jeſus: and can truly ſay, that I felt the efficacy of the Holy Spirit upon my ſoul, during that diſcourſe. I afterwards ſhut up my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in my chamber, during the remaining part of that day; and before I laid myſelf down to reſt, I made a ſolemn and ſerious dedication of myſelf to God, by way of covenant, extended and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the ſame with my hands, and, I think, had communion with God in ſo doing; to which I have often had recourſe ſince, in adhering thereto, and in renewing thereof; though my life ſince has been attended with many backſlidings from God, and have been perfidious in his covenant; yet I ſtill rejoice in his ſalvation through precious Chriſt. And it is refreſhing to behold the place at this very day, as I have often done ſince. I from the <hi>aera</hi> abovementioned, always looked upon Mr. Whitefield as my ſpiritual father, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard him afterwards in Edinburgh and Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow with much ſatisfaction. It always gave me joy, the mentioning of his name, and grieved me when he was reproached. And I can very well remember, that when Cape Breton was taken, I happened to be then at Edinburgh; and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to breakfaſt with Mr. Whitefield, I never in all my life enjoyed ſuch another breakfaſt. He gave the company a fine and lively deſcant upon that part of the world, made us all join in a hymn of praiſe and thankſgiving, and concluded with a moſt devout and ſervent prayer. In the evening of that day, he preached a moſt excellent thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſermon, from the firſt two verſes of the cxxvith pſalm.</q>

               </head>
               <p>ON Mr. Whitefield's arrival in London, he found a new awakening at the Tabernacle, which they had been obliged to enlarge; where, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
<q>from morning till midnight<note n="*" place="margin">Letter CCCCXCI.</note>, I am em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed, and, glory be to rich grace, I am car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the duties of each day with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and almoſt uninterrupted tranquillity. Our ſociety is large, but in good order. My Maſter gives us much of his gracious preſence, both in our public and private adminiſtrations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the month of March, 1743, he went into Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire, where the people ſeemed more deſirous to hear than ever.
<q>Preaching (ſays he) in Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire<note n="†" place="margin">Letter DIV.</note>, is now like preaching at the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in London.</q>
And again, (in a letter, dated April 7,)<note n="‡" place="margin">Letter DVI.</note>
                  <q>I preached and took leave of the Glouceſter people, with mutual and great concern, on Sunday evening laſt. It was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

At five I roſe again, ſick for want of reſt; but I was enabled to get on horſeback, and ride to Mr. F—'s where I preached to a large congregation, who came there at ſeven in the morning. At ten, I read prayers and preached, and afterward admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered the ſacrament in Stonehouſe church. Then I rode to Stroud, and preached to about 12,000

Next morning he preached near Durſley to ſome thouſands; about ſeven reached Briſtol, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a full congregation at Smiths-Hall; and on Tueſday morning, after preaching again, ſet out for Waterford, in South-Wales, where he opened the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation which he and his brethren had agreed upon, and was ſeveral days with them, ſettling the affairs of the ſocieties.

Laſt year I viſited ſeveral places, but now I went to more, and in every place found, that not one half had been told me. The power of God at the ſacrament, under the miniſtry of Mr. Rowland, was enough to make a perſon's heart burn within him. At ſeven of the morning I have ſeen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ten thouſand from different parts, in the midſt of ſermon, crying, <hi>Gogunniant—bendyitti</hi>— ready to leap for joy.

                  </note>, and preached about forty times.</p>
               <p>In May he went back to London,
<q>Once more, as he expreſſes it, to attack the prince of darkneſs in Moorfields,</q>
in the time of the holidays. The congregations were amazingly great, and much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.

               <p>About the middle of June he made another excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and preached at Fairford, Glanfield, Burford, Bengeworth, and Glouceſter; alſo at Briſtol and

               <p>In Auguſt he returned to London, but made no long ſtay there.

               <p>February 1744, an event happened to him, which, amidſt all his ſucceſs, tended to keep him humble, and ſerved to cure him of a weakneſs to which he had been liable, the truſting to groundleſs impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It was the death of his only child, concerning whom he was ſo impreſſed, that he made no ſcruple of declaring before the birth, that the child would be a ſon, and that he hoped he would live to preach the goſpel. Several narrow eſcapes which Mrs. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field had during her pregnancy, confirmed him in his expectations; which were ſo high, that after he had publicly baptized the child at the Tabernacle, all went away, big with hopes of his being ſpared to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the work of God. But theſe fond expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were ſoon blaſted by the child's death, when he was about four months old. This was, no doubt, very humbling to the father; but he was helped to make the wiſeſt and beſt improvement of it.
<q>Tho' I am diſappointed, (ſays he writing to his friend<note n="‡" place="margin">Letter DXLVII.</note>)

of a living preacher by the death of my ſon; yet I hope what happened before his birth, and ſince at his death, has taught me ſuch leſſons, as if duly improved, may render his miſtaken parent more cautious, more ſober-minded, more experienced in Satan's devices, and conſequently more uſeful in his future labours to the church of God.</q>

               <p>March 3, he attended the aſſizes at Glouceſter. The occaſion was, in the Summer 1743, the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts had been perſecuted and abuſed by the mob, particularly at Hampton, where ſeveral were hurt, and the life of their preachers threatened. Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field having tried other methods in vain, reſolved with the advice and aſſiſtance of his brethren, to ſeek the protection of law: and accordingly got an information lodged againſt the Hampton rioters in the court of King's-Bench. Facts being proved by a variety of evidence, and the defendants making no reply, the rule was made abſolute; and an information filed againſt them. To this they pleaded, Not Guilty, and therefore the cauſe was referred in courſe to the aſſizes in Glouceſter. There he attended and got the better of his adverſaries. After a full hearing on both ſides, a verdict was given for the proſecutors, and all the defendants were brought in Guilty of the whole information lodged againſt them. This proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution had a very good effect. The rioters were greatly alarmed at the thoughts of having an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion iſſued out againſt them. But the intention of the Methodiſts was, to let them ſee what they could do, and then to forgive them <note n="*" place="margin">Letter DXLIX, DL.—See an account of this trial in his works, vol.

               <p>Some time before this, ſeveral anonymous papers, entitled,
<q>Obſervations on the Conduct and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of a certain Sect, uſually diſtinguiſhed by the name of Methodiſts,</q>

about in the religious ſocieties of London and Weſtminſter, and given to many private perſons, with ſtrict injunctions to part with them to no one. Mr. Whitefield having accidentally had the haſty pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of them; and finding many queries concerning him and his conduct contained in them; and having applied for a copy, which was refuſed him, he thought it his duty to publiſh an advertiſement, deſiring, (as he knew not how ſoon he might embark for Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia) a ſpeedy, open publication of the ſaid papers, that he might make a candid and impartial anſwer. He had reaſon to believe the Biſhop of London was concerned in compoſing or reviſing them: but that he might not be miſtaken, after the publication of the advertiſement, he wrote the Biſhop a letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he deſired to know, whether his Lordſhip was the author or not; and alſo deſired a copy. The Biſhop ſent word, "He ſhould hear from him." Some time after, one Mr. Owen, printer to the Biſhop, left a letter for Mr. Whitefield, informing him that he had orders from ſeveral of the Biſhops, to print the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, &amp;c. with ſome few additions, for their uſe; and when the impreſſion was finiſhed, Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field ſhould have a copy.—For theſe reaſons, Mr. Whitefield thought it proper to direct his Anſwer to the Obſervations, to the Biſhop of London, and the other Biſhops concerned in the publication of them. This Anſwer occaſioned the Rev. Mr. Church's Expoſtulatory Letter to Mr. Whitefield; to which he ſoon replied, with thanks to the Author for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing his name<note n="*" place="margin">See his works, vol.

               <p>Having reſolved to make another viſit to America, whither Mr. Smith, a merchant, then in England, in

<q>In my way, ſays he, I preached at Wellington, where one Mr. Darracott had been a bleſſed inſtrument of doing much good. At Exeter alſo, I reviſited, where many ſouls were awakened to the divine life. At Biddeford, where good Mr. Hervey had been cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, we had much of the power of God; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at Kingſbridge.

It is remarkable, that juſt before his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at Plymouth, he was in danger of being killed. Four Gentleman, it ſeems, came to the houſe of one of his particular friends, kindly enquiring after him, and deſiring to know where he lodged. Soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Mr. Whitefield received a letter, informing him, that the writer was a nephew of Mr. S—, an Attorney at New-York; that he had the pleaſure of ſupping with Mr. Whitefield at his uncle's houſe; and deſired his company to ſup with him, and a few more friends, at a tavern. Mr. Whitefield ſent him word, that it was not cuſtomary for him to ſup abroad at taverns, but ſhould be glad of the Gentleman's
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:013298_0138_0F904E9FEF31AA40"/>
company to eat a morſel with him at his lodging: he accordingly came and ſupped; but was obſerved fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to look around him, and to be very abſent. At laſt he took his leave, and returned to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the tavern; and being by them interrogated, what he had done, he anſwered,
<q>That he had been uſed ſo civilly, he had not the heart to touch him.</q>
Upon which, it ſeems, another of the company, a Lieutenant of a man of war, laid a wager of ten gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, that he would do his buſineſs for him. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, however, had the precaution to take away his ſword. It was now about midnight, and Mr. Whitefield having that day preached to a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and viſited the French priſoners, was gone to bed: when the landlady came and told him that a well-dreſſed gentleman deſired to ſpeak with him, Mr. Whitefield, imagining it was ſomebody under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, deſired him to be brought up. He came, and ſat down by the bed ſide, congratulated him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſucceſs of his miniſtry, and expreſſed much concern at being detained from hearing him. Soon after he broke out into the moſt abuſive language, and in a cruel and cowardly manner, beat him in his bed. The landlady and her daughter hearing the noiſe, ruſhed into the room, and ſeized upon him; but he ſoon diſengaged himſelf from them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his blows on Mr. Whitefield, who being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that he intended to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Take courage, I am ready to help you.</q>
But by the repeated cry of Murder, the alarm was now ſo great, that they both made off.
<q>The next morning, ſays, Mr. Whitefield <note n="*" place="margin">Letter DLII.</note>, I was to expound at a private houſe, and then to ſet out for Biddeford. Some urged me to ſtay and proſecute; but being better

employed, I went on my intended journey, was greatly bleſſed in preaching the everlaſting go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and upon my return was well paid for what I had ſuffered: curioſity having led perhaps two thouſand more than ordinary, to ſee and hear a man that had like to have been murdered in his bed.

                  </note>, Mr. Whitefield embarked in the beginning of Auguſt 1744, though in a poor ſtate of health. The tediouſneſs of the voyage, he imagined, occaſioned no ſmall addition to a violent pain in his ſide. However, he ſays,
<q>Bleſſed be God, in a week or two after we ſailed, we began to have a church in our ſhip. We had regular public prayer morning and evening, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent communion, and days of humiliation and faſting.</q>
After a paſſage of eleven weeks<note n="†" place="margin">His letter to the Clergy of the Dioceſs of Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field and Coventry, is dated during this voyage.</note>, he arrived a York in New-England. Colonel Pepperell went with ſome friends in his own boat, to invite

What gave me moſt concern was, that notice had been given of my being to preach. Whilſt the Doctor was preparing a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine feeling my pains abated, I on a ſudden cried, 'Doctor, my pains are ſuſpended: by the help of God, I will go and preach, and then come home and die.' In my own apprehenſion, and in all appearance to others, I was a dying man. I preached. The people heard me as ſuch. The inviſible realities of another world lay open to my view. Expecting to ſtretch into eternity, and to be with my Maſter before the morning, I ſpoke with peculiar energy. Such effects followed the words, I thought it was worth dying for a thouſand times. Though wonderfully comforted within, at my return home, I thought I was dying indeed. I was laid on a bed upon the ground, near the fire, and I heard my friends ſay, 'He is gone.' But God was pleaſed to order it otherwiſe. I gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually recovered; and ſoon after, a poor Negro-woman would ſee me. She came, ſat down upon the ground, and looked earneſtly in my face, and then ſaid, in broken language;</q>
                  <q>Maſter, you juſt go to Heaven's gate. But Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <q>Get you

down, get you down, you muſt not come here yet; but go firſt, and call ſome more poor Negroes.</q>
I prayed to the Lord, that if I was to live, this might be the event.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>In about three weeks I was enabled, though in great weakneſs, to reach Boſton; and every day was more and more confirmed, in what I had heard about a glorious work, that had been begun and carried on there, and in almoſt all parts of New-England, for two years together. Before my laſt embarkation from Georgia, Mr. Colman, and Mr. Cooper, wrote me word, that upon Mr. Tenant's going out as an itinerant, the awakening greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in various places<note n="*" place="margin">See Prince's Chriſtian Hiſtory, or hiſtorical col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, &amp;c.

But as the ſame ſun that enlightens and warms the earth, gives vent to noxious inſects; ſo the ſame work, that for a while carried all before it, was ſadly blemiſhed through the ſubtility of ſatan <note n="†" place="margin">Thus it was at the Reformation in Germany.</note>, and the want of more experience in Miniſters and people, who had never ſeen ſuch a ſcene before. Oppoſers, who waited for ſuch an occaſion, did all they could to aggravate every thing. One rode ſeveral hundred miles, to pick up all the accounts he could get of what was wrong, in what he called only, 'a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſtir.' And God having been pleaſed to ſend me firſt, all was laid upon me. Teſtimonies ſigned by various Miniſters came out againſt me <note n="‡" place="margin">He wrote an anſwer, to a teſtimony by Harvard College. See Works, vol. IV.</note> almoſt

every day, and the diſorders were alſo at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; ſo that for a while, my ſituation was rendered uncomfortable. But amidſt all this ſmoke, a bleſſed fire broke out. The awakened ſouls were as eager as ever to hear the word. Having heard that I had expounded early in Scotland, they beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged I would do the ſame in Boſton. I complied, and opened a lecture at ſix in the morning. I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom preached to leſs than two thouſand. It was delightful to ſee ſo many of both ſexes, neatly dreſſed, flocking to hear the word, and returning home to family-prayer and breakfaſt, before the oppoſers were out of their beds.

Obliged thus to ſtay, and looking up to me, waiting for ſome freſh matter for ridicule, God was pleaſed to prick him to the heart.

                  <q>Saturday Nov. 24, 1744. The Rev. Mr. Whitefield was ſo far revived, as to be able to ſet out from Portſmouth to Boſton, whither he came in a very feeble ſtate the Monday evening after: ſince which,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:013298_0144_0F904EA7389565B8"/>
he has been able to preach in ſeveral of our largeſt houſes of public worſhip, particularly the Rev. Dr. Colman's, Dr. Sewall's, Mr. Webb's, and Mr. Gee's, to crowded aſſemblies of people, and with great and growing acceptance. At Dr. Colman's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and the conſent of the church, on Lord's-day after his arrival, he adminiſtered to them the Holy Communion. And laſt Lord's-day he preached for Mr. Cheever of Chelſea, and adminiſtered the Holy Supper there. The next day preached for the Rev. Mr. Emerſon of Malden. Yeſterday he ſet out to preach at ſome towns to the northward, propoſes to return hither the next Wedneſday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and after a few days, to comply with the earneſt invitations of ſeveral Miniſters to go and preach to their congregations in the ſouthern parts of the province. He comes with the ſame extra-ordinary ſpirit of meekneſs, ſweetneſs, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal benevolence, as before. In oppoſition to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſeparation and bigotry, is ſtill for holding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all proteſtant churches. In oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to enthuſiaſm, he preaches a cloſe adherence to the Scriptures, the neceſſity of trying all impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by them, and of rejecting whatever is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, as deluſions. In oppoſition to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſm, he preaches up all kinds of relative and religious duties, though to be performed in the ſtrength of Chriſt: and in ſhort, the doctrines of the church of England, and of the firſt fathers of this country. As before, he firſt applies himſelf to the underſtandings of his hearers, and then to the affections. And the more he preaches, the more he convinces people of their miſtakes about him, and increaſes their ſatisfaction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was now ſpring 1745, and at that time the firſt expedition was ſet on foot againſt Cape Breton. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Pepperell, who was then at Boſton, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attended Mr. Whitefield's lecture, was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:013298_0145_0F904EA931B7CC68"/>
the day before he accepted a commiſſion, to be General in that expedition, to aſk Mr. Whitefield's opinion of the matter. He told him, with his uſual frankneſs,
<q>That he did not, indeed, think the ſcheme propoſed for taking Louiſburgh, very promiſing: that the eyes of all would be upon him. It he did not ſucceed, the widows and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans of the ſlain ſoldiers, would be like lions robbed of their whelps; but if it pleaſed God to give him ſucceſs, envy would endeavour to eclipſe his glory; he had need, therefore, if he went, to go with a ſingle eye; and then, there was no doubt, but if Providence really called him, he would find his ſtrength proportioned to the day,</q>
About the ſame time, Mr. Sherburne, another of Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's friends, being appointed one of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, told him,
<q>He muſt favour the expedition, otherwiſe the ſerious people would be diſcouraged from enliſting; not only ſo, but inſiſted he ſhould give him a motto for his flag, for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoldiers.</q>
This he refuſed to do, as it would be acting out of character. But Mr. Sherburne would take no denial. He therefore, at laſt, gave them one, <hi>Nil deſperandum Chriſto Duce.</hi>
                  <q>If Chriſt be Captain, no fear of a defeat.</q>
Upon which great numbers enliſtened<note n="*" place="margin">Letter DLXXII.</note>. And before their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, the officers deſired him to give them a ſermon. This he readily complied with, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from theſe words:
<q>As many as were diſtreſſed, as many as were diſcontented, as many as were in debt, came to David, and he became a Captain over them.</q>
He ſpiritualized the ſubject, and told them, How diſtreſſed ſinners came to Jeſus Chriſt, the ſon David; and in his application, exhorted the ſoldiers to behave like the ſoldiers of David, and the officers to act like David's worthies; then he made no manner of doubt, there would be good news from

<q>He ſhould think it an honour, but believed, as he generally preached three times a day, in various places, to large congregations, he could do more ſervice by ſtirring up the people to pray, and thereby ſtrengthening his, and his ſoldiers hands.</q>
And in this practice he perſiſted during the ſiege of Louiſburgh,
<q>I believe, adds he<note n="*" place="margin">M. S. and Letter DLXXII.</note>, if ever people went with a diſintereſted view, the New-Englan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders did then. Though many of them were raw and undiſciplined, yet numbers were ſubſtantial perſons who left their farms, and willingly ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all for their country's good. An amazing ſcene of Providence appeared<note n="†" place="margin">See Mr. Prince's Sermon on that occaſion.</note>, and though ſome diſcouraging accounts were ſent during the latter end of the ſiege; yet in about ſix weeks, news was brought of the ſurrender of Louiſburgh.

               <p>The New-England people had, ſome time ago, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to build him a large houſe to preach in; but as this ſcheme might have abridged his liberty of itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, he thanked them for their kind offer, and at the ſame time begged leave to refuſe the accepting of it<note n="‡" place="margin">Letter DLXVII.</note>. As his bodily ſtrength increaſed, and his health grew better, he began to move farther ſouthward; and, after preaching eaſtward, as far as Caſcobay and North Yarmouth, he went through Connecticut, Plymouth, Rhode-Iſland, preaching to

<q>there was much ſmoke, yet every day I had more and more convincing proof, that a bleſſed Goſpel fire had been kindled in the hearts both of Miniſters and people. At New-York, where I preached as uſual, I found that the ſeed ſown, had ſprung up abundantly: and at the eaſt-end of Long-Iſland ſaw many inſtances. In my way to Philadelphia, I had the pleaſure of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by an interpreter, to ſome converted Indians, and of ſeeing near fifty young ones in one ſchool, near Free-hold, learning the Aſſembly's Catechiſm.

He then read them to others; they were awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and convinced.

                  <q>In North Carolina, where I ſtayed too ſhort a time, little was done. At Georgia, through the badneſs of the inſtitution, and the Truſtees obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in not altering it, my load of debt and care was greatly increaſed, and at times almoſt overwhelmed me. But I had the pleaſure of ſeeing one, who came as a player from New-York, now converted unto God, and a preacher of Jeſus Chriſt. One Mr. Ratteray brought me ten pounds: and at my return northward, freſh ſupplies were raiſed up. The generous Charleſtown people raiſed a ſubſcription of three hundred pounds, with which I bought land, being cheap, during the war; and a plantation, and a few negroes were purchaſed at Indian-Land. Thus, for a while, the gap was ſtopped. I preached a ſermon upon the rebellion. Was very ſick at Philadelphia; kindly received at Bohemia, and at New-York.</q>

               <p>MR. Whitefield met with the kindeſt reception at Bermudas, and for above a month, he preached generally twice a day, traverſing the Iſland from one end to the other: but his activity, uſefulneſs, and treatment, will beſt appear by an extract from his manuſcript journal of that period.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſimplicity and plainneſs of the people, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the pleaſant ſituation of the iſland, much delighted me.—The Rev. Mr. Holiday, Miniſter of Spaniſh-Point, received me in a moſt affectionate chriſtian manner, and begged I would make his houſe my home.—In the evening, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded at the houſe of Mr. Savage of Port-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which was very commodious, and which alſo he would have me make my home.—I went with Mr. Savage, in a boat, lent us by Captain —, to the town of St. George, in order to pay our reſpects to the Governor. All along we had a moſt pleaſant proſpect of the other part of the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but a more pleaſant one I never ſaw. One Mrs. Smith, of St. George's, for whom I had a letter of recommendation from my dear old friend Mr. Smith of Charleſtown, received me into her houſe. About noon, with one of the council and Mr. Savage, I waited upon the Governor. He received us courteouſly, and invited us to dine with him and the Council at the tavern. We accepted the invitation, and all behaved with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <q>Sunday, March 20. Read prayers, and preached twice this day, to what were eſteemed here large auditories, in the morning at Spaniſh-Point church, and in the evening at Brackiſh-pond church, about two miles diſtant from each other. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I ſpoke with greater freedom than in the morning, and I truſt not altogether in vain. All were attentive—ſome wept. I dined with Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Butterfield, one of the council, and received ſeveral invitations to other Gentlemen's houſes.— May God bleſs and reward them, and incline them to open their heart to receive the Lord Jeſus! Amen and Amen!</q>

The company was here alſo large, attentive, and affected. Our Lord gave me utterance: I expounded on the firſt part of the viiith chapter of Jeremiah. After lecture, Mr. Riddle, a Counſellor, invited me to his houſe, as did Mr. Paul, an aged Preſbyterian Miniſter, to his pulpit; which I complied with upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the report was true, that the Governor had ſerved the Miniſters with an injunction that I ſhould not preach in the churches.</q>

It has been a pleaſant one to mine. Both morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and afternoon I preached to a large auditory, for Bermudas, in Mr. Paul's meeting-houſe, which I ſuppoſe contains above four hundred. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of negroes, and many others, were in the veſtry, porch, and about the houſe. The word ſeemed to be clothed with a convincing power, and to make its way into the hearts of the hearers. Between ſermons, I was entertained very civilly in a neighbouring-houſe: Judge Baſcome and three more of the Council came thither; each gave me an invitation to his houſe.—O how does the Lord make way for a poor ſtranger in a ſtrange land!— After the ſecond ſermon, I dined with Mr. Paul, and in the evening expounded to a very large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at Counſellor Riddle's.—My body was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weak, but the Lord carried me through, and cauſed me to go to reſt rejoicing.

Towards the concluſion of the ſermon, the hearers began to be more affected than I have yet ſeen them.—Surely the Lord Jeſus will give me ſome ſeals in this iſland!

Gentlemen and other people, with my friend Mr. Holiday, who came from different quarters to hear me.—Before I began preaching, I went round to ſee a moſt remarkable cave, which very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the exquiſite workmanſhip of Him, 'who in his ſtrength ſetteth faſt the mountains, and is girded about with power.' Whilſt I was in the cave, quite unexpectedly I turned and ſaw Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor Riddle, who with his ſon came to hear me, and whilſt we were in the boat told me, that he had been with the Governor, who declared he had no perſonal prejudice againſt me, and wondered I did not come to town and preach there, for it was the deſire of the people; and that any houſe in the town, the Court-houſe, not excepted, ſhould be at my ſervice. Thanks be to God for ſo much favour!—If his cauſe requires it, I ſhall have more.—He knows my heart; I value the favour of man no farther than as its makes room for the Goſpel, and gives me a large ſcope to promote the glory of God. There being no capacious houſe upon the iſland, I preached for the firſt time here in the open air. All heard very attentive, and it was very pleaſant after ſermon to ſee ſo many boats full of people returning from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. I talked ſeriouſly to ſome in our own boat, and began to ſing a pſalm, in which they readily joined.</q>

Preached twice this day at Mr. Paul's meeting-houſe, as on the laſt Sabbath, but with greater freedom and power, eſpecially in the morning, and I think to as great, if not greater auditories: Dined with Colonel H—vy, another of the Council; viſited a ſick woman, where many came to hear, and expounded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to a great company at Capt. John Darrel's, Mrs. D—l's ſon, who with his wife courteouſly entertained me, and deſired me to make his houſe

               <p>
                  <q>Wedneſday, April 6. Preached yeſterday at the houſe of Mr. Anthony Smith, of Baylis Bay, with a conſiderable degree of warmth, and rode after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to St. George's, the only town on the iſland. The gentlemen of the town had ſent mean invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by Judge Baſcome, and he with ſeveral others came to viſit me at my lodgings, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that the Governor deſired to ſee me.— About ten I waited upon his Excellency, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me with great civility, and told me he had no objection againſt my perſon or my principles, having never yet heard me, and he knew nothing in reſpect to my conduct in moral life, that might prejudice him againſt me; but his inſtructions were, to let none preach in the iſland, unleſs he had a written licence to preach ſomewhere in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica or the Weſt-Indies: at the ſame time he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it was but a matter of mere form. I informed his Excellency, that I had been regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inducted to the pariſh of Savannah; that I was ordained prieſt by letters diſmiſſory from my Lord of London, and under no church cenſure from his Lordſhip; and would always read the church prayers, if the clergy would give me the uſe of their churches. I added farther, that a Miniſter's pulpit was looked upon as his freehold, and that I knew one clergyman who had denied his own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan the uſe of his pulpit. But I told his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, I was ſatisfied with the liberty he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and would not act contrary to his injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I then begged leave to be diſmiſſed, becauſe I was to preach at eleven o'clock. His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:013298_0156_0F904EB07B157530"/>
ſaid, he intended to do himſelf the pleaſure to hear me. At eleven the church-bell rung, the church bible, prayer book, and cuſhion were ſent to the town-houſe. The Governor, ſeveral of the council, the Miniſter of the pariſh, and aſſembly-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a great number of the town's people, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in great order. I was very ſick, through a cold I catched laſt night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I read the church prayers, (the firſt leſſon was the xvth of the firſt book of Samuel) and preached on thoſe words, 'Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation.' Being weak and faint, and having much of the head-ach, I did not do that juſtice to my ſubject, as I ſometimes am enabled to do; but the Lord ſo helped me, that, as I found afterwards, the Governor and the other gentlemen expreſſed their approbation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged they did not expect to be ſo well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.—Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto thy free grace be all the glory!</q>

               <p>
                  <q>After ſermon, Dr. F—bs, and Mr. P—t, the Collector, came to me, and deſired me to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, and the gentlemen of the town with my company to dine with them. I accepted the invitation. The Governor and the Preſident and Judge Baſcome were there. All wondered at my ſpeaking ſo freely and fluently without notes. The Governor aſked me whether I uſed minutes. I anſwered, No. He ſaid it was a great gift. At table his Excellency introduced ſomething of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by aſking me the meaning of the word <hi>Hades.</hi> Several other things were ſtarted about free-will, Adam's fall, predeſtination, &amp;c. to all which God enabled me to anſwer ſo pertinently, and taught me to mix the <hi>utile</hi> and <hi>dulce</hi> ſo together, that all at table ſeemed highly pleaſed, ſhook me by the hand, and invited me to their reſpective houſes. The Governor, in particular, aſked me to dine with him on the morrow, and Dr. F—b, one
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:013298_0157_0F904EB12635CCA0"/>
of his particular intimates, invited me to drink tea in the afternoon. I thanked all, returned proper reſpects, and went to my lodgings with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of thankfulneſs for the aſſiſtance vouchſafed me, and abaſed before God at the conſideration of my unſpeakable unworthineſs. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, about five o'clock, I expounded the parable of the Prodigal Son, to many people at a private houſe, and in the evening had liberty to ſpeak freely and cloſely to thoſe that ſupped with me.— O that this may be the beginning of good goſpel times to the inhabitants of this town! Lord, teach me to deal prudently with them, and cauſe them to melt under thy word!</q>

                  <q>Friday, April 8. Preached yeſterday with great clearneſs and freedom, to about fourſcore people at a houſe on David's iſland, over againſt St. George's town; went and lay at Mr. Holiday's, who came in a boat to fetch me; and this day I heard him preach and read prayers, after which I took the ſacrament from him. Honeſt man, he would have had me adminiſter and officiate; but I choſe not to do it, leſt I ſhould bring him into trouble after my departure. However, in the afternoon, I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at one Mr. Tod's, in the ſame pariſh, to a very large company indeed. The Lord was with me. My heart was warm, and what went from the heart, I truſt went to the heart, for many were affected. —O that they may be converted alſo! Then will it be a <hi>good</hi> Friday indeed to their ſouls.</q>

                  <q>Sunday, April 10. Dined and converſed yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day very agreeably with Judge Baſcome; who ſeems to have the greateſt inſight into the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Arminian and Calviniſtical ſcheme of any one I have yet met with upon the iſland. In the afternoon, I viſited a ſick paralytic, and this day I preached twice again at Mr. Paul's meeting-houſe. The congregations were rather
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:013298_0158_0F904EB1E98C0C20"/>
larger than ever, and the power of God ſeemed to be more amongſt them. I think I ſee a viſible alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the better every Lord's day. Bleſſed be God! In the evening I expounded at Mr. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Dorrell's, (where I dined) to a very large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; then went to his kinſman's, my uſual lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on Saturday and Sunday evenings, who with his wife and other friends, ſeemed kinder and kinder daily.—Good meaſure, preſſed down and running over, may the Lord, both as to ſpirituals and temporals, return into all their boſoms!</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Saturday, April 16. Preached ſince Lord's day at five different houſes, to concerned and affected congregations, at different parts of the iſland, but was more indiſpoſed one night after going to bed, than I had been for ſome time. On two of the days of this week, I dined with the Preſident and Captain Spafford, one of the council, both which entertained me with the utmoſt civility.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Sunday 17. Still God magnifies his power and goodneſs more and more. This morning we had a pleaſing ſight at Mr. Paul's meeting-houſe. I began to preach, and the people to hear and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as in days of old at home. Indeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is encouraging. Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoul! After preaching twice to large congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the meeting-houſe, I at the deſire of the parents, preached in the evening a ſermon at the funeral of a little boy about five years of age. A great number of people attended, and the Lord enabled me ſo to ſpeak as to affect many of the hearers. Bleſſed be the Lord for this day's work! —Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto thy free grace be all the glory!</q>

                  <q>Sunday, April 24. The laſt week being rainy, I preached only five times in private houſes, and this day but once in the meeting-houſe; but I hope neither time without effect. This evening
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:013298_0159_0F904EB2A6490A68"/>
expounded at Counſellor Riddle's, who with the other gentlemen, treats me with greater reſpect every day. Colonel Gilbert, one of the council, has lent me his horſe during my ſtay, and Mr. D—ll this morning informed me of a deſign the gentlemen had, to raiſe a contribution to help me to diſcharge my arrears, and ſupport my orphan family.—Thanks be given to thy name, O God! Thou knoweſt all things; thou knoweſt that I want to owe no man any thing, but love and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for Betheſda after my deceaſe. Thou haſt promiſed thou wilt fulfil the deſires of them that fear thee. I believe, Lord, help my unbelief, that thou wilt fulfil this deſire of my ſoul. Even ſo, Amen!</q>

                  <q>Saturday, April 30. Preached ſince Lord's day, two funeral ſermons, and at five different houſes in different parts of the iſland to ſtill larger and larger auditories, and perceived the people to be affected more and more. Twice or thrice I preached without doors. Riding in the ſun, and preaching very earneſtly, a little fatigued me; ſo that this evening I was obliged to lie down for ſome time.— <hi>Faint, yet purſuing</hi>; muſt be my motto ſtill.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sunday, May 1. This morning was a little ſick; but I truſt God gave us a happy beginning of the new month. I preached twice with power, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the morning, to a very great congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the meeting-houſe; and in the evening, having given previous notice, I preached about four miles diſtant, in the fields, to a large compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of negroes, and a number of white people who came to hear what I had to ſay to them. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in all, there were near fifteen hundred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As the ſermon was intended for the negroes, I gave the auditory warning, that my diſcourſe would be chiefly directed to them, and that I ſhould endeavour to imitate the example of Elijah,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:013298_0160_0F904EB3659BD2A8"/>
who when he was about to raiſe the child, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted himſelf to its length. The negroes ſeemed very ſenſible and attentive. When I aſked them, whether all of them did not deſire to go to heaven, one of them with a very audible voice ſaid, 'Yes, Sir.' This cauſed a little ſmiling; but in general, every thing was carried on with great decency; and I believe the Lord enabled me ſo to diſcourſe, as to touch the negroes, and yet not to give them the leaſt umbrage to ſlight or behave imperiouſly to their maſters. If ever a Miniſter in preaching, need the wiſdom of the ſerpent to be joined with the harmleſſneſs of the dove, it muſt be when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing to negroes.—Vouchſafe me this favour, O God, for thy dear Son's ſake!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Monday, May 2. Upon enquiry, I found that ſome of the negroes did not like my preaching, becauſe I told them of their curſing, ſwearing, thieving, and lying. One or two of the worſt of them, as I was informed, went away. Some ſaid, they would not go any more: They liked Mr. M—r better, for he never told them of theſe things; and I ſaid, their hearts were as black as their faces. They expected, they ſaid, to hear me ſpeak againſt their maſters. Bleſſed be God, that I was directed not to ſay any thing, this firſt time, to the maſters at all, though my text led me to it. It might have been of bad conſequence, to tell them their duty, or charge them too roundly with the neglect of it, before their ſlaves. They would mind all I ſaid to their maſters, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps nothing that I ſaid to them. Every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon. Lord, teach me always that due ſeaſon, wherever I am called, to give ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther black or white, a portion of thy word! How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, others of the poor creatures, I hear, were very thankful, and came home to their maſter's houſes, ſaying, that they would ſtrive to ſin no
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:013298_0161_0F904EB42AFBF3B8"/>
more. Poor hearts! Theſe different accounts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me; and upon the whole, I could not help rejoicing, to find that their conſciences were ſo far awake.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Saturday, May 7. In my converſation theſe two days, with ſome of my friends, I was diverted much, in hearing ſeveral things that paſſed among the poor negroes, ſince my preaching to them laſt Sunday. One of the women, it ſeems, ſaid, 'That if the book I preached out of was the beſt book that was ever bought at, and came out of London, ſhe was ſure it had never all that in it, which I ſpoke to the negroes.' The old man, who ſpoke out loud laſt Sunday, and ſaid 'Yes,' when I aſked them, Whether all the negroes would not go to heaven? Being queſtioned by ſomebody, Why he ſpoke out ſo? Anſwered, 'That the gentleman put the queſtion once or twice to them, and the other fools had not the manners to make me any anſwer, till, at laſt, I ſeemed to point at him, and he was aſhamed that no body ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me, and therefore he did.' Another, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering why I ſaid, 'Negroes had black hearts;' was anſwered by his black brother thus: 'Ah, thou fool, doſt thou not underſtand it? He means black with ſin.' Two more girls were overheard by their miſtreſs, talking about religion, and they ſaid, 'They knew, if they did not repent, they muſt be damned.' From all which I infer, that theſe Bermudas negroes are more knowing than I ſuppoſed; that their conſciences are awake, and conſequently prepared, in a good meaſure, for hearing the Goſpel preached unto them.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Sunday, May 8. This alſo, I truſt, has been a good Sabbath. In the morning I was helped to preach powerfully to a melting, and rather a larger congregation than ever, in Mr. Paul's meeting-houſe; and in the evening, to almoſt as large a
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:013298_0162_0F904EB4F76A5338"/>
congregation of black and white as laſt Sunday, in the fields, near my hearty friend Mr. Holiday's houſe. To ſee ſo many black faces was affecting. They heard very attentively, and ſome of them now began to weep.—May God grant them a godly ſorrow, that worketh repentance not to be repented of!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Friday, May 13. This afternoon preached over the corpſe of Mr. Paul's eldeſt ſon, about twenty-four years of age; and by all I could hear and judge of by converſing with him, he did, indeed, die in the Lord. I viſited him twice laſt Lord's day, and was quite ſatisfied with what he ſaid, though he had not much of the ſenſible preſence of God. I find he was a preacher upon his death-bed. For he exhorted all his companions to love Chriſt in ſincerity, and bleſſed his brother and ſiſter, and, I think, his father and mother, juſt before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A great many people attended the funeral. I preached on Luke vii. 13. 'And when the Lord ſaw her, he had compaſſion on her, and ſaid unto her, weep not.' Many were affected in the application of my diſcourſe, and, I truſt, ſome will be induced, by this young man's good example, to remember their Redeemer in the days of their youth.—Grant it, O Lord, for thy dear Son's ſake!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sunday, May 15. Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within thee praiſe his holy name! This morning I preached my farewel ſermon at Mr. Paul's meeting-houſe, it was quite full, and, as the Preſident ſaid, above a hundred and fifty whites, beſides blacks, were round the houſe. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſat on every face; and when I came to take my leave, oh, what a ſweet unaffected weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was there to be ſeen every where. I believe there were few dry eyes. The negroes likewiſe without doors, I heard wept plentifully. My own
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:013298_0163_0F904EB5E4E23320"/>
heart was affected, and though I have parted from friends ſo often, yet I find every freſh parting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unman's me, and very much affects my heart. Surely, a great work is begun in ſome ſouls at Bermudas.—Carry it on, O Lord! and if it be thy will, ſend me to this dear people again. Even ſo, Lord Jeſus. Amen!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After ſermon, I dined with three of the Council and other gentlemen and ladies, at Captain Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come's; and from thence we went to a funeral, at which Mr. M—r preached; and after that I expounded on our Lord's Transfiguration, at the houſe of one Mrs. Harvey, ſiſter to dear Mr. Smith of Charleſtown. The houſe was exceeding full, and it was ſuppoſed above three hundred ſtood in the yard. The Lord enabled me to lift my voice like a trumpet. Many wept. Mr. M—r returned from the funeral with me, and attended the lecture, as did the three Counſellors, with whom I converſed very freely.—May God reward them, and all the dear people of the iſland, for thoſe many and great favours they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on me, who am the chief of ſinners, and leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints!</q>

I preached only three times, but to almoſt three times larger audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories than uſual. Indeed the fields are white, ready unto harveſt. God has been pleaſed to bleſs private viſits. Go where I will, upon the leaſt notice, houſes are crowded, and the poor ſouls that follow are ſoon drenched in tears. This day I took, as it were, another farewel. As the ſhip did not ſail, I preached at Somerſet in the morning, to a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:013298_0164_0F904EB7363768E8"/>
large congregation in the fields, and expounded in the evening to a large one at Mr. Harvey's houſe, round which ſtood many hundreds of people. But in the morning and evening how did the poor ſouls weep. The Lord ſeemed to be with me in a peculiar manner, and though I was ready to die with heat and ſtraining, yet I was enabled to ſpeak louder, and with greater power, I think, than I have been before. Gifts and grace, eſpecially in the evening, were both in exerciſe. After the ſervice, when I lay down on the bed to reſt, many came weeping bitterly around me, and took their laſt farewel. Though my body was very weak, yet my ſoul was full of comfort. It magnified the Lord, and my ſpirit rejoiced in God my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Abundance of prayers and bleſſings were put up for my ſafe paſſage to England, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy return to Bermudas again. May they enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth! For God willing, I intend viſiting this dear people once more. In the mean while, with all humility and thankfulneſs of heart will I here, O Lord, ſet up my Ebenezer. For hitherto ſurely thou haſt help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me! I cannot help thinking that I was led to this iſland by a peculiar Providence. My dear friend, Mr. Smith of Charleſtown, has been made eſpecially inſtrumental thereto. Thanks be to the Lord for ſending me hither. I have been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a manner I dared not expect, and have met with little, very little oppoſition indeed. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſeem to be plain and open hearted. They have alſo been open handed. For they have load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with proviſions for my ſea-ſtore; and in the ſeveral pariſhes, by a private voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have raiſed me upwards of a hundred pounds ſterling. This will pay a little of Betheſda's debt, and enable me to make ſuch remittance to my dear yoke-fellow, as may keep her from being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:013298_0165_0F904EB7E539FFB0"/>
or too much beholden in my abſence. Bleſſed be God for bringing me out of my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments by degrees! May the Lord reward all my benefactors a thouſand fold! I hear that what was given, was given exceeding heartily, and people only lamented that they could do no more.</q>

During this voyage, among other letters, he wrote the following:</p>

                  <q>June 24, 1748. (on board.) Yeſterday I made an end of reviſing all my journals. Alas! alas! in how many things have I judged and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wrong. I have been too raſh and haſty in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing characters both of places and perſons. Being fond of Scripture language, I have often uſed a ſtile too apoſtolical, and at the ſame time, I have been too bitter in my zeal. Wild fire has been mixt with it, and I find that I frequently wrote and ſpoke in my own ſpirit, when I thought I was writing and ſpeaking by the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. I have likewiſe too much made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impreſſions my rule of acting, and too ſoon and too explicitly publiſhed what had been better kept in longer, or told after my death. By theſe things, I have hurt the bleſſed cauſe I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and alſo ſtirred up needleſs oppoſition. This has humbled me much, and made me think of a ſaying of Mr. Henry's, 'Joſeph had more honeſty than he had policy, or he never would have told his dreams.' At the ſame time, I cannot but praiſe GOD, who filled me with ſo much of his holy fire, and carried me, a poor weak youth, through ſuch a torrent both of popularity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,

and ſet ſo many ſeals to my unworthy miniſtrations. I bleſs him for ripening my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a little more, for giving me to ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and I hope, in ſome degree, to correct and amend ſome of my miſtakes.</q>

               <p>ON Mr. Whitefield's viſiting a few of his friends, immediately after his return, he found himſelf in no very agreeable ſituation. His congregation at the Tabernacle was ſadly ſcattered. And as to his outward circumſtances,he had ſold all his houſhold fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, to help to pay the Orphan-houſe debt, which yet was far from being cancelled. But under all theſe diſcouragements, he was ſtill ſupported. His congregation was ſoon re-united, and received him with the greateſt joy. And at this time a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected thing happened to him. Lady Huntingdon, before his arrival, had ordered Mr. Howel Harris to bring him to her houſe at Chelſea, as ſoon as he came aſhore. He went, and having preached twice, the Counteſs wrote to him, that ſeveral of the Nobility deſired to hear him. In a few days the Earl of Cheſterfield, and a whole circle of them attended, and having heard once, deſired they might hear him again.
<q>I therefore preached again (ſays he) in the evening, and went home, never more ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at any incident in my life <note n="*" place="bottom">M. S. and Letter DCLXXIII.</note>. All behaved quite well, and were in ſome degree affected, the Earl of Cheſterfield thanked me, and ſaid, 'Sir, I will not tell you what I ſhall tell others how I approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of you;' or words to this purpoſe. At laſt, Lord Bolingbroke came to hear, ſat like an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and was pleaſed to ſay, 'I had done great

<q>I have reaſon (ſays he, Letter DCC) to believe ſome have been awakened, and many quickened and comforted. My old friends are more ſolidly ſo than ever, and a foundation, I truſt has been laid for doing much good, if ever the Lord ſhould call thither again. Two Synods, and one Preſbytery, brought me upon the carpet; but all has worked for good.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He means the Synods of Glaſgow and Perth, and the Preſbytery of Edinburgh. What happened in the Synod of Glaſgow may be ſeen in a Pamphlet, entitled,
<q>A fair and impartial Account of the Debate in the Synod of Glaſgow and Air, 6 October, 1748, anent employing Mr. Whitefield:</q>
publiſhed at Edinburgh the ſame year, and ſuppoſed to be written by the Rev. Dr. Erſkine, who was then Miniſter at Kirkintilloch. The ſhort hiſtory of the matter is this. A motion was made, tending to prohibit or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Miniſters from employing Mr. Whitefield. The ſpeeches made in ſupport of the motion, were upon the following topics. His being a prieſt of the church of England. That he had not ſubcribed the Formula. His imprudencies. Chimerical ſcheme of the Orphan-houſe. Want of Evidence, that the money he collects is rightly applied. Aſſerting that
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:013298_0169_0F904EBD6228CBF8"/>
aſſurance is eſſential to faith. Encouraging a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on impulſes and immediate revelations. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring on ſlender evidence, ſome people converted, and others carnal and unregenerated. Often, indeed, pretending to repent of his blunders, and retract; but as often relapſing into them. And laſtly, his being under a ſentence of ſuſpenſion by Commiſſary Garden, from which he had appealed to the High Court of Chancery, and made oath to proſecute that appeal in a twelve month; and yet it was never proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the Miniſters who were againſt the motion, ſpoke in this manner. I bluſh to think, ſaid one, that any of our brethren ſhould befriend a propoſal, ſo contrary to that moderation and catholic ſpirit, which now is, and I hope ever ſhall be the glory of our church. I am ſenſible, many things in the Church of England need reformation; but I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her, notwithſtanding, as our ſiſter church. If Biſhop Butler, Biſhop Sherlock, or Biſhop Secker were in Scotland, I ſhould welcome them to my pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. In this I ſhould imitate Mr. Samuel Rutherford, as firm a Preſbyterian as any of us, who yet employed Biſhop Uſher. There is no law of Chriſt, no Act of Aſſembly prohibiting me to give my pulpit to an Epiſcopal, Independent, or Anabaptiſt Miniſters, if of found principles in the fundamentals of Religion, and of a ſober life. Our Church expreſsly enjoins, Act XIII. April 1711, that great tenderneſs is to be uſed to foreign Proteſtants. The requiring ſtrangers to ſubſcribe our Formula, before they preach with us, would lay as effectual a bar againſt employing thoſe of congregational principles, or Preſbyterian Non-ſubſcribers, as thoſe of the Church of England.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. Whitefield, ſaid another, there are few Miniſters whoſe character has been ſo well atteſted, by the moſt competent judges, both at home and abroad. One thing I cannot but obſerve: thoſe who
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:013298_0170_0F904EBDE6702A08"/>
have ſpoken moſt warmly againſt Mr. Whitefield in this debate, acknowledge they have made little or no enquiry into his character: whereas thoſe on the other ſide, have made a very careful enquiry; and that enquiry has turned out entirely to their ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. With regard to his imprudencies, there is a great difference betwixt blunders owing to a bad heart, and thoſe that are owing only to a miſinformed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; eſpecially, when the miſtakes that occaſioned them, have miſled ſeveral great and good men. Whether Mr. Whitefield's ſcheme of the Orphan-houſe be prudent or not, it is demonſtrable it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly meant. The Magiſtrates of Savannah publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three years ago, in the Philadelphia Gazette, an affidavit that they had carefully examined Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's receipts and diſburſements, and found that what he had collected in behalf of the Orphans, had been honeſtly applied; and that beſides, he had given conſiderably to them of his own property. As to his maintaining, that aſſurance is eſſential to faith; encouraging an unwarrantable regard to impreſſions; and being too haſty in pronouncing men carnal or converted; his ſentiments in theſe particulars, have been altered for upwards of two years. And now he ſcarce preaches a ſermon, without guarding his hearers againſt relying on impreſſions, and telling them that faith, and a perſuaſion we are juſtified, are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, and that a holy life is the beſt evidence of a gracious ſtate. Theſe retractions are owing to a real change of ſentiment. Letters from correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in New-England ſhew, that this change is, at leaſt, of two years date, and that ever ſince it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he has preached and acted with remarkable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Laſtly, with reſpect to the proſecution of his appeal; Mr. Whitefield exerted himſelf to the utmoſt to get his appeal heard, but could not prevail on the Lords Commiſſioners ſo much as once to meet on the affair; they, no doubt, thinking of Mr. Garden's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:013298_0171_0F904EBEB5FA4490"/>
proceedings with the contempt they deſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſay ſome, Mr. Whitefield being under a ſuſpenſion not yet reverſed, is now no Miniſter.</q>
But for what was he ſuſpended? Why, for no other crime, than omitting to uſe the form of prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the communion book, when officiating in a Preſbyterian congregation. And ſhall a meeting of Preſbyterian Miniſters, pay any regard to a ſentence which had ſuch a foundation?</p>
               <p>The iſſue of the debate was a rejecting of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a vote, 27 to 13; and a reſolution which was ſo expreſt as to be a decent burial of it; laying no new reſtriction on Miniſters from inviting ſtrangers, but leaving things preciſely as they were before. And they who choſe to give Mr. Whitefield their pulpits, never after met with any moleſtation. Upon the whole, the attacks made on Mr. Whitefield's character, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the occaſion of informing the Synod of the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of many aſperſions thrown out againſt him, of the great increaſe of his prudence and caution, and the remarkable change of his ſentiments and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſo far as either were offenſive. And thus what was intended for his reproach, turned out to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>While he was in Scotland, he endeavoured to do all the ſervice he could to the New-Jerſey College, and in conjunction with ſome Miniſters who wiſhed well to that inſtitution <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Letter on this ſubject to Mr. M'Laurin Letters DCCCXXXIV. and DCCCLXVIII.</note>, adviſed the ſending over a Miniſter from America to make application in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Which was afterwards done in the year 1754, when Mr. Tennent and Mr. Davies applied to the General Aſſembly, and obtained an appointment of a general collection. He alſo began to think of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Orphan-houſe not only a receptacle for father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children, but alſo a place of literature and aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:013298_0172_0F904EBF8A9DB278"/>
ſtudies. Such a place, he thought, was much wanted in the ſouthern parts of America; and if conducted in a proper manner, would be of great ſervice to the colony. He therefore, after his return to England, wrote to the Truſtees, ſignifying that this was his intention, if they would be pleaſed to put the colony upon another footing, and allow a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted uſe of negroes, without which he had long been of opinion, that Georgia never could be a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing province<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCXLIV.</note>. Mean time, he went on his uſual way, and with his uſual ſucceſs at London, Briſtol, and Glouceſter, during the winter. And in February 1749, made an excurſion to Exeter and Plymouth, where he found a ſtrange alteration in the people, ſince he had been firſt there, about five years before; they now received him with the greateſt joy, and were importunate to hear him; and many of them gave proofs of a ſolid converſion to God <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCXXXIII. and M. S.</note>.
<q>Now (ſays he) Plymouth ſeems to be quite a new place to me.</q>
As his health was impaired in London, he loved to range (as he calls it) after precious ſouls. Though he never wanted to make a ſect, or to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of a party.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have ſeen enough of popularity, (ſays he) to be ſick of it; and did not the intereſt of my bleſſed Maſter require my appearing in<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter DCCXLVII.</note> public, the world ſhould hear but little of me henceforward.</q>
Yet he could not think of remitting his diligence in the work of the Goſpel.
<q>I dread the thoughts of flagging in the latter ſtages of my road, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that he often uſes in writing to his friends <note n="§" place="bottom">Letters DCCLXXXVII. DCCCXCVII. and DCCCCXXIII.</note>.</q>
He was frequently very ill; but he imagined preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and travelling did him ſervice.
<q>Fear not your
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:013298_0173_0F904EC033B8B518"/>
weak body, (ſays he, in a letter to Mr. Hervey <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXXX.</note>; we are immortal till our work is done. Chriſt's labourers muſt live by miracle; if not, I muſt not live at all; for God only knows what I daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. My continual vomitings almoſt kill me, and yet the pulpit is my cure, ſo that my friends begin to pity me leſs, and to leave off that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caution, 'Spare thyſelf.' I ſpeak this to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>About this time, he wrote Remarks an a pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, entitled, The Enthuſiaſm of Methodiſts and Papiſts compared.</q>
Wherein (with a candour ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncommon in controverſial writings) he ſays,
<q>Several miſtakes in ſome parts of my paſt writings and conduct are acknowledged, and my preſent ſentiments concerning the Methodiſts explained.<note n="†" place="bottom">See his Works, vol. IV.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In March 1749, he returned to London from an excurſion of about ſix hundred miles in the weſt, where he had the pleaſure of ſeeing that his former viſits had been bleſſed with abundant ſucceſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter DCCXLIII.</note>. In May he went to Portſmouth, and preached every day for more than a week, to very large and attentive audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. Many were brought under convictions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſeemed to be univerſally removed, and people, that a few days before were ſpeaking all manner of evil againſt him, were very deſirous of his longer ſtay to preach the Goſpel <note n="§" place="bottom">Letter DCCLI.</note> among them.</p>
               <p>June 24. He writes from Briſtol:
<q>Yeſterday God brought me here, after having carried me a circuit of about eight hundred miles, and enabled me to preach, I ſuppoſe, to upwards of a hundred thouſand ſouls. I have been in eight Welch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and, I think, we have not had one dry meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The work in Wales is much upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and likely to increaſe daily. Had my dear
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:013298_0174_0F904EC1838DF538"/>
Hervey been there, to have ſeen the ſimplicity of ſo many dear ſouls, I am perſuaded he would have ſaid, <hi>Sit anima mea cum Methodiſtis</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCLXII.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the months of July and Auguſt he was at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Briſtol, Plymouth, Biddiford, Exeter. When he returned to London, he had the pleaſure of a viſit from two German Miniſters, who had been labouring among the Jews, and, it is ſaid, had been made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in converting many of them <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCLXXV.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the month of September he went into North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonſhire and Yorkſhire; and preached at Oundle, Abberford, Leeds, and Hawarth, where good Mr. Grimſhaw (who was ſo indefatigable in his endeavours to bring ſouls to Chriſt) was Miniſter. In his church they had above a thouſand communicants, and in the church-yard about ſix thouſand hearers. At Leeds, the auditory conſiſted of above ten thouſand. Thither Mr. Whitefield was invited by one of the Rev. Mr. Weſley's preachers, and by the ſocieties. And Mr. Charles Weſley coming there, gave notice of him to the people<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letters DCCLXXVIII, DCCLXXIX.</note>, and alſo introduced him to the pulpit in Newcaſtle, where he preached four times, and twice without doors.</p>
               <p>It being now late in the year, he did not go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Scotland, but returned to London, after having preached about thirty times in Yorkſhire, and above ten times in Cheſhire, and Lancaſhire. He was alſo at Sheffield and Nottingham. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were every where large and ſerious. Only in one or two places, he had a little raw treatment; but this he did not mind, while he had reaſon to think many received real benefit <note n="§" place="bottom">Letters DCCLXXXI, DCCLXXXVI.</note>. He arrived in London about the middle of November, and continued there till the beginning of February, employed in his uſual
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:013298_0175_0F904EC1B3BE6DF0"/>
manner. Having offered to aſſiſt, occaſionally, at Weſt-ſtreet chapel, it was accepted. Accordingly, he preached four or five times there, and adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sacrament twice or thrice. Congregations were very large <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXIX.</note>.</p>
               <p>February 6, 1750. He writes from Glouceſter <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXIV.</note>:
<q>Though I left London in a very weak condition, and the weather was but bad, I came here on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening, and was ſtrengthened to preach on Saturday, and likewiſe on Sunday evening, and twice the ſame day in the country, at the New-houſe and at Hampton.</q>
And again from Briſtol, February 12.
<q>Since I wrote laſt, we have been favoured both in Glouceſter city, and in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with very pleaſant and delightful ſeaſons <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXVI.</note>. I have preached about twenty times, within this eight or nine days; and though frequently expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rain and hail, am much better than when I left London.</q>
From Briſtol he went to Exeter, and to Plymouth, and in his way met with the Rev. Mr. Pearſall, a diſſenting Miniſter at Taunton, and Mr. Darracott at Wellington; both of whom he ſpeaks of in his letters with the higheſt regard <note n="§" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXX.</note>. At Plymouth he preached twelve times in ſix days, and the longer he preached, he had the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hearers. His friends grew more and more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the fury of his enemies began to ſubſide. From thence he travelled near to the Land's-end, preaching in a great many places, ſuch as Taviſtock. St. Ginny's<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <q>Four of Mr. Weſley's Preachers were preſent, and three Clergymen, Mr. Bennet aged fourſcore, Mr. Thompſon, and Mr. Grigg.</q>
Letter DCCCXXIV.
<q>I found, as I went along, a moſt bleſſed work had carried on by the inſtrumentality of the Meſſrs. Weſleys, and their fellow-labourers.</q>
M. S.</note>, Port Iſaac, Camelford, St. Andrews,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:013298_0176_0F904EC29651F958"/>
Redruth, Gwinnop, St. Mewins. All this he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed before the 21ſt of March, when we find him again at Exeter.
<q>Invitations (ſays he) are ſent to me from ſeveral places. I want more tongues, more bodies, more ſouls for the Lord Jeſus. Had I ten thouſand, he ſhould have them all<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters DCCCXXIV, XXV, and XXVI.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In April he was at London and Portſmouth. And in May went to Aſhby, to wait on Lady Huntingdon, who had been ill. In his way thither, he had a moſt comfortable interview with the Rev. Dr. Doddridge, Mr. Hervey <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. Harvey thus wrote of this interview to a friend;</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I have ſeen lately, that moſt excellent Miniſter of the ever-bleſſed Jeſus, Mr. Whitefield. I dined, ſupped, and ſpent the evening with him at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, in company with Dr. Doddridge, and two pious, ingenious Clergymen of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, both of them known to the learned world by their valuable writings. And ſurely, I never ſpent a more delightful evening, or ſaw one that ſeemed to make nearer approaches to the felicity of heaven. A Gentleman of great worth and rank in the town, invited us to his houſe, and gave us an elegant treat; but how mean was his proviſion, how coarſe his delicacies, compared with the fruit of my friend's lips; they dropped as the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, and were a well of life. Surely, people do not know that amiable and examplary man, or elſe, I cannot but think, inſtead of depreciating, they would applaud and love him. For my part, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beheld ſo fair a copy of our Lord, ſuch a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing image of the Saviour, ſuch exalted delight in God, ſuch enlarged benevolence to man, ſuch a ſteady faith in the divine promiſes, and ſuch a fervent zeal for the divine glory; and all this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt moroſeneſs of humour, or extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of behaviour; ſweetned with the moſt engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chearfulneſs of temper, and regulated by all the ſobriety of reaſon, and wiſdom of Scripture; in ſo much, that I cannot forbear applying the wiſe man's encomium of an illuſtrious woman, to this eminent Miniſter of the everlaſting Goſpel; "Many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:013298_0177_0F904EC3277C8928"/>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXXXII.</note>But at Aſhby, where it might have been leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, there was a riot made before Lady Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's houſe, while the Goſpel was preaching: and in the evening, ſome people in their return home narrowly eſcaped being murdered. The Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed, ſent a meſſage, in order to bring the offenders before him.
<q>So that I hope, (ſays Mr. Whitefield) it will be over-ruled for great good, and that the Goſpel, for the future, will have free courſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXXXV.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After he left Aſhby, he preached at Radcliff church, Nottingham and Sutten with great ſucceſs.
<q>At Nottingham, (ſays he) ſeveral came to me, enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What they ſhould do to be ſaved? I preached there four times. One evening, Lord S—, and ſeveral Gentlemen, were preſent, and behaved with great decency. Many thouſands attended. Yeſterday morning I breakfaſted with three diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters; and Mr. P—s, who told me, that Lady P— deſired he would preſs me to preach at the church. Yeſterday, in the afternoon, I preached at Sutton; and this morning <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter DCCCXXXVIII.</note> at Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</q>
After leaving that place, he went to Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Sheffield. He was at Leeds in the end of
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:013298_0178_0F904EC3EB9739B8"/>
May, and obſerves,
<q>Methinks, I am now got into another climate <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters DCCCXL, and XLIX.</note>, where there are many of God's people.</q>
From thence he went to Mancheſter, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſindale, and ſeveral other parts of Lancaſhire, Kendal, Whitehaven, Cockermouth, preaching generally twice a day, and arrived at Edinburgh, July 6. Having preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near a hundred times ſince he left London, and by a moderate computation, to above a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls.
<q>It is amazing (he writes) to ſee how people are prepared, in places where I never was before. What ſhall I render to the Lord?</q>
               </p>
               <p>At Edinburgh and Glaſgow, (in which places he ſpent the month of July, 1750) he was received, as uſual, in the moſt loving and tender manner, preaching generally twice a day to great multitudes, whoſe ſeriouſneſs, and earneſt deſire to hear him, made him exert himſelf rather beyond his ſtrength.
<q>By preaching always twice, (ſays he) and once thrice, and once four times in a day <note n="†" place="bottom">Letters DCCCLI, and LV.</note>, I am quite weakened; but I hope to recruit again. I am burning with a fever, and have a violent cold; but Chriſt's preſence makes me ſmile at pain, and the fire of his love burns up all fevers whatſoever.</q>
He left Edinburgh Auguſt 3, and ſoon found himſelf much better for riding. At Berwick, one of the miniſters ſent him an offer of his pulpit, and he was informed that many more round that town, were willing to do the ſame. At his return to London, he preached ſeveral times at Weſt-ſtreet Chapel. He had alſo the pleaſure of Mr. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey's company, who, at his deſire, came up to town, and lodged in his houſe. In the months of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and October, he made excurſions to Portſmouth, Chatham, Glouceſter, Birmingham, Everſham, Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſbury, and Nottingham;
<q>ranging about, (as he
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:013298_0179_0F904EC4ADA08EA8"/>
expreſſes it) to ſee who would believe the Goſpel report<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCLXVIII.</note>.</q>
And was particularly ſucceſsful at Chatham and Canterbury.</p>
               <p>He ſpent the winter in London, in his uſual buſy and laborious way, and with equal ſucceſs. He was confined, near a fortnight, to his room by a violent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and inflammation of the lungs; but before the 17th of December, he was able to preach again. And in the latter end of January 1751, he rode poſt to Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, being alarmed with the accounts of Lady Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingdon's dangerous illneſs, and the afflictions with which it had pleaſed God to viſit her family. He writes from Aſhby, January 29.
<q>Bleſſed be God, Lady Huntingdon is ſomewhat better. Entreat all our friends to pray for her. Her ſiſter-in-law, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Frances H—, lies dead in the houſe. She was a retired chriſtian, lived ſilently, and died ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, without a groan. May my exit be like hers. Almoſt all the family have been ſick in their turns.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having left London, March 5, He went again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Glouceſterſhire, and to Briſtol, and preached at Taunton and Wellington in his way to Plymouth. April 11. he was at Exeter, and writes thus to Mr. Hervey:
<q>Some good I truſt, is to be done this ſpring, to many ſouls. This weſtern circuit, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, has been bleſſed already. I have preached about forty times ſince I left London, and have been enabled ſeveral times to ride forty miles a day. I find this ſenſibly refreſhes me. I wiſh you could ſay ſo too. At Plymouth we had ſweet ſeaſons; and on Tueſday laſt I met with a young Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was awakened under my preaching ſeven years ago. He had been at Cambridge, and was ordained by the Biſhop of Exeter. He is followed much, and, I ſuppoſe, will ſoon
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:013298_0180_0F904EC5807BC398"/>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> From his firſt viſit to <hi>IRELAND,</hi> to his opening the New Tabernacle at <hi>LONDON,</hi> in the Year <hi>1753.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFTER a paſſage of five days from Wales, he arrived, May 24, 1751, at Dublin, where he was gladly received, and lodged at the houſe of Mr. L—, and preached every morning and evening as uſual in other places:
<q>Surely (ſays he) here are many converted ſouls, among whom are two or three ſtudents, and ſeveral ſoldiers. At firſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters DCCCXCI, DCCCXCII.</note> the greatneſs and hurry of the place ſurprized me; but thanks be to the Lord of the harveſt, here as well as elſewhere, the fields are white, ready unto har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. Congregations are large, and hear as for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</q>
And again:
<q>Athlone, June 10. For this week paſt, I have been preaching twice almoſt every day in ſome country towns. I find, through the many offences that have lately been given, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were brought to a low ebb. But the cry now is, 'Methodiſm is revived again.'</q>
                  <q>I took a journey from near Haverford Weſt to Ireland, where a yet greater work had been begun and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to a high degree, amidſt prodigious oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; numbers converted, not only from Popery, but to Jeſus Chriſt, at Athlone, Dublin, Limerick, Cork, and various other places<note n="†" place="bottom">M. S.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At Limerick he preached ſeven times to large and affected auditories, and twice at Cork (where the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts had lately been mobbed) to a great body of people, with all quietneſs. From thence he went to
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:013298_0182_0F904EC6E7351818"/>
Bandon and Kinſale, where a like bleſſing attended his preaching. At his return to Cork, the numbers and affections of his hearers increaſed. At Belfaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he was detained ſome days beyond his intention, by the peoples' importunity, and preached at Liſburn, Lurgun, the Maize, and Lambag, towns and places adjacent. So many attended, and the proſpect of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good was ſo promiſing, that he was ſorry he had not come to the north of Ireland ſooner. But he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay another viſit to Scotland, before he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for America, which he was intent upon doing before winter.</p>
               <p>He therefore came over in the beginning of July 1751, from Belfaſt to Irvine, where, at the deſire of the magiſtrates, he preached to a great congregation; and ſo proceeded to Glaſgow. From this place he writes, July 12.
<q>Though I preached near eighty times in Ireland, and God was pleaſed to bleſs his word, yet Scotland ſeems to be a new world to me. To ſee the people bring ſo many Bibles, turn to every paſſage when I am expounding, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, upon me to hear every word, is very encouraging. I feel an uncommon freedom here; and talking with the winter as well as with the ſummer ſaints, feeds and delights my heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may be proper, once for all, to take notice of ſome particulars relating to Mr. Whitefield's viſits to Scotland, which he continued till within a few years of his death.</p>
               <p>Though after the years 1741, and 1742, there was no ſuch extenſive new awakenings, Mr. Whitefield's coming was always refreſhing to ſerious perſons, and ſeemed to put new life into them: and alſo to be the means of increaſing their number. His preaching was ſtill eminently uſeful in various reſpects. In the firſt place, it had an excellent tendency to deſtroy the hurtful ſpirit of bigotry, and exceſſive zeal for ſmaller <note n="*" place="bottom">M. S.</note>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:013298_0183_0F904EC830D3C180"/>
matters; and to turn mens' attention to the great and ſubſtantial things of religion. Another effect was, that it drew ſeveral perſons to hear the goſpel, who ſeldom went to hear it from other Miniſters. Again, young people in general were much benefited by his miniſtry, and particularly young ſtudents, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards ſerious evangelical preachers. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his morning diſcourſes, which were moſtly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſincere but diſconſolate ſouls, were peculiarly fitted to direct and encourage all ſuch in the chriſtian life. And his addreſſes in the evening to the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous multitudes who then attended him, were of a very alarming kind. There was ſomething exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtriking in the ſolemnity of his evening congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the Orphan-houſe park at Edinburgh, and High-church-yard of Glaſgow; eſpecially towards the concluſion of his ſermons, (which were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very long, though they ſeemed ſhort to the hearers) when the whole multitude ſtood fix'd, and like one man hung upon his lips, with ſilent attention, and many under deep impreſſions of the great objects of religion, and the concerns of eternity. Theſe things will not ſoon be forgotten; and it is hoped, the many good effects, which by the divine bleſſing attended them, never will.</p>
               <p>His converſation was no leſs reviving than his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Many in Edinburgh and Glaſgow are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this, eſpecially at Glaſgow, when in company with his good friends, Mr. MacLaurin, Mr. Robert Scott, &amp;c. one might challenge the ſons of pleaſure with all their wit, good humour and gaiety to furniſh entertainment ſo agreeable. At the ſame time, every part of it was not more agreeable, than it was uſeful and edifying.</p>
               <p>His friends in Scotland, among whom were many of all ranks, from the higheſt to the loweſt, were very conſtant and ſteady in their great regard for him. And his oppoſers grew more and more mild. Some
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:013298_0184_0F904EC980792F70"/>
anonymous pamphlets were written againſt him at his firſt coming: But theſe ſoon died and were forgotten. Afterwards a number of ſtories were handed about to his diſadvantage; but upon enquiry, it was found either that matters were miſrepreſented or exaggerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or that there was no foundation for ſuch reports at all. In ſhort, when they were traced to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, they rather turned out to his honour. He uſed to ſmile at good Mr. MacLaurin's honeſt zeal, who, on ſuch occaſions, ſpared no pains to come at the truth, and when he had diſcovered it, was no leſs ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to communicate the diſcovery to others, for the vindication of Mr. Whitefield's character, in which he thought the credit of religion was concerned. The following inſtance is well remembered. One Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Wright alledged, that Mr. Whitefield had kept back money ſent by a gentlewoman to her ſon in America. This coming to Mr. MacLaurin's ears, he was reſtleſs till he procured a meeting betwixt Mr. Whitefield and his accuſer. They met; Mr. Wright did not retract what he had ſaid. Upon which a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was inſtantly wrote to the mother at London; and her anſwer being received, a confutation of the calumny was publiſhed in the Glaſgow Courant, in the following terms: October 31, 1748.
<q>A ſtory having been ſpread in this town of Mr. Whitefield's having received twenty pounds ſterling from a gentlewoman in London, to give her ſon in Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia: whereas, he had received only three guineas, which he had returned to the gentlewoman when he came back from Georgia, her ſon having been gone from thence before his arrival; a letter was wrote to London to clear up this affair, to which the gentlewoman has ſent this anſwer: 'Sir, this is to aſſure you, that I received of Mr. John Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens the three guineas, which was the full ſum that I gave you for my ſon. I hope it is only a falſe aſperſion on him; for I never heard that he ſhould
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:013298_0185_0F904ECA215AECD8"/>
ſay any ſuch thing, being three months in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I am, &amp;c. September 13, 1748.' There is likewiſe a receipt come down, dated September 3, to Mr. Stevens. Both the letter and receipt are to be ſeen in the hands of the publiſher.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, indeed, Mr. Whitefield's whole behaviour was ſo open to the eyes of the world; and his character, after it had ſtood many attacks from all quarters, came at laſt to be ſo thoroughly eſtabliſhed, that ſeveral of his oppoſers in Scotland ſeemed rather to acquire a certain degree of eſteem for him; at leaſt, they all thought proper to give over ſpeaking againſt him.</p>
               <p>When he was at Glaſgow, he always lodged with Mr. James Niven, Merchant, above the Croſs; till towards the end of his life, his aſthmatic diſorder made the town air diſagree with him. And then he went out in the evenings, and ſtayed with his good friend Mr. MacCulloch at Cambuſlang.</p>
               <p>A perſon of eminence, whom a ſincere eſteem of Mr. Whitefield made attentive to his reception and miniſtrations in Scotland, from firſt to laſt; writes thus to the compiler:</p>
               <p>Edinburgh, January 1772.
<q>I think more might be ſaid with great juſtice, concerning the effects of his miniſtry in Scotland, after the firſt two years; as there was always a remarkable revival followed each of his viſits; which many of the Miniſters teſtified from their particular knowledge, eſpecially by the number of new communicants. Mention might be made of the great number of Miniſters in Scotland, that employed him, and of the many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate letters he received from them, of which there were a good many printed both in the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Glaſgow Weekly Hiſtories, from ſome of the moſt eminent men in the church, who had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him to preach in their pulpits, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo to do, when opportunity offered; except in the Preſbytery of Edinburgh; and even there,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:013298_0186_0F904ECB66A4BEF8"/>
the Magiſtrates always allowed him a church to preach in, every time he came.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the month of July, 1751, Mr. Whitefield was glad to underſtand that Mr. Dinwiddie, brother-in-law to the Rev. Mr. MacCulloch of Cambuſlang, was made Governor of Virginia. In that province there had been a conſiderable awakening for ſome years paſt, eſpecially in Hanover county and the places adjacent. As the Miniſters of the eſtabliſhment did not favour the work, and the people had put themſelves under the care of the New York Synod, they met with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements from thoſe in power. However, Mr. Samuel Davies (afterwards Preſident of the College of New-Jerſey) being licenſed, was ſettled over a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; and the religious concern ſo increaſed, that one congregation was multiplied to ſeven. There was now an agreeable proſpect that theſe good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would have the ſame privileges ſecured to them, which diſſenting Proteſtants enjoy at home <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCI.</note>.</p>
               <p>Auguſt 6, he ſet out from Edinburgh for London, in order to embark a fourth time for America. He had thrown up much blood in Edinburgh; but the journey he was now upon had a good effect in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him from that illneſs: and as he went along, he was much refreſhed with the accounts he received of the happy fruits of his miniſtry at Kendal the year before. After a ſorrowful parting with his friends in England, which grew ſtill more diſtreſſing to him, he went aboard the Antelope, Captain MacLellan, bound for Georgia with Germans; and took along with him ſeveral children.</p>
               <p>He arrived at Savannah, October 27, and found the Orphan-houſe in a flouriſhing condition.
<q>Thanks be to God, (ſays he) all is well at Betheſda. A moſt excellent tract of land is granted to me very near the houſe, which in a few years, I hope, will make a ſufficient proviſion for it <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXII.</note>.</q>
From November 1751,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:013298_0187_0F904ECC24270CF8"/>
to the beginning of April 1752, he was partly at Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda, and partly in South Carolina, ſtill upon the ſtretch in his Maſter's work.
<q>I intend, (ſays he) by his aſſiſtance, now to begin; for as yet, alas! I have done nothing.</q>
                  <q>And again, O that I may begin to be in earneſt! It is a new year; God quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my tardy pace, and help me to do much work in a little time! this is my higheſt ambition <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters DCCCCX, DCCCCXI.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Being warned by what had happened to him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, he did not venture to ſtay the ſummer ſeaſon in America; but took his paſſage in the end of April for London. At his arrival, he perceived he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in a very good time; for Georgia was ſoon to be taken into the hands of Government, and put on the ſame footing with other colonies, which gave ground to hope that it would ſoon became a flouriſhing province. This was joyful news. He now thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was appearing for Georgia and Betheſda. He determined therefore to ſell his plantation, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all his ſtrength to the Orphan-houſe.</p>
               <p>About the middle of June, he planned a new rout.
<q>Next week, (ſays he) God willing, I ſhall go to Portſmouth, from thence to Bath, then to the weſt, then to Wales, and from thence, may be, to <note n="†" place="bottom">Letters DCCCCXVII.</note> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland.</q>
Accordingly we find his letters of this period, dated at Portſmouth, Briſtol, Cardiff, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verford-weſt. In returning to Briſtol, he attended an aſſociation, where were preſent about nine clergy, and near forty other labourers, of whom he writes <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXXV.</note>:
<q>I truſt all are born of God, and deſirous to promote his glory, and his people's good. All was harmony and love.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Auguſt 17. he was in London. His letter of this date to his acquaintance Dr. F. the celebrated electrical philoſopher, deſerves particular notice.
<q>I find you grow more and more famous in the learned world.

As you have made a pretty conſiderable progreſs in the myſteries of electricity, I would now humbly recommend to your diligent unprejudiced purſuit and ſtudy, the myſtery of the new birth. It is a moſt important, intereſting ſtudy, and when maſtered, will richly anſwer and repay you for all your pains. One at whoſe bar we are ſhortly to appear, hath ſolemnly declared, that without it, we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. You will excuſe this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

               </p>
               <p>From London he took another tour to Edinburgh, where he arrived in the beginning of September 1752. In his way he preached twice at Lutterworth (the famous John Wickliff's pariſh) and at Leiceſter; and in both places was informed afterwards that good was done. At Newcaſtle, he was as it were arreſted to ſtay, and preached four times to great congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>At Edinburgh and Glaſgow (in which places he continued till the 10th of October) he was employed as uſual. He writes from Glaſgow, September 29.
<q>At Edinburgh great multitudes, among whom were abundance of the better ſort, attended twice every day. Many young Miniſters and ſtudents have given cloſe attendance, and I hear of ſeveral perſons that have been brought under deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions. I intend to ſend you copies of two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from a Highland ſchoolmaſter, who is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God to do much good among the poor High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land children <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXXXI.</note>.</q>
                  <q>I have brave news ſent me from Leiceſter and Newcaſtle, and have ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to Yorkſhire and Lancaſhire. What a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is that the year goes round ſo ſoon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1752, the General Aſſembly of the Church of Scotland, upon a diviſion of the houſe, by a few votes depoſed Mr. Gilleſpie; which afterwards gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:013298_0189_0F904ECF38FE9380"/>
to the ſociety called the Preſbytery of Relief. Mr. Whitefield being informed of the circumſtances of that affair, writes thus <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXIV.</note>:
<q>I wiſh Mr. Gilleſpie joy. The Pope I find has turned Preſbyterian— The Lord reigns, that is enough for us.</q>
And again <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXX.</note>:
<q>Now will Mr. Gilleſpie do more good in a week, than before, in a year. How blind is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan! What does he get by caſting out Chriſt's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? I expect that ſome great good will come out of theſe confuſions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In his way back to London, he preached at Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Alnwick, Morpeth, Newcaſtle. From Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field he writes, November 1.
<q>Since I left New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, I have ſcarce known ſometimes, whether I have been in heaven or on earth. At Leeds, Burſtall, Howarth, Halifax, &amp;c. thouſands and thouſands have flocked twice or thrice a-day to hear the word of life. I am now come from Bolton, Mancheſter, Stockport and Chinly. Yeſterday I preached in a church. Four ordained Miniſters, friends to the work of God, have been with me.

               <p>In May he made another excurſion to Narboth, Pembroke, Haverford-weſt, &amp;c. where congregations were large, and a gracious melting ſeemed to be among the people. Within little more than a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night he rode three hundred and fifty miles, and preached above twenty times <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCLXXVI.</note>.</p>
               <p>Sunday, June 10, 1753. He opened his new Tabernacle, preaching in the morning from 1 Kings viii. 11, and in the evening from 1 Chron. xxix. 9.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MR. Whitefield having preached in London at his Tabernacle for a few days with his uſual fervour, and ſucceſs, and to large congregations, in the end of the month of June, ſet out towards Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. In his way he had deſirable meetings at Oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Northampton. He preached alſo at Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and Nottingham, where a great multitude came to hear, and at Sheffield. In his way to Leeds, next morning, he preached at Rotheram and Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. At the former place he had been diſturbed twice or thrice, and was almoſt determined to preach there no more. But he <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCLXXXIV.</note> found this would have been a raſh determination; for ſome who had been bitter perſecutors, now received him gladly into their houſe, and owned, that God had made him inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in their converſion. At Leeds he had great ſucceſs. At York alſo he preached four times. Twice they were diſturbed, and twice had very agreeable ſeaſons. At Newcaſtle he preached ſeven times, and once at Sunderland to great multitudes who were deeply impreſſed. At five in the morning the great room was filled, and on the Lords-day, the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without was exceeding large. In ſhort, the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all around was ſo promiſing, that he almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his engagement to go to Scotland, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to come back as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:013298_0193_0F904ED3C594ECB0"/>He proceeded however, according to his promiſe, and having ſpent ſome days at Edinburgh and Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow in his uſual laborious and earneſt manner, and with uſual acceptance, he returned to England, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 7.</p>
               <p>All this time he preached twice or thrice a day, and once five times. This he found rather too much for his ſtrength. But he ſtill went on, often expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his deſires and hopes ſoon to ſee his Divine Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in glory.</p>
               <p>After he had been in Glaſgow, the following para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph appeared in the Newcaſtle Journal, Auguſt 11, 1753.
<q>By a Letter from Edinburgh we are informed, that on the ſecond inſtant Mr. Whitefield, the Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant, being at Glaſgow, and preaching to a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous audience near the Play-houſe lately built, he inflamed the mob ſo much againſt it, that they ran directly from before him, and pulled it down to the ground. Several of the rioters are ſince taken up, and committed to goal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It would not have been worth while to tranſcribe this, were it not another ſpecimen of the unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able liberties taken by ſome of the oppoſers of Mr. Whitefield, in telling their ſtories concerning him. The fact was this. Mr. Whitefield being informed, that the Players had lately come to Glaſgow, and had met with ſome encouragement, took occaſion in his ſermons to preach againſt Play-houſes, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their pernicious influence on religion and mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, eſpecially in a populous, commercial city, and the ſeat of a Univerſity. But there was no riot. It was the proprietor of the Play-houſe (at that time a ſlight temporary booth ſupported by the old walls of the Biſhop's Caſtle) who ordered his workmen to take it down.</p>
               <p>On his return to England, he went from Newcaſtle to Stockton, Oſmotherly, York and Leeds. He aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſacrament at Howard, where they had a
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:013298_0194_0F904ED4703E6EF0"/>
extraordinary ſeaſon, and a vaſt many communicants. He went as far as Bolton, Mancheſter and Stockport. The more he preached, the more eager the people ſeemed to be. The laſt part of his circuit was to Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire, Rotheram, Sheffield Nottingham and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton. He returned to London in the latter end of September, having travelled about twelve hundred miles, and preached a hundred and eighty times to many thouſands <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXCII.</note>.</p>
               <p>His ſtay in London was but ſhort, in the month of October he took another tour to Staffordſhire. A new ſcene of uſefulneſs ſeemed to open to him, while he he preached at Oulney, at Oxen near Harborough, Boſworth, Kettering and Bedford; at all which places preached in one week. At Birmingham alſo, and ſeveral adjacent places, the people flocked to hear the goſpel. At a place near Dudley called Guarnall he was informed of a whole company that were awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reading his ſermons <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXCVI.</note>. He met with others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened years ago, and heard of a notorious perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor and drunkard who had been powerfully ſtruck. He loved to break up new ground, as he expreſſes it; and had the pleaſure to find ſometimes that his way was prepared by the bleſſing which God had given to his writings, particularly at Alperam in Cheſhire, and at Liverpool, where a perſon that had received benefit by reading his ſermons, met him at landing, and took him to his houſe. All was quiet here, and at Cheſter, where he preached four times and had ſeveral of the clergy in his congregations. But at Wrexham and Nantwich (where a Methodiſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe had lately been pulled down) he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by the mob, and forced to remove his congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to a place a little out of town <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXCVII.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thus he went on, returning at times for a few days to London. And November 16, writes from Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:013298_0195_0F904ED56E2C9A38"/>
                  <q>After Lord's day I am bound for Briſtol and Plymouth, and hope to get into my winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſometime before Chriſtmas. Glad ſhould I be to travel for Jeſus all the year round. It is more to me than my neceſſary food<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter DCCCCXCIX.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>On Sunday, November, 25. he opened the new Tabernacle at Briſtol, which he obſerves was large, but not half large enough; for if the place could contain them, near as many would attend as in London.</q>
He alſo preached twice, in his brother's great houſe to the quality. Though it was ſo late in the year, he ſet out for Somerſetſhire, and preached ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times in the open air, at ſeven o'clock at night.
<q>My hands and body (ſays he) were pierced with cold; but what are outward things, when the ſoul within is warmed with the love of God? The ſtars ſhone exceeding bright; by an eye of faith, I ſaw Him who calleth them all by their names. My ſoul was filled with a holy ambition, and I longed to be one of thoſe who ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for ever and ever <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MIV, MV.</note>.</q>
At this time his friend and fellow-labourer, the Rev. Mr. John Weſley had by his extraordinary labours brought his life into great danger, of which Mr. Whitefield thus writes, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter MV.</note> Briſtol, December 3, 1753.
<q>I am now haſtening to London to pay my laſt reſpects to my dying friend. The Phyſicians think his diſeaſe is a galloping conſumption. I pity the church, I pity myſelf, but not him. Poor Mr. Charles will now have double work. But we can do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening us!</q>
His let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to both the brothers on this occaſion are very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and ſympathizing <note n="§" place="bottom">Letters MVI, VII, and VIII.</note>. And he ſoon had the pleaſure of ſeeing Mr. Weſley recover. Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 26. he had a viſit from Meſſieurs Tennent and Davies from America, who came over to procure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:013298_0196_0F904ED5F0E31748"/>
for the College of New-Jerſey. As they were commiſſioned to apply for a general collection in Scotland, he gave them recommendatory letters, and heartily endeavoured to promote their deſign. He ſtayed in London all the winter of 1753, <note n="*" place="bottom">His letters written about the beginning of the new year, ſhew the habitual frame of his mind.
<q>Near forty years old, and ſuch a dwarf! The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come already, and ſo little done in the ſummer.</q>
Again,
<q>I heartily wiſh your Lordſhip, not the compliments but the bleſſings of the ſeaſon; even all thoſe bleſſings that have been purchaſed for a loſt world, by the death and ſufferings of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate GOD.</q>
Letters MXV, MXVI.</note> long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a ſpring campaign (as he expreſſes it) that he might begin to do ſomething for his divine Maſter.</p>
               <p>March 7, 1754, having got twenty-two poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute children under his care, he embarked with them for America, by way of Liſbon, (at which port the ſhip was obliged to touch) where he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the 20th of March to the 13th of April.</p>
               <p>From Liſbon he writes <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MXXIX.</note>:
<q>The air agrees with my poor conſtitution extremely, and through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance, I hope what I ſee will alſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my better part, and help to qualify me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for preaching the everlaſting goſpel: again, a Gentleman hath moſt gladly received me into his houſe, and behaves like a friend indeed. To day I dine with the Conſul. Every day I have ſeen or heard ſomething, that hath had a native tendency to make me thankful for the glorious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letters MXXX, MXXXII.</note>.</q>
After a ſight of ſome Popiſh proceſſions, which were new and very ſtriking to him, he ſays,
<q>I returned to my lodgings not a little affected, to ſee ſo many thouſands led away from the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the goſpel, by ſuch a mixture of human arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and blind ſuperſtition, of which, indeed, I
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:013298_0197_0F904ED703114358"/>
could have formed no idea, had I not been an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter MXXXV.</note>.</q>
He was ſtill more ſhocked at the proceſſion of St. Francis; the following deſcription of which he wrote to his friend <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MXXXVI.</note>, with expreſſions of praiſe and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to Providence for the great wonder of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
<q>An intelligent Proteſtant, who ſtood near me, was ſo good as to be my interpreter of the dumb ſhew as it paſſed along.—I ſay, dumb ſhew; for you muſt know, it was chiefly made up of waxen or wooden images, carried on mens' ſhoulders through the ſtreets, intending to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the life and death of St. Francis, the founder of one of their religious orders. They were brought out from the Franciſcan convent, and were preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three perſons in ſcarlet habits, with baſkets in their hands, in which they received the alms of the ſpectators, for the benefit of the poor priſoners. After theſe, came two little boys in party-coloured cloaths, with wings fixed on their ſhoulders, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of little angels.—Then appeared the figure of St. Francis, very gay and beau-like, as he uſed to be before his converſion. In the next he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced under conviction, and conſequently ſtript of his finery. Soon after this, was exhibited an image of our bleſſed LORD himſelf, in a purple gown, with long black hair, with St. Francis lying before him, to receive his immediate orders. Then came the Virgin Mother, (<hi>horeſco referens</hi>) with CHRIST her ſon at her left hand, and St. Francis making his obeiſance to both.—Here, if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aright, he made his firſt appearance in his fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar's habit, with his hair cut ſhort, but not as yet ſhaved in the crown of his head. After a little ſpace followed a mitre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Cardinal gaudily attired, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him lay St. Francis almoſt proſtrate, in order to be confirmed in his office. Soon after this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he appears quite metamorphoſed into a monk, his
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:013298_0198_0F904ED768F38D10"/>
crown ſhorn, his habit black, and his loins girt with a knotted cord.—Here he prays to our Saviour hanging on a croſs, that the marks of the wounds in his hands, feet, and ſide, might be impreſſed on the ſame parts of his body. The prayer is granted; blood comes from the hands, feet, and ſide; and the ſaint, with great devotion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impreſſion. This was repreſented by red waxen ſtrings, reaching from thoſe parts of the image to the correſponding parts of St. Francis's body. Upon this he begins to do wonders; and therefore, in a little while, he is carried along, as holding up a houſe which was juſt falling. This miracle, they ſay, was performed, (if my informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be true) at Madrid, but the particulars of its hiſtory I have forgotten. At length the father dies, and is brought forth lying in his grave. But lo! the briars and nettles under which be lay, are turned unto fine and fragrant flowers. After this he is borne along upon a bier covered with a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pall, and four friars lamenting over him.—He then appears for the laſt time, but with an increaſe of power; for he was repreſented as drawing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented people out of purgatory with his knotted cord, which, as you may well imagine, the poor ſouls catched at, and took hold of very eagerly. At length came a gorgeous friar under a ſplendid ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy, bearing in his hand a piece of the holy croſs. After him followed two more little winged boys, and then a long train of fat and well favoured Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans, with their <hi>calceis feneſtratis,</hi> as Eraſmus calls them; and ſo the proceſſion ended. . . . . About ten o'clock at night, a train of near two hundred penitents paſſed along, and ſeveral companies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after with their reſpective preaching friars at their heads, bearing crucifixes. The penitents themſelves were cloathed and covered all over with
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:013298_0199_0F904ED82A37D0C8"/>
white linen veſtments, only holes were made for their eyes to peep out at. All were bare-footed, and all had long heavy chains faſtened to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which, when dragged along the ſtreet, made a diſmal rattling: but though alike in dreſs, yet in other reſpects there was great variety amongſt them. For ſome carried great ſtones on their backs, and others dead mens bones and ſkulls in their hands. Some bore large and ſeemingly very heavy croſſes upon their ſhoulders, whilſt others had their arms extended quite wide, or carried a bow full of ſwords with the points downwards. Moſt of them whipped and laſhed themſelves, ſome with cords, and others with flat bits of iron. It being a moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine night, I could ſee them quite well; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome of them ſtruck ſo hard, that I perceived their backs, (left bare on purpoſe to be ſlaſhed) were quite red, and ſwollen very much by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and repetition of the blows. The whole ſcene was horrible.</q>
He adds,
<q>O for an obediential ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to the ever-bleſſed God, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated deliverances.</q>
He further obſerves,
<q>The preachers here have alſo taught me ſomething; their action is graceful, <hi>Vividi oculi, vividae manus, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia vivida.</hi> Surely our Engliſh preachers would do well, to be a little more fervent in their addreſs. They have truth on their ſide; why ſhould ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and falſhood run away with all that is pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and affecting <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter MXXXVII.</note>?</q>
His two laſt letters from Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon contain the following lively deſcription of the ſuperſtitious farces which he ſaw acted on Holy Thurſday as they call it, and Good Friday:
<q>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MXL.</note> I have now ſeen the ſolemnities of an Holy Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which is a very high day in this metropolis, and particularly remarkable for the grand illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the churches, and the King's waſhing
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:013298_0200_0F904DF7EB17F3B0"/>
twelve poor mens' feet. Go which way you would, nothing was to be ſeen but illuminations within, and hurry without.—For all perſons, crowned heads themſelves not excepted, are obliged on this day to viſit ſeven churches or altars, in imitation, as is ſuppoſed, of our LORD's being hurried from one tribunal to another, before he was condemned to be hung upon the croſs.</q>
The following is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Good Friday's ſuperſtitious and idolatrous farce:
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter MXLI.</note>Before all uſed to be noiſe and hurry;— now, all was huſhed and ſhut up in the moſt awful and profound ſilence. No clock or bell had been heard ſince yeſterday noon. About two in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we got to the place, where (I had heard ſome days ago) an extraordinary ſcene was to be exhibited: 'The crucifixion of the Son of GOD, repreſented partly by dumb images, and partly by living perſons, in a large church belonging to the convent of <hi>St. De Beate.</hi>' Several thouſands crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it.—Through the kind interpoſition and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a Proteſtant or two, I was not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the church, but was very commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſituated to view the whole performance. We had not waited long before the curtain was drawn up. Immediately, upon a high ſcaffold, hung in the front with black baize, and behind with ſilk purple damaſk laced with gold, was exhibited to our view an image of the LORD JESUS at full length, crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thorns, and nailed on a croſs between two figures of like dimenſions, repreſenting the two thieves. At a little diſtance on the right hand, was placed an image of the Virgin Mary, in plain long ruffles, and a kind of widow-weeds. Her veil was purple ſilk, and ſhe had a wire glory round her head.—At the foot of the croſs lay, in a mournful penſive poſture, a living man, dreſſed in woman's cloaths, who perſonated Mary Magdalen; and not
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:013298_0201_0F904DFB8E914F20"/>
far off ſtood a young man, in imitation of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved diſciple.—He was dreſſed in a looſe green ſilk veſture, and bob-wig.— His eyes were fixed on the croſs, and his two hands a little extended. On each ſide, near the front of the ſtage, ſtood two centinels in buff, with formidable caps and long beards; and directly in the front ſtood another yet more formidable, with a large target in his hand. We may ſuppoſe him to be the Roman centurion. To complete the ſcene, from behind the purple hangings came out about twenty little purple veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed winged boys, two by two, each bearing a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wax taper in his hand, and a crimſon and gold cap on his head.—At their entrance upon the ſtage, they gently bowed their heads to the ſpectators, then kneeled and made obeiſance, firſt to the image on the croſs, and then to that of the Virgin Mary. When riſen, they bowed to each other, and then took their reſpective places over-againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on ſteps aſſigned for them at the front of the ſtage. Oppoſite to this, at a few yards diſtance, ſtood a black friar in a pulpit hung in mourning. For a while he pauſed, and then, breaking ſilence, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually lifted up his voice 'till it was extended to a pretty high pitch, though I think ſcarce high enough for ſo large an auditory. After he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his diſcourſe about a quarter of an hour, a confuſed noiſe was heard near the front great door; upon turning my head, I ſaw four long-bearded men, two of which carried a ladder on their ſhoulders, and after them followed two more with large gilt diſhes in their hands, full of linen, ſpices, &amp;c. Theſe (as I imagined) were the repreſentatives of Nicodemus and Joſeph of Arimathea. On a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal given from the pulpit, they advanced towards the ſteps of the ſcaffold. But upon their very firſt attempting to mount it, at the watchful centurion's nod, the obſervant ſoldiers made a paſs at them,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:013298_0202_0F904DFBAC2452D0"/>
and preſented the points of their javelins directly to their breaſts. They are repulſed. Upon this a letter from Pilate is produced. The centurion reads it, ſhakes his head, and with looks that beſpoke a forced compliance, beckons to the centinels to withdraw their arms. Leave being thus obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they aſcend; and having paid their homage, by kneeling firſt to the image on the croſs, and then to the Virgin Mary, they retired to the back of the ſtage. Still the preacher continued declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or rather, (as was ſaid) explaining the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene. Magdalen perſiſts in wringing her hands, and variouſly expreſſing her perſonated ſorrow; whilſt John (ſeemingly regardleſs of all beſides) ſtood gazing on the crucified figure. By this time it was near three o'clock, and therefore proper for the ſcene to cloſe. The ladders are aſcended, the ſuperſcription and crown of thorns taken off, long white rollers put round the arms of the image, and and then the nails knocked out which faſtened the hands and feet. Here Mary Magdalen looks moſt languiſhing, and John, if poſſible, ſtands more thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtruck than before.—The orator lifts up his voice, and almoſt all the hearers expreſſed concern by weeping, beating their breaſts, and ſmiting their cheeks.—At length the body is gently let down. Magdalen eyes it, and, gradually riſing, receives the feet into her wide ſpread handkerchief; whilſt John (who hitherto ſtood motionleſs like a ſtatue) as the body came near the ground, with an eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that beſpoke the intenſe affection of a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing friend, runs towards the croſs, ſeizes the upper part of it into his claſping arms, and, with his diſguiſed fellow mourner, helps to bear it away. Great preparations were made for its interment. It was wrapped in linen and ſpices, &amp;c. and being laid upon a bier richly hung, was afterwards car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried round the church-yard in grand proceſſion,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:013298_0203_0F904DFD4F278FF8"/>
and in about a quarter of an hour the corpſe was brought in, and depoſited with great ceremony in an open ſepulchre, prepared for the purpoſe.</q>
Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all which he ſays,
<q>Surely, thought I, whilſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on ſuch a ſcene of mock devotion, if ever, now is the dear LORD JESUS crucified afreſh; and I could then, and even now, think of no other plea for the poor beguiled devotees, than that which ſuffering innocence put up himſelf for his enemies, when actually hanging upon the croſs, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After a paſſage of ſix weeks from Liſbon, he arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Beauford in South-Carolina, May 27. with his Orphan charge, all quite well. Having ſettled them in his family in Georgia, which now conſiſted of above a hundred, and ſpent ſome time in Carolina, he took a journey to the northward.
<q>At Charleſtown (ſays he) and other parts of Carolina my poor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have met with the uſual acceptance, and I have reaſon to hope a Clergyman hath been brought under very ſerious impreſſions. My health is wonderfully preſerved.

He arrived at New-York by water July 27, and preached backwards and forwards from New-York to Philadelphia, and White Creek, till the middle of September.
<q>Every where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, a divine power accompanied the word, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices were removed, and a more effectual door opened than ever, for preaching the Goſpel<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MLX.</note>.</q>

The latter end of September, he had once more the pleaſure of ſeeing his good old friend Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Belchier at Elizabeth Town (New-Jerſey.) And it being the New-Jerſey commencement, the Preſident and the Truſtees preſented Mr. Whitefield with the degree of A. M. The meeting of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod ſucceeded, before whom he preached ſeveral times, and had much ſatisfaction in their company.
<q>To-morrow, (ſays he) October 1, God willing, I ſhall ſet out with the worthy Preſident (Mr. Burr) for New-England, and expect to return back to the Orphan-houſe, through Virginia. This will be about a two thouſand miles circuit; but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's ſtrength will be more than ſufficient.</q>
He had alſo ſome thoughts of going to the Weſt Indies, had it been practicable, before his return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter MLXI.</note>.</p>
               <p>He arrived with Preſident Burr at Boſton, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 9, and preached there a week with great accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<q>At Rhode-Iſland and Boſton (ſays he) ſouls fly to the Goſpel, like doves to the windows. Oppoſition ſeems to fall daily.</q>
When he was at Boſton, he heard to his great joy that a Governor was at length nominated for Georgia, and that his friend Mr. Haberſham was made ſecretary; to whom he writes,
<q>May the King of kings enable you to diſcharge your truſt, as becomes a good patriot, ſubject, and chriſtian<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters MLXII, MLXIV.</note>!</q>
At this time, he went as far north as Portſmouth (New Hampſhire) preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always twice, and ſometimes thrice a day; his reception at Boſton was more favourable than that fourteen years before; and in general his labours ſeemed to be attended with as great a bleſſing as ever<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter MLXVIII.</note>. He took leave of the Boſton people at four in the morning, November 7, and went to Rhode-Iſland;

from thence through Maryland<note n="§" place="bottom">

Many came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fifty miles to hear him; and a ſpirit of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſolation ſeemed to run through all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Three churches were opened to him. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſubſided; ſome of the rich and great began to think favourably of his miniſtrations; and ſeveral of the lower claſs came to him, and acknowledged what God had done for them by his preaching, when there before<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters MLXXI, MLXXIV.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the month of February 1755, he got back to Charleſtown, and from thence went to Savannah; continuing in theſe places till the latter end of March, when he embarked for England. And on the 8th of May, arrived at New-Haven in Suſſex<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MLXXVII.</note>.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he took notice of, was the ſucceſs of the Goſpel in his native country:
<q>Glory be to the great head of the Church! the word hath ſtill free courſe. The poor deſpiſed Methodiſts are as lively as ever; and in ſeveral churches, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is now preached with power. Many in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford are awakened to the knowledge of the truth, and I have heard almoſt every week of ſome freſh Miniſter or another, that ſeems determined to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letters MLXXXI, MLXXXII. In the M. S. he puts down the names of Jones, Romaine, Madan: of whom it appears he intended to have written more particularly.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This conſideration ſeems to have reanimated him. He went on preaching earneſtly at London, Briſtol, Bath, and in Glouceſterſhire, till the month of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:013298_0206_0F904E003409A7C0"/>
Then he went to Norwich, and opened a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle there.
<q>At this laſt place (ſays he) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding offences have come, there has been a glorious work begun, and is now carrying on, (Auguſt 30, 1755.)

               </p>
               <p>After this he went his northern circuit, and found reaſon to bleſs God for giving countenance to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours all the way; particularly, at Northampton, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpool, Bolton, Mancheſter, Leeds, Bradford, and York<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>At York, I hope, a fine Gentleman was touched; and ſeveral I find were awakened there, and at Newcaſtle, at my laſt viſit.</q>
Letter MCII.</note>. But when he had been ſome days at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, he found it too late to go to Ireland, (as he once propoſed) or even to Scotland: He returned therefore to London, October 30, after preaching twice and thrice a day for two months, to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. At this time, he ſays,
<q>Next to Jeſus, my King and country were upon my heart. I hope, I ſhall always think it my bounden-duty, next to inviting ſinners to the bleſſed Jeſus, to exhort my hearers to exert themſelves againſt the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of popiſh tyranny, and arbitrary power<note n="‡" place="bottom">This refers to the encroachments made by the French, upon the Britiſh colonies in America; and their threatening Great Britain with an invaſion; which occaſioned a declaration of war againſt France, next year.</note>.

                  </q>
About the end of November, he preached in pain, occaſioned by a ſore throat, which was like
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:013298_0207_0F904E00F89DCA28"/>
to have terminated in an inflammatory quincey. This obliged him much againſt his will, to be ſilent a few days. As ſoon as the danger ſeemed to be over, he fell to work again<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <q>One Phyſician preſcribed a perpetual bliſter; but I have found perpetual preaching to be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remedy. When this grand catholican fails, it is over with me.</q>
Letter MCXIV.</note>. He was now applied to by many ſerious perſons, to preach twice a week at Long-acre Chapel, near the play-houſes. Being informed that the place was licenſed, he complied, and preached there for the firſt time, on December 23, 1755; but met with great difficulties. The Biſhop of B— ſent him a prohibition. There was alſo a number of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, drummers, and many of the lower ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hired to diſturb him, by making a noiſe in the neighbouring houſe, or yard, of one Mr. C—; and this not once or twice, but every time he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that Chapel; being hired by ſubſcription, and provided with a copper furnace, bells, drums, clappers, &amp;c. they made it their buſineſs to raiſe the loudeſt din they poſſible could, from the moment he began preaching to the end of his ſermon. By which, alſo, mobbers were encouraged to come and riot at the chapel-door, during the time of divine ſervice, and then inſult and abuſe him, and the congregation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was over. The Chapel windows, while he was preaching, were repeatedly broken by large ſtones, which ſadly wounded ſome of the hearers. Upon this occaſion, Mr. Whitefield wrote ſeveral ſpirited letters to the Biſhop of B—, acknowledging, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Lordſhip's candor, and thanking him for his favourable opinion and good wiſhes; (for the Biſhop had wrote an anſwer to his firſt letter) but, at the ſame time, with great ſtrength of reaſon, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſenſe of Britiſh liberty, defending his own conduct, and remonſtrating againſt riotous proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

of his adverſaries.
<q>Laſt Tueſday night, (ſays he) all was huſhed. And in order to throw off all popular odium, I gave it as my opinion that it was owing to your Lordſhip's kind interpoſition. One Mr. C—, and one Mr. —, I am informed, are greatly concerned. I know them not; and I pray the Lord of all lords never to lay this ill and unmerited treatment to their charge. If no more noiſe is made on their part, I aſſure your Lordſhip, no further reſentment ſhall be made on mine. But, if they perſiſt, I have the authority of the Apoſtle on a like occaſion, to appeal unto Caeſar. And thanks be to God, we have a Caeſar to appeal to, whoſe laws will not ſuffer any of his loyal ſubjects to be uſed in ſuch an inhuman manner. I have only one favour to beg of your Lordſhip, that you would ſend (as they are your Lordſhip's pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners) to the above Gentlemen, and deſire them, henceforward, to deſiſt from ſuch unchriſtian, (and eſpecially, at this critical juncture) ſuch riotous and and dangerous proceedings.

This being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, his life was threatened. A man came up to him, in the pulpit at the Tabernacle<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter MCXXIX.</note>, and three anonymous letters were ſent him, denouncing, a certain, ſudden, and unavoidable ſtroke, unleſs he deſiſted from preaching, and purſuing the offenders. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that others were concerned as well as himſelf, and that it was an affair that had reference to the welfare of civil government, he ſent a copy of one of the letters to the Honourable Hume C—ll, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the favour of his advice; and was adviſed by all means, to put all concerned into the court of King's Bench<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters MCXXVII, MCXXIX.</note>. The Earl of Holderneſs, one of the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of ſtate) to whom he was introduced on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, received him very courteouſly, and ſeemed to have no objection againſt iſſuing a reward for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the letter-writer. "I find," ſays Mr. Whitefield, in his letter to Lady II—n, May 2, 1756,
<q>that all things happen for the furtherance of the Goſpel. I ſuppoſe, your Ladyſhip has ſeen his Majeſty's promiſe of pardon, to any that will diſcover the letter-writer; and this brings the further news of my having taken a piece of ground, very commodious to build on, not far from the Foundling Hoſpital. I have opened the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and through God's bleſſing, it hath already amounted to near ſix hundred pounds. I hope, in a few months to have what hath been long wanted, a place for the Goſpel, at the other end of the town. This evening, God willing, I venture once more to preach at Long-acre.</q>

               <p>After this he ſet out on one of his wonted tours, and having ſpent three weeks in preaching, with uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſucceſs, at Briſtol, and in Gloucerſhire, at Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Frome, Warminſter, and at Portſmouth <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter MCXXXIX.</note>, he returned to London in the beginning of June.</p>
               <p>July 27. he writes,
<q>The Goſpel flouriſhes in London. I am juſt returned from preaching it at Sheerneſs, Chatham, and in the Camp.</q>
Next day he ſet off for Scotland<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MCXLV.</note>. How he employed his time in his way thither, appears from the following letter.
<q>Sunderland, Auguſt 14, 1756. How ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth my precious time fly away! It is now a fortnight ſince I came to Leeds, in and about which, I preached eight days, thrice almoſt every day, to thronged and affected auditories. On Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt at Bradford, in the morning, the auditory conſiſted of about ten thouſand; at noon, and in the evening at Burſtall, to near double the number. Though hoarſe, I was helped to ſpeak ſo, that all heard. Next morning, I took a ſorrowful leave of Leeds, preached at Doncaſter at noon, and at York the ſame night; on Wedneſday at Wawſtall, about fifty miles off; on Thurſday, twice at Yarm, and laſt night, and this morning here.</q>
All the way he heard of a great concern, ſince he was in theſe parts laſt year.</p>

               <p>In ſpring 1757, he ſet out again on his northern circuit, and came to Edinburgh in the month of May, when the General Aſſembly of the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land held their annual meeting. He was much pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:013298_0213_0F8FFA700C1CAD70"/>
with this circumſtance. Many Miniſters attended his ſermons, perhaps a hundred at a time. Thereby prejudices were removed, and many of them ſeemed to be deeply affected. About thirty of them, as a token of reſpect, invited him to a public entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The King's Commiſſioner alſo invited him to his table.</p>
               <p>Some of the Scotch clergy, who were prejudiced againſt Mr. Whitefield, took upon them to ſignify to the Commiſſioner, (Lord Cathcart) by ſome of their friends, that it would be better not to invite Mr. Whitefield to his table; and that it would give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. This overture his Grace received with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The Earl of L— alſo, who was King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner before Lord Cathcart, ſhewed particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Mr. Whitefield: And from the time of his firſt coming to Scotland, ſhewed a great and conſtant regard for him.</p>

               <p>From Edinburgh he went to Glaſgow, where, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preached twice by the way, he arrived june 8th, and continued till the 14th, preaching, as uſual, in the High church-yard, to great multitudes, morning and evening; beſides on the Lord's-day, both fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon and afternoon, in one of the churches of the city. The poor in Glaſgow being at this time in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mournful circumſtances, notwithſtanding the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſources of ſupply, he (with the countenance of the magiſtrates) made a collection for them, at his ſermon on Monday evening, which amounted to near ſixty pounds. Next day he preached at Paiſley; and from thence ſet out for Ireland.</p>
               <p>His firſt reception was promiſing as formerly. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations at Dublin were very large, and much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.

One of the Biſhops told a Nobleman, (who repeated it to Mr. Whitefield) that he was glad he was come to rouſe the people. All ſorts attended, and all ſorts ſeemed to be ſtruck with a religious concern<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters MCLXVIII, LXIX.</note>. But on Sunday afternoon, July 3. after preaching in Oxmantown-green, (a place frequented by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Liberty boys, as they call them, who often fight there) he narrowly eſcaped with his life. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war time, he took occaſion to exhort his hearers, (as was his uſual practice) not only to fear God, but to honour the King; and prayed for ſucceſs to the King of Pruſſia. In the time of ſermon and prayer, a few ſtones were thrown at him, which did no hurt. But when he had done, and thought to return home, the way he came, by the barracks, to his great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize acceſs was denied; and he was obliged to go near half a mile, from one end of the Green to the other, through hundreds of Papiſts, &amp;c. who finding him unattended, (for a ſoldier, and four preachers who came with him, had fled) threw vollies of ſtones upon him from all quarters, and made him reel backwards and forwards, till he was almoſt breathleſs, and all over a gore of blood.
<q>I received many blows and wounds; one was particularly large, and near my temples. I thought of Stephen, and was in hopes, like him, to go off in this bloody triumph, to the immediate preſence of my Maſter<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MCLXX.</note>.</q>
At laſt, with great difficulty, he ſtaggered to the door of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's houſe lying next to the Green, which was kindly opened to him. For a while he continued ſpeechleſs and panting for breath; but his weeping friends having given him ſome cordials, and waſhed his wounds, a coach was procured, in which, amidſt the oaths, imprecations and threatnings of the Popiſh rabble, he got ſafe home; and joined in a hymn of thankſgiving with his friends, by whom, he ſays,
<q>none but ſpectators could form an idea of the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

At Plymouth he had the pleaſure of ſeeing officers, ſoldiers, ſailors, &amp;c. attending his ſermons with the utmoſt ſolemnity. In Exeter alſo, Briſtol, Glouceſter, and Glouceſterſhire, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſeaſons. About the middle of October 1757, he returned to London.</p>
               <p>His attendance this winter on both the Chapel and the Tabernacle, together with his thoughtfulneſs, greatly impaired his health. He was troubled with continual vomitings, got little ſleep, and had no appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. Still, however, he went on as well as he could.
<q>I am brought, now<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MCLXXXVII.</note>, (ſays he) to the ſhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of preaching but once a day, and thrice on a Sunday.</q>
But when he was not preaching, he was projecting ſome ſcheme or other for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion: for inſtance the building of alms-houſes for pious widows, on the ground that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Chapel.
<q>I have a plan, (ſays he) for twelve. The whole expence will be four hundred pounds. I have got a proſpect of two. I propoſe allowing each widow half a crown a week. The Sacrament money will more than do. If this be effected many godly widows will be provided for, and a ſtanding monument left that the Methodiſts were not againſt good works<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letters MCLXXXVII, MCLXXXIX.</note>.</q>
It was not long till
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:013298_0216_0F904E092DD91750"/>
this plan was put into execution. The foundation of the alms-houſes was laid February 16, 1758, and the widows began to be admitted in June following.</p>
               <p>He began his ſummer-circuit this year at Glouceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: from thence he went to Briſtol, and then to Wales. When he was in Wales he was brought very low in his health. He was not able to ſit up in company, as he uſed to do; and could take very little food. Yet continued travelling and preaching twice a day, through various towns in South Wales, where multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes attended; on Sundays the numbers were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters MCCIII, MCCVI.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the month of July he ſet off for Scotland. In his way he preached at Everton, St. Neots, Kayſo, Bedford, Oulney, Weſton, Underwood, Ravenſtone, Northampton, and Newcaſtle. Four Clergymen lent him their pulpits. His bodily ſtrength increaſed ſo little by this journey, that he ſometimes had thoughts of turning back. But this he did not think to be his duty.
<q>Through divine ſtrength, (ſays he) I hope to go forward, and ſhall ſtrive, as much as in me lies, to die in this glorious work<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MCCIX.</note>.</q>
Yet it pleaſed God to reſtore his health in a good meaſure, ſoon after his arrival in Scotland. From Edinburgh he writes, Auguſt 19 and 24.
<q>For theſe four months laſt paſt, I have been brought ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low in my body, that I was in hopes, every ſermon I preached would waft me to my wiſhed for home. Scotland, I hoped, would finiſh my warfare; but it has rather driven me back to ſea again. On Tueſday next, I thought to have moved; but as it is race-week, and my health is improving, friends adviſe me to ſtay, to ſtir them up to run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</q>

By his warm and repeated exhortation to loyalty, and a ſteady adherance to the proteſtant intereſt, on this, and all other occaſions, it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, even in this view, his viſit here has been uſeful to the community in a civil, as well as a religious light.<note n="*" place="bottom">Glaſgow Courant.</note>

               <p>He now talked of going over again to America, where his affairs were in a good ſituation:

Not being able, it ſeems, to get over theſe difficulties, he continued all winter 1758 in London, and above the middle of May 1759, opened his ſpring campaign at Briſtol. In the month of June he was in Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire and Yorkſhire, where people, high and

                        <q>Edinburgh, Auguſt 15, 1759. On Tueſday morning the Rev. Mr. Whitefield ſet out on his return for England. It is ſaid, that here and at Glaſgow, within theſe ſix weeks he has preached near a hundred times, and yet the congregations were always increaſing. Whatever this be owing to, every body muſt judge for themſelves: but it is certain he continually exerted all his rhetoric in ſtirring up a zeal for his God, his King, and his Country in this time of danger; and ſeemed particularly pleaſed, as were thouſands more, that he had an opportunity laſt Lord's Day evening, of preaching a thankſgiving ſermon to a moſt throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed auditory, on account of the glorious victory lately vouchſafed to Prince Ferdinand over the French.</q>

               </p>
               <p>His viſit to Scotland this year, gave occaſion to a paſſage, which was much for his honour, and a full confutation of the mercenary motives aſcribed to him by ſome of his adverſaries. One Miſs Hunter, a young Lady of conſiderable fortune, made a full offer to him of her eſtate, both money and lands, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to about ſeven thouſand pounds, which he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly refuſed. And upon his refuſing it for himſelf, ſhe offered it to him for the benefit of his orphan-houſe in Georgia, which he alſo abſolutely refuſed. Theſe facts the compiler has from undoubted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>He ſpent the winter<note n="‡" place="bottom">October 1759, he wrote a preface to Mr. Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Clark's Bible. See his Works vol. IV.</note> in London, and got his chapel enlarged.</p>
               <p>March 14, 1760, he made a collection at his Chapel and Tabernacle, of above four hundred pounds, for the diſtreſſed Pruſſians, who had ſuffered ſo much from the cruelty of the Ruſſians, at Newmark, Coſtrin, &amp;c.<note n="§" place="bottom">For this diſintereſted act of benevolence, it is ſaid, he received the thanks of his Pruſſian Majeſty.</note>.</p>
               <p>In ſummer 1760, he went into Glouceſterſhire and Wales, and from thence to Briſtol. When he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Tabernacle in Briſtol, there were more in the evenings than it could well hold; and in the fields his congregations conſiſted of not leſs than ten thouſand<note n="‖" place="bottom">Letter MCCXXXVII.</note>.</p>

Mr. Whitefield firſt takes notice of it in his letter dated Auguſt 15, 1760. It ſeems to have taken its riſe from the reſentment of the play-houſe people, after they failed in their attempt to freighten him from preaching at Long-acre chapel, and were farther exaſperated by ſeeing him erect a chapel of his own in Tottenham-court-road.</note>. His ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had in vain uſed violence againſt him, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found that the law would not ſuffer them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in that way, they therefore thought they would try what they could do by mockery. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they got for their tool one Samuel Foote, a mimic, who having had ſome ſucceſs in imitating Mr. Whitefield's perſon, and ſpeaking a few ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous ſentences in his manner, was encouraged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed farther, and to write a farce (called the Minor) to be acted at the Theatre in Drury-Lane<note n="†" place="bottom">See a letter to David Garrick <abbr>Eſq</abbr> occaſioned by the intended repreſentation of the Minor at Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane Theatre, ſaid to be written by the Rev. Mr. Madan.</note>. This performance is otherwiſe very dull and unintereſting; but by its impiety, it cannot fail of exciting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the religious and ſober-minded. For, in order to expoſe Mr. Whitefield to contempt, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes no ſcruple to treat the very expreſſions and ſentiments of the Bible with ridicule; or (to put the moſt favourable conſtruction upon the matter) he and thoſe whom he ſent to the Tabernacle and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to procure materials, were ſo little acquainted with the ſacred writings as not to know, that what they took for Mr. Whitefield's peculiar language, was the language of the word of God.</p>

                  </gap> they were ſo far from leſtening the number of his congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, that they increaſed them; and brought thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of new perſons to hear the goſpel; which was the very thing he always aimed at: and thus Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence gave him the victory over them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Foote being manager of the Edinburgh Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre in winter 1770, the Minor was acted there. The firſt night it was pretty throng, as people fond of any novelty were led to it without knowing any thing of the nature of the performance. But (ſuch was the public ſenſe of the impurity and indecency of it when known) that on the ſecond night, only ten women appeared. When it was acted on Saturday, November 24, a diſpute aroſe among the ſpectators, whether it was proper to bring Mr. Whitefield upon the ſtage, as he was now dead? This, however, was done; and raiſed a general indignation in the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that city. Next day ſeveral Miniſters (the Rev. Dr. Erſkine, Dr. Walker, &amp;c.) took notice of it in their diſcourſes from the pulpit. Dr. Walker (whoſe church is frequented by the people of higher rank) obſerved in his lecture upon 2 Cor. v.14-21, that he could not read the 17th verſe,
<q>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature,</q>
without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the juſt indignation he felt, upon hearing that laſt night a profane piece of buffoonery was public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted, in which this ſacred doctrine is ridiculed.— Mr. Baine, of the Kirk of Relief, preached a ſermon upon the occaſion, December 2, from Pſalm xciv.16,
<q>Who will riſe up for me againſt the evil doers? or who will ſtand up for me againſt the workers of iniquity?</q>
which was publiſhed and ſold off in a few days. Towards the concluſion of the ſermon, he ſays,
<q>How baſe and ungrateful is ſuch treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the dead; and that too ſo very nigh to a family of orphans, the records of whoſe hoſpital

               </p>
               <p>March 14, 1760, Mr. Whitefield preached at the Chapel from Hoſ. xi.8, 9. and at the Tabernacle in the evening, from the 80th Pſalm and laſt verſe. At the former place he collected two hundred and twenty-two pounds eight ſhillings and nine pence; and at the other, one hundred and eighty-two pounds fifteen ſhillings and nine pence, for the diſtreſſed Proteſtants in Pruſſia. No man was a more ſtrict obſerver of public occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or more endeavoured to improve them.</p>
               <p>In the months of September and October 1760, he made a tour through Yorkſhire; and was in London during the winter, employed as uſual. On the faſt-day, Feb. 13, 1761, he preached early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Tabernacle on Exod. xxxiv.1, &amp;c. and collected one hundred and twelve pounds; in the forenoon he laboured at the Chapel, and diſcourſed on Joel ii.15. and afterwards collected two hundred and forty-two pounds; and in the evening he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Tabernacle from Gen. vii.1. and collected two hundred and ten pounds. Theſe ſums were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately applied to the noble purpoſes for which they were collected, the relief of the German Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the ſufferers by fire at Boſton<note n="*" place="bottom">

Accordingly, he prolonged his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the length of Edinburgh and Glaſgow, and did not return to London till the month of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; when he found himſelf conſiderably better, which (under God) he attributed to his following the ſimple preſcriptions of four eminent phyſicians in Edinburgh; being ſenſible, as he ſaid, that their advice had been more bleſſed, for his recovery, than all the medicines and directions he had elſewhere<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MCCLIX.</note>.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as his health was in ſome meaſure reſtored, he fell to his beloved work again. From Briſtol, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 1762, he writes,
<q>Briſtol air agrees with me. I have been enabled to preach five times, this laſt week, without being hurt. Who knows but I may yet be reſtored ſo far as to ſound the goſpel trumpet for my God? The quietneſs I enjoy here, with daily riding out, ſeems to be one very proper means<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letters MCCLX, LXI.</note>.</q>
He continued thus to preach four or five times a week, notwithſtanding his weakneſs, till about the middle of May; and was ſometimes enabled to "take the field," as he expreſſes it, which gave him great joy;
<q>Mounts ſays he, are the beſt pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and the heavens the beſt ſounding boards. O for power equal to my will! I would fly from pole to pole, publiſhing the everlaſting goſpel of the Son of God<note n="§" place="bottom">Letter MCCLXV.</note>.</q>
When he returned to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the cares and labours that thronged upon him were ready to bring him low again. In the month of July, therefore, he made a voyage to Holland, and preached four times at Rotterdam: he found himſelf much better, and writes from Norwich, July 31,
<q>The expedition to Holland, was, I truſt, profitable
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:013298_0225_0F904E0B8EBF8340"/>
to myſelf and others; and if ever my uſefulneſs is to be continued at London, I muſt be prepared for it by a longer itineration both by land and water.

               <p>Auguſt 18, he arrived at Edinburgh, made a viſit to Glaſgow, where he preached every day (and twice at Cambuſlang) and continued preaching once a day at Edinburgh till September 13, when he returned to England: and was glad (now that peace was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of the proſpect of embarking ſoon for America.</p>
               <p>While in England, he found that preaching once a day did not hurt him, but dared not venture oftener. At Leeds, Briſtol and Plymouth, he had very deſirable ſeaſons; but with reſpect to London, he ſays,

Having therefore perſuaded ſome of his intimate friends, as truſtees, to take upon them the whole care of the affairs of his Chapel and Tabernacle, and all his other concerns at home; he reſolved to ſail from Greenock in Scotland. On his way thither, in the month of March, 1765, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Everton, Leeds, Aberford, Kippax, and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle; and was alſo employed in writing his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, &amp;c. in anſwer to Biſhop Warburton<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letters MCCLXXVIII, LXXIX.

               <p>His letters in September, October, and November 1763, are dated from Philadelphia. He found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtill an invalid; yet made a ſhift to preach twice a week,
<q>Here, ſays he, are ſome young bright witneſſes riſing up in the church. Perhaps I have already converted with forty new creature Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of various denominations. Sixteen hopeful ſtudents, I am credibly informed, were converted at New-Jerſey College laſt year. What an open door, if I had ſtrength!

               <p>He wanted much to go forward to Georgia, but the phyſicians were abſolutely againſt it, till he got more ſtrength. In the latter end of November he ſet out from Philadelphia for New-York, and on his way preached ſeveral times at New-Jerſey College and Elizabeth-Town, with much acceptance. His ſpirits now grew better, and he could ſometimes preach thrice a week<note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter MCCXCVIII.</note>. While he continued at New-York during the winter, he writes,
<q>Prejudices in this place have moſt ſtrangely ſubſided.

                  <q>New-York, January 23, 1764. The Rev. Mr. George Whitefield has ſpent ſeven weeks with us, preaching twice a week to more general acceptance than ever; and been treated with great reſpect by many of the Gentlemen and Merchants of this place. During his ſtay, he preached two charity ſermons; the one on the occaſion of the annual collection for the poor, in which double the ſum was collected that ever was upon the like occaſion; the other was for the benefit of Mr. Wheelock's Indian ſchool at Lebanon, in New-England, for which he collected (notwithſtanding the preſent prejudices of many people againſt the Indians) the ſum of one hundred and twenty pounds. In his laſt ſermon he took a very affectionate leave of the people of this city, who expreſſed great concern at his departure. May God reſtore this great and good man (in whom the Gentleman, the Chriſtian and accompliſhed Orator ſhine forth with ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar luſtre) to a perfect ſtate of health, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue him long a bleſſing to the world, and the church of Chriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Boſton Gazette.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After leaving New-York, he preached at Eaſt-Hampton, Bridge-Hampton, and South-Hold, upon Long-Iſland; at Shelter-Iſland alſo; and at New-London, Norwich, and Providence on the Main Land. Then proceeded to Boſton, where he arrived in the latter end of February 1764, and was received with uſual warmth of affection<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MCCCIV.</note>. But as the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox was ſpreading through the town, he choſe to preach for a while in the adjacent places. At New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury a great influence attended his preaching. He writes from Concord to his friend Mr. S— S—,
<q>How would you have been delighted to have ſeen Mr. Wheelock's Indians? Such a promiſing nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of future miſſionaries, I believe, was never ſeen in New-England before; pray encourage it

               <p>In the month of April he had a return of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; but it did not long keep him from preaching: and the Boſton people were exceedingly eager to hear. He was thinking to proceed immediately ſouthward, but they ſent after him, and perſuaded him to come back. June 1, 1764, he writes,
<q>Friends have even conſtrained me to ſtay here, for fear of running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſummer's heat. Hitherto I find the benefit of it. Whatever it is owing to, through mercy I am much better in health than I was this time twelve months, and can now preach thrice a week to very large auditories, without hurt.

<q>At preſent, ſays he, my health is better than uſual, and as yet I have felt no inconvenience from the ſummer's heat.—I have preached twice lately in the fields, and we ſat under the bleſſed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſhadow with great delight.—My late excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon Long-Iſland, I truſt, have been bleſſed.

               <p>In September and October he was at Philadelphia; the provoſt of the college there read prayers for him.

               <p>From Philadelphia he proceeded ſouthward through Virginia. And November 22, at New-Brunſwick in Carolina, he writes,
<q>At Newburn laſt Sunday good impreſſions were made—From that place to this I have met with what they call New-Lights<note n="‡" place="bottom">A name given to thoſe who favour the revival of religion under the Miniſtry of Mr. Whitefield, Mr. Tennent, &amp;c.—Letter MCCCXIX.</note> lmoſt every ſtage.—I have the names of ſix or eight of their preachers.

               </p>
               <p>After preaching at Charleſtown, he arrived at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah in December, where he found affairs proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his wiſh. "The colony," ſays he,

And he was not diſappointed his expectations; for he writes,

But how was my Lord ſurprized and delighted!

               </p>

               <p>About this time, the Stamp Act was repealed; on which occaſion he greatly exulted. The intereſt of the colonies always lay near his heart, and he hoped this ſtep would reſtore peace and happineſs to his country.

               <p>Mr. Occum, an Indian preacher, and Mr. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker, came over from America to ſollicit contributions for Mr. Wheelock's Indian ſchool, an inſtitution which Mr. Whitefield greatly approved.

<q>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a large and effectual door opening among the Heathens, bleſſed be God, is very promiſing.

               <p>In the month of January 1767, he wrote a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory preface to a new edition of Bunyan's works; which is inſerted with his Tracts in vol.

               </p>
               <p>This winter his negociations about the intended college at Betheſda, came to an iſſue. A memorial, addreſſed to his Majeſty, was put into the hands of the clerk of the privy council, ſetting forth the great utility of a college in that place to the inhabitants of the ſouthern provinces, and praying that a charter might be granted upon the plan of the college at New-Jerſey. This memorial was by him tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lord Preſident, and by his Lordſhip refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the conſideration of the Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, to whom alſo a draft of an intended charter was preſented by the Earl of D—h. Upon which an epiſtolary correſpondence enſued betwixt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop and Mr. Whitefield; the ſum of which was, the Archbiſhop put the draft of the charter in the hands of the Lord P. who promiſed to conſider it and gave it as his opinion, that
<q>the head of the college ought to be a member of the Church of Engliſh of
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:013298_0236_0F8FFA778F8D4320"/>
That this was a qualification not to be diſpenſed with. And alſo that the public prayers ſhould not be extempore ones, but the liturgy of the church, or ſome other ſettled and eſtabliſhed form.</q>
Mr. Whitefield anſwered, he could not agree to either of theſe reſtrictions, becauſe the greateſt part of the Orphan-houſe collections and contributions came from diſſenters; and becauſe he had frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the intended college was to be founded upon
<q>a broad bottom, and no other. This, ſays he, I judged I was ſufficiently warranted to do, from the known, long eſtabliſhed, mild, and uncoercive genius of the Engliſh government; alſo from your grace's moderation towards proteſtant diſſenters; from the unconquerable attachment of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans to toleration-principles, as well as from the avowed habitual feelings and ſentiments of my own heart. This being the caſe,—and as your grace by your ſilence ſeems to be like-minded with the Lord P—t; and as your grace's and his lordſhip's influence will undoubtedly extend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to others, I would beg leave, after returning all due acknowledgments, to inform your grace that I intend troubling your grace and his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip no more about this ſo long depending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. As it hath pleaſed the great head of the church in ſome degree to renew my bodily ſtrength, I purpoſe now to renew my feeble efforts, and turn the charity into a more generous, and conſequently into a more extenſively uſeful chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. I have no ambition to be looked upon as the founder of a college; but I would fain act the part of an honeſt man, a diſintereſted Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and a truly catholic, moderate preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of the church of England<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Works, vol. III. page 472-484, where the ſteps he took in this affair are more fully narrated in a letter to Governor Wright—and Letter, MCCCLXXVII, in which he complains to his intimate friend Mr. K—n,
<q>None but God knows what a concern lies upon me now in reſpect to Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. As another voyage, perhaps, may be the iſſue and reſult of all at laſt, I would beg you, and my dear Mr. Hervey, to let me have my papers, and letters, that I may reviſe and diſpoſe of them in a proper manner.

                  <pb n="237" facs="unknown:013298_0237_0F904E1774D45678"/>Accordingly he reſolved, in the mean time, to add a public academy to the Orphan-houſe, like what was done at Philadelphia, before its college charter was granted; and to wait for a more favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making freſh application, for a charter upon a broad bottom.</p>
               <p>October 28. he preached at the Tabernacle, to the Society for promoting Religious Knowledge among the poor, when the collection amounted to above a hundred pounds, (about four times as much as uſual) and eighty perſons became new ſubſcribers.</p>
               <p>His text was, Luke xi.2. "Thy kingdom come." The place was quite full, and many went away for want of room. A great number of diſſenting Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were preſent; probably, more than ever before met to hear a church Clergyman preach. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dined with the Miniſters and whole company at Draper's-Hall, where he was treated with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. All was very harmonious, and gave him great pleaſure in reflection<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter MCCCLXXV.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1768, ſix pious ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were expelled from Edmund-Hall, in Oxford, for uſing extempore prayer, reading and ſinging hymns, and exhorting one another in private religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meetings. Upon this occaſion, Mr. Whitefield
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:013298_0238_0F8FFA785585F6C8"/>
wrote his letter to Dr. Durell, Vicechancellor of the univerſity<note n="‡" place="bottom">See his works, vol. IV.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the ſummer, he went once more to Edinburgh, where his Orphan-houſe-Park congregations were as large, attentive, and affectionate as ever<note n="§" place="bottom">Letters MCCCLXXXVII, LXXXVIII.</note>.</p>
               <p>Auguſt 3. ſoon after his return to London, Mrs. Whitefield was attacked with an inflammatory fever, and the 9th of Auguſt ſhe died. The 14th of the month he preached her funeral ſermon, from Rom. viii.20: and September 12. he writes,
<q>I have been in hopes of my own departure. Through hard rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and frequent preaching, I have burſt a vein. The flux is in a great meaſure ſtopped, but reſt and quietneſs are ſtrictly enjoined. We were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with glorious Goſpel-gales this day fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and ſeveral preceding days, at opening good Lady Huntingdon's chapel, and place of pious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Wales<note n="†" place="bottom">From his Memorandum Book.

               <p>September 26. he writes concerning his friend and fellow-labourer Mr. Middleton:

               </p>
               <p>Next ſpring, 1769, he ſeems to have recovered a little; for we find him preaching more frequently. It gave him great pleaſure to ſee ſome more of the nobility joined to Lady H—n's ſociety.

               <p>In the month of May he preached at Kingſwood, Briſtol, Bradford, Frome, Chippenham, Rodborough, Caſtlecomb, Durſley. But deferred his weſtern circuit on account of the opening the Chapel at Tunbridge<note n="§" place="bottom">Letter MCCCCXIII.</note>.</p>
               <p>July 23, 1769, he opened Lady Huntingdon's New Chapel at Tunbridge Wells. Preached from Gen. xxviii.17.
<q>This is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</q>
In the evening, the congregation being too large to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the chapel, he preached out of doors, from a mount in the court before the chapel; after which he gave a general exhortation; and next day admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered the ſacrament, and preached from 1 Theſſ. ii.11, 12.</p>

                  <q>Saturday, Sept. 2. Had a moſt awful parting ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at Tottenham-Court-Chapel ſacrament, laſt Sunday morning, the ſermon from Gen. xxviii. 12. And the ſame at Tabernacle (which was more than full) on Wedneſday morning at ſeven o'clock. This day dined at my worthy, faſt, and tried friend Mr. Keen's; and having comfortably ſettled and left all my outward concerns in his hands, I took an affectionate leave, and in company with ſome dear friends, this evening reached Graveſend; where others met us. We ſupped and converſed together in ſome degree, I truſt, like perſons who

                  <q>Sunday, September 3. Preached this morning at the Methodiſt Tabernacle from John xiii. verſe 32. The congregation was not very large. But God gave me great freedom of ſpeech, and made it indeed a houſe of God, and gate of Heaven. In the afternoon I preached in the market-place from Gen. iii. verſe 13. to a much larger, but not more devout auditory. In the out-ſkirts, as might naturally be expected, ſome were a little noiſy, but a great body was very attentive, and I was enabled to lift up my voice like a trumpet. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the evening was ſpent as the night before, with my chriſtian London friends; who with me, leſs than the leaſt of all, exceedingly rejoiced at the opportunity of a parting ſtreet-market-place preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where, I truſt, ſome pennyleſs bankrupt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were made willing to buy Goſpel wine and milk, without money, and without price.—May the great day ſhow that this hope was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill-grounded!</q>

                  <q>Monday, September 4. Had my dear chriſtian friends on board to breakfaſt with me this morning. Converſation was ſweet, but parting was bitter. 'What mean you (ſaid the Apoſtle) to weep and break my heart?' However, through infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I was helped to bear up, and after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Divine Preſence made up the loſs of all, even with new creature comforts.

                  <q>The winds being contrary, and the weather hazy, we did not arrive in the Downs till the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following.

All attended divine worſhip very orderly, and thanked me for my offer of lending them books, and giving them what aſſiſtance lay in my power towards making their voyage comfortable. All ſeemed thankful, and the pilot parted with tears in his eyes.—May the great, and never-failing pilot, the Almighty Jeſus, renew us, and take us all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his holy protection, and then all muſt neceſſarily end in our ſafe arrival into the haven of eternal reſt!</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Tueſday, September 12. Preached laſt Sunday morning to my little flock on board, and was moſt agreeably ſurprized to-day, with a kind unexpected viſit from the Rev. Dr. Gibbons. His diſcourſe was very friendly and devout.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Wedneſday, September 13. I went aſhore and attended on an ordination ſolemnity, at the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meeting. Several Miniſters officiated. Several very important queſtions were aſked, and anſwered before, and a ſolemn charge given after, impoſition of hands. But the prayer put up in the very act of laying on of hands, by Dr. Gibbons, was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, and the looks and behaviour of thoſe that joined ſo ſerious and ſolemn, that I hardly know when I was more ſtruck under any one's miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ordination being over, at the deſire of the Miniſters, and Gentlemen, I went and dined with them. Our converſation was edifying. And being informed, that many were deſirous to hear me preach, I willingly complied, and I truſt ſome ſeed was ſown the ſame evening at Deal, which, by God's heavenly bleſſing, will ſpring up to life eternal. The people of Deal ſeemed very civil, and ſome came to me who had not forgotten my

preaching to them, and their deceaſed friends and parents, thirty-two years ago.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Friday, September 14. 15. I had received moſt preſſing invitations to viſit Ramſgate, many weeks ago. Theſe were now repeated by many of that place, who came to the ordination at Deal; ſo there was no reſiſting their importunity. We reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ramſgate about two, took ſome refreſhment, and there I preached about four, not to a very large, but an attentive and affected auditory. This I did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the morning following; and was moſt agreeable entertained with the diſcourſe, and good memory of one, in particular, who had been my fellow-paſſenger, and frequent hearer many years ago, in the Wilmington, Captain Darling, bound to Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataway in New-England. The people's behaviour here was ſo undiſſembledly generous, frank, genteel, and chriſtian, that I know not where I have been more pleaſed and delighted. Being quite uneaſy, leſt by ſtaying longer I ſhould be unready, if the wind ſhould turn favourable, I went early on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning to Deal, and from thence immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on board, and preached in the afternoon. This morning came a ſurreptitious copy of my Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle Farewell Sermon, taken, as the ſhort-hand writer profeſſes, <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I ſpoke it. But ſurely he is miſtaken. The whole is ſo injudiciouſly paragraphed, and ſo wretchedly unconnected, that I owe no thanks to the miſguided, though it may be well-meant zeal of the writer and publisher, be they who they will. But ſuch conduct is an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable tax upon popularity. And all that appear for Jeſus Chriſt, and his bleſſed Goſpel, much like their maſter, expect to ſuffer from the falſe fire of profeſſing friends, as well as ſecret malice of avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemies. However, if any one ſentence is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the conviction of one ſinner, or the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any individual ſaint, I care not what becomes
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:013298_0244_0F904E1BB73AE698"/>
of my character, though I would always pray to be preſerved from bringing upon myſelf, or others, needleſs, unneceſſary contempt.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Monday, September 25. Weighed anchor laſt Tueſday morning, with a ſmall favourable gale and fine weather. So many ſhips which had lain in the Downs, moving at the ſame time, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gliding by us, together with the proſpect of the adjacent ſhore, made a moſt agreeable ſcene. But it proved only a very tranſient one. For by that time we got to Fairlee, the wind backened, clouds gathered, very violent gales ſucceeded, and for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days we were ſo toſſed, that after coming over againſt Brighthelmſtone, the Captain rightly judging, turned back, (as did many other ſhips) and anchored over againſt New Rumſey and Dungeneſs.—Lord, in thine own time, thou wilt give the winds a commiſſion to carry us forward towards our deſired port.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At laſt they got out of the Channel, and on the 30th of November, arrived at Charleſtown, in South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. It had been a dangerous and trying paſſage; yet, on his arrival, he found himſelf in better health than at the end of any voyage he had made for ſeveral years; and the ſame day that he came aſhore, he preached at Charleſtown, where his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was as hearty, or heartier than ever.
<q>For the laſt week (November 1769) we were beating about our port, within ſight of it, and confined for two days in five-fathom-hole, juſt over the bar. A dangerous ſituation, as the wind blew hard, and our ſhip, like a young chriſtian, for want of more bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, would not obey the helm. But through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy, on November 30, a pilot-boat came and took us ſafe aſhore to Charleſtown, after being on board almoſt thirteen weeks. Friends received me moſt cordially.—Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoul,

<q>Savannah, January 31, 1770. Laſt Sunday, his Excellency the Governor, Council, and Aſſembly, having been
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:013298_0246_0F904E1D77944198"/>
invited by the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at divine ſervice in the Chapel of the Orphan-houſe Academy, where prayers were read by the Rev. Mr. Ellington, and a very ſuitable ſermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Whitefield from Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah iv. 10. 'For who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things?' to the general ſatisfaction of the auditory; in which he took occaſion to mention the many diſcouragements he met with, well known to many there, in carrying on this inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for upwards of thirty years paſt, and the preſent promiſing proſpect of its future and more extenſive uſefulneſs. After divine ſervice, the company were very politely entertained with a handſome and plentiful dinner; and were greatly pleaſed to ſee the uſeful improvements made in the houſe, the two additional wings for apartments for ſtudents, one hundred and fifty feet each in length, and other leſſer buildings, in ſo much forwardneſs, and the whole executed with taſte, and in a maſterly manner; and being ſenſible of the truly generous and diſintereſted benefactions derived to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince through his means, they expreſſed their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the moſt reſpectful terms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this he writes from Charleſtown, Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 10.
<q>Through mercy, I enjoy a greater ſhare of bodily health than I have known for many years. I am now enabled to preach almoſt every day.

                  <q>During this month I have been above a five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles circuit, and have been enabled to preach and travel through the heat every day.

At this laſt place he preached in the open air, to accommodate the multitudes that came to hear him, no houſe being able to contain them. He continued his diſcourſe near two hours, was greatly fatigued, and in the afternoon ſet out for Newbury-Port, where he arrived that evening; went early to bed, it being Saturday night, intending to preach the next day. He awaked ſeveral times in the night, and complained much of a difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At ſix o'clock on the Lord's day morning, he expired in a fit of the aſthma.</p>
               <p>Mr. Richard Smith, who accompanied Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field from England to America the laſt time, and in his journeyings when there, to the time of his death, hath given a particular account of his death and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it may not be improper to inſert.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>On Saturday, Sept. 29, 1770, Mr. Whitefield rode from Portſmouth to Exeter (fifteen miles) in the morning, and preached there to a very great multitude in the fields. It is remarkable, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went out to preach that day, (which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his laſt ſermon) Mr. Clarkſon, ſenior, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him more uneaſy than uſual, ſaid to him, 'Sir, you are more fit to go to bed than to preach.' To which Mr. Whitefield anſwered, 'True, Sir:' but turning aſide, he claſped his hands together, and, looking up, ſpoke, 'Lord Jeſus, I am weary in thy work, but not of thy work. If I have not yet finiſhed my courſe, let me go and ſpeak for thee once more in the fields, ſeal thy truth, and come home and die.' The text he preached from was, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. 'Examine yourſelves, whether ye be is

the faith; prove your own ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?' He dined at Captain Gillman's. After dinner, Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Parſons rode to Newbury. I did not get there till two hours after them. I found them at ſupper. I aſked Mr. Whitefield how he felt himſelf after his journey. He ſaid, 'he was tired, therefore he ſupped early, and would go to bed.' He eat a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little ſupper, talked but little, aſked Mr. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to diſcharge the table, and perform family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then retired up ſtairs. He ſaid, 'that he would ſit and read till I came to him,' which I did as ſoon as poſſible, and found him reading in the Bible, with Dr. Watts's Pſalms lying open before him. He aſked me for ſome water-gruel, and took about half his uſual quantity, and kneeling down by the bedſide, cloſed the evening with prayer. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little converſation, he went to reſt and ſlept till two in the morning, when he awoke me, and aſked for a little cyder; be drank about a wine glaſs full. I aſked him how he felt, for he ſeemed to pant for breath. He told me, 'His aſthma was coming on him again; I muſt have two or three days reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Two or three days riding, without preaching, would ſet me up again.' Soon afterwards he aſked me to put the window up a little higher, (though it was half up all night) for, ſaid he, 'I cannot breathe, but I hope I ſhall be better by and by; a good pulpit-ſweat to-day may give me relief; I ſhall be better after preaching.' I ſaid to him, I wiſhed he would not preach ſo often. He replied, 'I had rather wear out, than ruſt out.' I then told him, I was afraid he took cold in preaching yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.

ſouls might be brought to Chriſt, and prayed for direction, whether he ſhould winter at Boſton, or haſten to the ſouthward: prayed for a bleſſing on his Betheſda College, and his dear family there; for Tabernacle and Chapel congregations, and all his connections on the other ſide the water, and then laid himſelf down to ſleep again. This was nigh three o'clock. At a quarter paſt four he wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaid, 'My aſthma, my aſthma is coming on, I wiſh I had not given out word to preach at Haverhill on Monday; I don't think I ſhall be able: but, I ſhall ſee what to-day will bring forth. If I am no better to-morrow, I will take a two or three days ride.' He then deſired me to warm him a little gruel, and in breaking the fire-wood, I waked Mr. Parſons; who thinking I knocked for him, roſe and came in. He went to Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's bedſide, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſked him how he felt himſelf. He anſwered, 'I am almoſt ſuffocated, I can ſcarce breathe: my aſthma quite choaks me.' I was then not a little ſurprized, to hear how quick and with what difficulty he drew his breath. He got out of bed, and went to the open window for air. This was exactly at five o'clock. I went to him, and for about the ſpace of five minutes, I ſaw no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, only that he had a great difficulty in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I had often ſeen before. Soon afterwards he turned himſelf to me, and ſaid, 'I am dying.' I ſaid, I hope not, Sir. He ran to the other win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow panting for breathing, but could get no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. It was agreed I ſhould go for Dr. Sawyer; and on my coming back, I ſaw death on his face, and he again ſaid, 'I am dying.' His eyes were fixed, his under lip drawing inward every time he drew breath; he went towards the window, and he offered him ſome warm wine with Lavender drops, which he refuſed. I perſuaded him to ſit down in the chair, and have his cloak on; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:013298_0253_0F8FFA79CBCC5320"/>
by a ſign, but could not ſpeak. I then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him the glaſs of warm wine; he took half of it, but it ſeemed as if it would have ſtopped his breath entirely. In a little time he brought up a conſiderable quantity of phlegm and wind. I then began to have ſome ſmall hopes. Mr. Parſons ſaid, he thought Mr. Whitefield breathed more freely than he did, and would recover. I ſaid, no, Sir, he is certainly dying. I was continually employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in taking the phlegm out of his mouth with a handkerchief, and bathing his temples with drops, rubbing his wriſts, &amp;c. to give him relief, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but all in vain, his hands and feet were cold as clay. When the Doctor came in, and ſaw him in the chair leaning on my breaſt, he felt his pulſe, and ſaid, 'He is a dead man.' Mr. Parſons ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'I do not believe it, you muſt do ſomething Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.' He ſaid, 'I cannot; he is now near his laſt breath.' And indeed ſo it was, for he fetched but one gaſp, and ſtretched out his feet, and breathed no more. This was exactly at ſix o'clock. We continued rubbing his legs and hands and feet with warm cloths, and bathed him with ſpirits for ſome time, but all in vain. I then put him into a warm bed, the Doctor ſtanding by, and often raiſed him upright, continued rubbing him and putting ſpirits to his noſe for an hour, till all hopes w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſeveral years ago, and alſo of many in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, that to their knowledge, under God, owed their converſion wholly to his coming among them, often repeating the bleſſed ſeaſons they had enjoyed under his preaching: and all ſaid, that this laſt viſit was attended with more power than any other, and that all oppoſition fell before him. Then one and another of them would pity and pray for his dear Tabernacle and Chapel congregations, and it was truly affecting to hear them bemoan A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica and England's loſs. Thus they continued for two hours converſing about his great uſefulneſs, and praying that God would ſcatter his gifts and drop his mantle among them. When the corpſe was placed at the foot of the pulpit, cloſe to the vault, the Rev. Mr. Daniel Rogers made a very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting prayer, and openly confeſſed, that under God, he owed his converſion to the labours of that dear Man of God, whoſe precious remains now lay before them. Then he cried out, 'O my father, my father!' then ſtopt and wept, as though his heart would break, and the people weeping all through the place. Then he recovered, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his prayer and ſat down and wept. Then one of the Deacons gave out that hymn, 'Why do we mourn departing friends?' Some of the people weeping, ſome ſinging, and ſo on alternately. The Rev. Mr. Jewel preached a funeral diſcourſe, and made an affectionate addreſs to his brethren to lay to heart the death of that uſeful man of God; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that he and they might be upon their watch-tower, and endeavour to follow his bleſſed exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The corpſe was then put into the vault, and all concluded with a ſhort prayer, and dimiſſion of the people, who went weeping through the ſtreets to their reſpective places of abode.</q>

               <p>The melancholy news of Mr. Whitefield's death reached London on Monday, November 5, 1770,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:013298_0255_0F8FFA7B95FF1A80"/>
by the Boſton Gazette, and by three letters from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons at Boſton, to his friend Mr. Keen, who alſo by the ſame poſt received two of his own hand-writing, written in health: one ſeven, and the other five days before his death. Mr. Keen had the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly event notified the ſame night at the Tabernacle, and the next night at Tottenham-Court Chapel. His next ſtep was to conſider of a proper perſon to preach the funeral ſermon; and recollecting he had often ſaid to Mr. Whitefield, If you ſhould die abroad, whom ſhall we get to preach your funeral ſermon? Muſt it be your old friend the Rev. Mr. John Weſley? And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received conſtantly for anſwer, "He is the man." Mr. Keen accordingly waited on the Rev. Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley on the Saturday following, and engaged him to preach it on the Lord's day, November 18, which he did to a very large, crowded, and mournful audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: many hundreds going away, who could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly get in.</p>
               <p>In both the places of worſhip, the pulpits, &amp;c. were hung with black cloth, and the galleries with fine black baize. The pulpits had eſcutcheons placed in the front, and on each of the houſes adjoining, hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were put up: The motto on each was, "<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>He was a man eminent in Piety, of a humane, benevolent, and charitable diſpoſition; his zeal in the cauſe of God was ſingular, his labours indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable, and his ſucceſs in preaching the Goſpel remarkable and aſtoniſhing. He departed this life in the 56th year of his age.</p>

                  <l>And, like his Maſter, was by ſome deſpis'd;</l>

                  <l>Not whom the world, but Jeſus Chriſt will own.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Mr. Whitefield was not full fifty-ſix years of age at the time of his death: thirty-four years of which he ſpent in the miniſtry. And if life is to be meaſured by the greateſt activity and enjoyment; ſuch as being always intent upon ſome good deſign, and vigorous in the purſuit of it; filling up every day with actions of importance, worthy of a man and a chriſtian; ſeeing much of the world, and having a conſtant flow of the moſt lively affections, both of the ſocial and religious kind; Mr. Whitefield, in theſe thirty-four years may be ſaid to have lived more than moſt men would do, though their lives were prolonged for many ages.</p>

               <p>HIS perſon was graceful, and well proportioned: his ſtature rather above the middle ſize. His complexion was very fair. His eyes were of a dark blue colour, and ſmall, but ſprightly. He had a ſquint with one of them. Occaſioned either by the ignorance, or the careleſsneſs of the nurſe who attended him in the meaſles, when he was about four years old. His features were in general good and regular. His countenance was manly, and his voice exceeding ſtrong; yet both were ſoftened with an uncommon degree of ſweetneſs. He was always very clean and neat, and often ſaid pleaſantly
<q>that a Miniſter of the Goſpel ought to be without ſpot.</q>
His deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was decent and eaſy, without the leaſt ſtiffneſs or formality: and his engaging polite manner made his company univerſally agreeable. In his youth he was ſlender, and moved his body with great agility to action, ſuitable to his diſcourſe; but about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his age, he began to grow corpulent; which however was ſolely the effect of his diſeaſe, being always, even to a proverb, remarkable for his moderation both in eating and drinking.</p>
               <p>In reviewing the life of this extraordinary man, the following particulars appear very remarkable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we are ſtruck with his unwearied diligence in the office of religion, and his conſcientious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every portion of his time. Early in the morning he roſe to his Maſter's work, and all the day long was employed in a continual ſucceſſion of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent duties. Take a view of his public conduct; here he is engaged either in preaching the Goſpel, in viſiting and giving counſel to the afflicted, in inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:013298_0258_0F904E27766FA758"/>
the ignorant, or in celebrating the praiſes of God. Obſerve his behaviour in private company; there you hear him introducing, upon all occaſions, and among all ſorts of people, diſcourſe that tended to edification. And if you follow him to his retirements; you ſee him writing devout meditations upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of the day, or letters to his chriſtian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance full of piety and zeal. What a gloomy idea muſt a ſtranger to vital piety entertain of a life ſpent in this manner? He will think it muſt have been not only joyleſs and diſguſting, but intolerably burthenſome. Far otherwiſe did it appear in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this ſervant of Chriſt. He felt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoyment when engaged in a conſtant round of ſocial and religious duties. In theſe, whole weeks paſt away like one day. And when he was viſited with any diſtreſs or affliction, preaching, as he tells us himſelf, was his catholicon, and prayer his antidote againſt every trial. The pleaſure of a man of buſineſs in ſucceſsfully puſhing his trade, or of a philoſopher when purſuing his favourite ſtudies, may give us ſome faint conception of the joys which he felt: yet ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent were his deſires after the heavenly happineſs, that he often longed to finiſh his work, and to go home to his Saviour.

               <p>Again, we are juſtly ſurprized at his frequent and fervent preaching under all the diſadvantages of a

ſickly conſtitution, and the many fits of illneſs with which he was ſuddenly ſeized. It muſt indeed be confeſſed, that change of air, frequent travelling on horſeback, and the many voyages he made, might contribute to the preſervation of his health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour: but when we conſider what exertion of voice was neceſſary to reach his large congregations; that he preached generally twice or thrice every day, and often four times on the Lord's day; but above all, what waſte of ſtrength and ſpirits every ſermon muſt have coſt him, through the earneſtneſs of his delivery; it is truly aſtoniſhing, how his conſtitution could hold out ſo long <note n="‡" place="bottom">"I preach till I ſweat through and through." Letter XLVI.</note>.</p>
               <p>But there is another circumſtance not leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than either of the former, which is, the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſire that all ſorts of people expreſſed to attend his preaching; and that not upon the firſt or ſecond viſit only, but at every ſucceeding opportunity. Wherever he went, prodigious numbers flocked to hear him. His congregations often conſiſted of four or five thouſand: in populous places they ſwelled to ten, ſometimes fourteen: and upon ſome occaſions the concourſe was ſo great, that they have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be from twenty to thirty thouſand.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful to think how he commanded the attention of ſuch multitudes; with what compoſure they liſtened when he began to ſpeak; how they hung upon his lips, and were often diſſolved in tears: and this was the caſe with perſons of the moſt hardy and rugged, as well as thoſe of ſofter tempers.</p>
               <p>His eloquence was indeed very great, and of the trueſt and nobleſt kind. He was utterly devoid of all appearance of affectation. He ſeemed to be quite unconſcious of the talents he poſſeſſed. The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his ſubject, and the regard due to his hearers, engroſſed all his concern. He ſpake like one who
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:013298_0260_0F904E296A4A6698"/>
did not ſeek their applauſe, but was concerned for their beſt intereſts, and who, from a principle of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned love, earneſtly endeavoured to lead them in the right way. And the effect in ſome meaſure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded to the deſign. They did not amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with commending his diſcourſes; but being moved and perſuaded by what he ſaid, entered into his views, felt his paſſions, and were willing, for that time at leaſt, to comply with all his requeſts. This was eſpecially remarkable at his charity ſermons<note n="*" place="bottom">Which he preached for a great many others, beſide his own orphans in Georgia. See his life.</note>, when the worldly-minded were made to part with their money in ſo generous a manner, that when they returned to their former temper, they were ready to think that it had been conjured from them by ſome inexplicable charm. The charm, however, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than the power of his irreſiſtible eloquence, in which reſpect it is not eaſy to ſay, whether he was ever excelled either in ancient or modern times.</p>
               <p>He had a ſtrong and muſical voice, and a wonderful command of it. His pronunciation was not only proper, but manly and graceful. Nor was he ever at a loſs for the moſt natural and ſtrong expreſſions. Yet theſe in him were but lower qualities. The grand ſources of his eloquence were an exceeding lively imagination, which made people think they ſaw what he deſcribed; and action ſtill more lively if poſſible, by which, while every accent of his voice ſpoke to the ear, every feature of his face, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hands, and every geſture ſpoke to the eye; ſo that the moſt diſſipated and thoughtleſs found their attention involuntarily fixed, and the dulleſt and moſt ignorant could not but underſtand. He had likewiſe a certain elevation of mind, which raiſed him equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above praiſe and cenſure, and added great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to whatever he ſaid. The natural language of this chriſtian fortitude was,
<q>The Lord only knows
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:013298_0261_0F904E2AB13DD9A8"/>
how he will be pleaſed to diſpoſe of me; great afflictions I am ſure of having; and a ſudden death, bleſſed be God, will not be terrible. I know that my Redeemer liveth.

               </p>
               <p>But what was perhaps the moſt important of all, he had a heart deeply exerciſed in all the ſocial, as well as the pious and religious affections, and was at the ſame time moſt remarkably communicative, by which means he was peculiarly fitted to awaken like feelings in others, and ſo ſympathize with every one that had them.</p>
               <p>This laſt, ſome have thought was the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of his character. It was certainly, however, an eminent part of it. In his journals and letters, an impartial reader will find inſtances thereof almoſt in every page: ſuch as, lively gratitude to God in the firſt place, and to all whom God had uſed as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of good to him: ſincere love in dealing ſo plainly with his correſpondents about the intereſt of their ſouls <note n="‡" place="bottom">See particularly Letter CXVIII.</note>: frequent and particular interceſſion for his friends, his enemies, and all mankind: great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſociety of chriſtian acquaintance: many very ſorrowful partings, and joyful meetings with his friends: tender heartedneſs to the afflicted: the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in procuring and adminiſtring ſeaſonable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are manifeſt proofs that he had a heart eaſily ſuſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of every humane, tender, and compaſſionate feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this was certainly a great mean of enabling him ſo ſtrongly to affect the hearts of others.</p>

But as Mr. Whitefield had repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deſired he might be buried before Mr. Parſons's pulpit, if he died at Newbury-Port, Mr. Parſons thought himſelf obliged to deny both of theſe requeſts. The following account of his interment, is ſubjoined to his ſermon, viz. "October 2, 1770. At one o'clock all the bells in town were tolled for half an hour, and all the veſſels in the harbour gave their proper ſignals of mourning. At two o'clock the bells tolled a ſecond time. At three the bells called to attend the funeral. The Rev. Dr. Samuel Haven of Portſmouth, the Rev.

Mr. Parſons's of Newbury-Port, where Mr. Whitefield died. Mr. Parſons and his family together with many other reſpectable perſons followed the corpſe in mourning. The proceſſion was only one mile, and then the corpſe was carried into the Preſbyterian church, and placed on the bier in the broad-alley, when the Rev.

Then, the third hymn of the ſecond book of Dr. Watts's Spiritual Songs was ſung by the congregation.

<pb n="267" facs="unknown:013298_0267_0F8FFA80A0B33B28"/>
to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain." And this is the character he gives of his departed friend.</p>
                  <p>"Chriſt became a principle of ſpiritual life in his ſoul, while he was an under-graduate at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in Oxford. Before his converſion he was a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee of the Phariſees, as ſtrict as ever Paul was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God met him on his way to Damaſcus, according to his own declaration in his laſt ſermon, which I heard him preach at Exeter, yeſterday. He was, by means of reading, a very ſearching, puritanical writer, convinced of the rottenneſs of all the duties he had done, and the danger of a ſelf-righteous foundation of
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:013298_0268_0F904E300698CC08"/>
hope. When he heard Chriſt ſpeak to him in the Goſpel, he cried, 'Lord what wilt thou have me to 
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:013298_0269_0F904E315A440790"/>
do?' And it ſeems as if, at that time, it had been made known to him that he was a choſen veſſel, to bear the name of Chriſt Jeſus through the Britiſh Nation and her Colonies: to ſtand before Kings and Nobles, and all ſorts of people, to preach Chriſt, and him crucified. From that time the dawns of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had living power in his heart, and he had an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire to furniſh himſelf for the Goſpel miniſtry. To this end, beſides the uſual ſtudies at the college, he gave himſelf to reading the Holy Scriptures, to meditation and prayer; and particularly, he read Mr. Henry's Annotations on the Bible, upon his knees before God.</p>
                  <p>"Since my firſt acquaintance with him, which is about thirty years ago, I have highly eſteemed him, as an excellent Chriſtian, and an eminent Miniſter of the Goſpel. An heart ſo bent for Chriſt, with ſuch a ſprightly active genius, could not admit of his ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fixed reſidence, in one place, as the paſtor of a particular congregation; and therefore, he choſe to itinerate from place to place, and from one country to another; which indeed was much better ſuited to his talents, than a fixed abode would have been. I often conſidered him as an angel flying through the midſt of heaven, with the everlaſting Goſpel, to preach unto them that dwell on the earth; for he preached the uncorrupted word of God, and gave ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn warnings againſt all corruptions of the Goſpel of Chriſt. When he came the firſt time to Boſton, the venerable Dr. Coleman, (with whom I had a ſmall acquaintance) condeſcended to write to me, "That the wonderful man was come, and they had had a week of Sabbaths; that his zeal for Chriſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; and yet he recommended himſelf to his many thouſand hearers, by his engagedneſs for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſouls." I ſoon had opportunity to obſerve that wherever he flew, like a flame of fire, his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gave a general alarm to all ſorts of people, though before, they had, for a long time, been amazingly
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:013298_0270_0F904E31A9B5A490"/>
ſunk down into dead formality. It was then a time in New-England, that real Chriſtians generally had ſlackened their zeal for Chriſt, and fallen into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and careleſs frame of ſpirit: and hypocritical profeſſors were ſunk into a deep ſleep of carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Miniſters and their congregations, ſeemed to be at eaſe. But his preaching appeared to be from the heart, though too many, who ſpake the ſame things, preached as if it were indifferent, whether they were received or rejected. We are convinced that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the meſſage he brought us, to be of the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Nevertheleſs, as ſoon as there was time for reflection, the enemies of Chriſt began to cavil, and hold up ſome of his ſallies, as if they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable faults. By ſuch means he met with a ſtorm as tempeſtuous as the troubled ſea, that caſts up mire and dirt. Some of every ſtation were too fond of their old way of formality, to part with it, for ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed cauſe as living religion. But the Spirit of Chriſt ſet home the meſſage of the Lord upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of ſome, and ſhook them off from their falſe hopes: but many began to find fault, and ſome to write againſt his evangelizing through the country, while others threatened fire-brands, arrows, and death. Yet God gave room for his intenſe zeal to operate, and ſit objects appeared, wherever he went, to engage him in preaching Chriſt, and him crucified.</p>
                  <p>"In his repeated viſits to America, when his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices had almoſt exhauſted his animal ſpirits, and his friends were ready to cry, Spare thyſelf, his hope of ſerving Chriſt, and winning ſouls to him, animated and engaged him to run almoſt any riſque. Neither did he ever croſs the Atlantic on an itinerating viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without viſiting his numerous brethren here, to ſee how religion proſpered among them: and we know that his labours have been unwearied among us, and to the applauſe of all his hearers; and, through the infinite mercy of God, his labours have ſometimes been crowned with great ſucceſs, in the converſion
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:013298_0271_0F904E3272FBF8B0"/>
of ſinners, and the edification of ſaints. And though he often returned from the pulpit very feeble after public preaching, yet his engaging ſweetneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, changed the ſuſpicions of many, into paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate love and friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>"In many things his example is worthy of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, if in any thing he exceeded, or came ſhort, his integrity, zeal for God, and love to Chriſt and his Goſpel, rendered him, in extenſive uſefulneſs, more than equal to any of his brethren. In preaching here, and through moſt parts of America, he has been in labours more abundant, approving himſelf a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in watchings, in faſtings, by pureneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by love unfeigned; as ſorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things. And God that comforted thoſe that are caſt down, has often comforted us by his coming; and not by his coming only, but by the conſolation wherewith he was comforted in us, ſo that we could rejoice the more.</p>
                  <p>"His popularity exceeded all that ever I knew; and, though the aſthma was ſometimes an obſtruction to him, his delivery and entertaining method was ſo inviting to the laſt, that it would command the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vaſt multitudes of his hearers. An appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his concern to ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and do good to the ſouls of men, drew many thouſands after him, who never embraced the doctrines he taught. He had ſomething peculiar in his manner, expreſſive of ſincerity in all he delivered, that it conſtrained the moſt abandoned to think, he believed what he ſaid was not only true, but of the laſt importance to ſouls; and by adapted texts adduced, and inſtances of the grace of God related agreeable thereto, he often ſurpriſed his moſt judicious hearers.</p>
                  <p>"His labours extended not only to New-England, and many other colonies in Britiſh America, but were eminent and more abundant in Great-Britain. Many
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:013298_0272_0F904E3335DB27B8"/>
thouſands at his Chapel and Tabernacle in London, and in other places, were witneſſes that he faithfully endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſtore the doctrines of the Reformation, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the church to its primitive glory. Some among the learned, ſome of the mighty and noble have been called, by his miniſtry, to teſtify for the Goſpel of the grace of God. The force of his reaſonings againſt corrupt principles, and the eaſy method he had in expoſing the danger of them, have aſtoniſhed the moſt that heard him, in all places where he preached. How did he lament and withſtand the modern, unſcriptural notions of religion and ſalvation, that were palmed upon the churches of every denomination! The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting change from primitive purity to fatal hereſy, together with the ſad effects of it in mere formality and open wickedneſs, would often make him cry, as the Prophet did in another caſe, "How is the gold become dim, and the moſt fine gold changed! How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud, in his anger, and caſt down from heaven to earth the beauty of Iſrael"</p>
                  <p>"It is no wonder that this man of God ſhould meet with enemies, and with great oppoſition to his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for hell trembled before him. It is no more than may be always expected of the devil, that he ſhould ſtir up his ſervants, to load the moſt eminent Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſt with calumny, and moſt impudent lies; and repreſent them as the filth and off-ſcouring of all things. All this may be, and often has been done, under a pretence of great concern for the honour of Chriſt, and the preſervation of Goſpel-order. When ſatan's kingdom totters and begins to fall, he can find men enough to cry, The Church is in danger; and that, he knows, is ſufficient with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ny, to hide his cloven foot, and make him appear as an angel of light.</p>
                  <p>"Through a variety of ſuch labours and trials, our worthy friend, and extenſively uſeful ſervant of Chriſt, Mr. Whitefield, paſſed, both in England and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: but the Lord was his ſun to guide and animate

him, and his ſhield to defend and help him unto the end: neither did he count his own life dear, ſo that he might finiſh his courſe with joy, and the miniſtry that he had received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the Goſpel of the grace of God. The laſt ſermon that he preached, though under the diſadvantage of a ſtage in the open air, was delivered with ſuch clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pathos, and eloquence, as to pleaſe and ſurprize the ſurrounding thouſands. And as he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the grace of God, many years before, and had been waiting and hoping for his laſt change, he then declared, that he hoped it was the laſt time he ſhould ever preach. Doubtleſs, he then had ſuch clear views of the bleſſedneſs of open viſion, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete fruition of God in Chriſt, that he felt the pleaſures of heaven in his raptured ſoul, which made his countenance ſhine like the unclouded ſun."</p>

<q>The memory of the juſt is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed!</q>
Poſterity will view Mr. Whitefield in many reſpects, as one of the moſt extraordinary characters of the preſent age. His zealous, inceſſant, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful labours, in Europe and America, are without a parallel.</p>
                  <p>"Devoted early to God, he took orders as ſoon as the conſtitution of the eſtabliſhed Church in England allowed. His firſt appearance in the work of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was attended with ſurpriſing ſucceſs. The larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt churches in London were not able to contain the numbers that perpetually flocked to hear his awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſes. The crowds daily increaſed. He was ſoon forced into the fields, followed by multitudes, who hung with ſilent attention upon his lips, and
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:013298_0275_0F8FFA814F164248"/>
with avidity received the word of life. The Spirit of God, in uncommon meaſure, deſcended upon the hearers. The ſecure were awakened to a ſalutary fear of divine wrath; and inquiring minds were directed to Jeſus, the only Saviour of a revolted world. The vicious were viſibly reclaimed, and thoſe who had hitherto reſted in a form of godlineſs, were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the power of a divine life. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God were refreſhed with the conſolation of the bleſſed Spirit, and rejoiced to ſee their exalted Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, going on from conquering to conquer; and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of all orders and characters, bowing to the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a crucified Saviour.</p>
                  <p>"His zeal could not be confined within the Britiſh iſlands. His ardent deſire for the welfare of immortal ſouls, conveyed him to the diſtant ſhores of America. We beheld a new ſtar ariſe in the hemiſphere of theſe weſtern churches; and its ſalutary influences were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through a great part of the Britiſh ſettlements in theſe remote regions. We heard with pleaſure, from a Divine of the Epiſcopal communion, thoſe great doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Goſpel, which our venerable anceſtors brought with them from their native country. With a ſoul elevated, above a fond attachment to forms and ceremonies, he inculcated that pure and unadulterat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion, for the preſervation of which our fathers baniſhed themſelves into an uncultivated deſert. In his repeated progreſſes through the Colonies, he was favoured with the ſame ſucceſs which attended him on the other ſide of the Atlantic. He preached from day to day in thronged aſſemblies; yet his hearers never diſcovered the leaſt wearineſs, but always followed him with increaſing ardour. When in the pulpit, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eye was fixed upon his expreſſive countenance; every ear was charmed with his melodious voice, all ſorts of perſons were captivated with the propriety and beauty of his addreſs.</p>
                  <p>"But it is not the fine ſpeaker, the accompliſhed orator, that we are to celebrate from the ſacred deſk:

theſe engaging qualities, if not ſanctified by divine grace, and conſecrated to the ſervice of heaven, are as the ſounding braſs, and the tinkling cymbal. When miſimproved, inſtead of conveying happineſs to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, they render us more illuſtriouſly miſerable.</p>
                  <p>"The gifts of nature, the acquiſitions of art, which adorned the character of Mr. Whitefield, were devoted to the honour of God, and the enlargement of the kingdom of our divine Redeemer. While he preached the Goſpel, the Holy Ghoſt was ſent down to apply it to the conſciences of the hearers; the eyes of the blind were opened, to behold the glories of the compaſſionate Saviour; the ears of the deaf were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopped, to attend to the invitations of incarnate love; the dead were animated with a divine principle of life; many in all parts of the land, were turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God. Theſe doctrines which we had been inſtructed in from our infancy by our faithful Paſtors, ſeemed to acquire new force, and were attended with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſucceſs when delivered by him. His diſcourſes were not trifling ſpeculations, but contained the moſt intereſting truths; they were not an empty play of wit, but ſolemn addreſſes to the hearts of men.</p>
                  <p>"To convince ſinners that they were by nature children of wrath; by practice, tranſgreſſors of the divine law; and in conſequence of this, expoſed to the vengeance of offended heaven; to diſplay the tranſcendent excellency of a Saviour, and perſuade awakened minds to confide in his merits and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as the only hope of a guilty world; to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon the profeſſors of the Goſpel the neceſſity, not only of an outward reformation, but an internal change, by the powerful influences of the Spirit; to lead the faithful to a zealous practice of the various duties of the Chriſtian life, that they may evidence the ſincerity of their faith, and adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour; theſe were the reigning ſubjects of his pulpit diſcourſes.</p>

                  <p>"That I am not complimenting the dead, but ſpeaking the words of truth and ſoberneſs, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded I have many witneſſes in this aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>"He was always received by multitudes with pleaſure, when he favoured theſe parts with his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but he never had a more obliging reception than in his laſt viſit. Men of the firſt diſtinction in the province, not only attended his miniſtry, but gave him the higheſt marks of their reſpect. With what faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs did he declare unto us the whole counſel of God? With what ſolemnity did he reprove us for our increaſing degeneracy? With what zeal did he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us, to remember from whence we were fallen, and repent and do our firſt works, leſt God ſhould come and remove our candleſtick out of its place?</p>
                  <p>"Animated with a Godlike deſign of promoting the temporal and ſpiritual happineſs of mankind, after the example of his Divine Maſter, he went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good. In this he perſevered with unremitting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and aſſiduity, till death removed him to that reſt which remains for the people of God. Perhaps no man, ſince the apoſtolic age, preached oftner or with greater ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>"If we view his private character, he will appear in a moſt amiable point of light.

The Orphan-houſe, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ago he erected in Georgia, and the College he was founding in that province at the time of his death, will be laſting monuments of his care, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and learning might be propagated to future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>

I have not mentioned his natural abilities, which were vaſtly above the common ſtandard. I conſider him principally in the light of a Chriſtian, and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Jeſus Chriſt, in which he ſhone with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar luſtre, as a ſtar of the firſt magnitude.</p>
                  <p>"After all, I am not repreſenting a perfect man; there are ſpots in the moſt ſhining characters upon earth. But this may be ſaid of Mr. Whitefield with juſtice, that after the moſt public appearances for above thirty years, and the moſt critical examination of his conduct, no other blemiſh could be fixed upon him, than what aroſe from the common frailties of human nature, and the peculiar circumſtances which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his firſt entrance into public life.</p>
                  <p>"The imprudencies of unexperienced youth, he frequently acknowledged from the pulpit with a frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which will for ever do honour to his memory. He took care to prevent any bad conſequences that might flow from his unguarded cenſures in the early days of his miniſtry. The longer he lived, the more he evidently increaſed in purity of doctrine, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, meekneſs, prudence, patience, and the other amiable virtues of the chriſtian life."</p>
                  <p>Another Funeral Sermon on Mr. Whitefield was preached by Mr. Ellington, at Savannah in Georgia, Nov. 11, 1770, upon Heb. xi. 26. "Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt: for he had reſpect unto the recompence

                        <p>The ſame public marks of regard were ſhewn at one of the churches in Philadelphia, of which Mr. Sprout is paſtor, which by deſire of the ſeſſion and committee, was put into mourning. Alſo, at their deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the bells of Chriſt-Church, in that city were rung muffled.</p>

                  <p>"The receiving the melancholy news of the much lamented death of a particular friend to this province, a perſon who was once Miniſter of this church, is the reaſon of this diſcourſe; and my choice of this ſubject before us, is to pay my grateful reſpect to the memory of this well-known able Miniſter of the New Teſtament, and faithful ſervant of the moſt high God, the Rev. George Whitefield; whoſe life was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, and whoſe death will be greatly regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the ſincerely religious part of mankind of all denominations, as long as there is one remaining on earth, who knew him, to recollect the fervor of ſpirit, and holy zeal with which he ſpake, when preaching the everlaſting Goſpel; and every other part of his diſintereſted conduct, conſiſtent with the miniſterial character in life and converſation. Mr. Whitefield's works praiſe him loud enough; I am not able to ſay any thing that can add greater luſtre to them. May every one that miniſters in holy things, and all who partake of their miniſtrations, have equal right to the characteriſtic in the text as he had.</p>
                  <p>"It is the ruling opinion of many, that the offence of the croſs is long ſince ceaſed, and that whatever evil treatment ſome of a ſingular turn may meet with, it is only the fruit of their own doings, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their own work, whereby they raiſe the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind againſt them for uncharitable ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſpiritual abuſe. But whoever knoweth any thing of the Goſpel, and hath experienced it to be
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:013298_0280_0F904E3A39E628A8"/>
the power of God unto ſalvation, knoweth this is the language of perſons who are unacquainted with the depravity of their nature, and through the degeneracy of their hearts, are unwilling to be diſturbed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſaying to the Miniſters of Chriſt, "Prophecy unto us ſmooth things." But the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to be ſons of thunder, and ſo to utter their voice, and conduct their lives, as to prove the nature of their work.</p>
                  <p>"Our dear and reverend friend was highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many years, in being an happy inſtrument to do this ſucceſsfully. With what a holy zeal he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, long before he was publicly ordained to the ſacred office, has been long atteſted; and no perſon has been able to contradict the teſtimony. No ſooner did he appear in the work of the ſanctuary, but he ſoon convinced his numerous auditories, that his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Lord, who had given him the commiſſion, had by his grace wrought him for the ſelf-ſame thing; and through the Holy Spirit, attending his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, made him a workman that needed not to be aſhamed. One would think his great ſucceſs in his public labours, the frequent opportunities he embraced of doing good, by the relief of people in diſtreſſing circumſtances, every occaſion he took to uſe his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the good of mankind, and the whole of his behaviour through a life of fifty-ſix years, being (ſo far as the frailty of our preſent ſtate will admit) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable and unreproveable, ſhould have exempted him from contempt and reproach. But quite the contrary, there was ſo near a reſemblance with his bleſſed Maſter, that obliged him to bear his reproach. He has ſuffered with him on earth, and he is now glorified with him in heaven. He has laboured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, and he has been as liberally reproached and maligned from every quarter. Clergy and laity have whet their tongues like a ſword againſt him, and bent their bows to ſhoot their arrows; but the Lord, amongſt all, has known and approved his righteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:013298_0281_0F904E3AB1EFDBF8"/>
Though it is well known he has had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity long ſince to enjoy epiſcopal emolument, yet, in his opinion (and it will be found he judged like a wiſe man in the end) ſinners through his inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, being turned unto the Lord, and becoming his joy, and crown of rejoicing, in the day of our Lord Jeſus, was eſteemed a greater honour than any this world could afford him. His longing deſire for the ſalvation of immortal ſouls, would not admit of his being confined within the diſtrict of any walls; though it muſt be ackowledged, he never thought of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing field-preacher, till his invidious enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him church-pulpits, with indignation of ſpirit unbecoming the loweſt and vulgar claſs of mankind, much leſs men profeſſing themſelves preachers of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Though he has, throughout the whole courſe of his miniſtry, given ſufficient proof of his inviolable attachment to our happy eſtabliſhment, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to countenance the image of Chriſt wherever he ſaw it, well knowing, that political inſtitutions in any nation whatever, ſhould not deſtroy the bleſſed union, or prevent the communion which ought to ſubſiſt throughout the Holy Catholic Church, between real and ſincere chriſtians of all denominations. Some people may retain ſuch a veneration for apoſtolic phraſes as to ſuppoſe they ought not to be applied to other perſons; ſorry am I to obſerve, that few deſerve the application of them. But of Mr. Whitefield we may ſay with the ſtricteſt truth, in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of his own countrymen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderneſs, in perils in the ſea, in perils among falſe brethren, in wearineſs and painfulneſs, he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved himſelf a Miniſter of God. All who knew and were acquainted with him, ſoon diſcovered in him every ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of good ſenſe and good manners; his company and conversation was ſo enlivening and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, and at the ſame time ſo inſtructive and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that no perſon with the leaſt degree of common
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:013298_0282_0F904E3B6B75EA60"/>
ſenſe, could behave improperly in his preſence. In him met (which do not often meet in one perſon) the finiſhed and complete Gentleman, and the real and true Chriſtian. Why then did he take pleaſure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and ſubmit to the taunts and inſults both of the vulgar and politer part of mankind? He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the recompence of reward. Though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's work will never entitle him to a reward of debt, yet the reward of grace will always excite a holy deſire to render ſomething unto the Lord: What wouldſt thou have me do? is the inceſſant inquiry of that ſoul, who by the merits of the Redeemer's death, and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his precious blood, is redeemed from ſin, and made a partaker of the inheritance incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away. Faith operates by good works: and let all the men of the world ſay to the contrary, or to put ever ſo baſe a conſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our doctrine, it will evidence itſelf by theſe good fruits. It was from theſe principles that Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field acted, and they were productive of the deſired effects; not only in alms giving, this was but a ſmall matter, when compared with the happier and more important attempt which he made for the good of mankind, at the hazard of his life, and the expence of an unblemiſhed character. How he has preached with ſhowers of ſtones, and many other inſtruments of malice and revenge about his ears, many of his ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friends can witneſs; but having the ſalvation of ſinners at heart, and a great deſire to reſcue them from the power of eternal death; he reſolved to ſpend and be ſpent for the ſervice of precious and immortal ſouls; and ſpared no pains, and refuſed no labour, ſo that he might but adminiſter to their real and eternal good: And glory be to our good God, he hath perſevered and endured to the end of his life, having reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the recompence of the reward. Surely nothing elſe could ſupport him under ſuch a weight of care, and enable him, amidſt it all, for ſo many years, to bear it with ſo much chearfulneſs. The worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:013298_0283_0F904E3C27AE0CF0"/>
of this Province do not want my atteſtation, either to the loſs the province has ſuſtained, or to the deſire he has had for its proſperity. His indefatigable endeavours to promote it, and the many fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he has night and day offered for it, ſpeak loud enough. Happy omens we would hope in favour of it, both as to its temporal increaſe, and ſpiritual proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. May God raiſe up ſome uſeful men to ſupply his place, and carry on unto perfection what he hath ſo diſintereſtedly begun, that the inſtitution he hath founded in this province may be of public utility to the lateſt poſterity! As to his death, little more can be ſaid of it, than has been communicated to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic already. He died like a hero in the field of battle; he has been fighting the battles of the Lords of Hoſts upwards of thirty years, againſt the world, ſin, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; and he hath been a conqueror, he hath fought ſucceſsfully; many, very many, converted ſinners are the trophies of his victory: but now his warfare is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, the Captain of his ſalvation hath granted him a diſcharge, he is entered into his everlaſting reſt, and is reaping the benefits of a life ſincerely dedicated to the ſervice of the once crucified, but now exalted Jeſus. He preached the day before his deceaſe: tho' his death was ſudden he was not ſurprized; the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his departure not many hours before his ſpirit took its flight to the regions of bliſs, he prayed to the God of his ſalvation, and committed his departing ſoul into his hands, as his faithful Creator and all merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Redeemer. Soon after he ſaid, I am near my end, then fell aſleep; he fainted, and died; not one ſigh, or groan; the Lord heard his prayer and granted him his requeſt, and gave him an eaſy diſmiſſion out of time into eternity: ſudden death was his deſire, and ſudden death was to him ſudden glory. He has fought the good fight; few, if any, ſince the Apoſtles, hath been more extenſively uſeful or laboured more abundantly. Thouſands I believe I may with propriety ſay, in England, Scotland, and America, have great reaſon to
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:013298_0284_0F904E3CEA7A09E8"/>
bleſs God for his miniſtrations; for he hath travelled far and wide proclaiming the glad tidings of ſalvation, through faith in a crucified Saviour. Adorable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, make thou up the loſs of him to thy church and people! Let a double portion of thy Spirit be poured out upon the remaining Miniſters! Let that holy fire which burnt ſo bright in thy departed ſervant, warm each of their hearts! And, O thou Lord of the harveſt, ſend forth more ſuch true and faithful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into thy harveſt!"</p>
                  <p>A number of Funeral Sermons were preached for him in England as well as in America. In one by Mr. D. Edwards, Nov. 11, 1770, upon Heb. xi. 4.
<q>By it he being dead, yet ſpeaketh,</q>
we have the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing character of Mr. Whitefield.</p>
                  <p n="1">"1. The ardent love he bore to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was remarkable. This divine principle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to an unwearied application to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Goſpel, and tranſported him at times, in the eyes of ſome, beyond the bounds of ſober reaſon. He was content to be a fool for Chriſt's ſake; to be deſpiſed, ſo Chriſt might be honoured; to be nothing, that Jeſus might be all in all. He had ſuch a ſenſe of the incomparable excellence of the perſon of Chriſt, of his adorable condeſcenſion in taking our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and enduring the curſes of the holy law; his compleat ſuitableneſs and ſufficiency; as the wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he could never ſay enough of him. He was ſo convinced of the happy tendency and efficacy of this principle in his own mind, that he made uſe of it, and propoſed it to others, in the room of a thouſand ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, whenever he would inculcate the moſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved obedience to the whole will of God, or ſtir up believers to a holy diligence in adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things; inſpired by this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, nothing frighted or flattered him from his duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">"2. Another pleaſing ingredient in his character, and a ſure evidence of the former, was love to the
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:013298_0285_0F904E3DC8FD6058"/>
ſouls of mankind. He rejoiced in their proſperity as one that had found great ſpoil; and with St. Paul was willing to ſpend and be ſpent in promoting their happineſs. He loved all who loved Jeſus Chriſt in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, however they might differ in ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials. He embraced all opportunities to expoſe the malignant leaven of a party, and to remove prejudices and miſapprehenſions which good people too often entertain of one another, when under the influence of a ſectarian humour.</p>
                  <p n="3">"3. His attachment to the great doctrines of the Goſpel was inflexible; having known their worth, and experienced their power in his own heart, he plainly ſaw, that though they were unacceptable to the carnal heart, yet they bore the plain impreſs of the infinite wiſdom of God. Thoſe important truths, which tend to humble the ſinner, to exalt Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote holineſs in heart and life, were his darling ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. He did not diſguiſe Goſpel-truths by ſome art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſweetening, or render them more palatable to men of corrupt minds: he ſtudied to preach the word in its purity, plainneſs and ſimplicity. The warmth of his zeal diſguſted many who make a mighty outcry about candour and charity, and are willing to extend it to every ſentiment, except the truths in which the Apoſtles gloried. It was his love to the truths of God, and the ſouls of men, that led him to expoſe thoſe who plead for the rectitude and excellency of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; deny the proper Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by faith in his righteouſneſs imputed, or the New-Birth, and the abſolute neceſſity of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghoſt. Faith and holineſs were ever united together in his ſyſtem, in oppoſition to thoſe who pretend to faith without obedience to the law of God as the rule of life. He knew errors in the great truths of the Goſpel are not indifferent, but dreadful and fatal; he knew it was not candor and charity to ſay that errors in judgment are not hurtful, but the
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:013298_0286_0F904E3E66548BB8"/>
greateſt unmercifulneſs and cruelty; therefore he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reproved ſuch ſharply.</p>
                  <p>"Although he was ſo tenacious of the foundation-truths of the Goſpel, yet none more candid in things that are not eſſential; herein he was full of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and forbearance. In things indifferent he became all things to all men <note n="*" place="bottom">As to the difference between eſſentials and non-eſſentials in religion, Mr. Edwards refers to the Rev. Mr. Newton's "Review of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, ſo far as it concerns the progreſs, decl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nſions, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Evangelical doctrine and practice."</note>.</p>
                  <p n="4">"4. To the foregoing particulars in Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's character, I may add his zeal. His chriſtian zeal was like the light of the ſun, which did warm, ſhine and cheriſh, but knew not to deſtroy; full of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous philanthropy and benevolence, his zeal made him exceeding earneſt and importunate in his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ſaints and ſinners. His zeal returned bleſſings for curſes, and prayers for ill treatment: it kindled in him a becoming indignation againſt the errors, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſins of the times: it led him to weep bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over thoſe who would not be perſuaded to fly from the wrath to come: it made him bold and intrepid in the cauſe of God, and kept him from that flatneſs and deadneſs which is too viſible in ſome good Miniſters. In theſe things he was an example to Miniſters of every denomination: and, if the limits of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would admit, I could mention many things, as to his great charity to the poor, his humility, &amp;c."</p>
                  <p>On Sunday, Nov. 18, 1770, a Sermon was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his death at the Chapel in Tottenham-Court-Road, and at the Tabernacle near Moorfields, by the Rev. Mr. John Weſley. The text was, Num. xxiii. 10.
<q>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</q>
And in the ſermon, after giving ſome particulars of his life and death, Mr. Weſley ſays,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="287" facs="unknown:013298_0287_0F8FFA83015B7538"/>"1. We are next to take ſome view of his character, A little ſketch of this was ſoon after his death, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Boſton Gazette: an extract of which is ſubjoined: 'Little can be ſaid of him, but what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friend to vital chriſtianity, who has ſat under his miniſtry, will atteſt. In his public labours he has for many years aſtoniſhed the world with his eloquence and devotion. With what divine pathos did he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the impenitent ſinner to embrace the practice of piety and virtue: filled with the ſpirit of grace, he ſpoke from the heart, and with a fervency of zeal, perhaps unequalled, ſince the days of the Apoſtles, adorned the truths he delivered with the moſt grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful charms of rhetoric and oratory. From the pulpit he was unrivalled in the command of an ever crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed auditory. Nor was he leſs agreeable and inſtructive in his private converſation: happy in a remarkable eaſe of addreſs, willing to communicate, ſtudious to edify; may the riſing generation catch a ſpark of that flame which ſhone with ſuch diſtinguiſhed luſtre in the ſpirit and practice of this faithful ſervant of the moſt high God.'</p>
                  <p n="2">"2. A more particular and equally juſt character of him, has appeared in one of the Engliſh papers <note n="*" place="bottom">London Chronicle, November 8, 1770.</note>. It may not be diſagreeable to you to add the ſubſtance of this likewiſe: 'The character of this truly pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, muſt be deeply impreſt on the heart of every friend to vital religion. In ſpite of a tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate conſtitution, he continued to the laſt day of his life, preaching with a frequency and a fervour that ſeemed to exceed the natural ſtrength of the moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt. Being called to the exerciſe of his function at an age, when moſt young men are only beginning to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify themſelves for it, he had not time to make a very conſiderable progreſs in the learned languages: but this defect was amply ſupplied by a lively and fertile genius, by fervent zeal, and by a forcible and moſt perſuaſive delivery. And though in the pulpit he
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:013298_0288_0F904E4219F12CA0"/>
often found it needful, by the terrors of the Lord, to perſuade men, he had nothing gloomy in his nature, being ſingularly chearful, as well as charitable and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted. He was as ready to relieve the bodily as the ſpiritual neceſſities of thoſe that applied to him. It ought alſo to be obſerved, that he conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced upon his audience every moral duty, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly induſtry in their ſeveral callings, and obedience to their ſuperiors. He endeavoured by the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary efforts of preaching in different places, and even in the open fields, to rouſe the lower claſs of people from the laſt degree of inattention and ignorance, to a ſenſe of religion. For this and his other labours, the name of George Whitefield will long be remembered with eſteem and veneration.'</p>
                  <p n="3">"3. That both theſe accounts are juſt and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, will readily be allowed; that is, as far as they go: but they go little farther than the outſides of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: they ſhew you the preacher, but not the man, the chriſtian, the ſaint of God. May I be permitted to add a little on this head, from a perſonal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of near forty years? Indeed, I am thoroughly ſenſible how difficult it is to ſpeak on ſo delicate a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; what prudence is required to avoid both extremes, to ſay neither too little, nor too much? Nay, I know it is impoſſible to ſpeak at all, to ſay either leſs or more, without incurring from ſome the former, from others the latter cenſure. Some will ſeriouſly think that too little is ſaid; and others, that it is too much: but without attending to this, I will ſpeak juſt what I know, before Him to whom we are all to give an account.</p>
                  <p n="4">"4. Mention has already been made of his unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled zeal, his indefatigable activity, his tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to the afflicted, and charitableneſs toward the poor. But ſhould we not likewiſe mention his deep gratitude to all whom God had uſed as inſtruments of good to him? Of whom he did not ceaſe to ſpeak in the moſt reſpectful manner, even to his dying day. Should we not mention that he had an heart ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:013298_0289_0F8FFA838A809D28"/>
of the moſt generous and the moſt tender friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? I have frequently thought, that this, of all others, was the diſtinguiſhing part of his character. How few have we known of ſo kind a temper, of ſuch large and flowing affections. Was it not principally by this, that the hearts of others were ſo ſtrangely drawn and knit to him? Can any thing but love beget love? This ſhone in his very countenance, and continually breathed in all his words, whether in public or private. Was it not this, which, quick and penetrating as lightning, flew from heart to heart? Which gave that life to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, his converſations, his letters? Ye are witneſſes.</p>
                  <p n="5">"5. But away with the vile miſconſtruction of men of corrupt minds, who know of no love, but what is earthly and ſenſual. Be it remembered, at the ſame time, that he was endued with the moſt nice and unblemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed modeſty. His office called him to converſe very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and largely with women as well as men, and thoſe of every age and condition. But his whole beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour toward them, was a practical comment on that advice of St. Paul to Timothy, "Intreat the elder wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as mothers, the younger as ſiſters, with all purity."</p>
                  <p n="6">"6. Mean time, how ſuitable to the friendlineſs of his ſpirit, was the frankneſs and openneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? Although it was as far removed from rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the one hand, as from guile and diſguiſe on the other. Was not his frankneſs at once a fruit and a proof of his courage and intrepidity? Armed with theſe, he feared not the faces of men, but uſed great plainneſs of ſpeech to perſons of every rank and condition, high and low, rich and poor; endeavouring only by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the truth, to commend himſelf to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God.</p>

<q>'Patient in bearing ill and doing well.'</q>
And this appeared in the ſteadineſs wherewith he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued whatever he undertook, for his Maſter's ſake: witneſs one inſtance for all, the Orphan-houſe in Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:013298_0290_0F904E43683E3F00"/>
which he began and perfected, in ſpite of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. Indeed, in whatever concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was pliant and flexible: in this caſe he was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to be intreated, eaſy to be either convinced or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded; but he was immoveable in the things of God, or wherever his conſcience was concerned. None could perſuade any more than affright him to vary in the leaſt point from that integrity, which was inſeparable from his whole character, and regulated all his words and actions. Herein he did

If it be enquired, what was the foundation of this integrity, of his ſincerity, courage, patience, and every other valuable and amiable quality; it is eaſy to give the anſwer. It was not the excellency of his natural temper; not the ſtrength of his underſtanding: it was not the force of education: no, nor the advice of his friends. It was no other than faith in a bleeding Lord; faith of the operation of God. It was a lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. It was the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt, which was given unto him, filling his ſoul with tender, diſintereſted love to every child of man. From this ſource aroſe that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of eloquence which frequently bore down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. From this, that aſtoniſhing force of perſuaſion, which the moſt hardened ſinners could not reſiſt. This it was, which often made his head as waters, and his eyes a fountain of tears. This it was which enabled him to pour out his ſoul in prayer, in a manner pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to himſelf, with ſuch fulneſs and eaſe united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſuch ſtrength and variety both of ſentiment and expreſſion.</p>

                     </note> On the ſame day (November 18, 1770) the Rev.
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:013298_0292_0F904E452A72E1E0"/>
Mr. Venn preached at the Counteſs of Huntingdon's Chapel at Bath, on Iſaiah viii. 18. "Behold I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for ſigns and for wonders in Iſrael; from the Lord of Hoſts, which dwelleth in Mount Zion." And of Mr. Whitefield he ſays, "Though the children of Chriſt are all for ſigns and for wonders in Iſrael, yet do they differ as one ſtar differs from another ſtar in glory. Talents, grace, and zeal, eminently dignify ſome; and draw the eyes of men upon them. In the foremoſt of this rank, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, is the Rev. Mr. Whitefield to be placed; for his doctrine was the doctrine of the Reformers, of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and of Chriſt: it was the doctrine of free grace, of God's everlaſting love. Through Jeſus he preached the forgiveneſs of ſins, and perſeverance in holy living, through his faithfulneſs and power engaged to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And the doctrine which he preached he eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorned by his zeal, and by his works. For if the greatneſs, extent, ſucceſs, and diſintereſtedneſs of a man's labour can give him diſtinction amongſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſt, we are warranted to affirm, that ſcarce any one of his Miniſters ſince the Apoſtles days, has exceeded; ſcarce any one has equalled Mr. Whitefield.</p>
                  <p>"What a ſign and wonder was this man of God in the greatneſs of his labours! One cannot but ſtand amazed that his mortal frame could for the ſpace of near thirty years, without interruption, ſuſtain the weight of them. For what is ſo trying to the human frame, in youth eſpecially, as long-continued, frequent and violent ſtraining of the lungs? Who, that knows their ſtructure, would think it poſſible, that a perſon, little above the age of manhood, ſhould ſpeak in the compaſs of a ſingle week (and that for years) in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, forty hours, and in very many weeks, ſixty, and that to thouſands; and after his labour, inſtead of taking any reſt, ſhould be offering up prayers, interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with hymns and ſpiritual ſongs, as his manner was in every houſe to which he was invited. The hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Church of Chriſt affords but very few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:013298_0293_0F904E45E9A06AF8"/>
of men thus inceſſantly employing their whole ſtrength, and as it were, every breath they drew, in the buſineſs of their ſacred function. And the truth is, that, in point of labour, this extraordinary ſervant of God did as much in a few weeks, as moſt of thoſe who exert themſelves are able to do in the ſpace of a year. Thus labouring not by fits and ſtarts, but with conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and perſeverance, and ardour unabated, his mortal frame, about nine years ſince, began to ſink under the weight of ſo much work. If, with the length and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Mr. Whitefield's preaching, we conſider the intenſeneſs of voice and ſpirit with which he ſpoke, the greatneſs of his labours will appear perfectly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing: he knew not how to ſpeak with leſs zeal, in his whole manner, than became the ſubjects of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The total ruin of the human race by the fall; the complete recovery of believers in Chriſt, his dying love, and the unſearchable riches of his grace, to be known experimentally in this life, though fully to be diſplayed in the next: and the infatuation of ſinners, led captive by their luſts down to the chambers of death: theſe grand truths, of more weight than words can paint, fired his whole ſoul; they tranſported him as much as earthly ſpirits are tranſported into vehemence, when they contend perſonally for their own property; he cried out therefore, as his dear Lord was wont to do, with a voice audible to an amazing diſtance: hence in a thouſand inſtances, where the cauſe of God more coolly pleaded, would have been neglected, he gained it a hearing, and carried the day: for the unuſual ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of the ſpeaker rouſed the moſt ſtupid and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargic: it compelled them to feel; the matter muſt be momentous indeed, which the ſpeaker was urging as a man would plead for his own life. Early and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his body ſuffered for this very violent exertion of his ſtrength: early and often his inſide has bled a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity, and cried out, ſpare thyſelf: but, prodigal of life, in the beſt of cauſes, he would give himſelf no reſt; expecting very ſoon to finiſh his courſe,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:013298_0294_0F904E46A83D54A0"/>
and infinitely deſirous to ſave the ſouls condemned to die; he periſhed. Though this may be blamed as an exceſs, it was an exceſs far above the reach of a ſelfiſh mind, or an ordinary faith.</p>
                  <p>"Equal to the greatneſs and intenſeneſs of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, was their extent. The abilities and grace of moſt teachers, have full employ in a ſmall diſtrict, nor have common men talents for more. But when God lights up in the breaſt, an apoſtolic zeal for his own glory, an apoſtolic love for the ſouls of men, it ſeems reaſonable to conclude, ſuch an inſtrument is deſigned for the moſt extenſive uſefulneſs.</p>
                  <p>"Accordingly the compaſs of Mr. Whitefield's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, exceeds any thing that others can pretend to. Not only in the ſouth, the weſt, and north of England, did he lift up his voice, ſaying, "Repent, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is come:" but in Wales, in Scotland, in Ireland, and America, from Georgia to Boſton, vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in each country were witneſſes of his zeal for the ſalvation of ſouls.</p>
                  <p>"And to crown all, he was abundantly ſucceſsful in his vaſt labours, and diſintereſted too. The ſeals to his miniſtry, from firſt to laſt, I am perſuaded, are more than would be credited, could the number be fixed. This is certain, his amazing popularity was only from his uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; for he no ſooner opened his mouth as a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than God commanded an extraordinary bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his word. The people were ſo deeply impreſſed with the ſenſe of divine things from what he delivered, that, to his own great ſurprize they followed him from church to church, until the largeſt churches in London could no longer contain a fourth part of the crowds, which preſſed to hear the word of God from his lips.</p>
                  <p>"Should any one ſay, few in compariſon, beſides the low, ignorant, common people were his followers; I would anſwer, the ſouls of the poor and ignorant, are to the full as precious as thoſe of the rich and learned: and the mob have ſhown the juſteſt diſcernment, and have received the truth; whilſt men of wealth, and
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:013298_0295_0F904E47AE26C608"/>
learning, and education, have trampled it under their feet. Witneſs the chief Scribes and Phariſees, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected both the Baptiſt and the Saviour, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people juſtified God, and gave them both the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being ſent from him. Indeed in every age, we ſee the Scripture fulfilled, not many rich, not many mighty, not many wiſe men after the fleſh are called; but God hath choſen the poor, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>"However, when the fierceneſs of prejudice was worn off, numbers, who at firſt deſpiſed him, taught to do ſo by groſs ſlanders, were happy under his miniſtry. And this honour was put upon him even to the laſt. He had a much larger audience ſtatedly to hear him, than any man in the whole kingdom, perhaps in all Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>"And that this vaſt multitude of people were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, juſt as the primitive churches of Chriſt, by the truth they heard, and the ſpiritual benefit they received under his word, is evident beyond a reaſonable doubt. For if you trace his progreſs through the various cities and countries where he preached the Goſpel, you will find as the caſe was with St. Paul, ſo it was with this ſervant of Chriſt. Many were turned by him from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, from the power of ſatan unto God, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remiſſion of their ſins, and an inheritance among thoſe that are ſanctified, through faith in Chriſt. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the effects of his labours, from the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per judges, thoſe who live in the religious world, and they will aver, that many within their own knowledge, ſmall as that circle muſt be, confeſs they owe their own ſelves to this faithful witneſs for his Lord. Add to this, that the letters he received of grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from perſons of all ages and conditions in life, for the ſpiritual bleſſings he had conveyed to them, would fill whole volumes. Nay, it is a well-known fact, that the converſion of mens' ſouls has been the fruit of a ſingle ſermon from his lips; ſo eminently was he made of God, a fiſher of men. But he was not more ſucceſsful
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:013298_0296_0F904E483AA14ED0"/>
than he was diſintereſted in his labours; for though a vaſt multitude, (which muſt ever be the caſe with thoſe whom God is pleaſed remarkably to own) followed him, he had ſtill no ambition to ſtand as the head of a party. His great object was to exalt Chriſt crucified; and when his hearers were brought to the knowledge of ſalvation, his point was gained, and his ſoul was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Hence neither in his ſermons, nor more private exhortations, did he caſt diſparaging reflections upon other preachers of Chriſt. No baſe ſuggeſtion dropt from his mouth, as if to differ from him muſt be owing to blindneſs in the judgment, or coldneſs of the heart for the intereſts of holineſs. Truly cordial and catholic in his love for all who appeared to love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, he never deſired to ſee his congregation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by thoſe who had evangelical paſtors of their own. Further, in proof of his diſintereſtedneſs, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he gained by his labours. The ſcourge of the tongue was let looſe upon him, and his name was load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fouleſt calumnies; he was often in tumults, and more than once in danger of his life, by the rage of the people; he wore himſelf away in the ſervice of ſouls; and when he died, he died quite exhauſted by much ſpeaking; but in his death, he received an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate anſwer to his own prayer, 'That if it were conſiſtent with the Divine Will, he might finiſh that day his Maſter's work.'</p>
                  <p>"For ſuch a life, and ſuch a death, (though in tears under our great loſs) we muſt yet thank God. And though we are allowed to ſorrow, becauſe we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee or hear him again, we muſt rejoice that milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have heard him ſo long, ſo often, and to ſuch good effect; that out of this maſs of people, multitudes are gone before him, we doubt not, to hail his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world of glory; and that in every period of life, from childhood to hoary age, many of his children in the Lord are ſtill to follow; all to be his crown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing: the only effectual, everlaſting confutation of his adverſaries; that he ran not in vain, nor laboured in vain."</p>

                     <pb n="297" facs="unknown:013298_0297_0F904E4987A7A7E0"/>There were many other ſermons preached on occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr. Whitefield's death, in which the deſcriptions of his character are the ſame in ſubſtance, with thoſe already given <note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>In a note upon the laſt paragraph, the author ſays, "Whoever is acquainted with Mr. Whitefield's life, well knows that I have not exaggerated matters. For in a viſit to Ireland, he was ſolicited by the Primate of that kingdom, to accept of ſome conſiderable church preferment; but declined the offer, becauſe he looked upon himſelf as called to an itinerant life; and what makes this circumſtance the more remarkable, is, that Mr. Whitefield, at that time, had no proſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as to temporals."</p>

quite ſuitable to his extraordinary manner of life. But it was ſtill more ſingular, to have a ſermon preached upon his perſonal and miniſterial character, in his own lifetime, and when he was but twenty-ſix years of age. This ſermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Joſiah Smith of Charleſtown, South-Carolina, and was publiſhed at Boſton, with a recommendatory preface by the Rev. Dr. Colm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n and Mr. Cooper, in the year 1740. Of this it is worth while to make a ſhort extract, after all that has been ſaid; that by comparing it with the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſermons, the reader may ſee how conſiſtent and uniform Mr. Whitefield's conduct was, from that early period of his miniſtry, till his death.</p>
                  <p>After ſpeaking of his doctrine concerning Original Sin—Juſtification by faith alone—Regeneration—The inward feelings of the Spirit—Mr. Smith adds, "As to the manner of his preaching—With what a flow of words did he ſpeak to us, upon the great concern of our ſouls! In what a flaming light did he ſet out eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity before us! How earneſtly did he preſs Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us! How cloſe, ſtrong, and pungent were his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the conſcience; mingling light and heat; pointing the arrows of the Almighty at the heart of ſinners, while he poured in the balm on the wounds of the contrite! How bold and courageous did he look? He was no flatterer. He taught the way of God in truth, and regarded not the perſons of men. The politeſt and moſt modiſh of our vices he ſtruck at, the moſt faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able entertainments; regardleſs of every ones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but His in whoſe name he ſpake.</p>
                  <p>"As to his perſonal character, while he preaches up faith alone in our juſtification before God, he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to maintain good works. Theſe things the grace of God teaches us. And how much of this doctrine has he tranſcribed into his life! How rich has he been in all good works! What an eminent pattern of piety towards God! How holy and unblameable in all converſation and godlineſs! How ſeaſoned, how much to the uſe of edifying all his diſcourſes! How naturally does he turn

them to religion? How much is he given to devotion himſelf, and how does he labour to excite it in others!</p>
                  <p>"He affects no party in religion, nor ſets himſelf at the head of any. He is not bigotted to the leſſer rites and forms of religion, while zealous enough in all its eſſentials. He profeſſes love to good men of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination. His heart ſeems ſet upon doing good. He goes about his great Maſter's work with diligence and application, and with ſuch chearfulneſs as would make one in love with a life of religion. He is proof againſt reproach and invective. When he is reviled, he revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h not again; but prays heartily for all his enemies.</p>
                  <p>"He renders to all their due. While zealous for the things of God, is a friend to Caeſar. And for charity, as it conſiſts in compaſſion and acts of beneficence, we have few men like minded. Had he been under any cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal influence of a mercenary temper; had he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected monies for himſelf in his journeys, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of doing it for the poor, as he was ſlanderouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, he had certainly a fair opportunity to enrich himſelf. But we have ſeen; and plain fact cannot be denied; that he caſts all into the Treaſury, and ſerves the tables of the poor with it. Strolling and vagabond orphans, without father, and without mother, without purſe, and without friend, he ſeeks out, picks up, and adopts into his family. He is now building accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and laying the beſt foundation for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintenance." Thus far Mr. J. Smith, who had the pleaſure of ſeeing this character of his friend verified in the whole of his future life; and who, in his Funeral Sermon upon him at Charleſtown, Oct. 28, 1770, has this remarkable expreſſion, concerning a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit he made to Mr. Whitefield at his Orphan-houſe: "It was a ſcene that made me think I was in heaven."</p>
                  <p>By a paper, written with Mr. Whitefield's own hand, of the contents of his imperfect manuſcript, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quoted in the above account of his life, it appears, that if he had lived to finiſh it, the concluſion would have been, "Reflections upon the whole, containing
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:013298_0301_0F8FFA365052AA48"/>
arguments to prove the divinity of the work; and anſwers to objections againſt Fleid-preaching—Lay-preaching—Irregularities—And the blemiſhes that have attended it."</p>
                  <p>As he did not live to execute this deſign, the reader is referred to what has been publiſhed upon the ſubject by the Rev. Meſſ. Jonathan Edwards, Hobby, Shurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, &amp;c. The Rev. Mr. Newton preached a ſermon at Olney, Nov. 11, 1770, on John v. 35.

In which he ſpeaks of Mr. Whitefield; an extract of which follows: "Some Miniſters are burning and ſhining lights in a peculiar and eminent degree. Such a one, I doubt not, was the ſervant of God whoſe death we now lament. I have had ſome opportunities of looking over the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Church in paſt ages, and I am not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſay, that I have not read or heard of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſince the Apoſtle's days, of whom it may more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically be ſaid, "He was a burning and a ſhining light," than the late Mr. Whitefield, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the warmth of his zeal, the greatneſs of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial talents, or the extenſive uſefulneſs with which the Lord honoured him. I do not mean to praiſe the man, but the Lord who furniſhed him, and made him what he was. He was raiſed up to ſhine in a dark place. The ſtate of religion, when he firſt appeared in public, was very low, in our eſtabliſhed church. I ſpeak the truth, though to ſome it may be an offenſive truth. The doctrines of Grace, were ſeldom heard from the pulpit, and the life and power of godlineſs were little known. Many of the moſt ſpiritual among the Diſſenters, were mourning under the ſenſe of a great ſpreading declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on their ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what a change has taken place throughout the land within a little more than thirty years, that is, ſince the time when the firſt ſet of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Miniſters came from Oxford! and how much of this change has been owing to God's bleſſing on Mr. Whitefield's labours, is well known to many who have lived through this period; and can hardly be denied
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:013298_0302_0F8FFA370C0E26B0"/>
by thoſe who are leaſt willing to allow it. Firſt, He was a burning light. He had an ardent zeal for God, an enflamed deſire for the ſalvation of ſinners. So that no labours could weary him, no difficulties or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſcourage him, hardly any limits could confine him; not content with the bounds of a county, or a kingdom, this meſſenger of good tidings preached the everlaſting Goſpel in almoſt every conſiderable place in England, Scotland and Ireland, and throughout the Britiſh empire in America, which is an extent of more than a thouſand miles. Moſt of theſe places he viſited again and again; nor did he confine his attention to places of note, but in the former part of his miniſtry, was ready to preach to few, as well as to many, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a door was opened; though in the latter part of his life, his frequent illneſs, and the neceſſity of his more immediate charge, confined him more at home. In ſome of his moſt early excurſions, the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God led him here, and many, I truſt, were made willing to rejoice in his light, and have reaſon to bleſs God, that ever they ſaw and heard him. 2dly, He was a ſhining light: his zeal was not like wild-fire, but directed by ſound principles, and a ſound judgment. In this part of his character, I would obſerve, 1ſt, Tho' he was very young when he came out, the Lord ſoon gave him a very clear view of the Goſpel. In the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he publiſhed ſoon after his firſt appearance, there is the ſame evangelical ſtrain obſerveable, as in thoſe which he preached in his advanced years. Time and obſervation, what he felt, and what he ſaw, enlarged his experience, and gave his preaching an increaſing ripeneſs and ſavour, as he grew older in the work; but from firſt to laſt he preached the ſame Goſpel, and was determined to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified. 2dly, His ſteadineſs and perſeverance in the truth was the more remarkable, conſidering the difficulties and ſnares he was ſometimes beſet with. But the Lord kept him ſteady, ſo that neither the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:013298_0303_0F904DBF39178638"/>
nor friendſhip, nor importunity of thoſe he dearly loved, were capable of moving him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, The Lord gave him a manner of preaching, which was peculiarly his own. He copied from none, and I never met any one who could imitate him with ſucceſs. They who attempted generally made themſelves diſagreeble. His familiar addreſs, the power of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his marvellous talent in fixing the attention even of the moſt careleſs, I need not deſcribe to thoſe who have heard him, and to thoſe who have not, the attempt would be vain. Other Miniſters could, perhaps, preach the Goſpel as clearly, and in general ſay the ſame things; but, I believe, no man living could ſay them in his way. Here I always thought him unequalled, and I hardly expect to ſee his equal while I live.</p>
                  <p n="4">"4th, But that which finiſhed his character as a ſhining light, and is now his crown of rejoicing, was the ſingular ſucceſs which the Lord was pleaſed to give him in winning ſouls; what numbers entered the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory before him, and what numbers are now lamenting his loſs, who were awakened by his miniſtry. It ſeemed as if he never preached in vain. Perhaps there is hardly a place, in all the extenſive compaſs of his labours, where ſome may not yet be found who thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge him as their ſpiritual father. Nor was he an awakening preacher only wherever he came; if he preached but a ſingle diſcourſe, he uſually brought a ſeaſon of refreſhment and revival with him, to thoſe who had already received the truth. Great as his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and perſonal uſefulneſs was, his occaſional uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs (if I may ſo call it) was perhaps much greater. Many have cauſe to be thankful for him, who never ſaw or heard him. I have already obſerved, that there was a ſomething peculiar in his manner of preaching, in which no perſon of ſound judgment would venture to imitate him. But notwithſtanding this, he was, in other reſpects, a ſignal and happy pattern and model <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> preachers. He introduced a way of cloſe and lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the conſcience, for which I believe many
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:013298_0304_0F8FFA37C9B4F470"/>
of the moſt admired and eminent preachers now living will not be aſhamed, or unwilling to acknowledge themſelves his debtors."</p>
                  <p>There was alſo a Sermon preached on the occaſion by the Rev. Mr. Samuel Brewer, of Stepney, London, which his modeſty would not permit him to print. And many others of the Miniſters, both of the Church, and among the Diſſenters in England, in their ſermons and prayers upon the news of Mr. Whitefield's death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the loſs of ſo great a man, and ſo faithful and ſucceſsful a ſervant of Chriſt; among theſe were the Rev. Mr. Romaine, Mr. Madan, Dr. Gibbons, and Dr. Trotter.</p>
                  <p>On the 6th of February 1771, the executors having received the probat of Mr. Whitefield's Will, Mr. Keen, who was perfectly acquainted with every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of his temporal affairs, immediately publiſhed it, with the following preamble:</p>
                  <p>As we make no doubt the numerous friends of the late Rev. Mr. George Whitefield will be glad of an opportunity of ſeeing a genuine copy of his laſt Will and Teſtament; his Executors have favoured us with a copy of the ſame, tranſmitted to them from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan-houſe in Georgia, and which they have proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. And as it was Mr. Whitefield's conſtant declaration he never meant to raiſe either a purſe or a party, it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that almoſt the whole money he died poſſeſſed of, came to him within two or three years of his death in the following manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Mrs. Thomſon of Tower-Hill, bequeathed him L. 500. By the death of his wife, including a bond of L. 300 he got L. 700. Mr. Whitmore bequeathed him L. 100 and Mr. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der L. 100; and it is highly probable, that had he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reach Georgia from his late northern tour, he would have much leſſened the above ſums, by diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them in the ſame noble and diſintereſted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that all the public or private ſums he has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, have been.</p>

To all my other chriſtian benefactors, and more intimate acquaintance, I leave my moſt hearty thanks and bleſſing, aſſuring them that I am more and more convinced of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reality, and infinite importance of the grand Goſpel truths which I have from time to time deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and am ſo far from repenting my delivering them in an itinerant way, that had I ſtrength equal to my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would preach them from pole to pole, not only becauſe I have found them to be the power of God to the ſalvation of my own ſoul, but becauſe I am as much aſſured that the Great Head of the Church hath called me by his word, providence and ſpirit, to act in this way, as that the ſun ſhines at noon day. As for my enemies, and misjudging, miſtaken friends, I moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heartily forgive them, and can only add, that the laſt tremendous day will ſoon diſcover what I have been, what I am, and what I ſhall be, when time itſelf ſhall be no more; and therefore, from my inmoſt ſoul, I cloſe all, by crying, Come, Lord Jeſus, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; even ſo Lord Jeſus, Amen and Amen.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the manner in which Mr. Whitefield's Tabernacle and Chapel are at preſent ſupplied, the compiler has received the following information.:</p>
                  <p>HAVING by his Will left both of his places of worſhip, his houſes, library, and all things appertaining thereto, to two of his executors in ſurvivorſhip, they have been enabled, through the abundant goodneſs of God, to carry on the work in the ſame manner as in Mr. Whitefield's life-time, without the leaſt diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of largeneſs of the congregations, or the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible power of God attending the miniſtry ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. And as neither of them are Miniſters, but engaged in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive buſineſs, it appears the more wonderful, and
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:013298_0311_0F904DC80934CFC0"/>
ſhews the work to be begun and carried on by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God alone; and it is their earneſt prayer and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that it may be tranſmitted down, and faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and upright perſons raiſed to carry it on when their heads are laid in the duſt. Two of his fellow-labourers were taken off by death, whilſt he was laſt abroad, viz. the Rev. Mr. Howel Davie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The preſent Miniſters are chiefly theſe, the Rev. Mr. Kinſman of Plymouth, the Rev. Mr. Edwards of Leeds, the Rev. Mr. Knight of Hallifax, and the Rev. Mr. Aſhburner, of Pool in Dortſetſhire; theſe viſit London once, and if wrote for, twice a year. The conſtant ones upon the ſpot are, Mr. Joſs and Mr. Brookſbanks. The Rev. Mr. De Courcy, and the Rev. Mr. Piercy, and other Clergymen, have often aſſiſted. Beſides theſe, the proprietors have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the occaſional labours of Mr. Rowland Hill, and Mr. Heath of Plymouth: alſo of many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Clergymen and Diſſenting Miniſters from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who eſteemed it their privilege to preach to very large, ſerious, and attentive congregations, whoſe hearts have been filled with thankfulneſs, and at the ſame time engaged in prayer for every ſuch Miniſter; and an unuſual bleſſing has commonly attended both ſowers and reapers; and it is the earneſt deſire of the proprietors, that the pleaſure of the Lord may thus proſper in their hands. They purpoſe, through the bleſſing of God, to let the pulpits be open to every diſintereſted Miniſter that may occaſionally come to town, of good moral character, ſound in the faith, of moderate Calviniſtical principles, without diſtinction of parties or denominations, whoſe talents are ſuitable to preach with life and power to large congregations. And hope for the concurrence of all well-wiſhers to the proſperity of Zion.</p>
