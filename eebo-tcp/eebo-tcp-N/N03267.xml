            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A <hi>ſolemn Caution</hi> from the holy Apoſtle to all Chriſtians, <hi>not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every, Spirit, but to try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</hi> That is, not preſently to believe every Pretender to divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations to be under the Conduct of the Spirit of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003975_0004_10034E0B01C8C1B0"/>Truth, becauſe he himſelf had Confidence enough to affirm it: but to examine firſt what Right ſuch Perſons could make out to ſuch Pretences; and not to receive the Dictates of any Man as divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whatever ſpecious Pretences he might make, without ſufficient Reaſon to believe him <hi>a Teacher ſent from God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. We have a very <hi>good Reaſon for the Caution</hi> given, <hi>viz. Becauſe many falſe Prophets were gone out into the World:</hi> becauſe many who ſet themſelves up for Teachers, and delivered the <hi>Devices of their own Hearts,</hi> or the <hi>Suggeſtions of the wicked one,</hi> yet pretended that they ſpake only <hi>as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>From the Words we may obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That during the Lives of the Apoſtles themſelves there were many falſe Pretenders to divine Revelation.</hi> Many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World; <hi>deceitful Workers, transforming themſelves into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 11.13.</note>. This was indeed a notable Inſtance of the <hi>ſtrong Deluſion</hi> to which Mankind is liable; or elſe of the Corruption and <hi>deſperate Wickedneſs of the Heart of Man:</hi> that any ſhould dare to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon ſo vile an Enterprize, while the Apoſtles themſelves were living, who had the Gift of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spirits;</hi> who had <hi>Authority</hi> eno' with all <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> to expoſe ſuch Impoſtors; and who had ſo much <hi>Power with God,</hi> as ſometimes to inflict Diſeaſes, and even Death itſelf, <hi>on the Children of the Divel.</hi> But yet it was <hi>no marvel</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 11.14, 15.</note>) <hi>for Satan himſelt is transformed into an Angel of Light. Therefore it is no great Thing if his Miniſters alſo be transformed as the Miniſters of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003975_0005_10034E10A2FE38B0"/>whoſe End ſhall be according to their Works.</hi> It would be beſide my preſent Deſign, to enquire who theſe falſe Prophets were; or what falſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines or pernicious Practices they introduced. 'Tis enough that my Text expreſly tells us, there were ſuch; and that the Number of them was not ſmall.</item>
                  <item>2 We may obſerve, <hi>that there were ſufficient Means for the People of God to know that theſe falſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to divine Revelations were not of God.</hi> For it would not have been a ſerious, wholſome Charge, but a cruel Mockery in the Apoſtle, to bid them <hi>try the Spirits, whether they were of God</hi> or not; if there had been no ſufficient Means or Rules for them to <hi>diſcern the Spirit of Truth from the Spirit of Error</hi> by. The Apoſtle gives them a Rule in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe, peculiarly ſuited to diſcover the falſe Prophets of his own Time: and there is enough in the holy Scriptures, to enable us to detect ſuch Impoſtors in all Ages; whatever <hi>ſtrong Deluſions</hi> they may be under themſelves, or whatever <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs</hi> they may think to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal themſelves under from others.</item>
                  <item>3. We may obſerve, <hi>That it was a Thing of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequence, even for thoſe who believed the divine Authority of the Doctrines taught by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to think other Teachers alſo to be of God, who were not ſo.</hi> I ſhall have occaſion in the Progreſs of this Diſcourſe, to give ſome Inſtances of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences of ſuch a Miſtake; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall forbear mentioning any at preſent. It will ſufficiently juſtify the making ſuch an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Text, only to ſay, that the Apoſtle wrote this Epiſtle to ſuch as would never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, if they had not thought the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines taught by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles to be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003975_0006_10034E1467416870"/>of divine Authority; and yet, that the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them to be in danger from falſe Pretenders to divine Revelation: otherwiſe the Warning in my Text would have been needleſs, the Apoſtle's Rule of Tryal in the following verſe of no Signiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, and the People of God diſquieted and alarmed for nothing. And therefore we way obſerve,</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That it is the Duty and Intereſt even of thoſe who believe the divine Authority of the Doctrines taught by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to examine the Claims of any other Pretenders to divine Revelation; and not to yeild to their Authority, unleſs there appears good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe it divine.</hi> That it is their <hi>Duty</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the expreſs Charge of the Apoſtle, to <hi>try the Spirits whether they were of God.</hi> And, that it is their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> is no leſs evident from the dangerous Conſequences of the neglect of it; which muſt be ſuppoſed to render ſuch a Charge neceſſary.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And now to apply theſe Obſervations to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>If there were many falſe Pretenders to divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations even <hi>in the Apoſtles days,</hi> it will be no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at all, if there be ſuch <hi>in ours:</hi> but we may well expect it now, when there is no body qualified like the Apoſtles to expoſe and explode ſuch vain or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Pretences.</p>
            <p>And if it was the <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Chriſtians <hi>then,</hi> while the extraordinary Gifts of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit were very frequent, not to ſubmit themſelves to the Authority of any Pretender to divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before they had tried and examin'd, whether he <hi>were of God</hi> or no; it muſt much more concern <hi>us,</hi> to take heed to our ſelves, and be ſuſpicious of all Pretenders <hi>now,</hi> when the extraordinary Gifts of the holy Spirit are generally ſuppoſed to have ceas'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003975_0007_10034E1E75D36F28"/>
And if <hi>while the Canon of Scripture was yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> the People of God did not want ſufficient <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Error;</hi> we may very well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves <hi>thoroughly furniſhed unto this Work now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then we have Reaſon enough to expect Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to divine Revelation and Authority in our days. I ſhall enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Whether there really are any ſuch?</hi> And if there be; ſince we are ſo much concerned and have ſuch good Encouragement to endeavour to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> I ſhall examine,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Whether they are of God or no?</hi> Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to enquire, <hi>Whether there are any Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to divine Authority and Revelation in our Days!</hi> Now under this Inquiry I ſhall have nothing to do with ſuch as teach any Religions manifeſtly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Religion taught us in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament. For ſince I have long ago proved them to have been given by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God; and ſince the God of Truth cannot deny or contradict himſelf; it is very plain that no Religion can be of God, which is evidently contrary to <hi>that</hi> taught us in the Scriptures. And therefore I have nothing to do under this Queſtion, with the Religions of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> or <hi>Heathen.</hi> Or if I had, they have both been formerly conſidered and diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Again, ſince I have long ago proved the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> as well as of the <hi>Old;</hi> I have nothing to do with the <hi>Jews</hi> neither, whom we don't charge with falſe Pretences to divine Revelation, but only with a falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the True Oracles of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003975_0008_10034E20135CF860"/>
All that I have to do therefore under this Head, is only to enquire, <hi>Whether among thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, and admit that the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament were given by Inſpiration of God, there are any that pretend to divine Revelations themſelves; or that ſet up any thing elſe as of equal Authority with the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here the Anſwer is obvious, <hi>That among thoſe Chriſtians that call themſelves Proteſtants there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sect</hi> (and perhaps ſome particular Perſons who do not denominate themſelves from any Sect) <hi>that pretend to divine Revelations:</hi> And <hi>that the Romaniſts generally arrogate a Spirit of Infallibility to their own Church; and pretend to have preſerved ſundry Traditions of the ſame Original and Authority with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Now ſince theſe Pretenſions are not only known and acknowledged, but earneſtly contended for, by the Parties or Perſons charged with them, there is no need of inſiſting here.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It only remains, that according to the Caution given in my Text, <hi>we belive not theſe Spirits till we have tried whether they are of God;</hi> which was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thing propoſed.</p>
            <p>But an Examination of them all would lead me into a larger Field than I purpoſe to enter at this Time.</p>
            <p>My only Buſineſs will be with <hi>thoſe Sects or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who come under the General but</hi> (as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now uſed) <hi>moſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

2. <hi>To try the Spirits of theſe modern Pretenders to divine Revelations, by ſuch Rules as the Word of God ſuggeſts to us.</hi> By which, I think, it will appear, that they muſt be numbred with the Prophets againſt whom we are cautioned in my Text.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſhow, <hi>That it is exceeding unlikely, that God ſhould diſcover Religious Truths and Duties to any of his Children in our days by immediate Revelation:</hi> And that becauſe it is <hi>altogether needleſs, and would be of no uſe,</hi> but <hi>very dangerous</hi> if he ſhould.</p>
            <p>I am not going here to diſpute, whether God is ever pleaſed in theſe days upon ſpecial occaſions, to impreſs the Spirits of any of his Servants with ſtrong Apprehenſions of ſome Events, which it may be of great Importance to themſelves or others, to have ſome previous Intimations of; but only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is pleaſed to diſcover religious Truths and Duties to any of them by immediate Revelation: which I ſuppoſe he is not.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe it is altogether needleſs that he ſhould.</hi> For a Diſcovery of religious Truths and Duties by immediate Revelation muſt be either the <hi>ſame</hi> with the Diſcovery contained in the holy Scriptures, or <hi>another,</hi> But <hi>another</hi> Diſcovery of religious Truths and Duties, than that contained in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, cannot be by divine Revelation; unleſs God could contradict himſelf. For I have formerly proved, that the Sciptures of the New Teſtament give us a full and faithful Account of the Truths and Duties taught by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſolemnly <hi>curſes him</hi> that ſhould preſume <hi>to preach any other Goſpel than that of Chriſt,</hi> even tho' he were <hi>an Angel from Heaven.</hi> Gal. 1.7, 8. From whence it plainly follows, that if a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of religious Truths and Duties ſhould now be made to any Man by immediate divine Revelation,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003975_0010_10034E31B8B5A3A0"/>it muſt be the <hi>ſome,</hi> at leaſt in Subſtance with the Diſcovery already contained in the Scriptures. And then what Neceſſity can there be of it? For why may not all the Ends of divine Revelation be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by a Diſcovery of the Nature and Will of God committed to Writing, and ſufficiently atteſted to be of divine Original; as well as by a new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation? It would be very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pretend, that a Man cannot underſtand Truth and Duty by an external written Revelation, if it be but <hi>full</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> enough, as thoroughly as by an inward immediate one. Now that the Revelation contained in the Scriptures is ſo <hi>full</hi> as to teach every thing which God requires us to <hi>believe</hi> or to <hi>do,</hi> in order to obtain eternal Life; and ſo <hi>clear</hi> that, if we would but take the ſame prudent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that are neceſſary to underſtand almoſt any other Book or Matter of Importance, we need not be at any Loſs about it; is manifeſt from what the Apoſtle tells us, 2 Tim. 3 15, 17. that <hi>the holy Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and that <hi>the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to all good works</hi> by them. So that there can be no Pretence of a Neceſſity of new immediate Revelations to give Men a better Underſtanding of the important Truths and Duties of our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>Nay, in this Reſpect a <hi>ſtanding written Revelation</hi> hath the Advantage of <hi>an inward immediate one,</hi> which is but a <hi>tranſient thing;</hi> and ſo both the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the <hi>true Import</hi> of it may in a great meaſure wear out of Memory by length of Time: Whereas inſpired Writings are ſtanding Monuments of the Will of God, to which we may have Recourſe upon every Doubt or Failure of Memory; and we are
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003975_0011_10034E3345A242C0"/>furniſhed with abundant Helps to underſtand the true Deſign and Import of them, of which we muſt be deſtitute in Caſe of any Obſcurity in a tranſient Revelation. Now if a Man may be more certain to have an abiding thorough Knowledge of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from a ſtanding written Revelation, than from an immediate tranſient one, then it appears in a ſtronger Light ſtill, that there can be no Pretence of need of immediate Revelations to fill us with the Knowledge of our Duty; ſince we are much better provided for already in that Regard, by a perfect ſtanding Revelation of the Will of God conveyed to us in the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> But perhaps it will be objected here, That the Scriptures ſpeak much of the natural Darkneſs and Blindneſs of our Minds, and of their Inability to diſcern the Things of the Spirit of God, until God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, ſhine into our Hearts to give the Light of the Knowledge of them. And what can this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend leſs than a Neceſſity of immediate Revelati. ons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To which I anſwer; That tho' it be a great Truth, that the Underſtanding of Man in his natural State is ſo much blinded, that without the gracious Influences of God's Holy Spirit it will never apprehend divine Truths, in ſuch a manner as that the Heart ſhall be ſuitably affected and the Life go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Apprehenſion of them; yet <hi>that</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Operation of God upon Man, which is now neceſſary to remove the natural Blindneſs of his Under ſtanding, and make him capable of diſcerning divine Truths aright, is not an immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine Truths to his Underſtanding; but only a gracious Removal of thoſe Impediments
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003975_0012_10034E3A30A02A78"/>which would not have ſuffered his Underſtanding to perceive thoſe Truths in a ſpiritual manner, whatever way they might be revealed to him in, whether mediately by the written Word of God, or immediately by inward Revelation. So that this operation of the Spirit of God upon Man, which is now neceſſary in order to a right underſtanding of divine Truths, does not at all affect <hi>the manner</hi> of the Revelation of thoſe Truths; but it only affects <hi>the Faculty</hi> wherewith alone we can apprehend them, after what manner ſoever they are revealed. And therefore no Plea for the Neceſſity of immediate Revelations can be founded upon the Illuminations of the Spirit of God, ſo often ſpoken of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Again, as an immediate Revelation of religious Truths and Duties is not at all neceſſary to give any Man a competent Underſtanding of them; ſince this End is much better provided for by the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation contained in the Holy Scriptures; ſo <hi>neither is it neceſſary, to aſſure Men that ſuch Truths and Duties are of divine Original.</hi> For this alſo they have better Aſſurance of from the Scriptures, than they could well be ſuppoſed to have from immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation.</p>
            <p>Our Lord himſelf prefers the Teſtimony of the Scriptures before the Teſtimony of <hi>one riſing from the dead</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 16.31.</note>. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> tho't the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Scriptures a <hi>more ſure Word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> than what was delivered by a <hi>voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1.19.</note>. And the Matter is too plain almoſt to admit of any Diſpute, with reſpect to the Scriptures of <hi>the New Teſtament</hi> in particular (to ſay nothing here
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003975_0013_10034E40C2640B98"/>of thoſe of <hi>the Old</hi>) that the Witneſs God was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear to the Religious Truths and Duties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, by Signs and Wonders, Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt (not once or twice, but for a whole Age together) is a much more rational and ſatisfactory Evidence of the divine Authority of them, than an immediate tranſient Revelation of the ſame Truths and Duties to any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without ſuch Signs following to ſupport the Credit of it, well can be.</p>
            <p>Now if neither ſo diſtinct a Knowledge of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths and Duties, nor ſo good Aſſurance of their divine Original, can reaſonably be expected by immediate Revelations, as we have already by the holy Scriptures; I think it will not be eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what Need there can now be of any ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations. For the great Ends of a Revelation are, to give us a ſufficient Knowledge of what we are to believe and practiſe, and ſufficient Evidence that it is God who requires theſe things at our hands: both which are done already, in the beſt manner that can be, by the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it will be thought, That tho' there be no <hi>abſolute Neceſſity</hi> that religious Truths and Duties ſhould now be made known to any Man by immediate Revelation, yet it might be <hi>of very good Uſe,</hi> if they ſhould; eſpecially to ſuch as are to be <hi>Inſtructors of others:</hi> That a ſenſe of the immediate Operation of the Spirit of God upon their Souls, in revealing divine Things unto them, would very much affect their Hearts, and ſo fire them with a greater Zeal and Activity in their Maſter's Service. Which brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuch immediate Revelations would be no more uſeful than they are neceſſary,</hi> Indeed there is no
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003975_0014_10034E4986F5FF68"/>doubt to be made, but that they would warm the Heart and raiſe the Paſſions for a Seaſon: but there is little Raeſon to think, that the Heat would prove laſting; and none at all to imagine, that it would make an habitual Change in the Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For God's preſenting Truths to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by immediate Revelation, and his bowing the Will and Affection to a Compliance with Duty, are Two as different Actions as can be; and have no neceſſary Connection at all with each other.</p>
            <p>Accordingly we find, that many who have at times had immediate Revelations, have yet lived and died very wicked Men. Thus <hi>Balaam</hi> who had often <hi>heard the words of God, and ſeen the Viſions of the Almighty</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. 24.4.</note> yet ſtill continued to <hi>love the ways of Unrighteouſneſs</hi> as well as ever, even after that <hi>the dumb Aſs ſpeaking with Man's Voice, had forbidden the Madneſs of the Prophet</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2.15, 16.</note> And ſo our Saviour himſelf tells us in Effect, that <hi>many that have caſt out Devils, done many wonderful Works, and propheſied in his name,</hi> ſhall nevertheleſs <hi>depart from him</hi> in the day of Judgment with the <hi>Workers of Iniquity</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Math. 7.22.23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, God hath given us ſufficient and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Evidence of the divine Authority of the holy Scriptures; and in ſome reſpects better than any Man can well be ſuppoſed to have of the Divinity of a tranſient Revelation. And therefore as for them who will not hear or regard <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, we are far from having any Reaſon to think, that they would be effectually perſuaded or wrought upon by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation: And ſo ſuch immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation would only ſerve to raiſe a ſudden Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003975_0015_10034E53E59BFDA0"/>in the Soul, and could be of no Uſe or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at all to the Intereſt of Piety and Religion in it. But I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That an Expectation of modern Revelations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Truths and Duties to any of the Children of God, would certainly be extreme dangerous:</hi> and that both to many of the ſuppoſed Subjects of ſuch Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to many others alſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It would be very dangerous <hi>to many of the ſuppoſed Subjects of ſuch Revelations.</hi> For though we have all the Reaſon in the World to think, that God (who hath given to Men a power of communicating their Tho'ts to one another, in ſuch ways as that they may know aſſuredly from whom the Communication comes) can never want means Himſelf to make known his Mind to any of his Children ſo effectually as that they may be as certain that the Revelation is from God, as they can be at any time that they hear the Words of their moſt intimate Friends, when they are before their Eyes ſpeaking to them; and tho' it be not unreaſonable to think, that if any Perſon had been once favoured with a true divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would know the Operations of the Spirit of God too well, to be ever after impoſed upon by the Suggeſtions of the Devil: yet notwithſtanding theſe Conceſſions'tis very obvious, that were it once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, that God did in theſe days make immediate Revelations of religious Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſome of his Children, without atteſting the Divinity of thoſe Revelations, by the Giſts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy and Miracles, or ſome other way equally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory (which he hath never been known to do in later Ages) the great Adverſary of Souls might ſoon take the Advantage of it, to impreſs Deluſions upon the Minds of many well diſpoſed Perſons, who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003975_0016_10034D00332863C8"/>had never yet had any divine Revelations, with ſo much Force and Subtilty, as to make them really think themſelves inſpired of God; when in truth they were only made to believe Lyes by the Craft and Power of the Devil. And that there would be real and great danger of ſuch fatal Impoſitions from the Father of Lyes, if an Expectation and Belief of modern unatteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Revelations ſhould once prevail; is evident, not only from the Reaſonableneſs of the Suppoſition, but alſo from what was Matters of Fact not much more than Twenty Years ago: when great Numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, firſt in <hi>France</hi> and afterwards in <hi>England</hi> (and ſome of conſiderable Learning and Knowledge too, and of unblemiſh'd Life) were ſo far drawn away by the Devices of Satan, as to think themſelves under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Operations and Illuminations of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; until at length in that Confidence they ventured ſo far at Propheſies and Miracles, as to quite ſpoil the Credit of their ſuppoſed Inſpirations.</p>
            <p>But theſe things may ſuffice for the Danger to which an Expectation and Belief of modern Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of religious Truths and Duties would expoſe the <hi>imagin'd Subject</hi> of ſuch Revelations. It only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that I ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuch an Expectation and Belief would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme dangerous to many others alſo.</hi> For if ſome of the Children of God were now imagin'd to be favoured with immediate Revelations; then whatever <hi>they</hi> were ſuppoſed to ſpeak unto us by Revelation, ought not to be received as <hi>the Word of Man,</hi> but as the <hi>Word of God.</hi> And here a Difficulty would ariſe how we ſhould know, who ſpake by Revelation, and who did not? For unleſs we could know this, we ſhould be at an utter Loſs whoſe Words we ought to receive as <hi>Oracles of God.</hi> And therefore for our Conduct in this difficult Affair, we muſt either make it a Rule to believe every one, whom we look'd upon as a good Man, to ſpeak by immediate Revelation, as often as he was pleaſed to affirm he did, and we upon Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003975_0017_10034E59A44B9870"/>into Circumſtances could find no Deſign of Fraud: Or elſe every one who pretended to be favoured with divine Revelations, muſt come recommended to us by ſuch Evidences of a divine Miſſion as might ſatisfy a reaſonable Enquirer, that he ſpake not in <hi>the Words which Man's Wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>unſpeakable Miſchiefs would follow to Mankind upon the former of theſe Suppoſals.</hi> For if we were to believe every one, whom we look'd upon as a good Man, to ſpeak by immediate Revelation, as often as he had Aſſurance enough to affirm he did, and we upon Enquiry into Circumſtances could find no Deſign of Fraud (beſides the ſtrong deluſions ſuch Men would be liable to themſelves, as was obſerved under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going head) it would open a Door for every bold Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, who could hypocritically make a fair ſhew of Religion, to impoſe upon us almoſt any Imaginations of his own Heart which he pleaſed. And in ſuch a State of things there would ſoon be a Multitude of Inſtances of good Men drawn away by ſuch Deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to act directly contrary to the Will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And that this is not a groundleſs Surmiſe, but a well founded Suppoſition, I think we may eaſily ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our ſelves, by conſidering the tragical Story of the <hi>Man of God, who came out of Judah by the Word of the Lord unto Bethel,</hi> as it is reported 1 Kin. 13. He was <hi>commanded of God to propheſie againſt the Altar of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel; and was alſo charged to eat no Bread, nor drink Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor turn again by the Way that he came</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">v. 2, 9.</note> And if he could be under any Doubt, whether God was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe Charges or no, it muſt be entirely taken away by the Fulfilment of <hi>the Sign which the Lord had ſpoken,</hi> in the <hi>renting of the Altar and the pouring out of the Aſhes;</hi> and by the withering <hi>of the King's hand, and the reſtoring of it at his Prayer</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">v. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> Upon this he withſtands the King's Invitation, tho' inforced with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003975_0018_10034E5F373EDA50"/>the Promiſe of a Reward; and ſaith unto him, <hi>If thou wilt give me half thine Houſe, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat Bread, nor drink Water in this place</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Verſe 7, 8.</note>. And yet notwithſtanding this Reſolution, no ſooner comes <hi>the old Lyar of Bethel,</hi> and ſaith unto him, <hi>I am a Prophet alſo as thou art, and an Angel ſpake unto me by the Word of the Lord, ſaying, bring him back with thee into thine Houſe, that he may at Bread and drink Water</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Verſe 18.</note>; but the Man of God belioving him upon his bare Word, without any Evidence of a divine Miſſion, tranſgreſſes the expreſs Command of God to himſelf thro' ſuch Credulity, <hi>goes back with him, eats Bread and drinks Water in his houſe, and is ſlain by a Lion</hi> (upon his Return) <hi>for his Diſobedience to the Ward of the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Verſe 19, 24.</note>. Now if one who was <hi>a Prophet</hi> might be ſo ſeduced to act directly contrary to an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to himſelf, confirmed with ſuch Signs following: by taking another to come with a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Revalation from God, upon his own bare Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any ſufficient Evidence: how much eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may we well ſuppoſe it, for Multitudes of Men of honeſt Minds, who are <hi>neither Prophets nor the Sons of Prophets,</hi> to be drawn into Apprehenſions and Practices (eſpecially in Matters of poſitive Inſtitution) directly contrary to the Revelations of the Will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Scriptures; if they ſhould preſume any Men in our days to be favoured with divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, only upon their own pretending to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's bearing them Witneſs in any way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole; if it be altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and would be of no good Uſe, but of ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequences (as we have heard) for any of the Children of God in our days, and under the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our modern Pretenders, to have religious Truths and Duties diſcover'd to them by immediate Revelation, I think, we need not be at any Loſs at all, to conclude they have not. For it would be contrary
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003975_0019_10034E6C12A5F4D0"/>to all the natural Notions we have of the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and to all the Diſcoveries God hath made of himſelf in his Word, to imagine Him expoſing His Children to fatal Dangers, without any Neceſſity, or propoſing any Advantage to them by it.</p>
            <p>And if to theſe Conſiderations we add, the frequent Warnings we have in the Scriptures, of <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers, transforming themſelves into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt,</hi> and endeavouring <hi>to ſeduce, if poſſible the very Elect;</hi> and that we are therefore wiſely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and charged in my Text, <hi>not to believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God;</hi> I think, we may ſafely ſet it down for a Rule, that we ought not to give heed to any Man's Pretenſions to divine Revelations of religious Truths and Duties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he produces ſuch Evidences as may be a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Satisfaction to us, that the Spirit of God is in him.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded, what Evidences are ſufficient to give us ſuch a Satisfaction? I muſt defer the Anſwer till God ſhall give another Opportunity.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Enquiry now before us is, <hi>What Evidences are ſufficient to give us a reaſonable Satisfaction, that any Man who pretends to have religious Truths and Duties diſcovered to him in our Days by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation, hath the Spirit of God in him of a Truth?</hi> The Anſwer to this Enquiry will lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecond Thing propoſed, which was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To try the Spirits of our modern Pretenders to divine Revelations, whether they are of God or no, by ſuch Rutes as the Word of God ſuggeſts to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I think I may truly affirm,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That me ought not to reſt ſatisfied in any thing ſhort of ſuch Evidences as thoſe by which God was pleaſed to bear Witneſ, to Moſes and the Prophets, to Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in ancient Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, that nothing ſhort of ſuch Evidences as theſe, ought to ſatisſy us now: becauſe that God hath as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Care of His Church now as ever; and from the frequent and ſolemn Warnings of our bleſſed Lord himſelf, and his Apoſtles, the Church of God ſeems to be in as much Danger now as ever of <hi>Deceivers.</hi> And
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003975_0021_10034DFD1E152C00"/>therefore we cannot ſuppoſe it to be the Will of God, that his People ſhould give Credit to Pretenders to divine Revelation now, upon weaker Evidences than he expected, that they ſhould do ſo in more ancient Times.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if we conſider, that we have no Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that after the <hi>Canon</hi> of it ſhould be compleated, we were to expect any more <hi>holy Men of Goa ſpeaking or writing to us, as they ſhould be moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But inſtead of this, the <hi>Canon</hi> of the New Teſtament is ſealed up with that awful Commination Rev. 22.18, 19. <hi>I teſtify unto every Man that heareth the Words of the Propheſy of this Book, If any Man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book. And if any Man ſhall take away from the Words of the Book of this Propheſy, God ſhall take away his Part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy City, and from the things that are written in this Book.</hi>

            <p>Whereas if we look back to the Times of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> we ſhall find, That tho' <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, <hi>ye ſhall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it.</hi> Deut. 4.2; yet he alſo ſays, Deut. 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me; unto him ye ſhall hearken.</hi> Now whether we underſtand this Prediction of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> and ſome others do; not of any ſingle Perſon, but of a Succeſſion of Prophets, as the Exigencies of the Church in the ſeveral Ages of it, during that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſhould call for: or whether we underſtand it accerding to the more general Opinion of Expoſitors, to intend (eſpecially at leaſt, if not only) Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, who alone reſembled <hi>Moſes</hi> in that which was the chief part of his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a Prophet, <hi>viz.</hi> in giving Laws in the Name of God, and being the Author of a Body of inſtituted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Which ever way we take it, it is a plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that Propheſy ſhould not ceaſe with <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:003975_0022_10034E7C51B1CCE8"/>but that the People of God might ſtill expect further. Revelations from him, for a great while to come.</p>
            <p>And certain it is, That from this or other ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in the Old Teſtament, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> how much ſoever they differed in other Points in our Saviour's time, yet were well agreed in this; that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> whom they expected, was to be a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> I know, ſays the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Joh. 4.25. <hi>that Meſſias cometh which is called Chriſt; when he is come, he will tell us all things.</hi> And when our bleſſed Lord had fed a great Multitude of <hi>Jews</hi> with Five Loaves and Two Fiſhes; <hi>then thoſe Men, when they had ſeen the Miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a Truth that Prophet that ſhould come into the World.</hi> John 6.14.</p>
            <p>Once more, the marvellous Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Diſciples of our Lord on the day of Pentecoſt (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us, Act. 2.16, 17.) <hi>was nothing but what was ſpoken by the Prophet</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Joel 2.28.</note> Joel, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Fleſh: and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall propheſy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Upon the ſealing up of the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> when the Spirit of Propheſy was to be with held for a ſeaſon, God charges His People, Mal. 4.4. <hi>Remember the Law of Moſes my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Iſrael, with the Statutes &amp; Judgements.</hi> And yet he had told them but a little before <note n="*" place="bottom">Mal. 3.1.</note>, That <hi>the Lord whom they ſought ſhould ſuddenly come to his Temple.</hi> And he adds here <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mal. 4.5.</note>, <hi>Behold I will ſend you</hi> ELIJAH THE PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHET, <hi>before the Coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon the whole, if we compare the many plain Intimations in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> of the Return of the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit of God in the Days of the <hi>New,</hi> with the profound Silence of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003975_0023_10034E7DD55F40A0"/>the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> as to any new Effuſions of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, after the New Teſtament-Canon ſhould be compleated; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we conſider how all Expectation of any ſuch Thing ſeems to be cut off in the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> I think the leaſt Effect it can have upon us, muſt be, to heighten our Suſpicions of any Pretenders to immediate Revelations of religious Truths and Duties from God in our Days; and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it reaſonable for us to expect rather <hi>more</hi> than <hi>leſs Evidences</hi> that the Spirit of God is in them, than <hi>thoſe</hi> by which he was wont to bear Witneſs to his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Meſſengers in the Days of the Old and New Teſtament. And this brings me to conſider, what thoſe Evidences were.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>the Evidences by which God was pleaſed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times to bear Witneſs to his extraordinary Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, were principally ſuch as theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>Sometimes the Beſtowment of an Ability to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell Things to come; or to do ſuch Works, as it cannot be ſuppoſed, that God would enable, or even ſuffer, Men to do for the Confirmation of Falſehoods in Religion; or both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe Evidences certainly concurred in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> The Paſſages of Scripture which prove it, are too many, and too well known, to need to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. It is highly probable alſo, that both theſe Evidences concurred in moſt, it not all, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> that followed <hi>Moſes</hi> during the Times of the Old Teſtament. For as to all thoſe whoſe Writings remain, we are ſure, either from their own Books which are ſtill in our hands, or from Hints given us elſewhere in the Scripture, that they foretold things to come. And as for others of them, who have left no Writings upon ſacred Record, ſuch as the <hi>Man of God from Judah,</hi> mentioned in the preceeding Diſcourſe, <hi>Elijah</hi> the <hi>Tiſhbite,</hi> Eliſha &amp;c.) we are
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003975_0024_10034E84306A8BE8"/>nevertheleſs expreſsly told, both of their Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of their Miracles. And if we conſider the Severity of that Law, Deut. 18.20. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which ſhall preſume to ſpeak a word in my Name, which I have not commanded him to ſpeak,—even that Prophet ſhall die;</hi> and the Rule which God gives in <hi>ver.</hi> 22, <hi>how the People ſhould know the Word which the Lord had not ſpoken;</hi> we may very well conclude that God always enabled his Servants the Prophets (at leaſt in their beginning to ſpeak in his Name, before their Authority could be eſtabliſhed by the Fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Predictions) to give ſome convincing Sign to thoſe that heard them (it there was Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it) that they had a Command from God for what they ſaid: As we are aſſured, he did in the Caſes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the <hi>Man of God from Judah,</hi> of <hi>Elijab</hi> and others <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Exod, 4.1 Kin. 13. &amp; 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore when our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it, that the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> once and again <hi>asked a Sign of him,</hi> even <hi>a Sign from Heaven</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 12.38.-16. I.</note>; it could not be becauſe he judged it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that the People of God ſhould demand a Sign, of one who ſpeaks to them in the Name of the Lord, before his Miſſion from God had been proved by any Sign, or any thing elſe equivalent to a Sign: Nor could it be becauſe he judged it reaſonable, that He himſelf ſhould be believed to be a Teacher ſent from God, without any other Evidences of it than his own bare Word. For he ſays in Contradiction to any Surmiſe like the Firſt of theſe, Joh. 15.24. <hi>If I had not done among them the Works which none other Man did, they had not had Sin;</hi> And in Oppoſition to the latter he ſays, Joh.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003975_0025_10034E8604199B38"/>10.37, 38. <hi>If do not the Works of my Father, believe me not: but if I do, tho' ye believe not me, believe the Works.</hi> And therefore we muſt ſuppoſe, that the true Reaſon of our Lord's Diſpleaſure was, becauſe the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> (who came tempting him, and asking a Sign) very well knew, that He had formerly done ſo many and ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works, as were abundantly ſufficient to ſatisfy any, but thoſe who were reſolved not to be ſatisfied, of his Miſſion from God. For beſides all his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works which they had ſeen or heard of before, when they came to ask a Sign of Him the firſt time, he had been caſting out a Devil; upon which the <hi>Phariſees ſaid, this Fellow doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.</hi> Mat. 12.24. And before they came to Him the ſecond time, He had been <hi>filling four thouſand Men, beſide Women and Children, with ſeven Loaves and a few little Fiſhes.</hi> Mat. 15.34, 38. and yet, as if this was a Work not worth regarding, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> with the <hi>Sadducees</hi> came and <hi>deſired him that he would ſhew them a Sign from Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16.1. We need not wonder then, that our Lord was angry at the Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wicked Perverſeneſs of theſe Men. And that I have aſſigned the true Cauſe of his Anger is manifeſt, not only from what hath been obſerv'd above, but alſo from His own Expoſtulation with them, Mat. 16.3. <hi>O ye Hypocrites, ye can diſcern the Face of the Sky, but can ye not diſcern the Signs of the Times?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think I need not ſay any more concerning the <hi>mighty Works</hi> with which <hi>the Miſſion of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was conſirm'd from Heaven.</hi> Nor need I ſay any thing of His <hi>Propheſies,</hi> which are ſo well known, and have been ſo exactly fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:003975_0026_10034E93194F1488"/>
I ſhall only add concerning his holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the Words of the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 2 ver. 3.4. <hi>That the great Salvation which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them Witneſs, both with Signs and Wonders, and with diverſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe things may ſuffice for the Firſt Way in which God was ſometimes pleaſed in the days of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to <hi>bear Witneſs</hi> to his extraordinary Meſſengers. I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>That God ſometimes teſtified the divine Miſſion of His Servants the Prophets, by doing ſome wonderful Work himſelf for the Confirmation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not the Prophets, but God Himſelf ſometimes gave a Sign. Thus he declares he will do to the <hi>Houſe of 'David,</hi> for the Conſirmation of His Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiab,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. And thus he did alſo in the Caſe of the Prophet <hi>Jonah:</hi> for <hi>the Lord prepared a great Fiſh to ſwallow up Jonah, and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah was in the Belly of the Fiſh three days and three nights. And the Lord ſpake unto the Fiſh, and it vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out Jonah upon the dry Land.</hi> Jon. 1.17.-2.10. Now tho' the Scriptures have not informed us, how the <hi>Ninevites</hi> came to the Knowledge of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Work of God, yet we are certain from the Scriptures, that they are not ignorant of it, and that this was a Sign to them of the divine Miſſion of the Prophet. For we read, Luk. 11.30. That <hi>as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah was a Sign to the Ninevites, ſo ſhall alſo the Son of Man be to this Generation.</hi> That is (to borrow the Words of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> with a little Alteration) <q>As the Preaching of <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Streets of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> atteſted with the Miracle of having been three days in the Whale's Belly, and then being
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003975_0027_10034E96216BDCC8"/>caſt upon the Shore alive, was an Aſſurance to them, that without Repentance they ſhould ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be deſtroyed: ſo ſhall the Preaching of Chriſt to the Men of this Age, atteſted with his Death and Reſurrection after three days, be a certain Fore-runner of Deſtruction to you that believe not.</q> Upon which we may obſerve, That even our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf had this Evidence alſo of His divine Miſſion, as well as the others above-mentioned. For not only did He Himſelf prove his Miſſion from God by Prophefies and Miracles; but <hi>God alſo gave Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it unto all Men in that He raiſed Him from the dead.</hi> But I haſten to ſay,</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>That ſometimes the 'Proof of the divine Miſſion of God's extraordinary Meſſengers might be fetched from Antecedent Propheſies concerning them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Sort of Proof our <hi>bleſſed Lord Himſelf</hi> don't think it unbecoming the Dignity of His Perſon and Offices to have Recourſe to. For after he had ſaid, Joh. 5.36. <hi>The Works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame Works that I do, bear Witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me;</hi> He adds Ver. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and they are they which teſtify of me;</hi> and again Ver. 46. <hi>Had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was the Caſe of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who had been ſpoken of under the Name of <hi>Elijah</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mal. 4.5.</note>; and whoſe Birth and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice had been foretold to his <hi>Father</hi> by an <hi>Angel,</hi> and a Sign given to confirm the Prediction <note n="†" place="bottom">Luk, 1, 13, 20.</note> 
               <hi>And all theſe things were noiſed abroad throughout all the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003975_0028_10034E97AB9B6420"/>Hill Country of Judea. And all they that heard them, laid them up in their Hearts, ſaying, what manner of Child ſhall this be</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Verſe 65, 66.</note>? In fine, tho' the People ſay of <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>he did no Miracle,</hi> yet they add, that <hi>all things that he ſpake of Chriſt were true</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. 10.41.</note>: which was an Acknowledgment that <hi>John</hi> had the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole: Since God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (ſo far as we can learn from Scripture) given ſome ſuch Evidences as theſe of the divine Miſſion of His Servants, when He expected, that Men ſhould believe that they ſpeak by Revelation from Him; ſince our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf tho't it neceſſary to have Recourſe to ſuch ſort of Proofs that the Father had ſent Him; and ſince it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for us to expect rather <hi>more</hi> than <hi>leſs</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that the Spirit of God is in ſuch as pretend to immediate Revelations from him in our Days, than <hi>thoſe</hi> by which he was wont to bear Witneſs to His extraordinary Meſſengers in the Days of the Old and New Teſtament; I think we may very fairly conclude, that till the modern Pretenders to divine Revelations can either prove, that they and their Miſſion have been foretold ſomewhere or other in the Scriptures of the Old or New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or can make it appear that God Himſelf hath given ſome ſufficient Sign of their Miſſion from Him, like that of Delivering <hi>Jonah</hi> from the Whale's Belly, or the Raiſing up our Saviour from the Dead; or till they can ſatisfy us, that they themſelves are endued from on high with the Giſts of Prophecy or Miracles, or both, to ſupport the Credit of their pretended Revelations; Or can give
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003975_0029_10034EA3591DB000"/>us ſome other as good Evidences as theſe, that God is with them of a Truth; they muſt allow us, in obedience to the Warnings and Cautions given us in the Scriptures, to number them with Men under <hi>ſtrong Deluſions,</hi> or with <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>Miniſters of Satan.</hi> And to theſe Things I muſt add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That upon Suppoſition that any modern Pretender to divine Revelation ſhould give any Sign or Wonder; yet if the Doctrine which it is wrought in Confirmation of, ſhould be manifeſtly contradictory to any Article of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, according to which Men are to be judged at the laſt Day; or ſhould be notoriouſly Wicked in its Nature; or evidently tending to open the Door to all manner of Wickedneſs, by ridding us of that Fear, not of Man only but of God alſo, which is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Wiſdom; Tho' the Sign ſhould be ſuch an one, as that if it had been given for a better Purpoſe, we ſhould hardly (if at all) have been able to diſtinguiſh it from a Divine Miracle; Yet in ſuch a Caſe the Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Wickedneſs of the Doctrine deſign'd to be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, would be a ſufficient Pooof, that the Wonder was not of God, but of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For we are not more certain that God is powerful, than we are that he is alſo wiſe, juſt, good, and true. And therefore the ſeeming Greatneſs or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of any Work can never perſwade us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it an Effect of Divine Power, if it be wrought to confirm a Doctrine, which we certainly know to be inconſiſtent with God's Wiſdom, Juſtice, Truth or Goodneſs. But on the contrary, a certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Wickedneſs of the Nature or Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of any Doctrine; or of its Contradictorineſs to ſuch Revelations of the Will of God as can never be reverſed, (becauſe Men are to be judg'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them at the great Day) and which God hath
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003975_0030_10034EAD75678DF8"/>born Witneſs to by Signs and Wonders, Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt for an whole Age to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; will be a ſufficient Reaſon for us to account any Wonder wrought in Confirmation of ſuch a Doctrine to be only a <hi>lying Wonder</hi> wrought by the <hi>Wicked one.</hi> For in ſuch a Caſe it muſt be more evident, that the Doctrine is falſe or wicked, than it can be, that ſuch a Wonder could be wrought by nothing leſs than divine Power.</p>
            <p>And as it is plain to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that no Sign or Wonder can be ſufficient to give Credit to a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, when it is more evident, that the Doctrine is falſe or wicked, than it is, that ſuch a Wonder could be wrought by nothing leſs than divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo it hath been the Opinion of ſeveral pious and very learned Men, that it appears from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that God may ſometimes permit ſuch Wonders to be wrought for the ſupport of Doctrines notoriouſly falſe or wicked, as can be diſtinguiſh'd from the Effects of a Power truly divine by nothing but the evident Abſurdity or Vileneſs of the Doctrine they are deſign'd to give Credit to. This Opinion they found upon that Paſſage, Deut. 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth thee a Sign or a Wonder, and the Sign or the Wonder come to paſs, whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let us go after other Gods (which thou haſt not known) and let us ſerve them: Thou ſhalt not hearken to that Prophet, or that Dreamer of Dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your Grd with all your Heart, and with all your Soul.</hi> Hence they ſuppoſe (and I think very juſtly) that God might (to prove His People) ſuffer a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to give ſuch a Sign or Wonder, to entice them to Idolatry, as could not be diſtinguiſh'd by any
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003975_0031_10034EB1711F3200"/>thing but the Deſign of it, from a true Miracle: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Gods</hi> was ſo abſurd and wicked, and contradictory to the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to be alone ſufficient to deſtroy the Credit of any Wonders, that could be wrought to ſeduce thoſe into it who were acquainted with the Reaſonable Service of the true God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Another Way in which the Credit of any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works, how great ſoever, may be deſtroyed, is by God's exerting a ſuperiour Power in Contradiction to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thus He did in ancient times by the Wonders of the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> whom he ſuffered to withſtand His Servants <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for ſome time; and to do, or ſeem to do, ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works like to theirs; for <hi>Aaron caſt his Rod upon the Ground, and it became a Serpent,</hi> and ſo did they <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 7.10, 12.</note>: and <hi>Aaron ſtretched out his hand over the Waters, and the Frogs came up and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Land of Egypt. And the Magicians did ſo with their Enchantments, and brought up Frogs upon the Land of Egypt</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. 8.6.7,</note>. But tho' He ſuffered the <hi>Magicians</hi> thus to contend with His Prophets, yet he gave the Victory clearly on his Prophets Side. For: <hi>Aaron's Rod ſwallowed up their Rods</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Exod. 7.12.</note>; and when the <hi>Magicians</hi> endeavoured <hi>by their Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring forth Lice,</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> had done, they <hi>could not;</hi> but were forced to own before <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> that it was the Finger of God <note n="††" place="bottom">Exod. 8.18.19.</note>; and from that Time forward ſtrove no more for Victory.</q> So that there was no Danger, that either <hi>Iſraelites</hi> or <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould be led into any Error by the Wonders of the <hi>Magicians;</hi> becauſe God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately enabled his Servants to contradict and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003975_0032_10034EB3178A2B38"/>them, by more wonderful Works on the other ſide: And therefore in this Caſe, it was not at all inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom or Goodneſs of God, to permit the Devil to do marvellous Things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He took effectual Care to prevent any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's being neceſſarily and fatally miſled by them, and rendered His own Power more obſervable and glorious, by ſuffering the <hi>Magicians</hi> to conteſt with Him for a time. And if God ever ſhould, for wiſe and holy Ends unknown to us, in our Times, or in Ages to come, ſuffer any falſe Pretenders to divine Revelations, <hi>after the working of Satan</hi> to ſupport their Pretenſions with ſuch Signs and Wonders, as could no other way be diſtinguiſh'd from the real Effects of divine Power; we may ſafely confide in his Goodneſs, that He would, as in the Days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> exert a ſuperiour Power in Contradiction to them; and not ſuffer thoſe <hi>who receive the Love of the Truth that they may be ſaved,</hi> to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born with ſuch <hi>ſtrong Deluſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That we can never ſafely depend upon it, if we are Strangers to a Man's Character, that he comes with a Meſſage by immediate Revelation from God to us, any further than He confirms the divine Authority of ſuch Meſſage by ſome ſufficient Evidence.</hi>

            <p>For I have proved in the foregoing Diſcourſe, that ſome very wicked Men have <hi>heard the Words of God,</hi> and <hi>ſeen the Viſions of the Almighty,</hi> and <hi>propheſied in his Name.</hi> And yet, if we ſhould believe ſuch a Man to <hi>come unto us by the Word of the Lord,</hi> without his giving any ſufficient Proof of a divine Miſſion at that time, only becauſe we have known or heard, that he hath ſometimes been favoured with divine Revelations; we can't be ſecure, that we ſhall not be ſerved, as the <hi>Man of God from
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003975_0033_10035448202B61D0"/>Judah</hi> was by the <hi>Old lying Prophet of Bethel.</hi> It is not enough therefore, that we be perſwaded, that a Man hath ſometimes been favoured with imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelations from God: but we ought alſo to be ſatisfied, that he is not under the predominant Power of Covetouſneſs or Pride, or any other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affection, but is one that truly fears God: Or elſe we cannot ſafely truſt him upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of former Revelations, any further than he gives ſufficient Evidence of the divine Authority of every particular Meſſage, which he may preſume to come to us with in the Name of God.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole: If you ſhould ever hear of any <hi>New Meſſiah,</hi> or if any pretended <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> ſhould <hi>come forth into the World</hi> in our days: the Thoughts which have been offered at this time may be improved, as ſo many Directions for your Aſſiſtance, in <hi>trying the Spirits whether they are of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I therefore deſire you would be careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what I hope has been ſufficiently proved above; and what I recapitulate on purpoſe to refreſh your Memories: namely,</p>
            <p>That you ought not to reſt ſatisfied with <hi>weaker Evidences</hi> of the divine Miſſion of Pretenders to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from God in our Days, than <hi>thoſe</hi> with which God tho't it neceſſary to bear Witneſs to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and His <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> in ancient Times.</p>
            <p>That even ſome of <hi>theſe</hi> are not alone of Force enough to command your Aſſent; but that you ought alſo to take in the Conſideration of the Nature and Tendency of the Doctrines to which they may be deſign'd to give Credit; and of the Conduct of the governing Providence of God with reſpect to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003975_0034_10035449A3DF45F8"/>
That the manifeſt Wickedneſs of the Nature or Tendency of any pretended New Revelation; or its Contradictorineſs to ſuch Ancient Revelations of the Will of God, as are never to be revers'd, and as have been confirmed by Signs and Wonders, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt for an whole Age together; will be ſufficient to ſpoil the Credit of any Sign or Wonder which may be wrought for its Support; and to prove that ſuch Sign or Wonder was not of God, but of the Devil.</p>
            <p>That the Credit of any wonderful Work will likewiſe be deſtroyed, if God ſhould exert a ſuperi; our Power in Contradiction to it.</p>
            <p>In fine, that when you are in any meaſure Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the moral Character of a Pretender to divine Revelations, you cannot ſafely truſt him upon the Credit of former Revelations; but may reaſonably expect, that he ſhould give ſufficient Evidence of the divine Authority of every particular Meſſage, which be may preſume to come to you with in the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And to theſe things you ought to add a Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Endeavour to <hi>do the Will of God,</hi> ſo far as you know it; and ſervent Prayers in the Name of Chriſt that God may have no <hi>Cauſe to ſend you ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, that you ſhould believe a Lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ſhall obſerve theſe few Directions, I truſt you <hi>will not be carried about with diverſe and ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> but will be eſtabliſhed <hi>upon the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief Corner Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: If <hi>ſome</hi> ſhould ſuppoſe theſe Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be needleſs, and <hi>others</hi> ſhould apprehend
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003975_0035_1003544B29737EF8"/>them to be too rigid; I think I cannot anſwer both better than in the ſolemn Words of our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>viz. If any Man ſhall ſay unto you, Lo, here is Chriſt, or there; beleive it not. For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders, inſomuch that (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) they ſhould deceive the very Elect. But take ye heed: Behold I have told you before</hi>
