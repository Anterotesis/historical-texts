            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>JESUS CHRIST is ſtiled, the Son of peace; and the diſpenſation of grace, through him, is called the Goſpel of peace. True, on a particular occaſion, he told his diſciples, that he came not to ſend peace on earth but a ſword: And the hiſtory of man, ſince his appearance, hath fully evinced the prediction. Abuſing this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpenſation of mercy, the wicked
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021614_0004_0FB41CDA358BA058"/>
and deſigning, as well as ignorant and miſinformed pious men, have made it the ſource of contention and ſtrife; ſo that the father hath frequently been found againſt the ſon, and the ſon againſt the father, in religious conteſts. But although blind or wicked zeal hath often kindled into the wrath of man, which worketh not the righteouſneſs of God; yet ſtill the native tendency of the Goſpel is peace: And it muſt be perverted and abuſed before it can engender any other than the ſpirit of love.</p>
            <p>As, under the Redeemer's gentle reign, the Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, we find Angels celebrate the birth of the Prince of peace, with this ſeraphic ſong, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men. Not only was he uſhered into the world with the ſong of peace, but, at his departure to the Father, he bequeathed peace, as his laſt legacy to the diſciples whom he had choſen.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle John, whom the Son of God diſtinguiſhed as the object of his peculiar affection, has given us the fulleſt account of the diſcourſes which Chriſt held with his diſciples immediately before his paſſion. Theſe have ever been reckoned
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021614_0005_0FB41CDC77BF3998"/>
of great importance by all the genuine followers of the Lamb. In the affecting moments of parting, when the Son of man ſaid, hereafter I will not talk much with you, behold him benignly ſaying, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing a little from theſe words, it is propoſed, through the bleſſing and aſſiſtance of God, to enquire what is implied in the expreſſions, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; and then make ſome ſhort practical improvement of what may be ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is propoſed to enquire what is implied in the expreſſions, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. A very little attention will convince us, that more is implied in the text than in the common parting-ſalutation, peace be with you. Chriſt gave not as the world giveth. My peace ſuggeſts unto us, that he is the author of it, and that he can freely beſtow it as his own. This verſe was by no means intended for the Apoſtles alone. All, who call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus, in every place and age, are equally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in it. Conſidering the text then as if the great Redeemer had immediately addreſſed it unto you, we think it implies in it the following things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021614_0006_0FB41CDDF5876650"/>1ſt. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, implies, that Chriſt hath procured, for all his people, peace with God. We ought carefully to guard againſt thinking that God hates any of the works he hath made. God is love. His tender mercies are over all his works. His every creature ſhares in his bounty, and partakes of his diffuſive goodneſs. But, by the wiſe and righteous conſtitution of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King eternal, immortal, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, miſery neceſſarily follows tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In the language of ſcripture, this miſery is called the wrath of God, and his vengeance. There is no peace to the wicked. Our God is a conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>When our ſins are pardoned, we are ſaid to be reconciled unto God, and to have peace with him. Thus the royal Pſalmiſt ſays, Thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou haſt covered all their Sin. Selah. Thou haſt taken away all thy wrath: thou haſt turned thyſelf from the fierceneſs of thine anger. Turn us, O God of our ſalvation, and cauſe thine anger towards us to ceaſe. Now it is in conſequence of the atonement of Jeſus Chriſt alone that our ſins are forgiven. He is our peace. Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins: and by him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified from all things, from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021614_0007_0FB41CDF759208F8"/>
which ye could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes. But being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: for there is now no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk, not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. Well, therefore, might Chriſt ſay, as in the text, Peace I leave with you. The ſoul-reviving news of pardon, of reconciliation with God, are ſtill ſounded in the Church. The great buſineſs of the Goſpel miniſtry is, to teſtify repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The tenor of the goſpel of Chriſt is, He that believeth ſhall be ſaved: for him hath God exalted to be a prince, and a ſaviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs; of ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Peace I leave with you, my peace give unto you, implies, that Chriſt beſtows. on all his people, inward tranquility and peace. It is too notorious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that we are guilty creatures. Guilt neceſſarily begets fear, and raiſes in the mind the moſt tormenting emotions. It is poſſible, by long habits or wickedneſs, to have the conſcience feared as with a hot iron. But however much temporary eaſe a perſon in this ſituation may feel, he is very far from true peace. The abſence of remorſe or the freedom from deſpair, is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021614_0008_0FB41CE1E0A47200"/>
owing to an unhappy habit, the ſinner too eaſily acquires, of turning off his attention from his true character; and keeping himſelf from reflecting on the conſequences of his conduct. The peace, which the exalted Saviour gives, is very different, and founded on a ſolid, on an immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able baſis.</p>
            <p>Every man, who becomes a diſciple of Jeſus, muſt be made, in ſome conſiderable degree, to know himſelf. He muſt feel that he is guilty, wretched and hateful. The true penitent views his ſins accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with their diſtreſsful circumſtances of aggravation. He ſees that the law, which he hath ſo wantonly broken, is not only righteous, but good and holy. Thus he lothes and abhors himſelf in duſt and aſhes. But when his heart is ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, he feels the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the man whoſe ſins are pardoned, whoſe iniquities are covered, to whom the Lord will not impute ſin. A ſenſe of guilt alarms. But when the ſinner, knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, believes in Jeſus Chriſt. that he may be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt and not by the works of the law, he reſts on a ſure and tried foundation. He believeth on him that juſtified the ungodly. He fleeth for refuge
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021614_0009_0FB41CE337AB57C0"/>
to lay hold on the hope ſet before him in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now he feels that there is none to condemn, but can according to the meaſure and ſtrength of his faith, adopt the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated language of the Apoſtle; Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that juſtifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea, rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo madeth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us. Here is peace which is the peculiar gift of the deſpiſed Nazarene. The blood of Jeſus cleanſeth from all ſin. It ſpeaketh peace to the guilty mind. It allays the fever of an upbraiding conſcience. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the fears of condemnation, and makes us know that God is love. For we have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear; but we have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</p>
            <p>It deſerves our attention, that, in the verſe preceding our text, the Lord mentions the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe agency no ſinner can enter into the Kingdom of God. He ſhall teach you all things and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you. Sin hath ſet our powers and faculties at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The inward part of the ungodly is all confuſion and turmoil. It is true one violent
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021614_0010_0FB41CE4B6874250"/>
paſſion after another uſurps the ſway, and, during its imperious reign, overpowers all oppoſition, and bids defiance to all controul. Yet even in this ſituation, when all ſeems to move in one direction, the ſoul is full of diſquiet. But it more frequently happens, that violent propenſities and paſſions urge at once their oppoſite and irreconciliable claims. Here the man without ſelf-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, like a ſhip which has loſt its rudder, driven by furious winds, while the tranſient gratification of each paſſion, like the claſhing of contending billows, vaſtly increaſes the uproar and confuſion within.</p>
            <p>But, when the divine Comforter reneweth the heart, the unruly propenſities, paſſions and luſts loſe their ferocity. Then the mind, recovered to a ſenſe of her immortal dignity, reſumes her rightful ſway. The inferior appetites are taught to know their proper place. The objects, which kindled ambition, or avarice, or luſt, no longer gliſter in their wonted charms. The opening glories of eternity captivate the Believer's heart. The powers of the world to come ſenſibly influence him. A new ſeries of activity engages all his faculties and deſtroys the unworthy conteſts which formerly rent his heart. May not the Son of God then ſay, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, when reaſon,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021614_0011_0FB41CE648DADC68"/>
conſcience, inclination, and all our powers lead to the ſervice of God; when the whole man is employed in righteouſneſs, the fruit of which is peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, implies, that Chriſtians be at peace with one another. The character, which the Apoſtle gives of them who are without God and without hope in the world, is, that they are hateful, and hating one another. When a man is full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion within; when the ſlighteſt degree of ſelf-examination preſents to him a monſter, on which he cannot bear to fix his eye, he muſt be irraſcible and unlovely. And, though the fear of encountering the fierce paſſions of others, which he knows to be as ungovernable as his own, may make him act with caution; yet he cannot be ſaid to be at peace with others who is at enmity with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Chriſt not only poſſeſſed the moſt undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed tranquillity within himſelf, but he was at all times actuated by the pureſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and good will towards all men. The expreſſions of the text may mean, that he hath left us an example of peace, which it is our duty and intereſt to imitate. But it implies much more than this.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath taken away every cauſe of contention among his followers. Wars and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021614_0012_0FB41CE7B5CA6A90"/>
ſightings among men come from their luſts, which war againſt the Spirit. But the luſts of the humble followers of the Lamb are ſubdued. Pride is another fruitful ſource of contention and ſtrife: But they, who learn of Jeſus Chriſt, are humble, meek and lowly. They think not of themſelves above what they ought to think, but eſteem each other better than themſelves. Self-conceit hath often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the happineſs of ſociety.</p>
            <p>The great Author and finiſher of our faith hath extinguiſhed one of the greateſt cauſes of contention, by giving his followers a certain and fixed ſtandard of wiſdom. While every man followed his own crude conceptions, and deemed his own mind the ſeat of perfection, there was wrangling and diſputes without end. Now we can appeal to the law and to the teſtimony: and we know that, if any man ſpeak not according to them, there is no truth in him. Many hot diſputes have, no doubt, been kindled in the Chriſtian world about the meaning of the ſacred oracles. All theſe however are foreign to the ſyſtem of peace. It appears, but too evidently, that the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, equally diſſatisfied with ſcripture, wiſh to ſubſtitute their own modes of expreſſions, and under theſe their own conceits, in the room of the word of God.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021614_0013_0FB41CE937C129B0"/>
On the other hand the true Chriſtian is ſatisfied to receive divine truth in the very words which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth. He holds the unity of the faith in the bond of peace; and finds his time and attention ſo completely engroſſed with regulating his conduct by the word of God, that he hath no leiſure for angry cavils with any man.</p>
            <p>Mutual neglects and injuries muſt be expected, in this imperfect ſtate, as the unavoidable concomitants of humanity. The true Chriſtian, like his divine maſter, is of a meek and forgiving temper. He hath learned, when he is reviled, not to revile again. He owes no man any thing but to love one another. He overcometh evil with good. It is true many, who only come to ſpy out our liberty in Chriſt, take upon themſelves the venerable name of Chriſtian, while they are utter ſtrangers to this divine temper. But, as theſe are none of Chriſt's, we are to expect, no peace in them or from them.</p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing the native tendency of the Goſpel of Chriſt is peace; peace with God, with ourſelves and with one another: And, ſeeing it is impoſſible to have diſputings, ſtrifes and contentions, without relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all title to the character of Chriſtians, we ſee the truth, the meaning, and the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021614_0014_0FB41CEAC74F8560"/>
propriety of theſe expreſſions, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And now, my Brethren, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of what hath been ſaid, ſuffer me to exhort you all to ſeek peace. Every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſent knows the importance of inward tranquility. There is however no peace to the wicked. If you wiſh to be in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſituation that your own conſciences condemn you not, ſeek peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillation with God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is the true, this is the ſole founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of happineſs. He, who looks for it from any other quarter, is like a man who builds his houſe upon the ſand.</p>
            <p>Peace and reconciliation with God will not only by the foundation of internal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, but it will lead you to be at peace among yourſelves. That chriſtian ſociety may be called a church of God, where the Son of peace dwells. I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement.</p>
            <p>Mutual forbearance muſt be the bond of peace among men. O remember that we are all imperfect. We ſee but in part; we know but in part. Let each of us ſtudy to approve ourſelves to God through Jeſus Chriſt; and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021614_0015_0FB41CEC363B3D60"/>
then the only contention, if it be lawful to give it ſo hard a name, will be who can forbear, who can yield, and who can love the moſt.</p>
            <p>My dearly beloved Brethren, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, we ſhall meet no more, till we are aſſembled before the laſt tribunal. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, without emotion, to anticipate this awful ſcene. For more than three years I have now laboured among you in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry. God knows, and you alſo know, that I have not been able, at all times, to reſtrain the tears, which involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily force themſelves from my eyes, when I figure, only in imagination, you and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as taking our reſpective places at the judgment ſeat of Chriſt. I dare not be ſo bold as to ſay with the Apoſtle, I am pure from the blood of all men. How cutting the thought, that perhaps ſome of you may riſe up in judgment againſt me; and that your blood ſhall be required at my hand.</p>
            <p>O thou compaſſionate High Prieſt, who didſt ſhed thy blood for our ſalvation, who art my Maſter, who ſhall be my judge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cannot ſay, before thee, that I have declared all the counſel of God; yet I hope to be found of thee as one who never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly ſhunned to declare any part of his counſels, and whoſe ſingle aim, though with much imperfection, hath been to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021614_0016_0FB41CEDB6257B10"/>
religion, righteouſneſs and peace in this place, that I might preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Allow me, my Brethren, to ſay, that my fears for myſelf, however pungent and keen, often give way to my concern for you. It is poſſible for Miniſters to ſave their own ſouls, while their hearers, or ſome of their hearers, are caſt out into utter darkneſs, where there is weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth. You know how that we have ſhewed, and taught, from this ſacred place, teſtifying, both to old and young, both to rich and poor, repentance towards God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is awful to think, that perhaps theſe pews, which alas! are too often unfilled, may riſe up in judgement againſt their holders, and convict ſome of you as perſons who have judged yourſelves unworthy of eternal life.</p>
            <p>But, beloved, not the hearers of the law are juſt before God, but the doers of the law ſhall be juſtified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At the great day of Chriſt, he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God; neither he that loveth not his brother. Theſe things being ſo, Oh! how diſtreſsful the thought, that I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably witneſs, in the great day of accounts,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021614_0017_0FB41CEF358CADE0"/>
againſt ſome of you. If while you were pricked to the heart; if, while conſcience, joining iſſue with the word, impreſſed you with a deep ſenſe of the neceſſity of your union with Chriſt, you ſtifled the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtill hold faſt your iniquity, Oh! dream not of eſcaping with impunity. Take heed how ye hear; for we muſt all give an account of ourſelves unto God. Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear friends, before I take my leave of you, permit me, in this public manner, to return my moſt ſincere and hearty thanks, for the great affection and love with which you have always treated me. Many haſty compoſitions, and but ill-digeſted thoughts have been delivered to you. No doubt ſeveral youthful indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions have, from time to time, appeared. But, inſtead of deſpiſing my youth, your approbation has been ſteady and ſure; yea, and you alſo afforded me the flattering, and I will add the ſupporting, ſenſe of it too.</p>
            <p>You no doubt ſaw, that your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was only a ſecondary object, and that your ſalvation was my conſtant and uniform aim. This neceſſarily led me to ſubjects of correction and reproof, as well as inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in righteouſneſs. I bluſh to own, that, on looking over ſeveral of theſe, I find, in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021614_0018_0FB41CF176255BD0"/>
many places, an aſperity of expreſſion, which, to ſay the leaſt of it, favours but too much of the wrath of man, that worketh not the righteouſneſs of God. All this notwithſtanding, there has been no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the harmony between us. Nay your love to me was, more and more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; ſo that I have ſerved with you in the goſpel as a ſon rather than a ſtranger. This I have conſidered as no inconſiderable evidence, that my preaching among you hath not been altogether fruitleſs. For God is not the Author of confuſion but of peace, as in all churches of the ſaints. Your warm and unremitting kindneſs has often affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſometimes almoſt overcome me; ſo I hope I ſhall be excuſed for adding, that I will bear you on my heart, while it continues to throb with the alternate emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grief and joy. And may the peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding, keep your hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>While I devoutly pray, that the great Shepherd and Biſhop of ſouls may beſtow upon you his beſt bleſſings; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that he may ſoon give you another Miniſter to diſpenſe in my room the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of peace; permit me to remind you of the great obligations to gratitude, under which you lie, to the exalted Head of the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021614_0019_0FB41CF2F6EFEB48"/>
Church, for the continuance of the life, of the health, and of the uſefulneſs of your preſent worthy Paſtor. It fills me with the ſincereſt regret to leave a colleague who who has been to me a Father. No com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of mine can add to his praiſe, which is already in the Church of Chriſt. Many of you, I truſt, are his epiſtle, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in your hearts, known and read of all men. I beſeech you, therefore, Brethren, to know him who labours among you, and is over you in the Lord, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes you; and to eſteem him very highly in love for his work's ſake. And be at peace among yourſelves. And the very God of peace ſanctify you wholly: And I pray God your whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body, be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Amen.</p>
