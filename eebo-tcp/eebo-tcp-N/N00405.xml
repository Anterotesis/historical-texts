            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Have Endeavoured to the utmost of my Power, to perform what was Desired of me in Order to the Publick Peace and Safety; and I do not know that any thing hath been Omitted which might tend to the Preservation of them, since the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Affairs was put into my hands. It now lies upon you to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a firm Security for your Religion, your Laws, and your Liberties. I do not doubt, but that by such a full and free Representative of the Nation as is now made, the Ends of my Declaration will be attained. And since it hath pleased God hitherto to bless my good Intentions with so great Success, I trust in him, that he will compleat his own Work, by sending a Spirit of Peace and Union to influence your Councils, that no interruption may be given to an happy and lasting Settlement. The Dangerous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Protestant Interest in Ireland, requiring a large and speedy Succour, and the present State of Things abroad, oblige me to tell you, that next to the Danger of unreasonable Divisions among your selves, nothing can be so fatal, as too great Delay in your Consultations. The States by whom I have been Enabled to Rescue this Nation may suddenly feel the ill effects of it. by being too long Deprived of the service of the Troops, which are now here, and of your early Assistance against a powerful Enemy, who hath Declared War against them. And as</hi> England, <hi>is by Treaty already Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to help them upon any such Exigences, so I am confident that their cheerful Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to preserve this Nation, with so much hazard to themselves will meet with all the Returns of Friendship and Assistance which may be expected from you as</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants <hi>and</hi> English-men <hi>whenever their Occasions shall require it.</hi>
