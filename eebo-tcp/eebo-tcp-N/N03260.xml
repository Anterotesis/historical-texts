            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003964_0004_10037B3D3090EC20"/>we, as intelligent Creatures, would pierce their Natures, and ponder their Events and Iſſues; accordingly forming our Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Choice reſpecting them.</p>
            <p>It is the Exerciſe of this noble Power of Reaſon in Meditation and Reflection which the Text before us recommends to our Practiſe, in which we have theſe two general Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>An important Duty enjoyned.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>An awful Puniſhment threatned for the Neglect of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt general Head are included theſe four following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Duty it ſelf.</item>
               <item>2. The Subject of it.</item>
               <item>3. The Object. And,</item>
               <item>4. The Time of Performance, which is <hi>Now.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Before I proceed father, let me attempt a brief Explication and Illuſtration of theſe Particulars: And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Duty</hi> enjoyned, which is <hi>Conſideration;</hi> this includes theſe three Things following.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> When a Perſon in receiving a Meſſage from God, underſtands, both who ſpeaks, and what is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003964_0005_10035C3038B4CCC8"/>ſpoken: <hi>Conſider this,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>Underſtand this;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal,</hi> CXIV. 8. <hi>Underſtand ye brutiſh among the People, and ye Fools, when will ye be wiſe?</hi> So that the Meaning of the World <hi>Conſider,</hi> is that they would ſeck to know that Being with whom they had to do that he is an infinitely holy, righteous and jealous God, who will not be mocked with fair Shews and Pretences, but will <hi>render to every one according to his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> at leaſt in the final Judgment; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they would labour to know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Importance of the Divine Meſſages.</item>
                  <item>2. This Duty of <hi>Conſideration</hi> imports, ſerious and ſolemn Deliberation, when the mind of God is not only underſtood and known, but ſeriouſly ponder'd and laid to Heart,; when a Perſon <hi>communes with his own Heart</hi> about it: What may be the Weight and Importance of the Matter and Meſſage, what the Advantages of Obedience againſt it; this was the Pſalmiſt's practice, Pſ. CXIX. 95. <hi>The Wicked have waited for me to deſtroy me, but I will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Teſtimonies. It is like that of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>how ſhall I do this Sin and Wickedneſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</hi> Or of <hi>Job. What then ſhall I do when God riſeth up, and when he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi> Job. XXXI.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003964_0006_10037B4A397A91B0"/>14. It was the neglect of this Duty of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation which was the Cauſe of God's Controverſy with, and complaint over the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſ. XLIV. 19. Jer. VIII. 6. <hi>I hearkned and heard that none conſidered in their Hearts to ſay,</hi> (why will ye not reaſon with your own Souls, and ſay, poor Sinners,) <hi>how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great a Salvation?</hi> And on the contrary, what an unconceivable Happineſs ſhall we be quickly inſtated in, if we be willing and obedient? And,</item>
                  <item>3. This Duty of Conſideration, imports Submiſſion, and Obedience: The Mind of God is then rightly underſtood and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, when it is obey'd, <hi>Ezek.</hi> XVIII. 28. <hi>Becauſe he conſidereth and turneth away from all his Tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Subject</hi> of this Duty: Forgetters of God, it will appear by the Law of Contraries who they are that forget God, by conſidering what it is, to remember him. And,
<list>
                  <item>1. To <hi>remember God</hi> is to entertain him in our Thoughts. So <hi>David</hi> remembred God <hi>upon his Bed,</hi> and <hi>meditated on him in the night Watches.</hi> Pſ. LXIII. 6. Thus God is forgotten when he is caſt out of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003964_0007_10037B533160EA38"/>Thoughts, as it's ſaid of the wicked, that <hi>God is not in all their Thoughts.</hi> Pſ. X. 4.</item>
                  <item>2. To remember God is to depend upon him, and confide in him, for Council and Support in every Difficulty, <hi>Pſ.</hi> XXV. 15. <hi>Mine Eyes are ever towards the Lord, he ſhall pluck my Feet out of the Net.</hi> Thus theſe who truſt in other Things, beſides God and make not him their Strength, forget him.</item>
                  <item>3. To ſerve and follow him with an honeſt and ſincere Heart; this is what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> gave in Charge to his Son <hi>Solomon and thou</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Heart, and with a willing Mind.</hi> I Chro. XXVIII. 9. it's in this Reſpect that the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaid, that his <hi>Heart followed hard after God, and that he was continually with him.</hi> Pſ. LXIII. 8. Pſ. LXXIII. 23. Thus theſe may be call'd forgetters of God, who Worſhip him not ſincerely in the Way of his Inſtitution.</item>
                  <item>4. To make him the laſt End of all our Actions, ſo as to intend and direct every Thing towards his Glory. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 31. Thus theſe forget God, who go no further in their Aims than themſelves.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Conſideration. This,</hi> conſider, that God <hi>knows and remembers your Iniquities</hi> however you conceal and forget them; he is <hi>Panopthalmos,</hi> all Eye;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003964_0008_10037B61B335D918"/>his Underſtanding pierces the thickeſt Vail of obſcurity, the midnight Darkneſs is to him as the Noonday; conſider, Sinners, that as God knows your ſecret Impieties, ſo he will damn you for them, he will <hi>tear you in Pieces,</hi> except you repent, the Terrors of an enraged God, are the moſt proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for ſecure Sinners to confider upon; becauſe, being ſelfiſh, they are more apt to be influenc'd by Fear than Love.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Time when this Duty is to be performed, is <hi>Now;</hi> now, this Day, this Moment, to Morrow may be too late, and you <hi>torn in Pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed to conſider the ſecond Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head, viz. <hi>the awful Penalty threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Neglecters of the aforeſaid Duty;</hi> in which are two Things that want Explication, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What it is to be <hi>torn to Pieces.</hi> And,</item>
               <item>2. In what Reſpects <hi>none ſhall be able to deliver.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Let us enquire what is the Meaning of this Phraſe, <hi>torn in Pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. More Generally, it Notes an utter and irreparable Deſtruction: It's an awful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, taken from a Lion, or Bear's entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devouring it's impotent Prey.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly it imports theſe three Things.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003964_0009_10037B651A971160"/>
               <item>1. That God will utterly take his Mercy from them if they take no Warning. <hi>Iſ.</hi> XXVII. 11.</item>
               <item>2. That God will deal with them in ſtrict Juſtice, according to the Rigour of his Law, without leſſening the leaſt Meaſure of their merited puniſhment: This is unſpeakably dreadful; for, <hi>if God marks Iniquity, who can ſtand? Pſ.</hi> CXXX. 3.</item>
               <item>3. According to the Power of his Wrath, avenging Jealouſy, and Conſuming Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which a Complication of all the Terribles in Nature is but a faint Shadow; for, <hi>who knows the Power of his Anger?

            </list>
            <p>Again let us enquire in what Senſe it is, <hi>there ſhall be none to deliver.</hi> The Meaning no Doubt is, That when the decree'd Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God comes forth, it will bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it ſudden and remedileſs Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo there can be <hi>none to deliver</hi> in theſe three Reſpects.</p>

            <p>The Sum of what has been ſpoken, is briefly this; That while God is upon a Treaty of Peace with Sinners, there is yet a Door of Mercy opened; and therefore that it highly concerns thoſe whoſe have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto forgotten God, in Regard of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Dependance and Service, that they would now, without further Delay, conſider and lay to Heart their preſent Danger and Miſery while they have the Offers of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, leſt they be forever deprived thereof, and expoſed to the Stroaks of his avenging Severity.</p>
            <p>From the Words thus explained, we may obſerve the following Truths.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the ſharpeſt Meſſages of God to his rebelious People are uſually mixt with gracious Warnings and Entreaties.</hi> The Reaſons why God deals thus with Mankind, are,

2. To work upon the Sinners ingenuity, and keep them from utterly diſpairing of his Mercy Hoſ. XI. 4. 8. <hi>I drew them with Cords of a Man with Bands of Love.</hi> There is a ſweet Contemperation between Love and Tenderneſs in the Invitation and Terror and Authority in the threatning, each aſſiſts the other in bringing the Sinner to Chriſt,; the one guards againſt Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the other againſt Diſpair, thoſe fatal Obſtructions in the Way to Jeſus.</item>
                  <item>3. To render obſtinate Sinners inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble who will take no Warning. <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken to them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak for their Sin,</hi> Joh.

            <p>Then learn.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To admire God's Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Dealings with poor Sinners in a Way beſt ſuited to their rational Natures, and moſt effectual either to alarm their Fear, or allure their Love; theſe two go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Paſſions of the humane Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To be overcome by it. O let <hi>the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience of God lead you to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Rom. II. 4. If there be any

            <p>Some make the firſt Word of our Text, to be an intreating Particle: As if God had ſaid, <hi>O conſider this!</hi> My Brethren, will not the paſſionate Entreaties of a gracious God, freely tendering Pardon and Pity, after your numberleſs Rebellions and cruel Obſtinacies, pierce your adamantine Hearts,! and excite you to accept at laſt, <hi>before it be too late,</hi> his merciful Offers and kind Warnings!

The People of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> were in a very dangerous Condition, near the Brink of utter Deſtruction: — Yet when they conſidered the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Warning, humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and reformed, the Lord repented of the Evil he threatned to inflict upon them. <hi>Jonah III.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is pleaſing to God when Sinners take Warning from him, and conſider their Sin and Danger; ſo ſoon as the Prodigal came to himſelf, and thought of returning to his Father, while he was yet a great Way off, his Father ran to meet him. — Hence the Lord graciouſly expoſtulates with thoſe Sinners, in <hi>Iſ.</hi> I. 18. <hi>Come now and let us Reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: Though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white

            <p>Again, conſider now, O Sinner!</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe thy Happineſs is of the laſt Importance, and the Seaſons of Securing it are very ſhort and contracted; alas! they inſenſibly waſte away, and being once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, can never be recalled. <hi>Gen.</hi> VI. 3. <hi>Luk. XIX.</hi> 41.42.</p>

In like manner unſpeakably acute and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will be the Anguiſh and Diſtreſs of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impenitent and inconſiderate Sinners, in the Day of the Lord's cruel Wrath and fierce Anger (which ſhall <hi>burn as an Oven and conſume</hi> the proud and wicked <hi>as dry Stubble</hi>) for then all their falſe Friends and Refuges will fail them, and their Enemies environ them to deſtroy them, and the Judgments of God arreſt them ſuddenly and terribly, like Thunder and Lightning, and that in Troops like Showers of fiery Hail, from which they ſhan't obtain a hiding Place, tho' they cry to the Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains for it. <hi>Iſ.</hi> XIII. 9. <hi>Mal.</hi> IV. 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> VI. 16.</p>

            <p n="7">7. The ſooner you turn to God, the more Good you are like to do, and the clearer E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences obtain of a good State.
