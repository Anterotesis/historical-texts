            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Vindication, was written in order to give, a clear View of Facts; and to free the Houſe of Repreſentatives, from ſome very injurious aſperſions, that have been caſt upon them, by ill-minded people out of doors. Whether the writer has acquitted himſelf as becomes a candid and impartial vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, is ſubmitted to the judgment of the publick; which is ever finally given without Favour or affection; and therefore the appeal is made to a truly reſpectable and ſolemn tribunal? At the ſame time that a ſincere love is profeſſed for all men, and the duty of honour and reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuperiors is freely acknowledged, it muſt be allowed that one of the beſt ways of fulfilling theſe Duties, is in a modeſt and humble endeavour,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:009225_0003_1030BAD675C08368"/>
by calm reaſon and argument, to convince mankind of their miſtakes when they happen to be guilty of any. The more elevated the perſon who errs, the ſtronger ſometimes is the obligation to refute him; for the Errors of great men are often of very dangerous conſequence to themſelves, as well as to the little ones below them. However it is a very diſagreable taſk, to engage in any kind of oppoſition to the leaſt individual in Society; and much more ſo when the opinions of Gentlemen of the firſt rank and abilities, and of publick bodies of men are to be called in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The world ever has been and will be pretty equally divided, between thoſe two great parties, vulgarly called the <hi>winners,</hi> and the <hi>looſers;</hi> or to ſpeak more preciſely, between thoſe who are diſcontented that they have no Power, and thoſe who never think they can have enough.</p>
            <p>Now, it is abſolutely impoſſible to pleaſe both ſides, either by temporizing, trimming or retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the two former juſtly incur the cenſure of a wicked heart, the latter that of cowardice, and fairly and manfully fighting the battle out, is in the opinion of many worſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I HAVE now to lay before you a Requiſition of His Excellency Sir JEFFERY AMHERST, who, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the great and important Services on which His Majeſty's Regular Troops are now employed, and the Uncertainty of their Return, render it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, that Proviſion ſhould be made in Time for garriſoning the ſeveral Poſts on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent during the Winter, deſires that you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for continuing in Pay the ſame Number of Troops that remained during laſt Winter; that is, Six Captains, Thirteen Subalterns, and Five Hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and Seventy Two Privates, amounting in the whole to Five Hundred and ninety one Men.</p>
                        <p>I MUST obſerve to you that the Neceſſity of this Requeſt ariſes from the preſent vigorous Exertion in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> which promiſes effectually to humble the Pride of our Enemies, and pave the Way to Peace. As this glorious Expedition cannot but have your entire Approbation, I doubt not but you will readily embrace this Opportunity to give a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Teſtimony of it.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>French</hi> Invaſion of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> muſt give you great Concern upon Account of the National Loſs which the Interruption of the Fiſhery there muſt have occaſioned, although this Province will not, in its own particular, greatly ſuffer thereby. But I am perſuaded that the Reign of the <hi>French</hi> in thoſe Parts is by this Time near over; and I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that this Government will have ſome Share in the Honour of putting an End to it.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009225_0006_1030BADB555F4870"/>
Advice of Council to take ſome cautionary Steps which have been attended with Expence. But as theſe Meaſures were adviſed with an apparent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency, and have been conducted in the moſt frugal Manner, I doubt not but what has been done will have your Approbation. I ſhall inform you of the Occaſion of theſe Expences, and order the Accounts thereof to be laid before you.</p>

I hope this ſpirit will ever remain as an indelible Characteriſtick of this People. Every thing valuable is now at ſtake. Our moſt Gracious Sovereign, and his royal Predeceſſor, of bleſſed memory, have for ſome years been engaged in a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009225_0007_1030BADE50574210"/>
bloody and expenſive, but moſt juſt and neceſſary War, with the powerful Enemies of their Perſons, Crown and Dignity; and conſequently of all <hi>our</hi> invaluable civil and religious Rights and Priviledges. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has declared the juſtice of this War, by giving us the moſt aſtoniſhing ſeries of Victories and Triumphs recorded in ancient or modern ſtory. From theſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes we had reaſon to hope that the War would have ended laſt year in a glorious peace. Our King and Father has condeſcended to tell us that his Endeavours for that purpoſe were fruſtrated by Gallic Chicanery and Perfidy. The King of Spain has been prevailed upon to break his Neutrality, to forſake his alliance with Great Britain, to turn a deaf Ear to the Intereſt and Cries of his own Subjects, and to attach himſelf to the Party of France and of Hell. But Heaven ſtill ſmiles upon his Majeſty's Arms. We have within this Hour received undoubted Intelligence of a memorable Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obtained by Prince Ferdinand of Brunſwick; and of the Reduction of the Havannah, the Key of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Treaſury. Beſides an immenſe Value in ſpecie we have taken and deſtroyed one quarter of the Spaniſh navy. This has been done at a bad Seaſon of the year and in Spite of as Gallant a defence as ever was made of a ſtrong Hold. <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> the Fate of North America, and perhaps ultimately of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain herſelf depends upon this War.</p>
                        <p>Our own immediate Intereſt therefore, as well as the general Cauſe of our King and Country, requires that we ſhould contribute the laſt peny, and the laſt drop of Blood, rather than, that by any backwardneſs of ours, his Majeſty's Meaſures ſhould be embarraſſed; and thereby any of the Enterprizes, that may be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Regular Troops miſcarry. Some of theſe Conſiderations, I preſume, induced the Aſſembly, upon his Majeſty's Requiſition, ſignified laſt Spring by Lord <hi>Egremont</hi> ſo cheerfully and unanimouſly to raiſe thirty three Hundred Men for the preſent Campaign; and upon another Requiſition, ſignified by Sir <hi>Jeffery Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſt,</hi>
                           <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009225_0008_1030BAE2CE629248"/>
to give a handſome bounty for inliſting about nine Hundred more into the regular Service. The Colonies we know, have been often blamed without Cauſe; and we have had ſome ſhare of it. Witneſs the miſcarriage of the pretended Expedition againſt Canada in Queen Anne's Time, juſt before the infamous Treaty of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> It is well known by ſome now living in this Metropolis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that every Article, that was to be provided here, was in ſuch readineſs, that the Officers, both of the army and navy, expreſſed the utmoſt Surpriſe at it upon their arrival. To ſome of them no doubt it was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment; for in order to ſhift the Blame of this ſhameful affair from themſelves they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to lay it upon the New-England Colonies. I remember, that by ſome, who would be thought faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hiſtorians, the miſcarriage at Auguſtin in the laſt War, has been attributed to the neglect of the Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. But it is now notorious to all, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Conduct of that War, ſo far as the miniſtry were concerned, has been judged to be one continued abuſe upon the Sovereign and his People. Thank God, we are fallen into better Times. The King, the miniſtry, and the People are happily united in a vigorous purſuit of the common good. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then if <hi>we</hi> ſhould diſcover the leaſt remiſsneſs in his Majeſty's Service, as we ſhould be truly blame-worthy, we may depend upon having matters repreſented in the ſtrongeſt light againſt us, by thoſe who delight to do us harm.</p>
                        <p>I am therefore clearly for raiſing the men, if Gen. <hi>Amherſt</hi> ſhould not inform us, by the return of the next mail, that he ſhall have no occaſion for them. But as his Letter is dated the 4th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> before even Moore Caſtle was taken, and ſince the Reduction of the Havannah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a number of the Regulars are returned to New-York it is poſſible the General may have altered his

Sentiments, as to the neceſſity of theſe Provincials.</p>
                        <p>Waiting 2 or 3 Days however can't make any odds in this Buſineſs, as our Troops are all inliſted to the laſt of October. Upon the whole <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> I am for a Committee to take the Governor's Speech and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Requiſition into Conſideration, and make report" This being ſeconded, <hi>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Otis, Mr. Tyler,</hi> General <hi>Winſlow,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Witt,</hi> were appointed a Committee to take ſaid Speech and Requiſition into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and make report. The Committee waited a few Days for the Return of the Expreſs, but hearing nothing further about the men it was taken for granted that the General expected them. The Committee therefore without debate unanimouſly reported to the Houſe in favour of raiſing them at the bounty of Four Pounds each, that is, ten Shillings more than was given in the Spring. This Report was likewiſe almoſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly accepted, and the men are now inliſting.</p>
                        <p>Here is another Inſtance of the readineſs of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to do every thing in their Power for his Majeſty's Service. This Spirit notwithſtanding many ungenerous Suggeſtions to the contrary, has remarkably diſcovered itſelf in moſt if not all the Britiſh Colonies during the whole War.

            <p>Upon the reading of this letter, it was moved to inſert theſe words, to wit, <q>with all due reverence to his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſacred Perſon and Government, to both which we profeſs the ſincereſt attachment and loyalty be it ſpoken it would be of little importance, &amp;c.</q> But a certain member crying <hi>"Raſe them," "Raſe them,"</hi>

words, under which his Excellency had placed a black mark, were accordingly eraſed and expunged, and the Meſſage returned to the Speaker.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of the debate a new and ſurprizing doctrine was advanced. We have ſeen the times when the majority of a council by their words and actions have ſeemed to think themſelves obliged to comply with every Thing propoſed by the Chair, and to have no rule of conduct but a Governor's will and pleaſure. But now for the firſt time, it was aſſerted that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in all caſes was obliged to act according to the advice of the council, and conſequently would be deemed to have no Judgment of his own.</p>
            <p>In order to excuſe if not altogether juſtify the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Paſſage, and clear it from ambiguity, I beg leave to premiſe two or three <hi>data.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The natural liberty of man is to be free from any ſuperior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legiſlative authority of man; but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of man in ſociety, is to be under no other legiſlative power, but that eſtabliſhed by conſent in the common wealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or reſtraint of any law, but what that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature ſhall enact according to the truſt put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> tells us, O. A. 55. A liberty for every one to do what he liſts, to live as he pleaſes, and not to be tied by any laws. But freedom of men under government, is to have a ſtanding rule to live by, common to every one of that ſociety, and made by the legiſlative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule preſcribes not, and not to be ſubject to the unknown, unconſtant, uncertain, arbitrary will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man; a freedom of nature is to be under no reſtraint but the law of nature. This freedom from abſolute arbitrary power, is ſo neceſſary to, and cloſely joined with a man's preſervation, that he cannot part with it but by what forfeits his preſervation &amp; life toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For a man not having power over his own life, cannot by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or his own conſent enſlave himſelf to any one, nor put himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the abſolute arbitrary power of another, to take away his life when he pleaſes: no body can give more power than he has himſelf. He that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.</p>

                     <hi>Locke</hi>'s DISCOURSE on GOVERN'T. Part II. CH. IV.</bibl>
                  <p>The legiſlative, whether placed in one or more, whether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though it be the ſupreme power in every common-wealth, yet in the utmoſt bounds of it, it is limited to the public good of the ſociety, it is a power that hath no end but preſervation; and thoſe can never have a right to deſtroy, enſlave or deſignedly to impoveriſh the ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the bounds to which the truſt that is put in them, by the Society, and the laws of God and nature, have ſet to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power of every common wealth, in all forms of government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are to govern by eſtabliſhed promulgated laws, not to be varied in particular caſes; but to have one rule for rich and poor, for the favourite at court, and the countryman at plough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe laws ought to be deſigned for no other end ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, but the good of the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They muſt not raiſe taxes on the property of the people, without the conſent of the people, given by themſelves or deputies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The legiſlature neither muſt not can transfer the power of making laws to any body elſe, nor place it any where but where the people have.</p>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Id.</hi> Ch. XI.</bibl>
                  <p>Where the legiſlative and executive power are in diſtinct hands, as they are in all moderated monarchies and well formed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there the good of the ſociety requires that ſeveral things ſhould be left to the diſcretion of him that has the ſupreme executive power. This power to act according to diſcretion for the public good, without the preſcription of Law, and ſometimes even againſt it, is that which is called <hi>PREROGATIVE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This power, while employed for the benefit of the community, and ſuitably to the truſt and ends of government, is undoubted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and never is queſtioned. For the people are very ſeldom or never ſcrupulous or nice in the point, they are far from examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prerogative whilſt it is in any tolerable degree employed for the uſe it was meant, that is for the good of the people, and not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly againſt it. But if there comes to be a queſtion between the executive power and the people, about a thing claimed as a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the tendency of the exerciſe of ſuch prerogative to the good or hurt of the people, will eaſily decide the queſtion. Prerogative is nothing but the power of doing public good without a rule. The old queſtion will be aſked in this matter of Prerogative, But who ſhall be judge when this power is made a right uſe of? I anſwer, between an executive power in being with ſuch prerogative, and a legiſlative, that depends upon his will, for their convening, there can be no judge on earth, as there can be none between the legiſlative and the people. Should either the executive or legiſlative, when they have got this power in their hands, deſign or go about to deſtroy them, the people have no other remedy in this, as in other caſes, when they have no judge upon earth, but to appeal to heaven. Nor let any one think that this lays a perpetual foundation for diſorder, for this operates not 'till the inconveniency is ſo great that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a neceſſity to have it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. But this the executive power or wiſe Princes never need come in the danger of; and it is the thing of all others, they have moſt need to avoid; as of all others the moſt perilous.</p>

                  <p>This other original Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has demonſtrated to be the conſent of a free people. It is poſſible there are a few, and I deſire to thank God there is no reaſon to think there are many among us, that can't bear the names of LIBERTY and PROPERTY, much leſs that the things ſignified by thoſe terms, ſhould be enjoyed by the vulgar. Theſe may be inclined to brand ſome of the principles advanced in the vindication of the houſe, with the odious epithets <hi>ſeditious</hi> and <hi>levelling.</hi> Had any thing to juſtify them been quoted from Col. <hi>Algernon, Sidney,</hi> or other Britiſh Martyrs, to the liberty of their country, an outcry of rebellion would not be ſurprizing. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has therefore been preferred to all others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for theſe further reaſons. 1 He was not only one of the moſt wiſe, as well as moſt honeſt, but the moſt impartial man that ever lived. 2. He profeſſedly wrote his diſcourſes on Government, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſſes it, "To eſtabliſh the throne of the great reſtorer king <hi>William,</hi> to make good his title in the conſent of the people, which being the only one of all lawful governments, he had more fully and clearly, than any Prince in chriſtendom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to juſtify to the world, the people of England whoſe love of liberty, their juſt and natural rights, with their reſolution to preſerve them, ſaved the nation when it was on the brink of ſlavery and ruin." By this title, our Illuſtrious Sovereign GEORGE the III. (whom GOD long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) now holds. 3. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> was as great an ornament, under a crown'd head, as the church of England ever had to boaſt off. Had all her ſons been of his wiſe, moderate, tolerant principles, we ſhould probably never have heard of thoſe civil diſſentions that have ſo often brought the nation to the borders of perdition. Upon the ſcore of his being a Churchman however, his ſentiments are leſs liable to the inviduous reflections and inſinuations that High-flyers, Jacobites, and other ſtupid Big<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſave my life than the name of the executioner, needs no Proof. It is therefore manifeſtly of no importance what a prince's chriſtian name is, if he be arbitrary, any more, indeed, than if he were not arbitrary. So the whole amount of this dangerous propoſition may at leaſt in one view be reduced to this, viz. <hi>It is of little importance what a King's chriſtian name is.</hi> It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of importance that a King, a Governor, and all other good chriſtians ſhould have a chriſtian name, but whether Edward, Francis or William, is of none, that I can diſcern. It being a rule to put the moſt mild and favourable conſtruction upon words that they can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bear, it will follow that this propoſition is a very harmleſs one, that cannot by any means tend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice his Majeſty's Perſon, Crown, Dignity or Cauſe, all which I deem equally ſacred with his Excellency.</p>
            <p>If this propoſition will bear an hundred different conſtructions, they muſt all be admitted before any that imports any bad meaning, much more a treaſonable one.</p>
            <p>It is conceived the houſe intended nothing diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of His Majeſty, his Government or Governor, in thoſe words. It would be very injurious to inſinuate this of a houſe that upon all occaſions has diſtinguiſhed itſelf by a truly loyal ſpirit, and which ſpirit poſſeſſes at leaſt nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thouſand of their conſtituents throughout the province. One good natured conſtruction at leaſt ſeems to be implied in the aſſertion, and that pretty ſtrongly, viz. that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation of Great Britain and France, it is of vaſt importance to be a Briton, rather than a Frenchman; as the French King is an arbitrary deſpotic Prince; but the King of Great Britain is not ſo <hi>de jure, de facto,</hi> nor by <hi>inclination;</hi> a greater difference on this ſide the <hi>Grave</hi> cannot be found, than that which ſubſiſts between Britiſh ſubjects, and the ſlaves of tyranny.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be objected that there is ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence even between arbitrary Princes in this reſpect at leaſt, that ſome are more rigorous than others. It is granted, but then let it be remembred, that the life of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009225_0022_1030316D84D997A8"/>
man is as a vapour that ſoon vaniſheth away, and we know not who may come after him, a wiſe man or a fool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' the chances before and ſince Solomon, have ever been in favour of the latter. Therefore it is ſaid of little conſequence. Had it been <hi>No</hi> inſtead of <hi>little,</hi> the clauſe upon the moſt rigid ſtricture might have been found barely exceptionable.</p>
            <p>Some fine Gentlemen have charged the expreſſion as indelicate. This is a capital impeachment in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and therefore demands our moſt ſerious attention. The idea of delicacy in the creed of ſome politicians, implies that an inferior ſhould at the peril of all that is near and dear to him (i. e. his intereſt) avoid every the leaſt trifle that can offend his ſuperior. Does my ſuperior want my eſtate? I muſt give it him, and that with a good grace, which is appearing, and if poſſible being really obliged to him that he will condeſend to take it. The reaſon is evident; it might give him ſome little pain or uneaſineſs to ſee me whimpering, much more openly complaining at the loſs of a little glittering dirt. I muſt according to this ſyſtem not only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to acquire my ſelf, but impreſs upon all around me a reverence and <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> to the ſentiments of my ſuperior, little ſhort of adoration. Is the ſuperior in contemplation a king, I muſt conſider him as God's vicegerent, cloathed with unlimited power, his will the ſupreme law, and not accountable for his actions, let them be what they may, to any tribunal upon earth. Is the ſuperior a plantation governor? he muſt be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only as the moſt excellent repreſentation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, but as a viceroy in his department, and <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The votaries of this ſect are all Monopolizers of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Peculators, Informers, and generally the Seekers of all kinds. It is better, ſay they, "to give up any thing, and every thing quietly, than contend with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,

who by his prerogative can do, and (as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar expreſs it) right or wrong, will have whatever he pleaſes. For you muſt know, that according to ſome of the moſt refined and faſhionable ſyſtems of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern politics, the ideas of right and wrong, and all the moral virtues, are to be conſidered only as the vagaries of a weak or diſtempered imagination in the poſſeſſor, and of no uſe in the world, but for the ſkilful politician to convert to his own purpoſes of power and profit.</p>

            <p>It is well known that the leaſt "patriotic ſpark" un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares "catched," and diſcovered, diſqualifies a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate from all further preferment in this famous and flouriſhing order of knights errant. It muſt howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be confeſſed they are ſo catholic as to admit all ſorts from the knights of the poſt to a garter and Star; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they are thoroughly diveſted of the fear of God, and the love of mankind; and have concentrated all their views in <hi>dear ſelf,</hi> with them the only <q>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and well-beloved name, or thing in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</q> See Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s <hi>Political Teſtament,</hi> and the greater Bible of the Sect, <hi>Mandeville</hi>'s <hi>Fable of the Bees. Richlieu</hi> expreſly in ſolemn earneſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſarcaſm or irony, adviſes the diſcarding all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men from the preſence of a prince, and from even the purlieus of a court. According to Mandeville, <hi>"The</hi> moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride." The moſt darling princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the great Apoſtle of the order, who has done more than any mortal towards diffuſing corruption, not only thro' the three kingdoms, but thro' the remoteſt dominions, is, "that every man has his price, and that if you bid high enough, you are ſure of him".</p>

difference between the ſentiments of a Britiſh houſe of commons remonſtrating, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe of a courtier cringing for a favour. A houſe of Repreſentatives here at leaſt, bears an equal proportion to a Governor, with that of a houſe of Commons to the King. There is indeed one difference in favour of a houſe of Repreſentatives; when a houſe of Commons addreſs the King. they ſpeak to their Sovereign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is truly the moſt auguſt Perſonage upon earth: When a houſe of Repreſentatives remonſtrate to a Governor, they ſpeak to a fellow ſubject; tho' a ſuperior, who is undoubtedly intitled to decency and reſpect; but I hardly think to quite ſo much Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as his maſter.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to obſerve, that a form of ſpeech may be, in no ſort improper, when uſed <hi>arguendo,</hi> or for illuſtration, ſpeaking of the King, which ſame form might be very harſh, indecent and even ridiculous, if ſpoken to the King.</p>
            <p>The expreſſion under cenſure has had the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divers Gentlemen of ſenſe, who are quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced by any party. They have taken it to imply a compliment rather than any indecent reflection, upon his Majeſty's wiſe and gracious adminiſtration. It ſeems ſtrange therefore that the houſe ſhould be ſo ſuddenly charged by his Excellency with <hi>Impropriety, groundleſs Inſinuations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What cauſe of ſo bitter Repentance, <hi>again</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> could poſſibly have taken place, if this clauſe had been printed in the Journal, I can't imagine. If the caſe be fairly repreſented, I gueſs the province can be in no danger from a houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives daring to ſpeak plain Engliſh, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a grievance. I ſincerely believe the houſe had no diſpoſition to enter into any conteſt with the Governor or Council. Sure I am that the promoters of this addreſs had no ſuch view. On the contrary, there is the higheſt reaſon to preſume that the houſe of Repreſentatives will at all times rejoice in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the Governor and Council, and contribute
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009225_0025_1030BB0C81AAA6A8"/>
their utmoſt aſſiſtance, in ſupporting thoſe two branches of the legiſlature, in all their juſt rights and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. But the houſe is and ought to be jealous and tenacious of its own priviledges; theſe are a ſacred depoſit intruſted by the people, and the jealouſy of them is a godly jealouſy.</p>
            <p>But to proceed with our narration; on Saturday about a quarter before one of the Clock, Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary came down with his Excellency's vindication, which is as follows.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have received an Anſwer from you to a Meſſage of mine; informing you of my having upon a ſudden Apprehenſion of Danger, fitted out the Province Sloop to protect a conſiderable and very intereſting Fiſhery, belonging to this Province: Upon which Occaſion you are pleaſed to obſerve, that the Method of doing this, which you call <hi>making or increaſing Eſtabliſhments is taking from the Houſe the Right of originating Taxes, annihilating one Branch of the Legiſlature,</hi> and tending to make <hi>the Government arbitrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are hard Words: and the Conſciouſneſs of my own Integrity will not permit me to ſubmit in Silence to ſuch Imputations. I know what the Priviledges of the People are, and their Nature and Bounds: and I can truly ſay that it has never been in my Thoughts to make the leaſt Invaſion of them. If therefore you think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſend ſuch a Charge as this to the Preſs; I muſt deſire that my Vindication may accompany it.</p>
                  <p>In Order to which I ſhall firſt conſider what the legal and conſtitutional Powers of the Governor and Council are, then ſtate the Fact in Queſtion, and by Application of the one to the other, ſee whether the Concluſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>y can be ſufficient to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a Houſe of Repreſentatives in giving up the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of originating Taxes;</hi> as I do not believe that ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ed by any Perſon concerned in the Government, or that any Governor and Council
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009225_0026_1030BB0E1F695608"/>
ſince the Revolution attempted or ever will attempt to tax the People.</p>
                  <p>The Buſineſs of originating the Taxes moſt certainly belongs to the Repreſentatives of the People, and the Buſineſs of iſſuing Money out of the Treaſury<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly belongs to the Governor with the Advice of the Council. In general all Votes and Orders for the Charge of the Government originate in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and the Money for defreying ſuch Charges is iſſued by Warrant of the Governor with the Advice of Council, without any further Reference to the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
                  <p>But as it is impoſſible that the General Court ſhould provide for every Contingency that may happen unleſs they were continually ſitting; there will ſometimes be Caſes in which the Governor, with the Council, is to be juſtified in iſſuing Money for Services not expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the General Court: Of theſe there are two very obvious.</p>
                  <p>The one is, where a Danger ariſes ſo immediate and imminent that there is no Time for calling together the Aſſembly. In this, I apprehend there is no other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of Expence, but in Proportion to the Evil impending: For the Safety of the People being the ſupreme Law, ſhould at all Events be provided for.</p>
                  <p>The other is, where the Expence of ſome neceſſary Service is ſo inconſiderable, as to be not worth the while to put the Province to the Charge of the Aſſembly's meeting for that Purpoſe only, at an Expence perhaps ten or twenty Times more than the Sum in Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be the Law and Uſage of every Royal Government on the Continent. In that over which I formerly preſided, where the People were very averſe to frequent or long Seſſions of the Aſſembly, I have upon an Emergency, with Advice of the Council only, raiſed Three Hundred Men at a Time, and marched them to the Defence of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>; and when the Aſſembly has met, have received their Thanks for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:009225_0027_1030BB0FBA141290"/>Now let me ſtate the Caſe in Queſtion. Moſt of the principal Merchants in <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Marblehead,</hi> who were conſiderably intereſted in a Fiſhery near the Gut of <hi>Canſo,</hi> in which I am told upwards of One Hundred Veſſels from this Province were employed, received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that there was a French Privateer or Pirate cruiſing in thoſe Parts. It has appeared ſince, that this Alarm was not peculiar to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Province: It reached <hi>Quebec,</hi> from whence an armed Schooner was fitted out to look after this Frenchman. It re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ched <hi>New-York,</hi> from whence General AMHERST a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iſed me of this French Veſſel. Theſe Merchants therefore applying by their Deputies to me for an immediate Protection of their Fiſhery, I laid the Matter before the Council, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening that the Province Sloop was juſt returned from <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> it was adviſed by the Council, that ſhe ſhould be immediately fitted out to go to the Protection of this Fiſhery: this was done in the moſt frugal Manner poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; out of Fifty Men put on board the Sloop, only twenty-four were charged to the Province, the reſt were drawn out of the Provincials employed at <hi>Caſtle-William,</hi> and in the recruiting Service; the Ammunition and Military Stores were taken from the Caſtle, to which they have been reſtored without Loſs or Expence; the Men were engaged only for one Month, after which they were not to be continued without the Advice of the General Court. This is the true State of this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action; and ſurely I may ſay it deſerved a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Animadverſion than what it has had.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply it to the Cenſure it has met with: This was an Act which the Governor with the Council had a Right to do; it was a legal and conſtitutional Exerciſe of the Powers veſted in them; it was an Exertion of the Executive Power of the Government, diſtinct from that of the Legiſlature. If it was wrong and ill adviſed (which I don't mean to admit) it could amount to no more than an improper Application of the public Money, by thoſe who have lawful Authority to apply ſuch Money to the public Purpoſes. When this Diſtinction
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009225_0028_1030BB1157EB13D0"/>
is conſidered; how can this Act, whether right or wrong, be applied to the Right of originating Taxes, annihilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Branch of the Legiſlature and making the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment arbitrary?</p>
                  <p>As for the diſcretionary Part of the Act, after I have had the Advice of the Council, and the Approbation of my own Judgment and Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall not enter into any f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rther Argument about it, than juſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; That if the Governor and Council legally acting in the Executive Adminiſtration, and determining to the beſt of their Judgment and Skill, with a conſcientious Regard to the Good fo the People, ſhall be liable to be called to account for Difference of Opinion only, the Government will be very much weakned. But I ſhall perſuade myſelf that a ſteady Attention to the Peace and Welfare of the Province, which you recommend to Me, will always ſufficiently juſtify my Conduct: and in that Confidence I hope I ſhall never fail to exert the Powers which have been committed to Me for the Defence and Protection of the People of this Province, by all lawful and conſtitutional Means.</p>

            <p>This being read, the Secretary inſtantly informed the Speaker, that his Excellency directed the attendance of the houſe in the council chamber.</p>
            <p>The two houſes had finiſhed the publick buſineſs; and before this the houſe of Repreſentatives had by a committee aſked a receſs, ſo it was preſumed the houſe was ſent for to be prorogued, as it turned out. The Speaker roſe to, go up to the council, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the houſe to attend him, the uſual and regular form, which it is preſumed was forgot. But it was moved that his Excellency's vindication, according to his deſire, ſhould be printed in the Journal. This motion was ſeconded, and paſſed in the affirmative by a great majority. Then a motion was made and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, for a committee to prepare a Reply to this
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009225_0029_1030BB15C2A8F050"/>
vindication in the receſs of the court, and to make report at the next ſeſſion; this alſo paſſed in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative by a conſiderable majority, and Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Otis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> were choſen a committee for ſaid purpoſe. Then the Houſe immediately attended his Excellency in the Council-Chamber. When his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, after giving his aſſent to two or three bills, prorogued the court.</p>
            <p>It was wiſhed, at leaſt by the moderate part of the houſe, that his Excellency had thought fit ſo far to give up the point, as to wave any conteſt about it, by aſſuring the houſe, that if his right was ever ſo clear, he would not exerciſe it, if grievous to the people. A like condeſcenſion crowned heads have practiſed, and found their account in it; as I am perſuaded his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency would, if the unanimous vote of thanks from the whole repreſentative body of this people is worth any thing. This I gueſs he would have had: And as it is a maxim that the King can do no wrong, but that whatever is amiſs is owing intirely to thoſe about him; ſo, with regard to his Excellency, we ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the beſt; and that it is to be charged to the account of ſome weak or wicked adviſers, that this buſineſs did not end happily. However, the matter is now become very ſerious, by his Excellency's vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; which we ſhall next conſider.</p>
            <p>The Charter of the province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, has inveſted the Governor and Council with power to iſſue (without the concurrence of the Houſe, as it is now conſtrued, or rather as the genuine ſenſe of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been waved by former Houſes) the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is manifeſt from the Charter, that the <hi>Acts</hi> of the province are the only legal and conſtitutional juſtification to the Governor and Council, in iſſuing any money out of the treaſury: <hi>"According to ſuch Acts as are or ſhall be in force within our ſaid Province,"</hi> are certainly no unmeaning words.</p>
            <p>It is clear from hence, that without the aid of an <hi>Act</hi> of the province, the Governor and Council cannot le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally take a ſhilling out of the treaſury, let the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency be what it may. It is agreed with his Excellency, that in iſſuing Money from the treaſury, as the charter
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009225_0031_1030BB1F23B8FD30"/>
has of late years been conſtrued, the Governor and Council are meer executive officers. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers-general of the Treaſury, i. e. the treaſurer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay without their warrant; but then they are as much bound by the acts of the province, as the treaſurer himſelf. He, the Treaſurer, indeed may be called to an account, but they can't, being in other reſpects two branches of the Legiſlature. The only remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a remonſtrance, and when that proves ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, the houſe may and ought to refuſe to ſupply the Treaſury, and ſtop a few Grants and Salaries; which would ſoon bring matters right without any dangerous ſhock to Government, or weakening thereof; but what the whole world muſt impute to a Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that would oblige a Houſe to have recourſe to the laſt reſort, but one; I mean as we are a dependent Government, a dutiful and humble remonſtrance to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of Great-Britain have as the laſt reſort, been known to appeal to Heaven, and the longeſt ſword; but God ſorbid that there ever ſhould be occaſion for any thing of that kind again; indeed there is not the leaſt danger of it ſince the glorious revolution, and the happy eſtabliſhment reſulting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. It was formerly the cuſtom for the Speaker of the houſe to ſign all warrants upon the treaſury, but this was at laſt either tamely given up, or at leaſt waved.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, that tho' our ſupply bills appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate by far the greateſt part of the ſums raiſed, yet ſomething is always expreſly left for contingencies, and the Governor and Council may and muſt in the nature of the thing apply this at diſcretion. I anſwer, 1. Even this is iſſued by force of an act, and not by virtue of any general power in the Governor and Council, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the act. 2. Neither cuſtom nor uſage ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this ſum appropriated for contingencies could be applied to the fitting out of men of war, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhments for them; for armed veſſels is one expreſs appropriation in our acts, which ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It has been ſaid that there were no privateers among the fiſhermen, but that when they diſcovered the ſloop, ſhe was taken for one, and that many of the fiſhermen ran home in a fright, and loſt their fares. How true this is I can't ſay, but have heard it reported, and believe there is at leaſt as much ground for it as there was to believe the ſtory of fourteen pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers. The Governor and Council doubtleſs meant well as to the protection of the fiſhery, and had there been no unjuſtifiable extenſion of their power, every one would have thankfully acquieſced. The money for fitting out this ſloop might have been raiſed by the Governor and Council's promiſe to recommend a reimburſement to the aſſembly. They might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have borrowed it of the Treaſurer upon the ſame terms, and the priviledges of the Houſe thereby would have been preſerve. It would be a very eaſy thing

to raiſe twenty times the ſum wanted to fit out this ſloop upon the credit of a like recommendation. This method was taken in fitting out the King George in 1761, as appears by the vote of Council, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's meſſage afterwards to the houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, and their vote thereupon, which laſt are as follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The council were of opinion, that the ſhip ſhould be immediately fitted out: and in order to do it with more expedition, I offered that if the crew could be quickly compleated to an hundred men, I would put fifty provincials on board for a ſhort cruize. It was therefore "adviſed to raiſe ſeventy men, and to give ten Dollars bounty: But there was no fund in the Treaſury to <hi>reſort</hi> to for this purpoſe.

            <p>The Governor and Council have naturally a great influence in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </gap> once taken up and applied, it would ſeem hard to make the ſubſcribers loſe it; and ſo in time it would come to be a thing of courſe, for the Houſe to reimburſe all expences the Governor and Council ſhould be pleaſed to create in the receſs of the aſſembly; and after a courſe of tame acquieſcence in ſuch a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the Houſe would become as ſome deſire to have it, a very inſignificant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unimportant part of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is therefore the indiſpenſible duty of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, to be very cautious how they allow or approve of any expences incurred even in this way.</p>
            <p>His Excellency is pleaſed to wave any inquiry "whether any neceſſity can be ſufficient to juſtify a Houſe of Repreſentatives in giving up the privilege of originating taxes?" for this reaſon only expreſſed; viz. "I don't believe (ſays his Excellency) that ſuch a ceſſion was ever deſired by any Perſon concerned in the government, or that any Governor and Council ſince the revolution, attempted or ever will attempt to tax the people" I wiſh I could exerciſe as much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards former Governors and Councils, as for his Excellency and the preſent honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but I can't. I am verily perſuaded, that we have had ſome Governors and ſome Councellors, ſince the revolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that would gladly have been as abſolute as Turkiſh Baſhaws; and that the whole tenor of their actions has given convincing proof of ſuch a diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>A tax upon the people in form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by iſſuing a tax bill, and ordering an aſſeſſment, I believe has not been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by a Governor and Council ſince the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This would be too alarming. The vulgar are apt to be forcibly affected with names and appearances, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009225_0035_1030BB2A1441CE68"/>
than by realities. If the money can be drawn out of the treaſury without any regard to the appropriations, made by the acts of the province; and the Houſe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever called upon, will without murmuring ſupply the treaſury again; they ſerve the purpoſe of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient machine to quiet the people; and the money flows in with greater eaſe and plenty than if the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council were, <hi>ad libitum,</hi> to collect and diſſipate the public treaſure.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that in France and other deſpotic governments, 'tis often with great difficulty, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with hazard, that the revenue is collected. Had <hi>Richlieu</hi> and <hi>Mazarine</hi> convinced the parliaments that it was a great priviledge to be allowed to vote as much money as was called for, and for any purpoſe the court might want it, the government would have had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of liberty under a tyranny; which to thoſe miniſters would have been a vaſt eaſe and ſecurity. But thoſe great politicians either never thought of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, or, the parliaments were too ſtupid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, of the utility of ſuch a plan.</p>
            <p>His Excellency proceeds, "The buſineſs of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the taxes moſt certainly belongs to the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people; and the buſineſs of iſſuing money out of the treaſury, as certainly belongs to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council." To ſay nothing of the doubt that might juſtly be made, whether a non-claim, waver, or even an expreſs conceſſion by any former houſe, of the privilege of joining in a warrant, for iſſuing the money, can be binding upon their Succeſſors? Would not a ſtranger to our conſtitution be lead to think, from this general aſſertion of the Governor, that he with the Council, could iſſue money without regard to the acts of the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The other is, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſome neceſſary ſervice is ſo inconſiderable, as to be not worth the while to put the province to the charge of the Aſſembly's meeting for that purpoſe only, at an expence perhaps of ten or twenty times more than the ſum in queſtion." Frequent and long ſeſſions I know are burthenſome to the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many think they had better give up every thing, than not have ſhort ſeſſions. But let theſe conſider that it is a very poor bargain, that for the ſake of avoiding a ſeſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, ſacrifices the right of being taxed by their Repreſentatives; and riſques ten or twenty times the ſum in the end, to be levied by a Governor and Council. I know too, that ſome gentlemen in order to leſſen the weight of a Houſe of Repreſentatives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are conſtantly exclaiming againſt long and frequent ſeſſions; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are gulled with the bait, and the houſe when they meet, are often in want of time to compleat the public buſineſs, in the manner that they would wiſh, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome affairs requires. What is the conſequence? Why, it is become a very faſhionable doctrine with ſome, that in the receſs of the court, the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are veſted with all the powers of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. It is coſtly and unpopular to have frequent and long ſeſſions; therefore they ſhall be few, ſhort and hurried; and in the mean time, the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhall have a right to do what they judge "the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme law," the good of the common-wealth, requires, and no limitation or bounds are to be ſet to the money they expend, but their ſovereign judgment of the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of the impending evil; for, "the ſafety of the people being the ſupreme law, ſhould at all events, and

by all means <hi>(but that of calling an aſſembly togother)</hi> be provided for." This is a ſhort method to put it in the power of the Governor and Council, to do as they pleaſe with the men and money of the province; and thoſe Governor's who can do as they pleaſe with the men and money of a country, ſeem to me to be, (or at leaſt are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> pretty fair way ſoon to be) arbitrary; which in plain Engliſh means no more than to do as one pleaſes. As to thoſe inconſiderable ſervices, not worth while to put the province to the charge of an aſſembly; it ſeems to be of no great importance whether they are performed or not. 2. There is always an appropriation for contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, great and ſmall. If this ſum ſhould be exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient might always be procured upon the credit of a recommendation from the Governor and Council, for a reimburſement. 3. Any particular ſervice had better ſuffer, and the province ſuffer that way, than loſe ſuch a priviledge as that of taxing themſelves; upon which ſingle priviledge evidently depends all others, <hi>Civil and Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency tells us of "the law and uſage of every royal government upon the continent;" and that, "in that over which he preſided formerly, he had upon an emergency, with the advice of the Council only raiſed three hundred men at a time, and marched them to the defence of the frontiers, and when the aſſembly has met has received their thanks for ſo doing."</p>
            <p>Whether the aſſembly of this province equal the aſſembly of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> in gratitude or any other virtue, I ſhall not preſume to determine. But this I am ſure of, that this province has been more liberal in their grants to his Excellency, than to any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. Inſtead of any debate about <hi>his ſalary,</hi> three grants have been made in leſs than two years, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to near three thouſand pounds ſterling in the whole; beſides the very valuable iſland of Mount Deſart, which the province thought they had a right to grant, ſubject to his Majeſty's confirmation; and which his Excellency doubtleſs will have confirmed to him.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009225_0039_1030BB38407B5638"/>
All this with the ordinary perquiſites, beſides the <hi>full third</hi> of all ſeizures, muſt amount to a very handſome fortune, obtained in about two years and two months. His Excellency has not been pleaſed to tell us, whether the aſſembly paid the expence of this extraordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or whether the Governor and Council ordered it to be paid? Now if the aſſembly paid it, as they doubtleſs ought, after thanking his Excellency, and thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the utility of the meaſure, their priviledge was ſaved. But if the Governor and Council paid it out of the treaſury, and the Houſe acquieſced in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of their priviledge, it cannot be produced as a precedent for us, let it be ever ſo royal a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His Excellency has a right to tranſport any of the militia of this province to any part of it, by ſea or land, for the neceſſary defence of the ſame: and to build and demoliſh ſorts and caſtles, and with the advice of the council in times of war, to exerciſe martial law upon the militia, but then it is with the Houſe to pay the expence, or refuſe it as they pleaſe. No man by charter can be ſent out of the province but by an act of the three branches of the legiſlature. The King himſelf applies to parliament to ſupport his army and navy, and it is their duty to do it, and they ever have and will do it; and the ſupplies for theſe ever originate in, and are appropriated by the Houſe of Commons; in whoſe money bills the Houſe of Lords won't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make any amendment; conſent or reject in the whole is all the power they exerciſe in this particular.</p>
            <p>His Excellency next proceeds to ſtate "the caſe in queſtion, "by which I ſuppoſe is meant the facts relative to fitting out the ſloop Maſſachuſetts. The facts mentioned, I take it for granted are in the main true, but the moſt material one ſeems to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, namely, that the Governor and Council made an eſtabliſhment; in conſequence of which the expence of this fitting out or a great part at leaſt has been paid out of the Treaſury, by warrant from the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. There is alſo a ſmall miſtake in his Excellency's
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009225_0040_1030BB3CA5253378"/>
ſaying the ſloop was then returned. She was expected, but her return was uncertain. Had the ſloop been ſent and the pay or reimburſement referred to the Houſe, there might have been no complaint as to this particular ſtep. But the main queſtion is not as to the right of ſending the ſloop, but of making, or increaſing her eſtabliſhment, and paying it out of the publick monies without the conſent of the Houſe; not only in this, but in a number of late ſimilar inſtances, that have indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Houſe to queſtion the right of the Governor and Council to draw monies out of the treaſury in this way. Or more properly, as it reſults from the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the Houſe, and his Excellency's vindication: The queſtion is in effect, whether the Houſe have a right to appropriate the money they agree to levy upon their conſtituents?</p>
            <p>It being pretty evident I hope by this time, that if the Governor and Council can iſſue what they pleaſe, <hi>and for what</hi> they pleaſe, that the Houſe has no right to appropriate; and it is as clear that if the right of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation is of any avail or ſignificancy, the Governor and Council cannot iſſue the monies from the treaſury for what they pleaſe; but are bound and limitted by the appropriations and eſtabliſhments made by the acts of the province, to which by the way they are two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of three in the making.</p>
            <p>His Excellency having given us his ſtate of the caſe in queſtion, proceeds "to apply it to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it has met with" as his Excellency is pleaſed to expreſs it. By which I preſume his Excellency means the application he had promiſed in the beginning of his vindication. "I ſhall conſider, ſays his Excellency, what the legal and conſtitutional powers of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council are; then ſtate the <hi>fact</hi> in queſtion, and by the application of the one to the other, ſee whether the concluſion before mentioned will follow."</p>
            <p>Here again there ſeems to be ſome little obſcurity, by reaſon of theſe words, <hi>"fact in queſtion";</hi> there being no queſtion about the facts, but about the right,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009225_0041_1030BB3FBB0E87C0"/>
not ſo much about the right of fitting out the veſſel, as the Governor and Council's right to pay for it out of the treaſury, without the conſent of the Houſe. What queſtion can there be about facts? There is no doubt but that the veſſel was ſent, and that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an application from ſome Salem and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blehead gentlemen.</p>
            <p>I therefore preſume to read the ſecond paragraph of his Excellency's vindication according to the ſenſe and ſpirit, (tho' not ſtrictly agreable to the letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) thus, "In order to my vindication (dele <hi>to which</hi>) I ſhall 1.

By application of the legal and conſtitutional pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Governor and Council to the fact, ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the concluſions before mentioned will ſo low." According to this diviſion, which in the ſpirit, tho' not in the letter, is a <hi>very good one;</hi> his Excellency has given us his ſenſe of the legal and conſtitutional pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Governor and Council. His Excellency is undoubtedly as well acquainted with the nature of theſe powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as "wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ledges of the Houſe of Repreſentatives are, their nature and their bounds;" which laſt are more immediately the ſubject of inquiry, than thoſe of the people. Tho' it is true, that the priviledges of the Houſe are the great ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>His Excellency having finiſhed his ſtate of fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds according to the method premiſed to the third and laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This is evidently his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009225_0042_1030BB42D4A73758"/>
meaning. The application is mental. The concluſions are expreſs. The firſt his excellency is pleaſed to make is in theſe words. "This was an act which the Governor with the Council had a right to do." I am no great admirer of the ſyllogiſtic form of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and this dreſs is very uncourtly. yet all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive reaſoning will bear the teſt of the ſchools. Let us try an experiment. His Excellency's whole vindication may nearly in his own words be reduced to this categoric ſyllogiſm.</p>
            <p>"All the money for defreying the charges of the government <hi>is</hi> iſſued by warrant of the Governor with the advice of Council, without any further <hi>reference</hi> to the houſe of Repreſentatives."</p>
            <p>The principal merchants in Salem and Marblehead were frighted with a rumour of a privateer: upon their application the Governor and Council took the alarm, fitted out an armed veſſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by their warrant defrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the charge out of the treaſury without any reference at all to the Houſe of Repreſentatives."</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. "This was an act which the Governor with the Council had a right to do." No man in his ſenſes to be ſure can deny the major propoſition, for the word <hi>is</hi> plainly implies a right; according to <hi>Mr. Pope</hi> and other great authorities, "whatever <hi>is</hi> is right." The minor is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> facts; therefore the way is cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar to follow his Excellency in the reſt of his inferences. 2. Inference. "It was a legal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional exerciſe of the powers veſted in them." 3. "It was an exertion of the executive power, diſtinct from that of the legiſlative." 4. If it was wrong, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His Excellency then proceeds to aſk the Houſe a very important queſtion. But before we conſider what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may be given to that queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and probably would have been given, had there been time before the court was prorog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed; I beg leave to make a few obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his Excellency's three laſt inferences. I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

province, and think I may challenge any man to ſhow any thing in either, that gives the leaſt colour of right to the Governor and Council, to fit out an armed veſſel to cruize upon the high ſeas, at the expence of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or to grant a bounty for inliſting the ſeamen, or to impreſs them when they won't inliſt faſt enough, as in the caſe of the ſhip King George, or to make an eſtabliſhment for the officers and ſeam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s wages, much leſs to iſſue the money from the treaſury for defreying theſe charges by warrant of the Governor and Council, without any <hi>reference</hi> to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, who muſt upon ſuppoſition of ſuch powers be ſtrangers, total ſtrangers to the expence thus brought upon the province.</p>
            <p>But we are told that "<hi>this</hi> is an exertion of the executive power of the government, diſtinct from the legiſlative."</p>
            <p>I am as much for keeping up the diſtinction between the executive and legiſlative powers as poſſible. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, very happy, would it be for this poor province, if this diſtinction was more attended to than it ever yet has been. I am heartily rejoiced however, that his Excellency ſeems here to diſcountenance and explod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the doctrine that ſome among us have taken great pains to inculcate, viz. that in the receſs of the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the whole power of the three branches devolves upon the Governor and Council. If I may compare ſmall things with great, without offence, this doctrine is as abſurd as if a man ſhould aſſert that in the receſs of parliament, the whole power of parliament is devolved upon the King and the Houſe of Lords. Had ſuch a doctrine always prevailed in England, we ſhould have heard nothing of the oppreſſions and misfortunes of the <hi>Charles's</hi> and <hi>James's;</hi> The revolution would never have taken place; the genius of <hi>William</hi> the third would have languiſhed in the ſons of Holland, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in the plains of Flanders; the names of three George's would doubtleſs have been immortal; but Great Britain to this day might have been in chains

and darkneſs, unbleſſed with their influence. I take it for granted therefore, his Excellency muſt mean by "power of the government," not the power of the whole province in great and general court aſſembled. but only the executive power of the Governor and Council, diſtinct from the legiſlative, as juſt explained by him. Names are ſometimes confounded with things by the wiſeſt of men. It is however of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance what the power is called, if the exerciſe of it be lawful. If the power of taxing is peculiar to the general aſſembly, if the charter has confined it to the general aſſembly, as I think it evidently does, and this act of the Governor and Council is a tax upon every inhabitant, as it clearly is, being paid out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney raiſed by their repreſentatives upon them for other purpoſes, which muſt remain unſatisfied; and ſo much more muſt be raiſed upon them as is thus taken away: It follows that as all taxation ought to originate in the Houſe; this act of the Governor and Council is ſo far from being an executive act peculiar to them, that it is evidently taking upon them in their executive capacity, or what other n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne elſe, you are pleaſed to give it, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not only confined by the charter, law and conſtitution of the province, to the general aſſembly or legiſlative body of the province, but ſo far confined to one branch of that body, that it can lawfully and conſtitutionally originate only in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>If therefore this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But upon ſuppoſition the Governor and Council act wrong, and miſapply the monies of the province, which his Excellency ſeems to concede, is at leaſt a poſſible caſe. What is to be done? I agree with his Excellency that they are not liable to be called to an account, and it would be a ridiculous vanity and preſumption in the Houſe to think of <hi>any</hi> ſuch thing. We have no body to inſtitute a ſuit againſt the Governor and Council; no court to try ſuch a ſuit; all that would be left therefore in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a caſe (if the priviledge of the Houſe of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all iſſues from the treaſury has been given up by former aſſemblies, and that is binding upon their ſucceſſors, "which I don't mean to admit") is to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te. This method the Houſe have taken in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, rather than at this juncture reclaim their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient priviledge of joining in all warrants for the iſſues from the treaſury. However, I conceive that the right of joining in ſuch warrants can never die. But to confine ourſelves to his Excellency's inferences, let us for a moment concede that this act by the Governor and Council, at moſt is only a miſapplication of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick monies. The conduct of the Houſe is certainly to be juſtified. The Governor and Council of the province miſapplying money, is a grievous event, a terrible misfortune, and a dreadful example to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. It would be enough to infect ſeven eighths of the petty officers in the community. Whenever a peculator, great or ſmall, ſhould be called to an account after ſuch an event repeated, and paſſed unnoticed by the Houſe, he would at leaſt conſole and comfort, nay even plume himſelf with ſuch like reflections as theſe.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009225_0046_1030BB4F511A24B0"/>
"My betters have done ſo before me. They make what applications they pleaſe of the publick money, without regard to law, or the duty of their truſt, and ſo will I." Tho' with regard to the preſent Governor and Council, it is preſumed a miſapplication can proceed only from an error in judgment, which the wiſeſt are in a degree ſubject to, not from any ſuppoſed pravity of inclination; yet it would be of dangerous tendency, and therefore a proper ſubject of remonſtrance. A remonſtrance is not an inſolent and preſumptuous "calling a Governor and Council to an account for difference of opinion only", nor any charge of wilful evil, but only of error in judgment, and a humble endeavour to point it out; relying always upon their known goodneſs and wiſdom, that whenever they ſhall diſcover the truth, they will readily follow it. The Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons remonſtrating (as they have ſometimes done) I believe would be aſtoniſhed to hear their humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Throne called <hi>"hard words and groundleſs inſinuations,</hi> &amp;c. and viewed as calling the King to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. It is true, that the Governor and Council may do many things, if they are ſo diſpoſed, which they cannot be called to an account for in this world; but this will hardly prove that they have a right to do them, eſpecially after the whole body of the people by their Repreſentatives complain of them as grievous.

               </gap> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Council may then do every thing as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>His Excellency aſks, "When this diſtinction is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how can this act, right or wrong, be applied to the right of originating taxes, annihilating one branch of the legiſlature, and making the government arbitrary." His Excellency, thro' his whole vindication, ſeems to ſpeak of the ſingle act of fitting out the ſloop, and don't once mention the eſtabliſhment made for her, or the payment thereof; much leſs the two inſtances of fitting out the ſhip King George: All which the houſe had in view, as is manifeſt by their ſaying, that, "had this been the firſt inſtance, they might not have troubled his Excellency about it." However, if this was the only inſtance that ever had happened of ſuch an exertion of the executive power by the Governor and Council, it ſeems to be very applicable to the right of originating taxes, and to have a tendency to make the Governor and Council of the province arbitrary. If the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council have a right to draw what money they pleaſe out of the treaſury, under a notion of diſcretion which they are to exerciſe, as executive officers of the government; it follows, that for ſo much charge as the government incurs, by the exerciſe of this diſcretionary power, by ſo much the province is taxed by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council, without any privity or conſent of the houſe; ſo much charge then as is incurred by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary power, the houſe cannot be ſaid to originate. Their right of originating taxes therefore is ſo far taken away; their power as to this ceaſing and coming to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by the Governor and Council exerciſing it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without the houſe, may be ſaid to be annihilated.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009225_0048_1030BB56E80E5D30"/>
And when the power and priviledge of any branch of the legiſlature ceaſes, is taken away and annihilated, then the government is ſo far arbitrary. The houſe are ſo modeſt as only to ſay, "that in ſuch a caſe it will ſoon become arbitrary."</p>
            <p>Can any man be ſo unreaſonable as to contend that the province is not as much taxed by the Governor and Council's paying for this ſloop out of the money already raiſed, as if the houſe had voted it? What is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? The people pay the reckoning whether the Governor and Council take upon them to arm veſſels out of money raiſed for other purpoſes, or the houſe vote to raiſe money for arming veſſels. When the money is gone out of the treaſury for arming, veſſels, the debts of the province contracted by the three branches of the legiſlature muſt nevertheleſs be paid, and other monies muſt be levied inſtead of thoſe taken away by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Council. And as according to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's diſtinction. there is no limitation of the diſcretiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expence, ſo long as the good of the whole, in the opinion of the Governor and Council ſhall require it; they may ſpend every farthing in the treaſury, and for what they pleaſe. Suppoſe his Excellency ſhould judge it expedient and abſolutely neceſſary upon the apprehenſion of ſome imminent and immediate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (of which he is in fact abſolutely by the charter the ſole judge) to march all the militia to the frontiers. This he can do without even the advice of the Council. Suppoſe the Council, tho' not conſulted, as they need not be, as to the utility of the march, ſhould place ſuch abſolute confidence in his Excellency's wiſdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſign a warrant for drawing every farthing out of the treaſury for the paying and ſubſiſting this armament. Could not as much be ſaid for all this, as is ſaid for fitting out the ſloop?</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Repreſentatives, ſhould they preſume to remonſtrate, might with the ſame propriety be given to underſtand that "there was not time to call <hi>them</hi> together", that "the danger was immed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009225_0049_1030BB59F321EB88"/>
and in ſuch a caſe there is no limitation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, but in proportion to the evil impending;" "for the ſafety of the people being the ſupreme law, ſhould at all events be provided for." Furthermore, "this was an act the Governor and Council had a right to do:" "It is a legal and conſtitutional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the powers veſted in them". "It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of the executive power of the government, diſtinct from the legiſlative." Nay let us go but one ſtep further, and I think the reaſoning will be compleat on the ſide of his Excellency, or on the ſide of the Houſe. All things are poſſible, and when his Excellency and the Council we are now bleſſed with, are taken from us, we may have a Governor and Council, that after they have given out orders to array and march the militia, and by warrant drawn all the money out of the treaſury, may alter their minds as to the imminent danger, lay by the expedition, but inſtead of replacing the money in the treaſury, divide and pocket it among themſelves.</p>
            <p>The reader no doubt ſtarts at ſuch a ſuppoſition, 'tis only a bare poſſibility as ſtated. The Houſe might poſſibly remonſtrate in ſuch a caſe. But I hold that upon the principles advanced by his Excellency, it would be wrong in them ſo to do, and that it ought to be taken for a ſatisfactory anſwer, That "if it were wrong and ill adviſed in the Governor and Council (thus to convert all the treaſure of the province to their own uſe, which they might not mean to admit) yet it would amount to no more than a <hi>very improper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the publick money, by thoſe who had lawful authority to apply ſuch money to the publick purpoſes."</p>
            <p>"When this diſtinction is conſidered, how could ſuch an act, whether right or wrong, be applied to the right of originating taxes, annihilating one branch of the legiſlature, and making the government arbitrary." Perhaps ſuch future Governor not underſtanding law diſtinctions ſo well as his Excellency our preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, might expreſly add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To conclude. Would all plantation Governors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the nature of a free government, and the principles of the Britiſh conſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as now happily eſtabliſhed, and practice upon thoſe principles, inſtead (as moſt of them do) of ſpending their whole time in extending the prerogative beyond all bounds; they would ſerve the King their maſter much better, and make the people under their care infinitely happier.</p>
            <p>Strange it is, that when King's and many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men have fallen in their attempts upon the liberties of the people of Great Britain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that plantation Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's don't all conſider the Act of 13th of George the ſecond, Chapter vii. which is a plain declaration of the Britiſh parliament, that the ſubjects in the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are intitled to all the privileges of the people of Great Britain. By this act of parliament even Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers having lived ſeven years in any of the Britiſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, are deemed natives, on taking the oaths of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, &amp;c. and are declared by ſaid act to be his Majeſty's natural born ſubjects of the kindom of Great Britain, to all intents, conſtructions and purpoſes, as if any or every of them had been, or were born within the kingdom. The reaſons given for this naturalization of foreigners, in the preamble of the act are, that "the <hi>increaſe</hi> of the people is the means of advancing the wealth and ſtrength of any nation or country, and that many foreigners and ſtrangers, from the <hi>lenity</hi> of our government, the <hi>purity</hi> of our religion, the <hi>benefit</hi> of our laws, the <hi>advantages</hi> of our trade, and the <hi>ſecurity</hi> of our property might be induced to come and ſettle in ſome of his Majeſty's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in America, if they were made partakers of the

               <hi>advantages</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> which the natural born ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this realm do there enjoy." Nor is any new priviledge given by this act to the natives of the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am convinced that if his Excellency will in al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
