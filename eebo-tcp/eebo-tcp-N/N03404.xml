            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E your Brethren, in the calling of Jeſus Chriſt; and Miniſtry of his Goſpel, of the County of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> who from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your acting in the <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Affair, have been looked upon, and treated by you, as eſpecially, and above all others obnoxious. And in all your Proceedings, from firſt to laſt, have been the Butt of your Reſentment and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy, and eſpecially in your Book called <hi>An Anſwer to the Hampſhire Narrative,</hi> have been treated with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Contempt, and repreſented with a great Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Diſdain and Inſult as a Set of wicked, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Men, looking upon it that you have gone out of the Way of your Duty, and acted much againſt the Honour of Chriſt, and the Intereſt of Chriſtianity, and to the Prejudice of the miniſterial Character, do think ourſelves obliged, as we are your fellow Chriſtians and Brethren in the Miniſtry, not only to vindicate ourſelves, but to labour to lead you to a Senſe of your Error, which
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004152_0005_1003DF5F34B6DF80"/>
tho' we have reaſon to fear, from the Temper and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice you have diſcovered in your Anſwer, is not very likely to be ſucceſsful; yet leaving the Event with GOD, we think ourſelves bound to endeavour. And would obſerve in general, That you have almost wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the Merits of the Cauſe in Diſpute between us, and inſtead of that, have been pleaſed to divert your Readers with ſuch ludicrous and unfriendly Reflections on our Narrative and Conduct, as you have tho't fit, for Reaſons beſt known to yourſelf. And therefore, for our own Vindication and your Conviction, we have tho't it necessary to remark and reply to <hi>ſome of the exceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Paſſages</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>In Page 1 and 2, where you diſtinguiſh thoſe who diſapproved of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Settlement at <hi>Springfield,</hi> and ſent their Proteſt againſt it, from thoſe that were called to judge in the Affair, ſpeaking of the Letter, you ſay, <hi>of which Number were the eldeſt Miniſters in their own County,</hi> whereby 'tis inſinuated, that the eldeſt Miniſters in the County acted, when you know that the true State of the Caſe was thus, That the <hi>eldeſt Miniſter</hi> of all <hi>in the County,</hi> and the eldeſt in the Province but one, was one that <hi>diſapproved and proteſted;</hi> the two next <hi>acted:</hi> the four next <hi>diſapproved;</hi> and the next <hi>acted:</hi> Which three were all in the County that <hi>acted.</hi> Now, Sir, the Caſe being thus, was not this that you gave an unfair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation: We appeal to all your Readers that had their Information only from your Book, whether they han't been led by it, to apprehend the Caſe quite different from what we have now repreſented. In the ſame Place you blame us that we did not leave thoſe <hi>eldeſt Miniſters that acted</hi> with others, to act according to their own Light. And why, <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> could not you, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that come from <hi>Boston,</hi> leave them to act <hi>according to their own Light,</hi> without taking ſuch abundant Pains in urging them to act againſt what they of themſelves were inclined to, as you know you did the Reverend Mr. <hi>Chauncey, the eldeſt that acted,</hi> who has often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in the hearing of ſome of us, that had he not been exceedingly importuned, he would not have <hi>acted,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004152_0006_1003E05E8163CA08"/>
and that he long reſiſted and oppoſed, but that you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, at both times of the Council's meeting. And the Reverend Mr. <hi>Devotion,</hi> before the Council came up, did ſufficiently declare in our hearing, his Diſinclination to <hi>act</hi> in the Caſe: And there are many other concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Evidences, that he would not <hi>have acted</hi> had not you ſent to him, urging him to it.</p>
            <p>In Page 2, you boldly charge us with running this Controverſy into the publick Prints. Certainly you ought not thus to have declared this to the World before you knew it; and yet afterwards, before you get to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Page, you implicitly confeſs, that you don't know it; for you ſpeak of the two Letters in the <hi>Boſton</hi> Journal, as publiſhed by us, <hi>or ſomebody that undertook our Vindication:</hi> If it was only ſomebody that undertook our Vindication, how does it thence follow, as you ſay, that we not being <hi>content that the Matter ſhould remain the Subject of Converſation only, run it into the publick Prints:</hi> And yet afterwards again, in the Margin, you charge the publiſhing theſe Letters at ſuch a Time, on us, as an Inſtance of our <hi>unfair Way of managing.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we none of us had any hand in publiſhing either of thoſe Letters, and knew not that any ſuch Letters were publiſhed, or like to be publiſhed, or were in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'till we ſaw them in the publick Prints: And if they had been publiſhed by us, it would have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry injuriouſly ſaid, that it was before any thing was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed on the other ſide: Whereas you very well know, the Complaint of <hi>Springfield</hi> Church to the General Aſſembly, was publiſhed in the <hi>Boſton</hi> Gazette, and the Letters refer'd to in your Anſwer, we ſuppoſe, were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by that Publication, and a ſtolen Letter that was written on this Affair, was before this expoſed in the publick Prints, with ludicrous Reflections, to render the Author, and the Cauſe he appeared in, ridiculous in the Eyes of the World.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> inſtead of our running our own Writings firſt into Print, thoſe of your Party ſtole 'em, and expos'd 'em, and ridicul'd 'em in the publick Prints. And then you write again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> crying down both the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004152_0007_1003BA835211E678"/>
and Magiſtrates of the County, before ever we publiſh'd any thing at all: And this after you had, in a great Meaſure filled the Country with Reproaches of us, and raiſed a general Cry againſt us, as a ſet of ambitious, arbitrary, and unjuſt Uſurpers, in the principal Part of the Country, where we, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aſon of our Diſtance, have no other Way to ſpeak for ourſelves but by the Preſs: And then after all cry out of us for <hi>running the Matter into the publick Prints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Things inſiſted on, Page 3, 4, and 5. we ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak afterwards. In Page 5,&amp;6, after you had for two or three Pages been ridiculing our <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> and its Acts and Pretentions, you ſay, <q>And when they (<hi>i. e. Aſſociations</hi>) come <hi>ex-officio,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Oaths, it ſeems alſo to intrench upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the civil Magiſtrate;</q> and then in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin you ſay to the World, <q>The Form of an Oath, or Declaration taken by a particular Miniſter, by Order of an <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> may be ſeen in the <hi>Narrative</hi> Page 49, the firſt, we ſuppoſe, of the Kind that has been given to the Publick, and therefore worthy of ſpecial Notice.</q> The Thing referred to in the <hi>Narrative,.</hi> is, that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Miniſter in <hi>Connecticut</hi> took the Evidence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons, in order to be ſent to <hi>Springfield,</hi> at the Time of the ſitting of the Council there; and they in giving their Evidence declared <hi>before GOD the Searcher of all Hearts,</hi> that their Evidence was <hi>the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but, the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Reverend <hi>Sir,</hi> ſuppoſe this were indeed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Oath, and this Miniſter had been appointed to take it by the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> to which he belonged, What is that to us that an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> in <hi>Connecticut</hi> remote from us did ſo? As it is beſide our Intention to ſay any thing on Defence of the Aſſociation of the County of <hi>Windham,</hi> ſo we are well aſſured, that thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gentlemen are well able to defend themſelves, when it ſhall be needful for them to free themſelves from Apprehenſions of the civil Magiſtrate in their own Colony, who have often heard of ſuch kind of Oaths or Declarations, without any Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of the Miniſters <hi>intrenching</hi> upon their Office.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004152_0008_1003E0690CAE9118"/>
And we are very ſorry that the Reverend Council have never heard of nor ſeen any ſuch kind of Oath or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in all the Diſcipline of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and of <hi>Scotland</hi> or other <hi>reformed Churches abroad,</hi> which, if they had, it ſeems ſtrange that they ſhould think there was ſo much Occaſion to put the Civil Magiſtrate upon drawing his Sword upon Aſſociations for preſuming to do it.</p>
            <p>In Page 9, after mentioning ſome Things in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative that you ſay are low and trifling, you ſay. <q>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretty Tale we are entertained with, in Page 63, there they tell us, that Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> preaching from thoſe Words, <hi>Many are the Afflictions of the Righteous,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf to <hi>David, Mordicai,</hi> and other good Men, and thoſe who oppos'd him to <hi>Haman,</hi> &amp;c..</q> Mayn't your Reader have juſt Ground to ſuſpect that this is but a Specimen of your Way of judging and eſtimating Things relating to Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k,</hi> in calling it a <hi>pretty Tale,</hi> and putting of it into the Catalogue of Things that you call <hi>low and trifling,</hi> when it is related, That he that was ſo young, and not yet ordained, ſhould in the Pulpit, not only compare himſelf to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Mordicai,</hi> and the neighbouring Miniſters, that had been long ſettled and accepted in that Work, and are old eno' to be his Fathers, to <hi>Haman?</hi> And may we not take it as a Specimen of your Impartiality? We would pray you, Sir, to conſider what you would think or ſay of any of us that are not ſo much younger than you, if we ſhould in our Pulpits, compare ourſelves to <hi>Mordicai</hi> and you to <hi>Haman</hi> his cruel Perſecutor; would it be a <hi>pretty Tale</hi> then? Would it not be horrid Prophaneſs, and many other Things as bad? And we would pray you alſo to conſider how vehemently you have inveighed againſt us in your Book for ſaying Things of you that are far leſs than this. And tho' it be a <hi>low and trifling</hi> Thing, not worthy to be mentioned for Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> to ſay this of his Fathers in the Pulpit, yet if they do but relate a Teſtimony publickly given by others, wherein there is ſomething againſt Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> How far is this from being a trifling Matter? Inſtead of which they are ranked by you among

Don't it favour of what you charge us with Page 8, <hi>viz</hi> a Diſpoſition <hi>to lay on all the Load that you could.</hi> The firſt Thing you mention as an Evidence of our ſhowing of ſuch a Spirit is, That we relate <hi>Things that don't enter into the Merits of the Cauſe;</hi> and that therefore <hi>the whole Deſign of them muſt be only to fix, as far as we could do it a Mark of Diſhonour and Diſgrace where we would have it worn.</hi> Will you allow that, if this holds good, and is juſt arguing in our Caſe, ſo it alſo is in your own in a like Caſe? That if you inſiſt on many Things to our Reproach, that don't in the leaſt <hi>enter into the Merits of the Cauſe,</hi> that then we may juſtly argue, That <hi>it muſt be only to fix, as far as</hi> you <hi>could do it, a Mark of Diſhonour and Diſgrace where</hi> you <hi>would have it worn?</hi> And that therefore it <hi>diſcovers</hi> in you <hi>an evil and bitter, an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and unchriſtian Temper and Spirit?</hi> And pray Sir, conſider how much it touch'd <hi>the Merits of the Cauſe,</hi> for you ſo much to inſiſt upon the <hi>Bulk</hi> of our Book, with ſo much Scoff and Jeer; repeating it over and ever ſo often, and declaring how it <hi>contain'd ſeven Sheets</hi> (tho' yours contain'd no leſs) and that it was mounted to <hi>Four Shillings and Six Pence</hi> Price (tho' your's was no leſs coſtly than ours) And how much did it concern the <hi>Merits of the Cauſe,</hi> for you, repeatedly and in a deriſory Manner, to mention it that we ſay on the Title Page of our Book <hi>WRITTEN BY THEMSELVES?</hi> And how much
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004152_0010_1003E06F10789938"/>
does it concern the <hi>Merits of the Cauſe,</hi> to inſiſt, with ſo much Ridicule, on our mean Method of writing?

            <p>Suppoſing it be ſo indeed, that we can't write ſo correctly and methodically as you can, or ſuppoſing you could make it manifeſt, that we did not know how to write well eno' to appear in Print, yet how does that alter the State of the Argument, with Regard to <hi>the Merits of the Cauſe?</hi> And what other End could you have in inſiſting on it, than <hi>to fix</hi> that <hi>Mark of Diſhonour and Diſgrace upon us,</hi> that we have written in a weak and ridiculous manner?</p>

In Page 14, after mentioning our Pretences of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> you ſay <q>Yet it ſeems they ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their own Cautions, that as ſoon as Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k</hi> left <hi>Springfield</hi> the firſt time, they let the Papers from <hi>Connecticut</hi> go about the Pariſh, when he was not there to make any Anſwer for himſelf.</q> In which you deal unjuſtly by us. Thoſe Papers from <hi>Connecticut</hi> were lodged in Mr. <hi>Hopkins'</hi>s Hands, and when the Pariſh had choſen a Committee to ask the Advice of the Miniſters of the County, whether they ſhould again make Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k,</hi> that Committee went to Mr. <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and deſired that they might have thoſe Papers to carry them to the Miniſters in the upper Part of the County (whoſe Advice they intended firſt to ask) giving this as a Reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had heard the Papers but once, and might be the better able to give Advice, if they had a ſecond View of them, Mr. <hi>Hopkins</hi> therefore (after cautioning them not to make any ill Uſe of them) gave them the Papers, and they being Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Friends, he had no Suſpicion that they would uſe them to his Damage, nor have we any Reaſon to think they did: It is true they kept them much longer in their Hands than was expected, and where they went we know not, but if <hi>they went about the Pariſh</hi> to Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Damage, Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Friends are to blame for it, and not the Miniſters of the County: And we aſſure you that they never <hi>went about the Pariſh</hi> any time, except while they were in the keeping of his Friends of that Pariſh.</p>
            <p>And then you proceed, in Page 14, 15, 16 and 17. to raiſe an exceeding Outcry againſt us, as <hi>cruel, barbarous, unchriſtian and inhumane, and thoſe whoſe tender Mercies are Cruelty,</hi> for publiſhing Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Teſtimony, in which he declared wherein he ſuppoſed Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> had been wanting to the Truth, in denying his ſtealing Books in College, becauſe herein is contain'd a Mention of that Crime, that he was then guilty of when he was ſo young, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho' herein you repreſent us as a moſt vile Parcel of Men, and worthy of the utmoſt Deteſtation, yet we pray you with a little Seriouſneſs to conſider whether
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004152_0012_1003E076851B21002"/>
or no your Treatment of us, with Reſpect to that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be right in the Sight of GOD, and whether it han't been, on the contrary, exceeding unjuſt: What is it that we did, that we ſhould be thus ſet forth as ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding black and vile? Our profeſſed Deſign in writing our Book was to give the World a Narrative or Hiſtory of our Proceedings in Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Affair; being, as we thought, obliged thereto by the Clamour that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was filled with againſt us, as having been intolerably injurious in that Affair: And in order to this, we gave an Account of and recite at large, that Information or Teſtimony that we received from the Reverend Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> that was the Occaſion and main Foundation of thoſe our Proceedings: And how was it poſſible for us to give the World a Narrative of our Proceedings, and not give an Account of that? For all our Proceedings were upon thoſe Teſtimonies that were ſent: How can any Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any that act publickly in a Cauſe, when they are complain'd of for Male-Adminiſtration or Injuſtice, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves without giving an Account of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations or Teſtimonies on which they proceeded; and when they do ſo in their own neceſſary Vindication, is it juſt to cry out of them as the moſt monſtrous and barbarous Wretches for ſo doing?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> while the Affair was in their Hands, never had proceeded any further than only to inſiſt on a particular Hearing of the Caſe, Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> and the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes being Face to Face, in order to our concurring in his Settlement at <hi>Springfield:</hi> And this you know is what we were eſpecially cryed out againſt for, that we would not accept of his Vindication, or account of himſelf in an Examination without this. We judged that the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we had had againſt his Principles and Morals rendred ſuch a particular Enquiry neceſſary, and this we were concern'd to ſhow to the World for our Vindication, and how could we poſſibly do it without letting the World know what theſe Informations or Teſtimonies were? It was neceſſary that we ſhou'd relate thoſe Teſtimonies <hi>as they were,</hi> if we had publiſh'd only a Part and conceal'd a Part, ſhould we not have given a handle to thoſe who
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004152_0013_1003DF8D624285E8"/>
ſtand ready to reproach us? Could we have expected any other from your ſelf, who are ſo ready to take all Advantages againſt us, than that you would cry out that our Teſtimonies, on which we proceeded, were ſuch as we durſt not let the World ſee? And it was eſpecially neceſſary that that Part of the Information that reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Veracity ſhould be declared, for it was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on the Account of this that we think ourſelves to be vindicated, for not accepting what he ſhould ſay of himself without hearing him and the Witneſſes Face to Face, which was the Thing we were eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for: And we were brought to this Neceſſity of giving this Narrative very much by Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s own Reproaches and Revilings of us, of which his comparing us to <hi>Haman</hi> in the Pulpit, which you call a <hi>pretty Tale,</hi> is a Specimen: This we think would have juſtified us in publiſhing that Teſtimony, tho' this Matter, which one Thing teſtified has a Reference to, had been of that Nature as would have greatly wronged his Reputation; but you yourſelf ſeem to ſpeak as tho' it had very little of that Tendency.—That we muſt by no Means be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſpeak of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s former Faults, or ſo much as give an Account of Teſtimonies that contain a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them, tho' laid under never ſo great Neceſſity by him himſelf, by his Reproaches of us, and tho' our Names never ſo much ſuffered in the Country by them, and tho' theſe Faults being publiſhed tend very little to his Diſcredit, (as by your own arguing they do) comes to this, that we ought to be vaſtly more tender of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Credit than our own, even to that Degree that we are oblig'd to yield up our Reputation a Sacrifice to his Revilings, and to be at his Mercy rather than vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ourſelves in the leaſt to the wrong of his Reputation. What we do is barely to recite Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Teſtimony, wherein Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s ſtealing Books is refer'd to, without one Reflection on that Particular, or any Hint as though we made any Uſe of that Crime, or any thing ſaid about it throughout the whole Book, nor was that thing ever inſiſted upon by us, among ourſelves, or even mention'd by us, as any Article againſt him, in this Controverſy; and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004152_0014_1003BB03F64A54A8"/>
the only Reaſon why it appear'd in our Book, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Information, which contain'd a Reference to it, could not be publiſh'd without it: And yet you charge <hi>us,</hi> ourſelves, with <hi>faſtening this Charge upon him:</hi> Is our giving an hiſtorical Account of Another's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, wherein he had occaſional Reference to a Fault committed, without ſaying a Word before or after about it, <hi>our faſtening a Charge of that Fault upon him?</hi> Yea, you charge us with being the Contrivers of it, and tell the World for what End we contrived it, in ſaying that <hi>for fear the Truth of the Story ſhould be queſtioned, we take Care to direct all that deſire to be confirm'd to enquire of ſuch and ſuch Perſons.</hi> Pleaſe, Sir, to ſuffer your own Conſcience to make its own Reflections upon this.</p>
            <p>In Page 16, and 17, you caſt ſome Reflections upon Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> upon this Account; and ſay, <q>Perhaps it may be ſaid Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> made the Enquiry with a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hope the Story was <hi>not true,</hi> and a kind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign <hi>to contradict it,</hi> when he heard it mention'd.</q> And then you add, <q>Whether it was juſt or not, there is ſome Reaſon to doubt, when he could write to a Miniſter in <hi>Boſton, to deſire</hi> him to make Enquiry into Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Conduct, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon of Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s informing Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> of that Story, was becauſe he was often <hi>enquired of</hi> by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Windham,</hi> and he knowing nothing about it tho't it proper to give Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> an Opportunity <hi>to vindicate</hi> himſelf. And when he <hi>had abſolutely denied</hi> the Truth of the Story, many ſuſpected his <hi>Veracity;</hi> and others, who pretended to be his peculiar Friends, ſuppoſed that the Story was <hi>abſolutely falſe and ſcandalous,</hi> and therefore earneſtly ſollicited Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> to write a Letter to ſome Gentleman, who was acquainted with him, to know the Truth of the Story; that ſo if he were <hi>innocent</hi> he might be <hi>vindicated,</hi> or if <hi>otherwiſe</hi> he might be made ſenſible of his Fault <hi>in denying of it.</hi> And accordingly Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> was prevailed upon to write a Letter for that End. And, Sir, what Colour is there for any Reflection upon Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> on this Account? Will you ſay it was an <hi>unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian or impertinent</hi> Thing in Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> to act ſuch a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004152_0015_1003DF99C2694B58"/>
               <hi>chriſtian</hi> Part, as to inform a Gentleman of an ill Report which there was about him, that ſo he might have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to vindicate himſelf, and that <hi>he</hi> might be in a better Capacity of vindicating of him, and to comply with the Importunity of his Friends to write a Letter for that End? Or if Mr <hi>Clap</hi> began afterwards to ſuſpect that the Story was <hi>true,</hi> and ſo that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> was not a <hi>Man of Truth</hi> in denying of it, muſt it then be a Fault in Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> to deſire to be ſatiſfied in that Point, when there was ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that he might be ſettled over Part of his Church.</p>
            <p>In Page 18, you charge Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Long-Meadow</hi> with being the Means that the Contents of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Colman'</hi>s Letter, was ſpread about <hi>Springfield</hi> before it reach'd where it was directed. How did you know that it was before it had reach'd where it was directed? Have you not ventur'd poſitively to aſſert this before the World on meer Conjecture? For what is aſſerted is contrary to Fact, for the Letter was ſent from <hi>Brookfield</hi> to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> to whom it was directed, by his Daughter, and reach'd to him the ſame Day that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Long-Meadow</hi> got Home him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, 'Tis there repreſented as tho' the Author of that Letter had written to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> manifeſting his Diſlike of letting the Contents of that Letter be known; which is quite wrong. The Words of the Doctor's Letter are theſe, <q>Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> tells me of my Letter's being put into the Hands of a mean Perſon, I think a Shoe maker, who carried it from Houſe to Houſe.</q> The Reverend Doctor never blam'd Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> for letting the Contents of the Letter be known, nor did Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> go about to excuſe himſelf for ſo doing; but to let the Doctor know that the Report was not true which the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> had told him, of his doing so ungentlemanly a Thing, as to put a Letter of his, that was committed to his Care, into the Hands of a Shoe-maker, to be carried from Houſe to Houſe.</p>
            <p>At the Bottom of the ſame Page, you tell the World, That our Book <hi>abounds with Miſrepreſentations and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths;</hi> and elſewhere are often charging us with <hi>vile</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004152_0016_1003E081A5857030"/>
and <hi>wilful Miſrepreſentations;</hi> yea, you repreſent us as Perſons ſo guilty in this Matter, that our Word is of no Significancy, or is not to be taken; your Words are, Page 58, <hi>And how ſhould ſuch Men be credited in their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of other Matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> which he wrote to him after our Book had been publiſhed ſo long that we may well conclude he had ſeen it, expreſſes Charity for us all with Reſpect to our Varacity: His Words are theſe, <q>I thank GOD, my Charity is not ſo ſhock'd, with reſpect to Brother <hi>Hopkins,</hi> or any of the Miniſters of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> as to ſuſpect them, after all the Stories I have heard, to be guilty of wilful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Truth and Fact.</q> Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> knows whether he had any Hand in writing this Book; if he had, and believed in his Heart, as he ſays to Mr. <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> certainly it was very injurious in him, ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repreſent to the World, as if we ſo abounded in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that there was no Truſt to be put in our Words, ſo publickly to wound our Reputation, contrary to what he thought in his own Heart, or at the ſame Time, that he believed that we were Men of Truth, ſo as not ſo much as to ſuſpect that we were otherwiſe, and to thank GOD <hi>that he had ſo much Charity for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Inſtance you mention of a Miſrepreſentation, wherein you ſay, <hi>our Haſte and Warmth probably carried us beyond our Evidence,</hi> is in ſaying that the Miniſters that came from <hi>Boſton</hi> had joyned in giving Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of his Orthodoxy, when but one of them had ſigned it: And tho' you find this Miſtake corrected in the End of the Book, yet you ſay it was done by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in <hi>Boſton,</hi> that look'd over that Half Sheet: You repeat this Matter again, Page 36, you ſay <hi>if you miſtake not</hi> it was ſo; but why, Rev. Sir, will you thus treat your Brethren in the Miniſtry, to publiſh ſuch a Thing to diſparage us, and render us vile in the Sight of the World on a meer Conjecture; when indeed your Gueſs is entirely wrong, for the Error was corrected by the ſame Perſon that made it, &amp; 'tis mention'd as an <hi>Erratum</hi> in the End of the Book, in his own Words, as he ſent them
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004152_0017_1003DFA48BF28478"/>
down in a Letter to the Printer; and if you don't believe it we deſire you would enquire of the Printer.</p>
            <p>Certainly, Sir, when you was blaming us for going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Evidence, it did not become you in the very ſame Inſtance you produce to prove it, to do the ſame Thing! We leave it with you to conſider what Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Ingenuity there is in thus inſiſting on a Thing that comes corrected, repeating it in different Parts of your Book, only on a groundleſs Gueſs, that not we, but ſomebody elſe corrected it: Don't this again ſhow that you endeavour'd <hi>to lay on all the Load you poſſibly could,</hi> and that you was greedy of Inſtances of <hi>Untruth and Miſrepreſentation</hi> in us; otherwiſe why would not ſuch a Multitude of other Inſtances, that you pretend you have found, that ben't mention'd as <hi>Errata,</hi> ſuffice you?</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to our <hi>firſt</hi> Argument to prove that thoſe that ſat at <hi>Springfield,</hi> and took upon them to ſit there as Judges of that Caſe, were not regularly called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, viz <hi>Becauſe the prevailing Part of them were not of neighbouring Churches, but fetched from remote Parts of the Country, in neglect of the Churches of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and in Oppoſition to the Body of neighbouring Miniſters,</hi> you ſay, firſt, that it was becauſe one of the Churches of the Neighbourhood that was ſent for would not come, that it was ſo that the prevailing Part was of remote Churches: And if you had told the whole Truth, would you not have ſaid too that but one of the Churches of the County would have come, if you that came from <hi>Boſton</hi> had let them alone? You ſpeak of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> his refuſing to come, as a Thing that ſtrengthened your Warrant to act; but it ſeems to us, that conſidering his Age, and that he was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Perſon of all that <hi>Springfield</hi> applied to, his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to come, as diſcountenancing the Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, ſhould' have rather made you more ſlow in Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially when he not only refuſed to come, but entred his ſolemn Proteſt againſt your Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Then you proceed to reply to what we produce from the <hi>Platform:</hi> And in the firſt Place, you declare to the World, that we ſaid that which we never did ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004152_0018_1003E08D208A75A8"/>
Words are, <q>Are Churches in the Calling of Councils <hi>limited to the Vicinity,</hi> ſo that it is an Irregularity and Offence to them if they don't take the <hi>next</hi> neighbouring Churches, <hi>and no other? This is what thoſe Gentlemen aſſert;</hi> and they deliver it not only as their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but ſay it was evidently the Mind of the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Platform.</q> Our Words are, <q>It appears e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently reaſonable in itſelf, that Churches that are by Providence planted together, and muſt dwell together, ſo as neceſſarily, above all others, to be concerned in each other's Affairs, and will be continually and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably in the Way of mutual Intercourſe, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Intereſted in each other's Welfare, <hi>ſhould be joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in their religious Affairs, and not be neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſet aſide one by another,</hi> wherein other Churches are to have Influence in their Affairs, <hi>but ſhould prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally be regarded;</hi> ſo this was evidently the Mind of the Compoſers of the Platform.</q> Why, Sir, would you ſo abuſe us, and ſtrain the Matter ſo much higher than we had done, and expreſs a Thing that is ſo diverſe from our Words, and oppoſite to the plain Import of them, and then ſay that <hi>this is what we aſſert?</hi> And again, lower down the ſame Page, you cite our Words wrong, and repreſent us as ſaying what we never ſaid, that you may have Opportunity to ridicule us: Your Words are, 'If they had, they never would have aſſerted that (and then the following Words are in another Character, as being cited from us) <hi>as often</hi> as it directs to a particular Church to apply to other Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſpecifies neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches.' Our Words are, <q>They, when they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to, or mention any Application to be made by a particular Church to other Churches, <hi>from Time to Time</hi> ſpecify neighbour Churches.</q> Perhaps you will ſay this is the ſame Senſe, tho' not the ſame Words; but if it be the very ſame Senſe, Why did you not mention the ſame Words, ſeeing you plainly mention them as a Citation? But we apprehend there is indeed a great Difference in the Senſe: Can't the <hi>Platform from Time to Time ſpecify neighbour Churches, when they mention any Application to be made to other Churches,</hi> and yet not do it every Time?</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004152_0019_1003DFAF71CED2F0"/>
Our Words, as we conceive, imply thus much, and no more, <hi>viz</hi> That when the Platform <hi>directs a Church to apply to other Churches, it does from Time to Time ſpecify</hi> what Churches ſhould be applied to, and that wherever it does ſo, <hi>it ſpecifies neighbour Churches,</hi> and that it never <hi>ſpecifies</hi> any other; of which the World have good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from this, that you can find no other <hi>ſpecified</hi> in it, who have doubtleſs thereby ſearched the Platform to this End.</p>
            <p>And to what Purpoſe is that Paſſage that you cite from the Platform, wherein it ſays, That <hi>all Churches</hi> ought to preſerve Communion one with another? We can conceive of nothing that you can intend by it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe the Platform ſays, That <hi>all Churches</hi> ought to hold Communion, that therefore they ought to exerciſe that Communion in every Thing that is an Act of Communion; but if this be what you mean, then it will follow, That all the Churches in the World ought to be conſociated; for the Synod in 1662 mentions Conſociation of Churches as one Way of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the Communion of Churches; however, they have expreſly limited that Exerciſe of Communion to Churches <hi>in a convenient Vicinity:</hi> Or elſe you muſt mean, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Platform ſays all Churches ſhould hold Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; one Way of Communion there mention'd is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult other Churches, that therefore a particular Church ought to conſult all other Churches.—But 'tis ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to infer any other from what the Platform ſays, than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That every Church ought to be ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Communion with all other Churches in all thoſe Ways, as the Diſpoſals of Providence, in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Occaſions of Churches ſhall open a Door for it and call to it. And to what Purpoſe are thoſe other Paſſages that you cite, where the Platform ſays a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church ought to conſult OTHER CHURCHES? Which you ſeem to think ſhould be taken ſo much Notice of, and obſerve that it is ſaid <hi>other Churches at large;</hi> does it thence follow, That the Platform neither does, nor can Deſign that Churches ſhould be <hi>eſpecially limited to neighbour Churches?</hi> What ſort of arguing is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004152_0020_1003E093CE41EF70"/>
this. The Platform ſays, Churches ſhould conſult other Churches, therefore it no where eſpecially limits them to neighbour Churches! Can't the Platform tell us that we muſt conſult <hi>other Churches,</hi> and then afterwards tell us <hi>what other Churches?</hi> Can't a Parent adviſe a Child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Difficulties to conſult <hi>others,</hi> and then in the ſame Diſcourse tell him <hi>who?</hi> And after he has told him, muſt the Child, becauſe his Father firſt ſaid <hi>others,</hi> ſtill look upon himſelf on more directed by his Father to one than another? The Platform does indeed ſometimes ſay <hi>other Churches,</hi> but then in other Places, <hi>from Time to Time,</hi> both before and after, tells <hi>what Churches, viz.</hi> neighbour Churches; it <hi>ſpecifies</hi> them without any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction;</hi> and therefore for any to ſuppoſe that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Platform did not by this intend to direct Churches <hi>where to go when they conſulted other Churches,</hi> is to reflect upon them as tho' they were ignorant of the Nature of Language, and did not underſtand what they ſaid.—But then you add further, that <q>We can't ſuppoſe that the Compilers of the Platform always meant by neighbour Churches thoſe that were ſcituated next to one another, but Churches in Communion one with another, by profeſſing the ſame Faith and Order of the Goſpel, ſo ſcituated that they could and would afford Assiſtance to one another, as the ſame ſhould be needed and deſired.</q> This we conceive is a Signification of the Expreſſion of <hi>neighbour Churches</hi> of your own finding out: If we ſhould ſpeak of a <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Families,</hi> or an <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>neighbouring Houſes,</hi> would it be agreeable to the common Uſe of ſuch Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to mean a Houſe in the Middle of <hi>Boſton</hi> and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Houſes in <hi>Cambridge?</hi> And what Engliſh would it be, if we ſhould ſpeak of a certain <hi>Town</hi> and the <hi>neighbouring Towns</hi> thereof, to mean <hi>Springfield</hi> and the Towns in the County of <hi>Suffolk?</hi> The Legiſlators of the Province have often Occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>neighbouring Towns,</hi> and did they underſtand themſelves, or does any Body elſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, in ſuch a Kind of Senſe as this? They ſpeak ſometimes of the Advice of neighbouring Miniſters, as in Caſe of improving a School Maſter, and other Caſes.

And did ever any Lawyer plead that they were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in ſuch a Senſe as this? We read in our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Bible, that GOD overthrew <hi>Sodom</hi> and the <hi>neighbour</hi> Cities thereof; the Tranſlators certainly ſhould have uſed ſome other Word, if this don't determine but that <hi>Sodom</hi> was at one End of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and the other Cities intended at the other; for this is doubtleſs quite diverſe from the Mind of the Original.</p>
            <p>You ſuppoſe that what we plead for is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to congregational Principles, in that it renders the Government of our Churches not <hi>Congregational</hi> but <hi>Claſſical;</hi> but we think that it is no more Claſſical or contrary to the congregational Scheme, than the <hi>Conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of Churches is, which the Synod ſpeaks of as what the Word of GOD commands: You cite their Words, as ſuppoſing that they will juſtify what you have done; they ſay, <q>Tho' in this there ſhould be ſpecial Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe Churches that are planted in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Vicinity, yet there ſhould be Liberty without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to make Uſe of others, as the Nature of the Caſe and the Advantage of Opportunity may lead thereto.</q> But, Sir, we apprehend that you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thoſe Words to a Purpoſe that is quite beſide the Deſign of them: There is nothing in the Words that in the leaſt imports that the neighbour Churches ſhould ever be <hi>ſet aſide,</hi> in order to the making Uſe of others; but that there ſhould ever be a <hi>ſpecial Reference</hi> to them; tho' ſometimes there ſhould be <hi>Liberty as the Nature of the Caſe and Advantage of Opportunity ſhould lead thereto,</hi> to joyn others with them: But it ſeems plain to us that the Synod had no Thought of ſetting aſide neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches, as being unfit to be concern'd, but that there ſhould ſtill be a <hi>ſpecial Reference</hi> to them, and the Management of ſuch Affairs ſhould <hi>eſpecially</hi> be left in their Hands, tho' there might be <hi>Liberty without Offence,</hi> to join some others upon particular Occaſions: This seems evident, becauſe 1<hi>st.</hi> The Synod, by their Manner of expreſſing themſelves, ſeem to direct to have a <hi>ſpecial Reference</hi> to neighbour Churches, in the ſame Affair, and at the ſame time that they make Uſe of other Churches; the <hi>latter</hi> therefore is plainly mention'd not as that which ſets the <hi>former</hi> aſide, but what may conſiſt with it.</p>

We the Miniſters of this Neighbourhood never refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſent that two or three others ſhould be joined with our Aſſociation, in this Affair of Mr. <hi>Breck:</hi> This is what we propoſed once and again to Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> another Time to the Church of <hi>Springfield,</hi> another Time to Mr. <hi>Cooper;</hi> but were always refuſed, as we ſhall fully ſhew afterwards.</p>
            <p>There is no Doubt to be made but that the Synod in 1662, would have utterly condemned doing as <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Church have done, ſetting aſide all the Churches but one, in that lower Part of the County (a putting the Affair mainly into the Hands of others, is inconſiſtent with having a <hi>ſpecial Reference to them,</hi> which the Synod directed to, at the ſame Time that others are made Uſe of) and doing as you have done, in <hi>Oppoſition to the Body of neighbouring Miniſters,</hi> as ſuppoſing them prejudiced and unfit Perſons. The Churches of this County have, from their Beginning till now, gone on in a Practice that is agreeable to the Advice of this Synod:—We are much ſeperated from other Parts of the Province, having comparitively but little Intercourſe with them: Divine Providence, <hi>by our Situation,</hi> has as it were made us one Society, ſo as that we are very much united, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably in a great Degree mutually influenced in our religious Affairs.</p>
            <p>We have from the Beginning till now, always managed our eccleſiaſtical Affairs within our ſelves; 'tis the Way which the County from its Infancy has gone on in, by the practical Agreement of all, and the Way in which our Peace has ever been maintained; ſo that we ſuppoſe we have been the freeſt by far of any Part of the Land from unhappy Contentions in our eccleſiaſtical and religious Concerns, 'till you have overthrown our Peace, and put us into the utmoſt Confuſion, by coming from abroad, and intermeddling in our Affairs: Yea this Way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging our eccleſiaſtical Affairs, has not only been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd by long continued practical Agreement, but alſo by the explicit and publickly declared Conſent of many of the Churches: In the Year 1714 the Rev. Mr. <hi>Brewer</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> with others, did at a Meeting of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004152_0023_1003DFBFCECCA2A0"/>
Miniſters at <hi>Northampton,</hi> agree to this, That <hi>they judged it to be their Duty to be ſubject to a Council of the Churches of the County, until there ſhould be ſome ſuperiour Council ſet up in the Province to which they might appeal;</hi> and agreed to make the Propoſals to their reſpective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: To which <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Determination</hi> they ſet their Hands, as 'tis found on the Church Records of <hi>Northampton:</hi> None can remember that ever they heard of <hi>Springfield</hi> Churches refuſing; indeed Mr. <hi>Brewer</hi> kept no Church Record, and none can be found there that by their Memory can determine one way or other; which ſeems to be an Argument that it was conſented to; for if it had been propos'd, and oppos'd, and rejected, they would be much more likely to remember that, than if it was only propos'd and readily agreed to, without ado: And beſides, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſoon after ſettling at <hi>Long Meadow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brewer</hi> furniſhed him with a Copy of thoſe Votes, in order to their being paſſed by his new gather'd Church.</p>
            <p>This that we plead for is alſo moſt evidently agreable to the famous <hi>Thirty Caſes.</hi> Caſe 15, touching the Power of chuſing a Paſtor, 'tis ſaid, <q>Miniſters and Meſſengers of neighbouring Churches have Power to except againſt any Election of a Paſtor, who by Errors or Scandals may be rendred unfit for the common Service of the Goſpel.</q> By <hi>Power</hi> here no Body will be ſo ridiculous as to underſtand, meerly that they have natural Ability to except againſt it, ſo that they can if they try; but that they have <hi>Right.</hi> Again, <hi>Ibid.</hi> 
               <q>Churches may ſuffer their Elections to be directed, yea, and be diverted by Conſiderations which they owe to others in the Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without ſurrendring their Liberties to be ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by any that would unjuſtly impoſe thereon.</q> Which is contrary to what you ſuppoſe Page 26, 27. That there ſhould be ſtated <hi>Aſſociations</hi> of Miniſters, that ſhould chuſe a Moderator, that ſhould be addreſs'd to, and advis'd withal, by bereaved Churches in their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity, for their Direction, in order to the Supply of the Vacancy made, and otherwiſe to be ſubſervient to eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Diſcipline in their Churches, is what ſeems to be

            <p>You ſay our Scheme is ſuch as will deſtroy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Scheme, becauſe the Platform ſays, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, ſince the Coming of CHRIST, is not National, Provincial, nor Claſſical, but Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional only: But, Sir, won't it hence follow, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, that your Principles are ſubverſive of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Scheme, by inſiſting that we are under a <hi>provincial eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution,</hi> as you ſeem to do? In Page 5, you ſay, <hi>in a Word, we don't look upon them (i. e.</hi> Aſſociations) <hi>to be any Part of the Conſtitution</hi> of theſe Churches: Page 35, you ſpeak of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s chuſing a Method more agreeable to <hi>our Conſtitution;</hi> and Page 95, you ſay your Proceedings are to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on the Principles of Liberty, and the <hi>Conſtitution:</hi> Now, Sir, How do theſe Things conſiſt together, that the Government of our Churches ſhould be only <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational,</hi> but the Conſtitution of Government that they are ſubject to <hi>Provincial?</hi> If the Conſtitution of Government eſtabliſh'd by Churches be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Limits of particular Churches, in that very Thing the eccleſiaſtical Government they are ſubject to is extended beyond thoſe Limits; for certainly the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of Government for particular Churches to be ſubject to, is itſelf an Act of Government if any Thing is. It ſeems to us that a Number of Churches, limited by the Bounds of a Province, <hi>united in</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to</hi> an eccleſiaſtical <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> that is Provincial, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> a provincial Church; unleſs the Word <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> has one Signification in <hi>New England</hi> and a quite different in other Parts of the World: The Notion of a <hi>Conſtitution</hi> is not meer Advice that is left with every
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004152_0025_1003DFCB64D99FD0"/>
ones Arbitrament and Pleaſure, whether he will follow or not, but ſomething of the Nature of a <hi>Rule</hi> eſtabliſh'd by Authority. There can be but theſe two Ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any Method or Form of Church Diſcipline, can take Place in a Country or Province, either by a <hi>conſtituting</hi> Authority, or voluntary Agreement; if it be only by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Agreement, then it in no wiſe reaches any more than them that do voluntarily agree, and can't, without a great Abuſe of Language, be call'd a <hi>Conſtitution:</hi> A
<hi>Conſtitution</hi> of eccleſiaſtical Government can extend no farther than <hi>conſtituting</hi> Authority extends; but by the Platform itſelf, that you call the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> Church Authority don't extend beyond the Limits of a particular Congregation, Chap XVI. Sect. IV. <q>It belongeth to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Councils, not to exerciſe Church Cenſures in Way of Diſcipline, NOR ANY OTHER ACT OF CHURCH AUTHORITY or Juriſdiction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The famous Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> in a Paſſage cited in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> to the Platform, reprinted for the firſt Church in <hi>Boſton,</hi> mentions the Platform of Church Diſcipline as only given in <hi>Way of Counsel:</hi> And if it be only in Way of Counſel or Advice, we would pray you, Sir, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your own Words, concerning the Nature of Advice, Page 33, <q>We think there is a groſs Abſurdity in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it Advice, and yet making it binding and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory, and that the very Notion of asking Advice ſuppoſes a Capacity and Right in them that ask it, to judge at laſt for themſelves; if it muſt be followed, however unſuitable in the Judgment of thoſe to whom it is given, call it not Advice, but by its proper Name, Law, or Command.</q> (or <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> as you do the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Synod in 1649.) Whence does this ariſe, that you that are ſo zealous for congregational Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, do overturn the very loweſt Foundation of the congregational Scheme? Here, Sir, again remember your own Words, Page 4, <q>We are perfectly at a Loſs by what Law or Rule they make the Churches to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the civil Diſtricts; the Towns in the Province we know are by legiſlative Power laid out into Counties, but we did not know that the Churches were.</q> So
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004152_0026_1003BB193111D420"/>
we ſay, <hi>we know</hi> that the Country was <hi>laid out</hi> into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, <hi>but we did not know that the Churches were;</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap>e are perfectly at a Loſs by what Law or Rule</hi> you <hi>mike the Churches to follow the civil Diſtricts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the major Part of the Churches in the County have voted to come into a certain Method of Government, why mayn't it, by your own Ways of arguing, be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> for the County, as well as the Vote of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Part of the Churches of the Province be a <hi>Conſtitution</hi> for the Province. Give us leave, on this Occaſion, to recite to you the Words of one of the Elders of your own Council at <hi>Springfield,</hi> (and one of you that came from far, and was very active in Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Favour) which he has publiſh'd in a ſmall Pamphlet of his concerning <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders,</hi> Page 10, 11. <q>Upon the prophetick Spirit that our Author, all on a ſudden ſeems to be inſpired with, when he tells us that the <hi>Non-conformiſt'</hi>s Cauſe in this Country depends entirely, under GOD, upon our Adherence to the Platform or the congregational Principles; which is juſt like the other popular Cries we have heard of late, <hi>Theſe, O Churches of the</hi> Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts <hi>are your great and diſtinguiſhing Privileges,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>the dying Teſtimony of ſome of the worthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſome of their laſt Lecture Sermons to our Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;</hi> and the like: All calculated for no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than to hurry the unthinking Part of the World, into Bigotry and blind Zeal, the Reſult of which will be to throw all into Confuſion; and it is well if ſome that are active in it have not this ſecret Deſign.</q> And much is there to the ſame Purpoſe</p>
            <p>In Page 26, in Reply to what we object concerning the Council, that they were called in this Buſineſs in <hi>Oppoſition to the Body of neighbouring Miniſters;</hi> you mention there being but a ſmall Majority of this Body, and ſay that <hi>at beſt Things lay at ſixes and ſevens among us:</hi> But if what was acted can't be look'd upon, as the Act of the Body of neighbouring Miniſters, becauſe there was but a ſmall Majority; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y then is what was voted in the Houſe of Repreſentatives called by you the Vote of the <hi>repreſentative Body of the Country,</hi> as it is in

Page 20, and made much of as ſuch, in which there was a far leſs Majority, in Proportion to the whole Number than in our Aſſociation?</p>
            <p>In Page 26, 27, you cry out againſt what we plead for, as intolerably arbitrary, and ſay, <q>And a fine Scheme it is, to ſetter and enſlave the Churches, and have Things carried according to the <hi>Will, Humour, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and arbitrary Diſpoſition of</hi> a particular Set of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</q> And you repreſent it as inſufferably tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, eſpecially on that Account, that it <hi>admits of no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</hi> Here in the firſt Place, we obſerve, That we are injuriouſly repreſented in this Suppoſition of yours; we are far from thinking that there ought not to be Appeals from Churches of a particular Neighbourhood, to a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſuperiour Council; as a particular Member ought to be ſubject to the Body; and that becauſe, though we think the eccleſiaſtical Concerns of a particular Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, or Member of the Body, belongs to them, rather than to any other particular Neighbourhood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do much more nearly concern that Member, than any other co-ordinate Member; yet the whole Body muſt be looked upon as having a greater Concern in the Intereſt of all the Members, than any ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Member: And when we ſpeak of ſuch Affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to ſuch a Neighbourhood, and not to others, we intended no other, and think, could fairly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood no otherwiſe, than that they did not belong to other Neighbourhoods, and other Churches co-ordinate with them: When it is ſaid that ſuch an Office or Work belongs to ſuch a Member and not to others, it muſt be underſtood of other particular Members and not the whole Body, of which both that and others are a Part. But, Sir, will you allow your own arguing to be good, in which you take Occaſion reproachfully to repreſent us as <hi>a Set of Miniſters of an arbitrary Diſpoſition,</hi> that endeavour to <hi>ſetter and enſlave the Churches, and carry all Things according to our own Will, Humour and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and arbitrary Diſpoſition?</hi> Will you allow this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of your's concluſive, that our Scheme is arbitrary becauſe it don't admit of Appeals? Then, Sir, What
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004152_0028_1003E0B0C4B9C338"/>
will follow concerning your own Scheme, by which a Perſon can demand no Appeal from the Judgment of a particular Congregation? What Appeal are the poor aggrieved Brethren at <hi>Springfield</hi> allowed, in that Cauſe that has been agitated between them and their Brethren, that ſo nearly concerned the eternal Welfare of their own Souls, and the Souls of their Children? They would gladly appeal to ſome other Judicature if it might be allowed.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to our <hi>ſecond</hi> Reason, to ſhew that this Affair was not in a <hi>regular Manner</hi> put into your Hands, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was in a <hi>diſorderly Manner</hi> taken out of the Hands of the Aſſociation of the Miniſters of the County, after it had been referred to them by the firſt Church in <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> themſelves, and by Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> you ſay that we took the Matter into our Hands before we were deſir'd; and then follows a Detail of Particulars to prove it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on it with an Air of Triumph, as if this were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our utter and ſhameful Confuſion; and therefore have it over in various Parts of your Book, as Page 3, 4, and p. 28, 29, 30, 31, and alſo p. 77: Concerning which, we would, <hi>Firſt,</hi> enquire, What this is to the Argument in Hand? Suppoſing it was ſo, that we firſt took the Matter into our own Hands before Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> and the Church of <hi>Springfield</hi> refer'd it, does it thence follow that they never did refer it to us? Or if it evidently appears by our Actions, that we thought we had the Affair in our Hands before we had, becauſe before Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> and <hi>Springfield</hi> Church had put it into our Hands, does it thence follow that we had it not in our Hands, after they had indeed <hi>put it into our Hands?</hi> Does it follow, that we were miſtaken ſtill, in thinking we had it in <hi>our Hands</hi> becauſe we were miſtaken before? And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to thoſe Particulars that you mention, to prove that we took this Matter into our own Hands, and our ſaying, in the Narrative, that we were obliged, both by our Situation and Office, to act in the Affair; which you relate as a Thing whereby Tyranny and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation are proved upon us, out of our own Mouths, and which is one Thing on which you build your great

Triumph, Page 82; we would intreat you, tho' you have treated us with ſo much Reproach and Inſult, with reſpect to this Matter, yet now at length to look over thoſe Particulars that you have mention'd, of our acting in this Affair, before it was referred to us, and ask your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in real Soberneſs, whether any of theſe Things were more than we ought to have done as Miniſters of Chriſt, and chriſtian Friends and Neighbours, to the Brethren of <hi>Springfield</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing you mention is, That Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> of <hi>Springfield</hi> received a Letter from his Brother of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> informing that there were material Objections againſt Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Principles and Morals, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of that Neighbourhood could inform of. Was this going too far, that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſhould <hi>receive,</hi> and read a <hi>Letter from his Brother?</hi> Was this <hi>taking the Matter into his own Hands?</hi> The next Particular is, That Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> at <hi>Weſtfield</hi> Lecture, ſhewed this Letter to the other Miniſters that were there: And was this an Inſtance of <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> when the Contents of the Letter ſhew plainly the Author deſign'd it ſhould be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them? The next Particular you mention is, That they advis'd that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> ſhould ſee the Letter: And was this a <hi>taking the Matter into our Hands,</hi> and an Inſtance of our <hi>Injuriouſneſs,</hi> that we let Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> know what was ſuggeſted againſt him? The next Particular was, That the Miniſters of <hi>Windham</hi> County were deſired to let us know what it was that they had to object againſt Mr. <hi>Breck;</hi> and nextly, That when thoſe Objections were ſent to us, we <hi>read them:</hi> Now, What was there in this more than what would have been prudent for Miniſters, of either presbyterian or congregational Principles, to have done? As we were the neighbouring Miniſters, ſo might we not well think it probable, That at leaſt ſome of us ſhould be called to act in Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Settlement? Was it not therefore Prudence for us, when it had been ſignified to us by Perſons so conſiderable, that there were material Objections of ſuch a Nature, for us to deſire to be informed what they were, in order to know how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ourſelves? Yea, was it not both our Prudence and our Duty, on another Account alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That in caſe the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004152_0030_1003E0B7AB5F8FB8"/>
Objections appeared to be material, we might inform the People of <hi>Springfield</hi> of it, that they might not act blindfold, in a Matter that did ſo greatly concern their own and their Children's eternal Good? If any one has been informed that that which his Neighbour is lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up for his Food or Drink, is deadly Poiſon, and is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that his Neighbour is wholly ignorant of it, and upon this, out of Concern for the Life of his Neighbour, makes ſome Enquiry, and upon finding of it to be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as a Neighbour and chriſtian Brother, gives him Notice of it, is he therefore chargeable with <hi>Tyranny and Uſurpation, in invading</hi> his Brother's Right, that he has to judge &amp; chuſe for himſelf, with reſpect to his own Meat and Drink, and <hi>taking it into his own Hands,</hi> to judge for him, before he referred it to him? Does not the <hi>Situation</hi> of Chriſtians that dwell near one to another, whereby they have Opportunity to diſcern the Danger of each Other's Circumſtances, and to inform one another, oblige 'em to ſuch Acts of Kindneſs as theſe? And whether we, by our <hi>Office,</hi> have any proper Authority out of the Limits of our own Congregations or no, yet we ſuppoſe, no Chriſtians, of any Mode of Diſcipline will deny, but that by Vertue of our being Officers in Chriſt's viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſet apart and devoted to be Miniſters of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion, we are under peculiar Obligations to ſeek the Advancement of his Honour and Glory, and to prevent whatever tends to overthrow it every where, as we have Opportunity in thoſe Ways that imply no Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Authority.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe, Rev. Sir, that you that are the Miniſters of <hi>Boſton,</hi> or of that Neighbourhood, had it credibly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to you, by the Miniſters of ſome diſtant Place, that there was a Deſign of introducing Popery into some one of your Congregations, by a popiſh Prieſt, that lately went from them in the Diſguiſe of a Proteſtant Miniſter, (for it concerns not the preſent Argument whether Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ben't worſe than what Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> was charged with) and you were ſenſible that this Congregation were led on in the blind, and knew nothing of it, and one of you that had received this Information in a Letter, ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004152_0031_1003DFEEF7C81720"/>
ſhew it to the reſt of the Miniſters, would this be Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Tyranny? And would you not look on your ſelves obliged, as chriſtian Neighbours, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as neighbouring Miniſters, to act in this Affair, ſo far as to make a particular Enquiry, to ſee whether it were ſo or not, and if you found it to be so indeed, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Congregation, to prevent their undoing, and to prevent the bringing in ſuch an Infection into the Neighbourhood? Would you do any more than your Prudence and Duty in this Matter? And would you deſerve at all to be reproached, derided, and inſulted, as insufferable <hi>Tyrants and Uſurpers</hi> on this Account?</p>
            <p>You intimate to the World that tho' <hi>Springfield</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did ask our Advice, yet that they never put the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our Hands as Judges, and therefore deride us for our <hi>notable arguing</hi> upon ſuch a Suppoſition; But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis evident that they refer'd it to the Aſſociation, under no other Notion than of their being Judges in it, and iſſuing of it, as appears by Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s own Words, in his Letter to Mr <hi>Clap,</hi> which we will repeat again, <q>If you have any Thing further to object, I suppoſe, if you pleaſe, you may be heard at <hi>Springfield,</hi> on the 8th Day of <hi>April</hi> next, when and where the Matter will be iſſued.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In Page 32, you ſay, That our <hi>Argument is ſo pleaſant that you will give it the Reader in our own Words, by tranſcribing the whole 'Paragraph that contains it,</hi> which when you have done, you cry out, <hi>What can be finer!</hi> And so go on, in the next Page, with Banter and Deriſion: But, Sir, Ridicule is cheaper than ſolid Argument, tho' much leſs worthy of a goſpel Miniſter; it is eaſier to laugh at Arguments than to anſwer them: The Sum of what you pretend as an Anſwer is, that the Notion of asking Advice, is to ask other's Judgment to be directed no <hi>otherwiſe than to be aſſiſted in making a Judgment for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> And what then? If it be ſo, does it thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is not as we ſay, <q>That it is impoſſible, and ſelf contradictory, that any one ſhould ask Judgment to be directed, (even in this Senſe that you ſpeak of) that is already fully determined, that let the Judgment
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004152_0032_1003E0C2A684E2B8"/>
be which way it will, he will go no other Way than this.</q> Is it not <hi>ſelf contradictory,</hi> to ask Judgment to be directed in <hi>making a Judgment for himſelf,</hi> that has already <hi>ſo made his Judgment,</hi> that he is reſolved he will act no other Way than according to that Judgment, let the Advice be what it will? Is not this Children's Play? And is it a decent and orderly Way of treating the Body of neighbouring Miniſters? And did not the Conduct of <hi>Springfield</hi> People plainly carry this in it, in that after they had had a Society-meeting, and by the Vote thereof, had refer'd the Matter to us, and had choſen a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee on purpoſe, who came with Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> to ſeek the Judgment of the Miniſters, and then after they had put the Miniſters to the Trouble of a Conſideration of the Matter, took it out of their Hands again, before ever they had Opportunity to make any Judgment, and in treating them with the greateſt Contempt, becauſe that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> and the Witneſſes ſhould be heard Face to Face, that they might be capable of judging? Is there any need of looking into the Platform, in order to know whether ſuch a Behaviour ben't irregular &amp; abſurd, and that all thoſe that have been the Encouragers of that People in ſuch a Method of proceeding, may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked upon as the Abertors of Diſorder and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Such a Conduct is not only what common Senſe knows to be abſurd and diſorderly, but is ſo by the known Principles, both of Congregationaliſts and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians; for <hi>Springfield</hi> Church and Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> in the Method they began with, <hi>viz</hi> in referring the Matter to the Judgment and Advice of neighbouring Miniſters, did but act in purſuance of thoſe Principles in which both congregational and presbyterian Churches agree, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſuggeſt as if it were not agreeable to our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>) and this is evident by the Heads of Agreement aſſented to by the united Miniſters, formerly called Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian and Congregational, Chap. II. of the Miniſtry, Sect. IV. <q>That in ſo great and weighty a Matter as the calling and chuſing a Paſtor, we judge it ordinarily requiſite, that every ſuch Church conſult and adviſe with the Paſtors of neighbouring Congregations.</q> This
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004152_0033_1003BB992C3A0198"/>
ſuppoſes that the neighbouring Paſtors ought to enquire and uſe all proper Means, to enable them to paſs a Judgment and to give Advice.</p>
            <p>But you think that the Church of <hi>Springfield</hi> had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſon for doing thus, becauſe Mr <hi>Breck</hi> objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt one of the Committee as a Perſon prejudiced, and the Aſſociation would not take him off; and the Reaſon we give for it is, That Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to offer any Reaſon why he thought Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> prejudiced, and we knew nothing of ourſelves that ſhould incline us to think Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> an unfit Perſon; and we did not think it fit, without ſome weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to exclude the Miniſters of the Town, who were next Neighbours, and were above all others nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to have an orthodox Miniſter ſettled there. But you ſay <q>
                  <hi>that was Reaſon enough,</hi> it was ſufficient for him to ſay he look'd upon him prejudiced, upon this Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ought immediately to have excuſed himſelf, and all other Judicatures would have taken him of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </q>. But we conceive that you are miſtaken in this Matter, and that no other Judicature would have allowed it as ſufficient without ſome Pretence of Reaſon why he thought ſo; and we think your own Council to be an Inſtance of a Judicature that would not allow ſuch a Reaſon to be ſufficient; for when you ſat in Judgment on Mr <hi>Breck'</hi>s Affair, that Part of the Church that were Complainants objected againſt you as partial and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, and not only ſo but backed it with ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they feared it; and therefore inſiſted on it as moſt reaſonable, that they ſhould be allowed to have their Caſe heard by Judges mutually choſen, but could not be heard by you; you did not ſhew ſo much Regard to their Objections as to try 'em with any further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, as we did Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> who when he ſhew'd his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the Committee, offered him that his Caſe might be heard before the whole Aſſociation, and when this was refus'd, it was offered him, by his own Deſire, that he might join two or three others with the Aſſociation, but theſe Propoſals were rejected by him: You ſay, <q>if the Moderator did conſent to this, others did not, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004152_0034_1003E0C7DD703588"/>
therefore <hi>there is a Fallacy in what we ſay that tends to impoſe on the World,</hi> becauſe that when the ſame Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal was made by others in Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Name, and at his Deſire, you know ſeveral of thoſe Gentlemen manifeſted their Diſlike of it, and would not give their Conſent</q>. But tho' you ſay you know it, yet that there was no ſuch Thing, that never any ſuch Propoſal was made to us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by others in Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Name, nor any ſuch Propoſal rejected by us, is what we ſhall make abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently evident hereafter, when we come to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooper'</hi>s Letter to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> wherein you ſay this Propoſal was made. And how could a Perſon be treated with greater fairneſs? And how unreaſonable is it after all to charge the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation once and again, as you do, with unreaſonable Stiffneſs in this Matter?</p>
            <p>With reſpect to our <hi>third</hi> Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe three Elders that belong to this County, that ſat in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil as Judges of this Caſe, they each of them had once before, openly in Aſſociation given their Judgment, and upon a formal Conſideration, and where the Matter was particularly diſcuſs'd and debated, declared it to be their Judgment that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> ſtood already ſufficiently clear, with regard to thoſe Things that had been alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt him; and that all the neighbouring Miniſters that had ſuſpended their Judgment, were ſet aſide as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, and thoſe only that had actually given their Judgment already were employed becauſe free from Prejudice. This is the certain plain Truth, of which the World have this very good Evidence, that you don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deny it, nor can it be denied; nor do you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſhow how it is agreeable to common Senſe, that ſuch ſhould ſit as Judges again in the ſame Caſe, which is alſo impoſſible for you to do; but only pretend with huge Triumph that you have caught us in a Self contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, becauſe we ſaid but the Page before, that the Matter was taken out of our Hands before ever we had Opportunity to give our Judgments, becauſe it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had Opportunity to hear Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> and the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Face to Face: But you make a Contradiction
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004152_0035_1003E00910273160"/>
where there is none; for what was the Matter that was expreſly ſignify was particularly diſcuſſed and debated, but this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or no Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> ſtood already ſufficiently clear with regard to thoſe Things that had been alledged againſt him, whether what had been offered already, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Vindication, <hi>&amp;c</hi> was ſufficient for us to clear him? The one Part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that it was, and the other judged it was not, becauſe they thought it inſufficient to give any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, but that it was neceſſary that we ſhould hear the Witneſſes and him Face to Face, before we could give any Judgment one Way or the other, or that it was neceſſary that Judgment ſhould be ſuſpended till that Time: And this every one that was there preſent knows to be the Truth. And pray Sir, judge your ſelf, which acted the moſt like Friends of Juſtice and Truth, and the leaſt like prejudiced Perſons,</p>

            <p>But of this Matter we ſhall ſpeak more particularly afterwards.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to our <hi>fourth</hi> Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Council were choſen by thoſe that were a <hi>Party in the Caſe:</hi> The Sum of your Anſwer is, that it is a new Thing that ſo great a Majority of a Church are called a <hi>Party,</hi> on which you make a great Harrangue. Here we would obſerve, the whole Argument that you pretend to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is entirely ſlip'd over, and not in the leaſt touch'd, and only a vain Diſpute rais'd that don't concern the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument at all, about the proper Application of the Word <hi>Party:</hi> When we ſay <hi>they had made themſelves a Party with Mr.</hi> Breck <hi>in the Caſe;</hi> the plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Meaning of it is, that they had ſo ſided and united
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004152_0036_1003E0CDB9EB3D70"/>
themſelves to Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> that they were become one with him in this Cauſe, or that his Cauſe was become their Cauſe; ſo that they became <hi>one Side</hi> concerned in the Cauſe that was to be judged, or one of thoſe <hi>two Sides</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> that you undertook to judge between: The <hi>minor Part</hi> of the Church had Articles of Charge to exhibit againſt the <hi>major Part,</hi> as they declared to you in their Letter, Page 45 of the Narrative. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when there is a Cauſe to be judged between two, either <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Companies,</hi> we ſay they are the <hi>two Parties</hi> concerned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when it is ſo, and the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is elective, we ſtill ſay it is contrary to the Light of Nature, that one Party or Side ſhould chuſe all the Judges: And it is perfectly wide from the Buſineſs, whether you allow the Word <hi>Party</hi> to be proper or no, if they being one of thoſe two Sides between whom Judgment is to be made, if they chuſe all the Judges, the other Side, equally concern'd with themſelves, tho' they are ſmaller and weaker, are oppreſſed and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their Right; and if any Scheme of Diſcipline gives them Power to chuſe all the Judges, we ſtill <hi>ſay,</hi> and every one <hi>muſt ſay,</hi> that 'tis <hi>built on the Ruins of the common Rights of Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You appeared there in a two fold Capacity; you did not appear only as Ordainers, but as Judges of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cauſe depending between the major Part of the Church and the Minor: You yourſelf declare, Page 47, that this was the Buſineſs you came upon, <hi>to hear and judge of what might be objected:</hi> And how much ſoever the Part you ſuppoſe that called you was the major Part, and how much Power ſoever you ſuppoſe the major Part to have over the Minor, it don't alter the Force of the Argument.</p>
            <p>At the Bottom of Page 38, you ſay,—<q>But if this be the Right of <hi>one or two</hi> diſſenting Brethren in a a Church.</q> In the foregoing Page you obſerved there were <hi>but four</hi> that dissented: What need is there now of bringing the Number down to one or two?</p>
            <p>With reſpect to our <hi>fifth</hi> Reaſon, <hi>viz</hi> That the major Part of the Council was choſen by Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> himſelf:

and that 'tis contrary to the Light and Senſe of all Mankind, that a Man ſhould chuſe his own <hi>Judges,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is in effect to give him Liberty to chuſe his own <hi>Judgment</hi> In anſwer to this you ſay, 'tis true the Church <hi>gave Mr.</hi> Breck <hi>Liberty to nominate ſome of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Churches,</hi> and ſay that Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> in his <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae,</hi> mentions it as the Cuſtom of the Churches to agree with the Candidate what Churches to ſend to in Ordination. He has there no Manner of Reſpect to the judging a Complaint exhibited againſt a Miniſter or Candidate; (as has been already obſerved you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared there not only as Ordainers but Judges of ſuch a Complaint, and you was choſen by the Defendant;) and if he had, it would not make for you, but againſt you; for the Church of <hi>Springfield</hi> never agreed with Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> what Churches ſhould be ſent for: Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> never ſo much as <hi>nominated</hi> the Churches till after the Church-meeting was over, and his <hi>Nomination</hi> was never brought to the Church to ſee whether they would agree to it or not.</p>
            <p>You next proceed to conſider our <hi>ſixth</hi> Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the major Part of the Council were not regularly called, even according to your own Principles, and that becauſe the Churches you belonged to were never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to by <hi>Springfield</hi> Church. Here you allow the Conſequence to be good, and ſay, <hi>If this was ſo we might well ſay you intermeddled in an Affair that did not belong to you, and pronounce all your Acts to be null and void;</hi> and acknowledge your <hi>very Being as a Council, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Validity of your Proceedings, depends upon the Call of the firſt Church in</hi> Springfield: But you deny the Premiſes, and ſay, that <hi>to let the World ſee</hi> that you <hi>did not run before you were called,</hi> you will <hi>give a Copy of one of the Letters miſſive:</hi> And there we have a Copy ſigned with five Men's Names, and ſaid to be in the Name of the reſt; and then in the next Page, you give a Copy of theſe Votes of the Church, which are all the Votes of the Church that there ever was reſpecting this Matter, and there being in them only four Churches mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe in this County, and not any Mention of one
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004152_0038_1003E0D3F44489F8"/>
of your Churches, that came from far, and no Vote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting you but only this, <q>Mr. <hi>John Burt</hi> choſen to go to <hi>Boſton,</hi> as a Meſſenger to the Elders that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> ſhould chuſe to ordain him.</q> You excuſe their Vote's not being more <hi>methodical &amp; expreſſive</hi> with that, that the Church had not a Paſtor at their Head to guide them, (as if it were uſual for Churches to have Paſtors to guide them in ſuch Caſes:) But you ſay, <hi>the Church choſe four of the Elders, and the naming of the other four was left with Mr.</hi> Breck, <hi>and choſe a Committee to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Affairs reſpecting the Ordination, and that one neceſſary Affair for which they were choſen was to ſign Letters to the</hi> ſeveral <hi>Churches.</hi> But what does all this ſignify, as long as it is as plain as 'tis poſſible any Thing ſhould be, by publick Records, that not one of your Churches were ever ſo much as mention'd in any Vote of the Church, either before Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s <hi>Nomination</hi> or in Conſequence of it, neither <hi>expreſly</hi> nor implicitly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Method</hi> nor out of Method, neither in any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given to the <hi>Committee choſen to manage the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Ordination</hi> nor to the <hi>Meſſenger that was to go to them,</hi> nor any other Way? If there was any ſuch Vote, Why is it not produced? Or was there ever any Pretence that there was any Vote that, thro' Carleſſneſs, was not recorded, or that there was ever any <hi>other Church meeting,</hi> wherein there was any ſuch Vote, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wherein this Affair was ever agitated, or that there ever was ſo much as any open Mention, in any Church meeting, of your particular Churches,; being deſign'd to be ſent for? If there was any of theſe Things, why are we not told of them? Or can you find out any Way in which you might truly be applied to and called by <hi>Springfield</hi> Church without any, either expreſs or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Mention of you, in <hi>any Vote of the Church,</hi> and without the Churches knowing, when together, or in the Time of any publick Church Act, what Churches were to be applied to? And is the Form of the Letter miſſive barely conſidered, ſufficient Proof that you was choſen by the Church, againſt the moſt authentick Accounts of Facts, publick Records of Votes of the Church, confirmed by every
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004152_0039_1003E02100E67418"/>
one's Memory, and all other collateral Evidences? But you ſay, <hi>The Church choſe a Committee to manage the Affairs reſpecting the Ordination, and that one neceſſary Affair for which they were choſen was to ſign Letters to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Churches, of which thoſe Elders were the Paſtors.</hi> Of which, <hi>Firſt,</hi> we would enquire, how you know that this is <hi>one Affair for which they were choſen?</hi> There is no Account or Hint of any ſuch thing in their Votes. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Church did chuſe them to <hi>ſign Letters,</hi> they choſe 'em to ſign Letters without any Direction <hi>who to ſign them to;</hi> for the Churches were not choſen by the Church meeting: And if you ſay that the Church meant to give this Committee Power to chuſe for 'em; for the preſent we will ſuppoſe they did mean to give 'em this Power. This, we humbly conceive, by congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Principles, is what they could not do: A Church indeed may chuſe a Committee to conſider Things, and make Report; but their Determinations are not Acts of the Church till reported to the Church and made their own by themſelves: A Church may alſo chuſe a Committee to execute their Acts, as to ſign Letters in the Name of the Church; but then it muſt firſt <hi>be the Act of the Church,</hi> before they can execute it: The Buſineſs of a Committee is not to <hi>make Acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and when they have done <hi>execute their own Acts,</hi> that never have been paſſed by the Church. The Church by congregational Principles, we conceive, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo give up their Power of Election in any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, into the Hands of particular Perſons, therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting them their Officers, to exercise for 'em a Power that is originally in themſelves; and that becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Part of their <hi>Power of Priviledge,</hi> which by congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Principles they ought to <hi>ſtand faſt in</hi> and in no Inſtance to give up to others: The Power of Priviledge and the Power of Office, both, by congregational Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are originally in the Brotherhood, but with this Difference, that Chriſt has given them the <hi>Power of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> not to be exerciſed by themſelves, but to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome particular Member, to whom they ſhall commit their Power, ſo conſtituting him their Officer,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004152_0040_1003E0DE5A25F458"/>
to exerciſe this Power for them: But the <hi>Power of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> is ſo given them by Chriſt <hi>to be in them formally and immediately ſo as it may be exercis'd by themselves,</hi> as is evident by the Platform, Chap. V. Sect. II. But when once they have given it away, tho' it be but in one Inſtance, it ceaſes to be in them, in that Inſtance <hi>formally and immediately,</hi> 'tis in them no otherwiſe than the Power of Office, and can't be <hi>exerciſed immediately by themſelves.</hi> This <hi>Power of Priviledge</hi> therefore can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in any Part of it, be given up to particular Perſons, but ever remains with the Brotherhood; which further appears by the Platform, Chap. X. Sect. XI. <q>From the Premiſes, <hi>viz</hi> That the ordinary <hi>Power of Government</hi> belonging only to the Elders, <hi>Power of Priviledge</hi> REMAINETH with the Brotherhood, as the Power of Judgment in Matters of Cenſure, and Powers of Liberty in Matters of Liberty.</q> And then this is against the Power of Priviledges, for a Church thus to give up their Power of Election in any Inſtance to particular Perſons another Way; for 'tis a Power of Priviledge that is veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every Brother to have a Hand in the Election, and one Way wherein they have a Right to have a Hand in it is, to have Liberty of offering their Objections to the reſt of their Brethren, againſt thoſe that are nominated before they are choſen: But if the Church don't chuſe at all, but give away their Power to particular Perſons, they will have no Opportunity for this: As in this Caſe there was no Mention made in the Church-meeting, who were to be choſen; and thoſe who would have objected had no Opportunity for it. But then, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nothing can be more plain and manifeſt, than that it never was what the Church meant, to give that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee Power to chuſe for them; 'tis utterly inconſiſtent with their own Votes; becauſe 'tis moſt plainly implied in thoſe Votes, that they give that Power to ſome Body elſe that did not yet belong to their Church, <hi>viz</hi> to Mr. <hi>Breck:</hi> for tho' there is nothing in their Votes mention'd about the Committee's chuſing Churches, yet there is this Vote relating to Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> that we will repeat again <hi>Mr.</hi> John Burt <hi>choſen to go to</hi> Boſton <hi>as a Meſſenger to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004152_0041_1003DF364FB4ACF8"/>
the Elders that Mr.</hi> Breck <hi>ſhall chuſe to ordain him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, we would ask you whether or no this does not fully and plainly imply, that the Church left it with Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> to chuſe the Elders out of the County that were to ordain him? And whether therefore this Vote did not limit the Committee to Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Choice? And whether their being limited <hi>to the Choice of another,</hi> is not inconſiſtent with its being left to <hi>their Choice?</hi> And whether it being ſo that the Church never choſe you themſelves, nor ever gave the Committee Power to chuſe you in their Names, that it will not follow that the Church never choſe you in any Senſe whatſoever? The Matter is ſo plain that it ſeems to be meer Waſte of Words to diſpute about it, &amp; would be ſo indeed, were the Obſtacles, in the Way of Conviction, but ordinary. If there be any other Way of a Churches chuſing, beſides doing it by themſelves, it muſt be chuſing by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee that they have impowered to chuſe for them, and in their Names; but neither of theſe, we have now ſhown, ever was in this Caſe, unleſs Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> was their Committee, which you ſtrenuouſly deny, Page 41, and bring Arguments to prove that he was not, which you ſuppoſe in Oppoſition to us, juſt as if we, when we ſaid they made Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> their Committee, intended that the Church had formally paſſed a Vote, wherein they had uſed the Expreſſion, and had in Terms voted that <hi>he ſhould be their Committee.</hi> We don't deny but that Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s nominating your Churches, might have been conſiſtent with your being choſen by the Church, if he had only <hi>nominated to the Church,</hi> and the Church had then voted according to his <hi>Nominations;</hi> but inſtead of this he was left to nominate and chuſe too; his Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (if you will ſo call it) was after the Church-meeting was broke up, and was never brought to any Church-meeting at all, to ſee whether the Church would vote it or not: So that you was not choſen by the Church <hi>before you came,</hi> and therefore <hi>run before you was called;</hi> and you ſtrenuouſly deny, yourſelf, Page 43, that you was accepted as a Council, by any Vote of the Church <hi>after you came.</hi> You make a Sppoſition, Page 44, that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004152_0042_1003E0E3C8AE9478"/>
               <hi>Springfield</hi> Church had only deſired the Aſſiſtance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Elders, and theſe Elders had, with the Conſent of their Churches, come to them; and think this would have been ſufficient; but as to you the Elders that came from out of this County, the Church of <hi>Springfield</hi> never ſent either to your Churches, or to you their Elders.</p>
            <p>To what Purpoſe is it to tell of <hi>Springfield</hi> Churches failing in the <hi>methodicalneſs of Expreſſion;</hi> whether their Votes were more or leſs <hi>methodical</hi> it ſignifies nothing, as long as 'tis as plain as the Sun in the midſt of a clear Firmament, that you was never choſen at all by <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Church by any <hi>Expreſſion</hi> or Act at all, either <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical</hi> or <hi>immethodical.</hi> You ſay the true Intent and Meaning of their Vote is very plain, to any one that has a Mind to underſtand them, and no Deſign to pervert them: So it is indeed <hi>as plain</hi> as Words can make them; <hi>'tis plain</hi> that <hi>they had a Meaning,</hi> utterly inconſiſtent with congregational Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> not to chuſe the Churches that were to be applied to, out of the County, themſelves, but to leave that Matter wholly with Mr. <hi>Breck;</hi> and ſo <hi>it is plain,</hi> that according to their <hi>Meaning,</hi> you were not choſen by the Church themſelves, but <hi>only by Mr.</hi> Breck: And you muſt ſtretch the <hi>Meaning of their Votes</hi> very far, not only to make them have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to, but not poſitively exclude Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> of <hi>Sudbury:</hi> The Meſſenger was directed in the Vote to go to <hi>Boſton</hi> to the Elders that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> ſhould chuſe to ordain him; not a Word of <hi>Sudbury:</hi> 'Tis not <hi>eaſy,</hi> but <hi>hard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their Meaning,</hi> if by <hi>Boſton</hi> they meant <hi>Boſton</hi> and all the Towns twenty Miles round: But whether it was in <hi>Boſton</hi> or out, 'tis certain that Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k'</hi>s Choice was all the Warrant you had to come; and ſo, by your own Confeſſion, Page 40, we <hi>might well ſay you intermeddled with an Affair that did not belong to you, and pronounce all your Acts to be null and void</hi> To uſe your own Words, Page 37, to whom did it belong to chuſe what Churches ſhould be applied to but the Church itſelf? So that by your own Principles you were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a Company of <hi>Buſy-bodies;</hi> (tho' you make it an intolerable Crime in us, to ſay that which implied it in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004152_0043_1003E03569062E98"/>
our Proteſtation;) and if it be ſo, will it not follow that you have been the blameable Cauſes of all the Miſchief, and Confuſion, and Wounds to Religion, that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this Caſe. You often, with an Air of Triumph, mention it as an Inſtance of our doing what was none of our Buſineſs, that we took the Caſe into our own Hands before it was referred to us by <hi>Springfield</hi> Church: We have already ſhown the Groundleſſneſs and Injuſtice of ſuch a Charge; but your Injuriouſneſs in it does more abundantly appear by this, that what you charge us with is ſo manifeſtly and certainly, the very Thing you did yourſelf, and not only ſo, but came an hundred Miles twice, in order to it, and once in the very Depth of Winter.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to our ſaying that the Church never vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to deſire the Aſſiſtance of any Church at all, but only certain Presbyters by Name; you ſay they <q>choſe four of the Elders, that with the Churches, they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aſſiſt, thinking the Churches were ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed by naming their Elders.</q> What <hi>we</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from is what was publickly acted, voted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; but what <hi>you</hi> argue from is what they thought in the ſecret Cloſet of their Hearts: If that be according to congregational Principles, to make a Churches unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Thoughts the Foundation of other Churches Acts, we confeſs it is as you ſay, Page 44, 45, That we <hi>have no thorough Acquaintance with congregational Principles:</hi> What is moſt probable is, that the Church, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of congregational Principles, thought nothing about applying to any Churches, and did not know that there was any Need of it: And tho' you ſay it ſhews our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of thoſe Principles, if we ſuppoſe, that in caſe <hi>Springfield</hi> Church had only deſired the Aſſiſtance of certain Elders by Name, and thoſe Elders with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their Churches, had come to ordain, it would not have been agreeable to thoſe Principles: but in this Matter, Rev. Sir, we humbly think we underſtand <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Principles</hi> better than you, or are more willing fairly to repreſent them: By thoſe Principles an Elder can act nothing in another Church but by Vertue of a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004152_0044_1003BB37B6544F58"/>
Miſſion from his Church, but his Church has no Power to concern themſelves in the Affairs of another Church, or to give any one a Miſſion to act in them, till applied to by that Church: All the Acts of other Churches, as well as Perſons, as concerning themſelves in the Affairs of that Church, are, by the Tenour of your own Words <hi>null and void,</hi> if not applied to, and called by that Church: An Application to a particular Perſon don't give a Church Authority to act; the Delegate goes as the Churches Repreſentative, &amp; all that he acts is in the Name of his Church, and not by any Power of his Office as an Elder, which extends not beyond the Limits of his own Congregation; in his <hi>coming</hi> the Church <hi>comes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, however <hi>he</hi> has been <hi>called</hi> perſonally, yet if the Church han't been applied to, the Church comes <hi>uncalled:</hi> It 'don't at all follow that it is not ſo, becauſe the Platform ſays they may improve Elders of other Churches, as you mention; there the Platform meddles not with the Way of their being called; the Platform ſuppoſes that to be determined elſewhere. So that we ſtill ſay <hi>there was not one Soul of that Council called according to congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Principles:</hi> But yet there is vaſtly the moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Defect with reſpect to the Manner of your being called that came from far.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Page 45, concerning a certain Miniſter in this County, that <q>only certain Elders by Name were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to carry on his Ordination, and theſe never ſo much as choſen by the Church he was ordained to, <hi>if you are rightly informed.</hi>
               </q> But why will you venture to publiſh Things to prejudice the Country againſt the County of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and the Memory of the late ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> only on uncertain Information, which is indeed contrary to Fact; for the Elders were choſen by publick Vote of the Church.</p>
            <p>With regard to that Objection that we make againſt the Method taken by <hi>Springfield</hi> Church, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>viz</hi> That it makes void all Endeavours any Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can uſe to hinder the ſettling of heterdox Miniſters, and to prevent the Growth of Error in the Country; and that it opens a Door for the letting in of Error into
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004152_0045_1003BAEB29A08650"/>
the Country, becauſe if there be any Objection againſt a Candidate, or like to be any Difficulty on any ſuch Account, he can go where he will for his Judges: In anſwer to it you ſay, you <q>are perſwaded that the Care of Councils, reſpecting this Matter, is like to be as thorough and effectual as that of Aſſociations.</q> Juſt as if you ſuppoſed, that the Thing in Diſpute was, which was moſt likely to take thorough Care, Councils or Aſſociations; whereas we don't ſo much as mention it, nor has this the leaſt Relation to the Objection we make, which is exceeding fully and plainly declared to be this, <hi>that the giving a Man this Liberty of going where he will for his Judges, opens a Door for the letting in of Error,</hi> which is ſo plain that it needs no arguing upon to prove it; you and every Body muſt know it to be ſo at firſt Sight: And what is it to the Purpoſe to ſay, in anſwer to this Objection, as you do once and again, Page 46, and Page 96, that <hi>you</hi> have taken thorough Care, and if <hi>other Councils</hi> will take as much Care as <hi>you</hi> have done, there will be no ſuch Door opened? Does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that becauſe, in a particular Inſtance, a Council choſen agreeable to ſuch a Cuſtom, have been faithful, that therefore the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> it ſelf <hi>opens</hi> no <hi>Door to Error:</hi> If it were the Cuſtom to allow Perſons accuſed of Theft to chuſe their own Judges, would it follow, that this <hi>Cuſtom</hi> don't open a Door for the Increaſe of Theft and Robbery, becauſe it has once ſo happend that Judges Choſen by a Perſon accuſed of ſuch a Crime, but was indeed innocent (as you ſuppoſe in this Caſe) have been faithful and upright in their Judgment.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to what is related in the Narrative, Page 33, 34, of what the Rev. Mr. <hi>Allis</hi> ſaid, you think you have Authority to contradict us before the World, as having given an Account that is not true, becauſe Mr. <hi>Allis</hi> don't remember it; but if you have, 'tis becauſe his <hi>negative</hi> Teſtimony <hi>alone,</hi> againſt the <hi>poſitive</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>three</hi> that heard him, gives you Authority ſo to do.</p>
            <p>In Page 48, you take Notice of our charging ſome of the Council with laying out themſelves to be the Perſons that muſt be the Judges in this Caſe before-hand; and

particularly the Reverend Moderator of the Council, which we ſay is evident by a Letter he ſent to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> to get us willing that he ſhould come upon that Buſineſs, pretending to be unwilling to come without our Conſent; but when he fail'd of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that, he appeared reſolved to come nevertheleſs. Herein you ſay we <hi>have doubly abuſed Mr.</hi> Cooper, <hi>and baſely miſrepreſented his Letter;</hi> and that becauſe, you ſay, <hi>the Deſign of that was not to ask the Conſent of any of us to his coming up upon a Council, but to be preſent when Mr.</hi> Breck'<hi>s Matters were fully heard before the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation.</hi> But not withſtanding this bitter Charge, we will ſhew that it was impoſſible for us to underſtand Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> otherwiſe than we repreſented him, and that it is moſt clearly evident that we <hi>underſtood him right</hi> and <hi>repreſented him right, viz</hi> that the Deſign of his Letter was to ask our Conſent to come up upon a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and as ſent by his Church. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Long-Meadow,</hi> upon his being ſhown that Letter by Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> wrote a large Letter to Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> in his Anſwer to it ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeem'd deſign'd as an Anſwer to his, to the Rev.

Nothing can be more plain than that neither Mr <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k,</hi> nor <hi>Springfield</hi> Church, nor Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> had a Thought of putting the Affair on the Foot of any ſuch Propoſal, as joining ſome others to the Aſſociation; for as to <hi>Springfield</hi> Church, and Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> other Things were plainly reſolved before Mr. <hi>Cooper'</hi>s Propoſal was made; nor did they in the leaſt ſuſpend the Matter to ſee whether any Propoſal of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to the Aſſociation, would be complied with; for as has been already obſerved, tho' Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> his Anſwer was not delay'd but written with convenient Speed, yet the Church met to chuſe Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that <hi>ſame Day</hi> that he wrote his Anſwer; and Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> himſelf as ſoon as ever he receives that which he himſelf took for an Anſwer to his Propoſal, wherein that very Thing of joining others to us, was earneſtly deſired of him, he immediately rejects it as not being the Thing that was agreeable to his Mind: So that the whole Face of the Affair, as it then ſtood on all Sides, rendred it impoſſible that that Propoſal of Mr. <hi>Cooper'</hi>s ſhould be underſtood otherwiſe than as we underſtood it. Hence it appears that we never rejected any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of joining two or three more with the Aſſociation, as you ſay <hi>you know</hi> we did: Indeed we ever inſiſted on
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004152_0049_1003E1B65189EDE0"/>
a Propoſal that it might be ſo, and made the Propoſal once and again, after we ſaw that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Caſe to us alone. Hence alſo it is evident, tho' you do ſo load us with Reproach about this Matter, charging us, Page 35, with <hi>Fallacy that tends to impoſe on the World,</hi> and with <hi>a double Abuſe and Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> Page 48, and with <hi>ſetting this Matter in a wrong Light on purpoſe, and therein treating Mr.</hi> Cooper <hi>in a very diſingenious and injurious Manner;</hi> that yet our Charge is juſt, and our Witneſs demonſtratively true in this Matter, and that Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> did indeed, before he was ſent to, lay out himſelf to be a Judge in this Caſe; and that you yourſelf have miſtaken Mr. <hi>Cooper'</hi>s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and if you underſtood it in the Time of it, muſt needs have forgotten and be ſtrangely loſt and confounded in your: Thoughts about it ſince. Hence alſo 'tis evident that the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> in his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Cooper'</hi>s Letter, nor his <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> did not miſtake his Propoſal.</p>
            <p>And what, Rev.

And is this your <hi>riſing up before the hoary Head,</hi> as you profeſs to do in your Letter to the ſame reverend and aged Gentleman, Page 56? Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi> wrote that Letter with his own Hand, before ever Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Long-Meadow</hi> ſaw Mr. <hi>Cooper'</hi>s Letter to him, and got it tranſcribed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very difficult to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In our Defence, Page 79, we ſignify that we think that we have Reaſon to complain, that in an Affair wherein our Intereſt is ſo much concerned, and yours ſo little, you would reſolutely proceed, without giving any Heed to our earneſt Remonſtrances, and ſtand aloof from us when you come into the County, and never ſo much as friendly enquire of us, or give us any fair Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſpeak for our ſelves; and Page 90, 91, we ſay you did in this contrary to what you gave Reaſon to expect, who aſſured the Rev. Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> that when you came you would, before you proceeded, viſit us, and not act without us, much leſs againſt us: We ſay that indeed you propoſed that the Aſſociation ſhould be called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Springfield,</hi> when you came up, to give you their Reaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that it would in our Judgment have made an odd Appearance for the Aſſociation to be called together to appear before you, to give an Account of ourſelves, ſubmitting our own Conduct as well as Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Caſe to your Judgment. <q>This (you ſay.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a complicated Charge, in which there is a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of vile Miſrepreſentations,</hi> and that you call them ſo becauſe they muſt needs be <hi>wilful ones.</hi>
               </q> With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to your viſiting us before you proceeded agreeable to your Promiſe to the Rev. Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> you ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Page 57, <q>Could they imagine that we ſhould go from one Part of the County to another, to meet with them ſingly, when they live ſo remote one from another.</q> We anſwer, that conſidering your Promiſe, which you don't deny, we might well <hi>imagine,</hi> that you would go to more than one of our Houſes, which you did not; we might well <hi>imagine,</hi> that ſeeing all the Miniſters in the County that joined with you were <hi>viſited,</hi> and much Time ſpent with them, and even Mr. <hi>Rand,</hi> tho' about thirty Miles from <hi>Springfield,</hi> that you would have viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of us who were nearer than any of them; we might well <hi>imagine</hi> that you would have viſited the Rev.

came within a Mile and an half of his Houſe, in your Viſit to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> and went ſeven Miles beyond it in your Viſit to the Rev Mr <hi>Rand;</hi> we might well <hi>imagine</hi> you would have viſited Mr <hi>Hopkins,</hi> ſeeing you was in <hi>Springfield</hi> from Wedneſday Night to the Tueſday following, before the Council ſat, and his Houſe was but two Miles from your Lodgings: we might well <hi>imagine,</hi> that when you came to our Door, you would not refuſe to go in, as ſome of you did when you was at Mr. <hi>Hopkins'</hi>s Door; and might we not well <hi>imagine,</hi> and ſay, conſidering theſe Things, that you ſtood aloof from us, without <hi>vile and wilful Miſrepreſentation.</hi> The Reaſon you give why you did not viſit the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> is, that <hi>he ſeemed to think himſelf ill treated in your Letter, that you</hi> ſay <hi>was drawn up in as reſpectful Terms as you could do it; and therefore you diſpair'd of his thinking himſelf well treated by you in a Viſit.</hi> That is plainly, that you found Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſo touchy and waſpiſh that there was no coming nigh him, or having any Thing to do with him: But with reſpect to that Clauſe of Mr. <hi>Williams'</hi>s Letter, he declares that he had no reſpect at all to your Manner of writing in your Letter to him, and that there were more <hi>Terms of Reſpect</hi> in it than he deſired; but that what he had Reference to, was your ſhewing ſo little Regard to his repeated Inſtances and Repreſentations in this Matter, and that you do in that Letter ſo groundleſly ſuggeſt, that what we in this Affair were contending for, was the <hi>Rights of Aſſociations</hi> in Oppoſition to the <hi>Liberty</hi> of particular Churches, in calling and ordaining their Paſtors.</p>
            <p>But then you ſay, the Truth of the Caſe is, <hi>we ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof from you:</hi> And what if we did, does that prove that you did not do as we aſſert, <hi>viz. ſtand aloof from us;</hi> or did we ever paſs our Word, and aſſure any Body that we would not <hi>ſtand aloof from you?</hi> But in this you charge us very wrong: You ſay, Page 53, that <hi>we would not give you that Opportunity to confer and conſult with you that you earneſtly deſired and requeſted</hi> of us: But, Sir, with your Leave, we will put you in mind of what you know (as to the Subſtance of it) we did do; and we would

In Page 58, you charge us with treating you <hi>in a moſt unjuſt and injurious Manner,</hi> in thoſe Words in our Defence, <q>Indeed they propoſed that the Aſſociation ſhould be called together at <hi>Springfield.</hi> when they came up, to give them their Reaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And then ſaying this upon it, <q>But this, in our Judgment, would have made an odd Appearance, for our Aſſociation to be called together from all Parts of the County to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them, to give an Account of ourſelves to them, ſubmitting our own Conduct as well as Mr <hi>Breck'</hi>s Caſe to their Judgment.</q> All the Repreſentation that we here make of what you did is in theſe Words, <hi>Indeed they propos'd that the Aſſociation ſhould be called together when they came up to give them their Reaſons,</hi> &amp;c And what follows is plainly expreſſed, not as what you ſaid, but as of our Senſe what our complying with your Propoſal would be in effect; and we think ſtill that our Senſe of the Matter was right, not withſtanding your Letter's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing writ in reſpectful Terms, which we don't deny. We ſay nothing of your <hi>writing in an aſſuming Way</hi> as you expreſs, nor do we in any wiſe repreſent you as ſo wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, unleſs giving an Account of our Senſe (not of the Way of propoſing) but of the Thing propoſed, be to repreſent you as writing <hi>in an aſſuming Way: The Thing propoſed</hi> might be <hi>aſſuming,</hi> tho' not the <hi>Way of propoſing;</hi> you might have ſaid you would riſe up before the hoary Head, and uſed many other reſpectful Terms, if you had writ to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi> to come down to <hi>Springfield</hi> to do the meaneſt Office for you: But we think our Senſe of your Propoſal was right; if we had anſwered your Deſire we muſt have come to you not as being Judges ourſelves, but to appear before them that were ſo; you did not propoſe that we ſhould have any Hand in the Judgment; and therefore what could we have to do, who had ourſelves been before concerned in the Caſe, and had had it referred to us, and had acted and taken ſome Steps as Judges in it, but only to give an Account of Things relating to the Caſe before you as the final Judges?

that are cited by you, Page 58, that there might be <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time of Conſideration,</hi> and that you would wait for <hi>Things to get into a better Poſture,</hi> before you finally reſolved; and how your <hi>immediately</hi> reſolving, without <hi>any further Conſideration,</hi> or <hi>at all waiting to ſee if Things would get into a better Poſture,</hi> and your <hi>delaying two Months on purpoſe that there might be Opportunity for Conſideration, and Things got into a better Poſture</hi> (as you ſay you did, Page 59.) do conſiſt together, we don't know: How could it be expected that Things ſhould get into a better Poſture, when the contending Parties ſee that the Matter was already determined and reſolved, paſt Hopes of Alteration, by the Judges that one of the Parties only had choſen, that they would come and be the ſole Judges of the Caſe? And tho' you came to <hi>Springfield</hi> ſome Days before the Day appointed for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, yet your <hi>Driving and Violence,</hi> and not your <hi>Moderation</hi> appeared in the Manner of your improving that Time; for tho' you ſay, Page 59, <q>We went to <hi>Springfield</hi> a Week before the Time for the Seſſion of the Council, and let the Gentlemen there know that we ſhould do ſo <hi>that ſo we might have Opportunity to confer and conſult with them.</hi>
               </q> How that conſiſts with the Facts already related, we leave you to judge. And to what Purpoſe is it to tell the World, as a further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of your <hi>Moderation</hi> and waiting, that you delayed three Months after the firſt Time of your coming to <hi>Springfield,</hi> before you ordained Mr. <hi>Breck?</hi> When tho' you did not actually ordain him, yet you came to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, which was drawn up and read in Publick, wherein Mr. <hi>B</hi>—was juſtified, and his Party adviſed to ſtick by him: 'Tis your <hi>Driving and Violence as Judges of this Cauſe,</hi> that we ſpeak of in our Defence.</p>
            <p>As to what you ſay, Page 61, That <q>while Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> was reading his Papers, there came a Meſſenger on Horſe-back to ſpeak with him, who having finiſhed his private Meſſage to Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> rode away with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed, it is not unlikely, to inform thoſe that ſent him, how to time the next Meſſenger or Meſſage.</q>

In this and the preceeding Page you refer ſix or ſeven Times to Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s <hi>reading ſundry large Papers,</hi> and ſeveral remarkable Incidents thereupon: Whereas four of us then preſent well remember, that Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> did not read one of thoſe Papers, but they were all read by the <hi>Scribe of the Council,</hi> as they were ſeverally given in by the Witneſſes; and therefore it is impoſſible any Meſſage ſhould be done to him <hi>while he was reading thoſe Papers.</hi> And we ſuppoſe that the Meſſage that was done to him, was before the <hi>Scribe</hi> began to read them: But let the Time of the Meſſage be <hi>when it will,</hi> the Suggeſtion that you add upon it, <hi>viz. That the Meſſenger came to know when would be the beſt Time to apprehend Mr.</hi> Breck, is wholly falſe and groundleſs; for the Meſſenger ſaid nothing of ſuch a Deſign, but his Meſſage was of another Nature.</p>
            <p>You miſrepreſent and very much diminiſh the Matter of your inſiſting on hearing and trying this Cauſe of ſuch publick Concern in private: You ſay, <hi>the Weather was too cold to allow the Door to ſtand open, but it was not kept ſhut to keep out any that we deſired might be preſent:</hi> But this you know to be true, that You allowed none but Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to be preſent: 'Tis true you allowed <hi>ſome Thing that was deſired, viz.</hi> That the Miniſters of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that were Witneſſes might be preſent, which <hi>was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,</hi> after it was ſeen that nothing elſe could be obtain'd; but was far from being <hi>all that was deſir'd.</hi> The Door was kept <hi>faſt ſhut and lock'd</hi> (inſtead of <hi>juſt ſhut and latch'd,</hi> as it is through the Error of the Preſs in the Narrative:) The Hearing was as private as poſſible, for none were allowed to be preſent but the Witneſſes that were <hi>to be heard:</hi> So private were you, that when one of the Miniſters of the County, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Allis,</hi> came and ſtood in the Chamber, it was carefully enquired by the Scribe of the Council, whether he was a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and when it was anſwer'd that he was not, he was deſired to withdraw. This is not only contrary to Reaſon, and the Cuſtom of all Nations, for Judicatures to try Cauſes, and eſpecially Cauſes of ſo publick a Concern, in ſuch a ſtrict Privacy, but 'tis alſo contrary to congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004152_0057_1003E0FFE367E378"/>
Principles, as appears by the Rev. Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> in his <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae,</hi> that you your ſelf cite as an authentick Witneſs in ſuch Affairs, Page 160, <q>The Council coming on the Spot, firſt chuſe their Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and uſe all other neceſſary Preliminaries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they proceed into <hi>as publick a Hearing as they can have,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Meeting-houſe) of the Things that are to come under Examination.</q> And Page 165, "When the Council arrives, they firſt more privately form themſelves into Order, by chuſing a Moderator, and ſpeaking with all Perſons concerned, ſo far as they count it needful, by Way of Preparation for their Buſineſs, then they paſs into the Meeting-houſe, where being firſt conveniently ſeated, <hi>all Perſons that will may ſee and hear all that is done.</hi>" Here the Dr. is ſpeaking of this very Caſe, of the Tryal of an offending Paſtor. And what Shadow of Reaſon is there in that Excuſe you offer for this Privacy, <hi>viz That the only Reaſon why you did not go into a publick Hearing was, becauſe the Diſſatisfied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they would not ſubmit their Matters to you as a Council,</hi> as long as you would, and did, not with ſtanding take the Matter into your Hands <hi>as a Council,</hi> to try the Cauſe, finally to determine and iſſue it, and act and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute according to your own Judgment, whether they would or no? And therefore how does this alter the Caſe as to the Reaſon why it ſhould be publick? If a Criminal ſhould be arraigned before a Court of civil Judicature, and ſhould plead againſt the Juriſdiction of the Court, and refuſes, as far as in him lies, to ſubmit his Cauſe to them, but his Plea is altogether diſallowed, and they, not with ſtanding, reſolutely go on, and hear Witneſſes, and judge him, and paſs Sentence upon him, and execute him, would that be a ſufficient Reaſon why the Trial muſt be in ſtrict Privacy, and he and others muſt be ſhut out from hearing of it? Would not the World cry out of ſuch an Appearance of Injuſtice, that he muſt be executed on a Judgment found againſt him, he, and the World muſt not know how?</p>
            <p>As to your appearing Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s <hi>Advocates in the Court, before you came to a Reſult,</hi> we ever thought it to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004152_0058_1003E18D20B1EF20"/>
be very improper for thoſe that are called to be Judges in a Cauſe, to appear to be Advocates for the Perſon that is to be tried any where at all; and that for this plain Reaſon, becauſe acting as a Man's Advocate, and being engaged in pleading his Cauſe, naturally tends to give a Biaſs to his Mind in his Favour.</p>

                        <p>When I was at <hi>Springfield</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1735, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Council then being there; the Evening after Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> was apprehended, I, and the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who went to teſtify in Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Favour, were deſired by the Council to write our Evidences that Night; and produce them before the Council the next Morning, which we did, and carried them to the Council; the Rev.

                           <hi>Kirtland</hi> and <hi>Clap,</hi> and the other Witneſſes, having that Morning taken away the Papers they delivered to the Council the Day before; the Rev Moderator Mr <hi>Cooper,</hi> told us that he tho't it not proper that our Evidences ſhould be given into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but thought it beſt they ſhould be read before the Church; not where the Council were ſitting, but in ſome other Room. Before we were gone out of the

Chamber, ſome Body ſaid to the Moderator, I believe there are others who would be glad to hear them; would it not be beſt to ſtay till Notice may be given them? The Moderator anſwered, very well; I believe it would be beſt; it is no Matter how many hear them. The Man went away immediately, I ſuppoſe to give Notice, and while they waited for the coming of the People, ſome Body ſaid in the Council Chamber, there will not be Room in the other Chamber for the People that will come, would it not be beſt to read them firſt in the other Chamber to the Church; and to read them abroad to the People when they are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> anſwered, very well, I believe it will be beſt to do ſo. Accordingly they were read in the other Chamber to the Church, and after the People came they were read before the Door, as the <hi>Hampſhire Narrative</hi> ſets it forth.</p>

               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:004152_0061_1003E10BD49BAA50"/>
And we would alſo intreat you to conſider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing itſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> your adviſing to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reading of thoſe Teſtimonies, in order to repreſent thoſe Gentlemen to be Liars; 'tis true the <hi>Manner</hi> of its being done, <hi>viz.</hi> on Horſe-back was odd, but its being done <hi>ſo publickly,</hi> without any Opportunity given to the Gentlemen to be preſent to ſpeak for themſelves, is all that is of Conſequence in the Affair, whether <hi>on Horſe-back</hi> or <hi>on Foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides, in Page 82, you your ſelf allow two of thoſe Gentlemen to be <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel, of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Character &amp; Reputation,</hi> and ſay you <hi>gave Credit to their Teſtimonies</hi> as ſuch, and yet adviſe to the publick rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Declarations of ſome Perſons, to repreſent them to be Liars: What End could you have in this? Is it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miniſters of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> gathered together in his Name, to promote the Peace and Holineſs of his Kingdom, openly to repreſent to the Multitude concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters of the Goſpel, that they are Liars, and yet at the ſame Time own 'em to be Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Fidelity, and that their Teſtimonies are good, and declare that you allowed them to be ſo! By your own Account, your End could not be to weaken or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate their Teſtimonies <hi>in this Affair</hi> (and indeed you expreſly ſay it, Page 83,) or in any wiſe to help Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s <hi>Cauſe;</hi> for you ſay you allowed their Teſtimonies to be good <hi>in that Cauſe,</hi> and did <hi>lay all the Weight upon 'em</hi> that was due to ſuch Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Page 69, that it makes it look ſtill worſe in us, that we ſhould mention this young Gentleman's reading thoſe Teſtimonies, to repreſent Mr. <hi>Kirtland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> to be Liars, that theſe Gentlemen notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a Week or two after, aſſiſted in his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis true, thoſe reverend Miniſters, tho' ſo abuſed by this young Gentleman, did exerciſe an admirable Spirit of Meekneſs in this Affair; for ſome of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that he was ſettling amongſt were exceedingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at it. And had Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> been diſpoſed to recant he could have hurt his Intereſt there; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he laboured very much to quiet the People's Minds,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004152_0062_1003E195C6747740"/>
and to pacify them towards him. And when he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with about it he did not juſtify what he had done; and thoſe Gentlemen aſſiſted in his Ordination. And we can't ſee that their Moderation and good Temper in <hi>ſo eaſily</hi> paſſing over the <hi>Injury,</hi> can reflect any Blame upon us, for reciting a Fact ſo publickly tranſacted.</p>
            <p>Whereas we ſpeak of it, in our Defence, as a Thing that ſhews the Prejudice and Violence of the Gentlemen of <hi>that Party,</hi> that they intercepted, broke open, and publiſhed in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> a private Letter of a Perſon of Diſtinction to his Friend (meaning a Letter of the Rev. Rector of <hi>Yale College</hi> to Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>ms</hi> of <hi>Long Meadow</hi>) you ſay that <hi>this needs want, as many of our Stories un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily do, the needful Circumſtances of Truth</hi> because <hi>none of you of the Council</hi> ever intercepted it, or broke it open; but if it be ſo, is that an Evidence that <hi>none of the Party</hi> did it.</p>
            <p>We uſed the Word <hi>Party</hi> here, and not <hi>Council,</hi> for that very End that it might take in, both the Intercepter and the Publiſher. You ſay you <hi>had not the leaſt Thought of its being intercepted or broken open, till the Narrative told</hi> you <hi>of it:</hi> If it be ſo, 'tis very ſtrange; you were long before that told of it in the <hi>Boston Gazette</hi> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> I. wherein the Injuriouſneſs of expoſing a Letter ſo ſtolen, was inſiſted on. But if it was ſo, and was as you <hi>ſolemnly declare, that not one of you knew from whom nor by whom it came,</hi> certainly then you ought not to have expoſed it as the Rector's, to his Reproach; for if the Caſe was ſo, you knew not but that it was a meer Forgery. Why would you ſuffer your Hands to touch Goods that were brought to you after ſuch a Manner, that you knew were none of your own, but ſaw that they came with another Man's Mark upon them, as the original Owner, and knew not how they were gotten from him? Was it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, under ſuch Circumſtances, before ever he knew, or had made any Enquiry, to take them into his Houſe, and into his own Poſſeſſion, and improve them to his own Purpoſes, and to the Prejudice of the original Owner? Is this, Rev. Sir, becoming of your Office and Character? But you ſay that you never
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004152_0063_1003E1151C84B090"/>
publiſhed it, &amp; then, to prove it, you inſert an Extract of that Part of the <hi>Boſton Gazette</hi> that was referred to, whereby it appears that only ſome Parts of the Letter were publiſhed, with Interſpers'd Reflections, publickly to ridicule it: But is not this a miſerable Foundation to cry out of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth upon? 'Tis true you did not till now publiſh the whole Letter, but han't you expos'd the Letter, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the Author <hi>in Publick</hi> in a greater Degree, than if you had meerly done that? You have picked out ſome particular Parts of the Letter, that you ſuppoſed moſt for your Purpoſe of rendring the Author ridiculous in the Eye of the World, and have not only publiſhed, but in a fleering inſulting Manner, derided and diſcanted on thoſe Paſſages: The Fact that you have been guilty of, is the ſame in Kind and Denomination with what we have charged you with; thoſe of that Party han't only intercepted and broke open, but alſo publiſhed in the <hi>Gazette.</hi> If a Company or Set of Men, made up of ſome that had ſtolen a Parcel of Goods, &amp; others that were Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with them, ſhould be diſcovered in ſelling of them, and ſome Body ſhould ſay the Company were guilty, not only of ſtealing but ſelling the ſtolen Goods, would it not be thought ridiculous in them, to cry out of Slander and a <hi>Breach of the ninth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> on no better Pretence than only that they had not yet sold 'em all? You ſeem to deſire that it ſhould be much taken Notice of by your Readers, that we ſay that therein the Gentlemen <hi>of the Party</hi> have done that in the Face of the World as glorying in it, which common Knaves and Ruſſians, when they do, do privately, and keep ſecret, as being aſhamed of it: As we ſaid then, ſo we ſay now, and appeal to all Gentlemen and all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, whether or no it be any Thing more than a juſt Reflection? Or, whether the Expreſſions are at all harſh for ſuch an Act? You yourſelf acknowledge <hi>ſuch an Act deſerves to be had in Deteſtation and Abhorrence:</hi> And tho' we did not charge it on any of the Council then, yet while you are declaming againſt us for charging you with it, you immediately ſhew us and the World, that you are not afraid nor aſhamed to have it true of you;
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004152_0064_1003BBA654F5E7E0"/>
but do it in the Face of the World, and glory in it now, when you do fully know it to be a ſtolen Letter. You ſeem to pretend that you publiſh it in your own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to ſhow the World that all of it was not contain'd in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> wherein we ſay it was publiſh'd; and may perhaps be ready to juſtify yourſelf with that, <hi>viz.</hi> That we, by abuſively repreſenting that you had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Letter, made it needful for you to publiſh it, to ſhow that you had not: But ſuppoſing we have herein abuſed you, does that give you Warrant ſo greatly to abuſe another Man, that was not concerned in that Abuſe? Suppoſing the Author of that Letter himſelf, had by ſome injurious Reproaches caſt on you, rendred it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the Letter ſhould be publiſhed in your Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, tho' to his Diſgrace; yet, will your taking this Advantage agree with your ſevere and bitter Charges of us for publiſhing Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Teſtimony, that was not ſtolen, but our own (wherein was ſomething to Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k'</hi>s Diſcredit) which was done upon a like Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
            <p>But the Miſrepreſentation and Abuſe you pretend, that you publiſh the Letter to vindicate yourſelf from, is ours and not his, which renders the Thing much more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: You own that the intercepting and opening a private Letter is a <hi>deteſtable Thing;</hi> but certainly the publiſhing ſuch a Letter to the World, when you know it to be ſuch a one, is <hi>more deteſtable:</hi> Wherein conſiſts the Diſhoneſty of a Perſon's breaking ſuch a Letter open, but that thereby he makes it known to <hi>one</hi> that had no Right to know it, and that the Author did not deſign ſhould know it? But he that publiſhes it, don't only make it known to <hi>one</hi> that had no Right to know it, but to <hi>Hundreds,</hi> he expoſes it to <hi>the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides, you ſay, Page 70, That every Man of you do <hi>ſolemnly declare, to all that will give you the Credit of Men of common Honeſty and Truth, that a Copy of a certain Letter was brought to</hi> Boſton, <hi>but not one of you knows from whom, or by whom it came:</hi> So that you knew not who took the Copy, whether he was a faithful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or no, and how often it was tranſcribed, nor how
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004152_0065_1003E11937830770"/>
much it was altered and corrupted, nor how much the Author is abuſed in the Copy; and yet you venture to publiſh it as his, on purpoſe to render him contemptible, introducing it with ſuch a Flear as this, <hi>as they ſay it came from a Perſon of Diſtinction, ſo we judge it to be a Letter of Diſtinction:</hi> And indeed the Author is exceedingly abuſed in the Copy, it being falſe in no leſs than thirteen Places; and there are ſome very great Errors in it: If you exerciſed Reaſon, you could not but be ſenſible that it was not a true Copy; for tho' you often Laugh at our calling the Author a <hi>Perſon of Diſtinction,</hi> yet you muſt think that he knows how to write better Engliſh than that Copy, which in ſome Part of it is groſs Nonſenſe.</p>
            <p>Thus, Rev. Sir, you are pleaſed to vaunt yourſelf, and glory before the World, in ſuch an Abuſe of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creatures and Brethren, and Violation of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Juſtice, that you may have the Glory of ſtriking the hardeſt Blows.</p>
            <p>In Page 75, 76, you ſay, with Reſpect to this Rev. Gentleman that you have ſo abuſed, <hi>if neither his being there</hi> (at <hi>Springfield</hi>) <hi>nor his Conduct there, needs an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, why do theſe Gentlemen go about to make one for him?</hi> Wherein lies your Argument here? Is it not this, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Rector's being there, nor his Conduct there, was indeed not blameable, why do we, when we heard he was blamed, go to ſhow that he was not blameable? But then in the following Lines of the 76th Page, you undertake to ſhow wherein it was blameable; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that you ſay, in Line 5, 6, and 7, <q>He might, and no Doubt did, make a Viſit to his Rev. Father at <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> but we know great Part of his Time was ſpent at <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Springfield.</hi>
               </q> Here it is inſinuated, that he ſpent conſiderable Time at <hi>Northampton</hi> with the Juſtices: We ſuppoſe you ventured upon this on meer Conjecture; for in truth he rarely has ſpent ſo little Time among his Relations at <hi>Northampton</hi> when he came into this Part of the Country, and ſaw but one of the Juſtices, <hi>viz</hi> his Uncle <hi>Stoddard,</hi> with whom he ſpent but about half an Hour. In Line 7, and 8, you ſay, <q>Eſpecially at the latter Place, where he was more than
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004152_0066_1003E1A0A1DABB98"/>
once.</q> And why is this put in among the reſt of your Arguments to prove the Rector to be blameable, unleſs it be to inſinuate to your Readers that are ignorant of the Situation of the Towns here (which are far the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part of your Readers) that he came to <hi>Springfield</hi> more than once to concern himſelf in this Buſineſs, whereas a Perſon can't come from <hi>New-Haven</hi> to <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> in the common Road, and return again, without being more than once at <hi>Springfield,</hi> the Road being through <hi>Springfield.</hi> You ſay, Line 10, 11, 12, <q>We can hardly think he came as other Gentlemen do to an Ordination, when the Week before, he could confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently give out at <hi>Springfield,</hi> there would be no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or there ſhould be none.</q> This we ſuppoſe is ſaid on meer hearſay, and without any Manner of Foundation in fact; the Perſon that you thus charge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he only rode through the Town, and called at no Houſe, and ſpake with no Perſon from Mr. <hi>Willliams'</hi>s of <hi>Long-Meadow,</hi> till he got to the Tavern at <hi>Chikopee,</hi> ſix Miles above the Town, where he called to Oat his Horſe, and ſpoke with no Perſon there but a little Girl that was in the Houſe: and declares furthermore, that he not only gave out no ſuch Thing as you charge him with, <hi>viz.</hi> That there would be no Ordination, but did not ſo much as think ſo; but on the contrary, that he ſuppoſed no other, but that you would ordain Mr. <hi>B</hi>—as you intended. Line 12, 13, 14, you ſay, <q>Some others of <hi>Connecticut</hi> that were with him there, could give out the ſame.</q> Whereas there was no Body with him at that Time, but only his Son that came to wait upon him. In Line 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, you ſay, <q>And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not urge the ſerving the Warrant upon that Part of the Council that did not belong to the County, let the Gentleman who refuſed to conſent to it's being ſerved, be enquired of.</q> Here again we ſuppoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Conjecture is your Foundation; the Rev. Rector declares that there was no ſuch Thing in Fact, and the Gentleman you direct to enquire of declares himſelf abuſed, and that he has given no Foundation for you to inſinuate as if there was. In Line 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004152_0067_1003BB5BCD2A29B8"/>
proceed, <q>When Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> was taken from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil into the publick Town-Houſe, and treated after the Manner he was, did not Mr. Rector <hi>W</hi>—<hi>ms</hi> ſit there with a ſingular Air of Pleaſure in his Countenance.</q> When Perſons are publickly reproached for the Air of their Countenance, the Charge is of ſuch a Nature, that let it be never ſo groundleſs, no Man living is under Capacity to vindicate himſelf from it; it depending on the Eye and Judgment (and oftentimes the Diſpoſition) of Spectators, what an Air a Man appears with: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that ſaw the Rector, obſerved no Manner of Ground for ſuch a Reproach to be caſt upon him. Line 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ſay, <q>And did he not faithfully attend at <hi>Springfield</hi> till the Buſineſs was ſo far over, that the Warrant was ſigned to ſend him to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> then he rode away a little before, <hi>no doubt</hi> to prepare him a ſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in that Colony, and to do, as that <hi>Perſon of Diſtinction</hi> did, who wrote the Letter from <hi>N</hi>—<hi>H</hi>—to <hi>L</hi>—<hi>g M</hi>—<hi>d</hi>—<hi>w.</hi>
               </q> Here 'tis implied that the Rector went to <hi>Connecticut</hi> before Mr. <hi>B</hi>—, and what a dark Hint is here, as tho' you know of ſomething that he did going before Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k</hi> to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to prepare him a Reception in that Government, that you forbear to tell the World! When indeed you have ventured upon all this Reproach of this Gentleman, whom you by Way of Mockery call <hi>a Perſon of Diſtinction,</hi> wholly upon a meer Gueſs of your own, that <hi>he did go</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> before Mr. <hi>B</hi>—, and that he might probably do ſomething there that he might be aſhamed of; when indeed he <hi>did not go</hi> to <hi>Connecticut</hi> before Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> he never went out of Town that Night, but lodged at Mr. <hi>Williams'</hi>s of <hi>Long-Meadow:</hi> ſo many Things have you aſſerted and inſinuated that are contrary to Fact, in this one Page! On this Occaſion we would again pray you to reflect on what you ſaid of us Page 13, 14, where charging us with an <hi>evil and bitter, an uncharitable and unchriſtian Temper and Spirit,</hi> you ſay, <q>Such a Spirit ſufficiently diſcovers itſelf in many Paſſages of their Book, and in divers of the Stories they tell—of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons,—which, if they had more of Truth in

them, yet don't enter into the Merits of the Cauſe, and the whole Deſign of them muſt be only to fix, as far as they could do it, a Mark of Diſhonour and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace where they would have it worn.</q> How do theſe <hi>Stories,</hi> which you with ſo much Triumphing and Inſult <hi>tell</hi> about the Rector, <hi>enter into the Merits of the Cauſe in Diſpute between us,</hi> when you own at the Bottom of the Page, we ben'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> concerned in them, and ſay, Page 75, <hi>That you never blamed us for his being there, nor ſo much as heard us blamed?</hi> You have conjectur'd that the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor urged the ſerving a Warrant upon you, and we would deſire you to conſider whether you have not allowed and manifeſted in your Book, a great Spirit of Revenge towards him for it.</p>
            <p>Having, for a little while, done with the Rector, you in the next Place fall upon us, and blame us again for refuſing to give you <hi>a friendly meeting, and ſtanding aloof from you when you came into the County,</hi> tho' ſo contrary to Fact, as we have already ſhown; and then you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſhow how we have ſet up a Juriſdiction over the firſt Church in <hi>Springfield,</hi> and have invaded the Rights of a congregational Church, and are chargeable with no ſmall Degree of <hi>Injuriouſneſs, Uſurpation, and Tyranny.</hi> And here in the firſt Place, as a Proof of this, you charge us again with taking the Affair of <hi>Springfield</hi> into our own Hands, without it's being referred to us by that Church; which we have particularly anſwered already: And nextly you ſay, we endeavoured to keep the Caſe in the Hands of the Aſſociation, and bring the Church at <hi>Springfield</hi> under a Neceſſity to ſubmit to our Judgment: To prove this you rehearſe Part of a Letter, ſent from one of us to the Rev.

                     <cell>It is an odd Thing that the Caſe of a Candidate, brought before an ASSOCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATION, ſhould be wreſted out of their Hands, (nam ſub Judice lis erat) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Notion of the Privilege that the Churches have, to chuſe their own Officers, or of the Liberty to chuſe whom they will to ordain.</cell>
                     <cell>If the Charges againſt Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> were <hi>fairly</hi> heard before our whole Aſſociation, <hi>to whom they were ſent, (yea, if you yourſelf, &amp; one more Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a cool Temper, were added to them,)</hi> and he were acquitted by them, I believe Things would be like to be eaſy.

            <p>Now is one of theſe Columns a fair Repreſentation of the other? Is there as much of an Appearance of the Thing that you brought it as a Proof of, (<hi>viz.</hi> That we <hi>endeavoured to keep the Caſe in the Hands of the Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and bring the Church of</hi> Springfield <hi>under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſubmit to</hi> our <hi>Judgment</hi>) in the one as in the other?

               </gap> the Words are contained as in the Original. In ſuch a Way as this do you lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for your great Triumph in Page 82.: If you had put in theſe Words that you have left out, you could not ſay with ſo good a Grace as you do, <hi>Riſum teneatis amici:</hi> Is this, Rev. Sir, doing to others as you would that they ſhould do to you?</p>
            <p>The next Proof of our <hi>Uſurpation</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> that you bring is, that we ſay in our Proteſtation, <q>As to your ſelves interpoſing in the Affair, it ſeems to be a Breach of that Rule I <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. and properly <hi>Allotrio Epiſcopein,</hi> which according to the Tranſlation in our Bibles, is to be <hi>Buſy-bodies in other Men's Matters.</hi>
               </q> To which we ſay, That we don't think it any Evidence of <hi>Tyranny and Uſurpation</hi> in us, to ſay that of you that is ſo manifeſtly and certainly true of you, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhown this to be: Was it not the Part of <hi>Buſy-bodies</hi> for you to lay your ſelves out to be the Perſons that muſt be the Judges in this Caſe, before ever there was any Meeting of the Church to apply to any Body, and when others were poſſeſſed of it, by being ſubmitted voluntarily to 'em, by all Parties concerned? Was it not the Part of <hi>Buſy bodies,</hi> even by your own Principles and frequent Aſſertions, for you to thruſt your ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Affair, in a Part of the Country an hundred Miles off from you, without ever being applied to at all by <hi>Springfield</hi> Church, under a Notion of your being fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and our being unfit? Was it not the Part of a <hi>Buſy-body</hi> in one of you, to come fourſcore Miles to be a Judge in this Affair, that was not only never choſen by the Church, but actually ſhut out by their Votes? And is it any <hi>Uſurpation and Tyranny</hi> to tell ſuch <hi>Buſy-bodies</hi> that they are ſo?</p>

               </hi> which you moſt inſiſt upon and glory in is, that we <hi>called in the Help of

ſome Juſtices to interpoſe</hi> in this Matter: To which we anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it were ſo indeed, <hi>that we called in the Help of the Juſtices and got 'em to interpoſe,</hi> as you ſay this would ſhow nothing of <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> if it be as we think we have proved, that even by congregational Principles, you had no Buſineſs there; for if ſo, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining you was not in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to congregational Principles, but in <hi>Defence</hi> of them, and alſo in Defence of the publick Peace, that (it will inevitably follow) you were the Diſturbers of; and therefore the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi> ſpeaking long after with Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in that Paſſage of a Letter of his to Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> which you cite Page 81, proves no Spirit of <hi>Uſurpation</hi> in him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If ſome particular Miniſters of the County had <hi>called in the Help of the Juſtices,</hi> and it were an Act of <hi>Uſurpation</hi> in them ſo to do, how does that anſwer our Challenge, which was to ſhow wherein the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> had manifeſted <hi>Uſurpation</hi> in any of their Acts? for we in the ſame Place diſtinguiſh between what was done in <hi>Aſſociation</hi> and what was done out of <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> by particular Perſons? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If all thoſe Facts that you mention of us were true, how do they prove that we <hi>called in the Help of the Juſtices?</hi> You ſay you know that we <hi>came to Springfield:</hi> 'Tis true we did come: And have you not abundantly inſiſted on it in your Book, how much you deſired us to come to have a Conference with you: We came according to your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and came to the Houſe where you were ſitting, and much ſought for an Opportunity of conferring with you; but could have no other Anſwer from you but that <hi>you was buſy;</hi> and yet this is now brought as an Evidence of our <hi>Tyranny!</hi> And ſuppoſing it were as you add, that we came to Town when the Juſtices did, and that we were in Converſation with them from Day to Day, and that it be manifeſt by Mr <hi>Williams'</hi>s Letter, that he knew of the Deſign of the Juſtices, and that theſe Things were indeed ſaid, that you ſay were ſaid by one and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of us, Page 81, what do all theſe Things prove if true, but that when we knew of the Deſign of the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we manifeſted an Approbation of it? which is all

you your ſelf pretend to prove by them, when you come to draw your Conſequence: But is this the ſame Thing with <hi>getting</hi> ſome in civil Authority <hi>to interpoſe,</hi> as you <hi>poſitively</hi> charge us, Page 82. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thoſe Facts you mention are not true: You ſay we came to <hi>Springfield when the Juſtices did.</hi> This is a Miſtake, for we did not come there the ſame Day: You add further, that we <hi>were in Converſation, if not in Conſuls with them, and the diſſatisfied Party from Day to Day.</hi> And all the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation there is for this is, that while we were in Town, both we and the Juſtices kept together at the publick Tavern, where Strangers uſed to keep that had not Friends in Town to entertain them.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Page 81, that one of us ſaid the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <q>Tomorrow is Wedneſday, and mark my Words, the Town of <hi>Springfield</hi> will be in the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion it was ever in ſince it was a Town.</q> This we are all of us ignorant of: Indeed there was ſomething ſaid that we are ready to ſuppoſe the Story might ariſe from; but if ſo, 'tis exceedingly altered and added to. In the following Sentence you ſay, <q>The ſame Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when the coming up of the Council the ſecond Time was mention'd in Converſation, ſaid, if they do, the Jail is the fitteſt Place for them, if you are not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed.</q> This it ſeems you have charged on meer Hearſay, and the Report is without any Manner of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Fact that any of us know of And another Thing in the following Sentence you ſay <hi>you know,</hi> that another of us, ſoon after the taking of Mr <hi>Breck,</hi> could go where a Number that had been engaged in the Affair were together, and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Well Gentlemen, we have had a fine Ordination to Day!</hi> But how, Sir, did you know it: There has been ſuch a Report amongſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe of your Party of Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>ms</hi> of <hi>Long-Meadow;</hi> but he declares he knows nothing of it, and is as well ſatisfied that he never ſaid any ſuch Thing, or any Thing of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Look, as he can be of a Negative: The Rev. Mr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> that was with him at the Time when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported he ſaid this, ſays alſo that he is confident there was no ſuch Thing ſaid, for he knows Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>ms</hi> at
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004152_0073_1003E135E676F068"/>
that Time, in all he ſaid and did, appeared exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from any ſuch Thing; and beſides, particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry has been made of the Gentlemen that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and none of them can remember any Thing of that Nature. But how injurious is it in you. Sir, to labour to render our Names a Reproach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by publiſhing ſuch Things to the World, on no other Foundation than meer Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay? Han't you liv'd long enough in the World to know that common Fame and flying Report is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Thing? And would not you look upon that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter very much to blame, that did not reprove the ſpreading abroad in a Neighbourhood, ill Reports that he hears of a Neighbour, only on ſuch a Foundation? And ſurely then, Miniſters of the Goſpel themſelves ſhould not print and publiſh ill Reports, and that of Miniſters of the Goſpel, to render 'em ridiculous, on no other Ground! The injuriouſneſs of it further appears by this, that a Man has no Way to defend himſelf from Hearſay and flying Report, let him be never ſo innocent, it is like the Wind, he knows not where to find the Source of it, and 'tis in vain to fight againſt it. And how do you exclaim againſt us, Page 19, for publiſhing Things without ſufficient Evidence? And ſay our Haſte and Warmth carried us beyond it. Such a Courſe do you take to anſwer our Challenge, to ſhow wherein our <hi>Aſſociation has uſurped,</hi> and manifeſt that you think you do it ſo effectually, as to be enough to ſet your Readers into an incontinent Laughter!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You have not only not proved that we got the Juſtices to interpoſe, but in Fact we did not; we never put any ſuch Thing into their Heads; it was no Propoſal, or Invention, or Thought of ours, nor of any one of us, nor was any Thing acted by them as being moved or put forward by any of us: Yea ſeveral of us diſliked it, and particularly Mr <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Long-Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> that you do more abundantly load with Charges of the contrary, and ſay <hi>you</hi> know he ſaid as in Page 81, <hi>We have had a fine Ordination to Day!</hi> He was known to diſlike ſuch a Method, inſomuch that the Party that oppoſed Mr.<hi>Breck</hi> were ſhy of acquainting him with their Deſigns in this Matter.</p>

Beſides the Arguments of the <hi>Uſurpation</hi> of our <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> here, there is another Thing you mention Page 4, as an Argument of it you ſay, <q>We find frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Narrative, of their Aſſociation, its Meetings, breaking up, Committee, Votes, and Doings.</q> What can you mean by this? Is it an Argument of <hi>Uſurpation</hi> in us, that we call our ſelves an <hi>Aſſociation?</hi> As if congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Divines were Strangers to ſuch a Term, when Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> whom you cite as ſuch an one, often uſes <hi>the Term</hi> in his <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae,</hi> and approves <hi>the Thing</hi> as here practiſed, as has been already ſhown; and you your ſelves in <hi>Boſton</hi> call your ſelves ſo, as you have given an Account, Page 87. And is it any Argument of <hi>Uſurpation</hi> that we <hi>meet,</hi> and when we have met <hi>break up</hi> again? Or that we have <hi>Doings,</hi> and don't do nothing when we meet? Or that we ſignify our Minds by <hi>Votes?</hi> Or that we have in ſome Caſes choſen a <hi>Committee?</hi> As if any voluntary Society may not chuſe a Committee to ſerve the reſt and act for their Benefit!</p>
            <p>In Page 82, 83, you ſay, <q>That Mr. <hi>Laſel</hi> declares that when Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> came to him to get his Teſtimony, he would have had it run in ſuch Terms as he could not in Conſcience ſubſcribe to; and when he told him how his Evidence muſt run, if he gave one at all, then his Evidence was no longer deſir'd.</q> We have enquir'd of Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> about this Matter, and he informs us that he never went to Mr. <hi>Laſel</hi> to get him to give in any Evidence at all, and that the only Paper he deſired him to <hi>ſubſcribe,</hi> was a Paper containing his Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Manning</hi> and others, when the ſaid <hi>Laſel</hi> was preſent, of which there is ſome Account in our Narrative Page 60, 65.</p>
            <p>You nextly proceed to declare the Grounds on which you proceeded to the Ordination of Mr. <hi>B</hi>—; and to that End, in Page 85, 86, you publiſh the Reſult of your Council at its firſt ſetting, in which you ſay of Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k,</hi>—<q>Nor are we ſenſible of any Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his Morals, which diſqualifies him for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry; inaſmuch as thoſe Perſons who have thought themſelves aſperſed by him, have had an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to bring in their Complaints to this Council
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004152_0075_1003E13C1E3B5D58"/>
and yet have not done it; and to one of them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, he has given what we think a ſufficient Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the Rules of the Goſpel</q> Wherein you refer to that Confeſſion that Mr. <hi>B</hi>—ſent to Mr. <hi>C</hi>—, Page 19, 20, of the Narrative, and particularly theſe Words of it (as you explain your ſelf, Page 94, 95.) <hi>And ſo far as I have in any of theſe Things, or in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with you upon the Account of them, been faulty, or have failed in ſhewing that Reſpect which was due to you, or of that Meekneſs that becomes a Chriſtian, I ask chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Forgiveneſs.</hi> This ſhows how ignorant the Council was of the State of Facts relating to the Caſe that they judged upon, for the Defect in Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Morals, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Aſperſion that he coſt on thoſe Gentlemen which you refer to, as is evident by Page 94, 95, was his repreſenting them abroad to be Liars, which this Paſſage in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> has no Manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence to, but to another Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Talk to Mr <hi>Clap's</hi> Face, as is evident by the Words themſelves,—<q>And ſo far as I have in my <hi>Diſcourſe with you,</hi> been faulty, or have fail'd of ſhowing that Reſpect.</q> When Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> had been down to Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s on the Affair in which Meſſi. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> and <hi>Eliot</hi> of <hi>Lebanon</hi> were concerned, which is mention'd a little before in that Letter of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s, he told Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> he would ſue him at the common Law, and treated him with other indecent Language: This Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> who drew that Confeſſion for Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> had been informed of by Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> in a Letter, and therefore he inſerted thoſe Words in that Confeſſion; but Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi> never heard of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s charging Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> with Lying, till afterwards, as appears by Mr. <hi>Williams'</hi>s own Words, in the following Page of the Narrative; he gives his not then knowing of it, as a Reaſon why (when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it) he judged the Confeſſion which he himſelf drew to be inſufficient. And beſides Mr.<hi>Breck</hi> perſiſted in thoſe Things after his Confeſſion; yet you declare this as one Ground of the Reſult you came to. Ought you not, before you came to a Reſult on ſuch a Ground,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004152_0076_1003E1AB61E34EE8"/>
more fully to have enquired, and known what your Ground was?</p>
            <p>You moreover mention the Judgment given in favour of Mr. <hi>B</hi>—, with Reſpect to his Orthodoxy, by ſome Miniſters in <hi>Boſton,</hi> of which the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> was one, before he was come as a Judge in this Caſe, as one Ground of your Reſult. Before this, you ſpeak in Page 36, as tho' it were very ſtrange that any ſhould think that the Judgment then given ſhould diſqualify the Perſons that gave it from ſitting as Judges in this Caſe, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as tho' that Judgment no Way concerned the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe; but now it ſo much concerns the <hi>preſent Caſe,</hi> as juſtly to be made one Ground of a Judgment <hi>in the Caſe;</hi> which was the very Thing on the Account of which we objected againſt it, <hi>viz</hi> That Judges that have given their Judgment before, in an Affair that ſo nearly concern the Caſe, won't be likely to be impartial, but to be influenced by their former Judgment, and now it proves ſo in Fact by your own Confeſſion; in ſo much that you publickly declare that that very Judgment was one Thing that you even founded your Judgment upon ſitting in Council in this Caſe, and as ſuch inſert it in your very Reſult, and inſiſt upon it afterwards as a very good Ground too.</p>
            <p>But then as a further &amp; a more abundantly ſatisfactory Ground of your Proceedings, you produce his <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> and then when you have done, cry out of us, <q>It is very ſtrange thoſe diſapproving Gentlemen ſhould ſay in their Defence, that the Council declare in their Reſult, there was nothing in the Way of his Ordination, without his ever openly making any Recantation, or any Reflection on himſelf, for the Errors he had vented.</q> How he ſhould make <hi>open</hi> Reflections on himſelf for Errors he has <hi>vented,</hi> without ever <hi>openly</hi> owning that he had ever held any Errors, is what we can't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; this he never did at <hi>Springfield,</hi> nor in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> nor any other Way that ever appeared: He indeed ſays, in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> that tho' he had preached Errors, yet ſays at the ſame Time he did not believe them; and yet makes no Reflections on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004152_0077_1003BB75487B47A8"/>
for delivering in the Name of GOD, what he did not believe. But you ſpeak as if his Confeſſion of Faith abundantly anſwer'd all Ends, and call it a publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, and wonder that we ſhould go to ſay he made no publick Recantation: But according to what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage meerly an orthodox <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation of Errors formerly maintain'd and preached,</hi> we don't know: A Recantation of Errors, as we (and ſuppoſe all the World except your ſelf) underſtand it, ever implies theſe two things, <hi>Firſt.</hi> An Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſuch Errors were <hi>formerly held;</hi> and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That now there is an Alteration, that they are <hi>no longer held</hi> but renounced. We are well ſatisfied the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> would think himſelf greatly injured if ſuch a <hi>Conſtruction</hi> were out upon the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> which he made at his <hi>own Ordination</hi> And we think that more than meerly a Confeſſion of Faith was neceſſary in this Caſe, upon two Accounts, <hi>1ſt.</hi> Becauſe all the Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance or Block that was in the Way of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in the Miniſtry, was not an Incapacity in him to be a <hi>Teacher of Truth,</hi> by Reaſon of his not <hi>receiving the Truth,</hi> but maintaining Error; but alſo there was publick and open Diſhonour to Chriſt and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Doctrines, that was to be <hi>removed:</hi> GOD is openly ſinn'd againſt, and thereby a great Wound given to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is to be <hi>healed.</hi> You yourſelf allow, Page 84, that the Things objected againſt Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> are of no <hi>ſmall and trifling Nature,</hi> but on the contrary that you think them of very great Importance, and ſuppoſe you lay as much Streſs upon them as we do: And it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly appears by the Teſtimonies that you yourſelf allow to be good, that he did, after he was a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant and a Preacher of the Goſpel, and a little before he came to <hi>Springfield,</hi> very frequently and openly treat ſome of the moſt fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity with great Contempt, in a haughty and proud Manner, aſſerting the contrary Errors, preaching them from Time to Time, and in various Pulpits, and that he perſiſted in it, with abundant Obſtinacy, after many gentle Means and Endeavours to reclaim him, or perſwade him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004152_0078_1003E1AD0C330C00"/>
and thereby greatly ſtumbled many People: And is there nothing of the Nature of Scandal in all this? Is not here a Wound to Religion, that does properly call for ſome open ſelf Reflections, in order to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing healed? Suppoſing it had been ſome open Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality by which Mr. <hi>B</hi>—, or any Body elſe, had wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, and laid a ſtumbling Block before others, would it be ſufficient to remove it and heal the Wound, meerly for him to draw up a Catalogue of moral Duties, and ſay he owns theſe to be Duties, and intends to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice 'em, without ſo much as owning that he had ever vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated one of them? If a Man only treat his Neighbour with publick and open Reviling and Contempt, he is guilty of that, which by goſpel Rules debars him from Communion in Chriſtian Ordinances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11 and 6. 10, And will it be ſufficient to remove this Offence, and open his Way again to Communion, for him only to acknowledge his Duty, and profeſs a Purpoſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it in the ſeveral Branches of it, and thoſe of Love and Honour to his Neighbours among others, without making any Reflections on himſelf for his Sin, and Wrong to his Neighbour among others, without making any Reflections on himſelf for his Sin and Wrong to his Neighbour in this Particular, or ſo much as owning it? If you ſay tho' Mr. <hi>B</hi>—did caſt open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on the Holy Doctrines of Chriſt; yet it was not <hi>as ſuch,</hi> becauſe he did not then ſuppoſe 'em <hi>to be ſuch:</hi> However ſhould not a Man in ſuch a Caſe, when he comes to ſee that they were indeed holy Doctrines of Chriſt, be greatly humbled to think that he has ſo vilified them, and be ready to ſhow his Abhorrence of himſelf for it to all the World? Did it not become thoſe Jews that vilified Chriſt, thinking him an Impoſtor, greatly to reflect on themſelves before all for ſo doing, after they came to be convinced who the Perſon was that they had thus treated? This is not only highly agreeable to Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we think agreeable to the Practice of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Churches, who ever were wont to require more than an orthodox Confeſſion of Faith in ſuch Caſes; and agreeable to the Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> itſelf,

before it was over run with <hi>Arminianiſm;</hi> of which we have an Inſtance in Mr. <hi>Barret,</hi> who having preach'd Doctrines far leſs corrupt than Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s, at St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Anno 1595, was obliged by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of that Univerſity, particularly to recite over every Error, and acknowledge that he had ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> Another Reaſon why we think that more than meerly a Confeſſion of Faith was neceſſary, and that he alſo ſhould make ſome open Reflections on himſelf, is that this was neceſſary as an Evidence of his Sincerity in his orthodox Confeſſion: Having done as before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, we think that if he was ſincere, and was now really convinced of his great Error and Folly in ſo doing, that he would now readily and joyfully do it. For a Man in ſuch a Caſe, inſtead of reflecting on himſelf, to blacken the Witneſſes, that are Men and Miniſters of an eſtabliſh'd Character, (as you own) and to repreſent them as common Liars, don't ſeem to us to be any good Sign of Sincerity. But that we might well deſire and inſiſt on ſome further Evidence of his Sincerity, than meerly his now ſaying other Things than he did before, we think, comparing Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<hi>k'</hi>s own Words in his Vindication offered to the Aſſociation, with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, might convince you, particularly thoſe that follow.</p>

All Men may be ſaved if they will; and it is very harſh, (and I think he ſaid) unjuſt in GOD, to puniſh any Man for not doing what <hi>was not in his Power to do.</hi>

            <p>The Rev.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Peter Robinſon'</hi>s Teſtimony, Page 51, 52, <q>And Mr. <hi>B</hi>—ſaid that none ſhould periſh for Want of the Knowledge of the Goſpel, and that every Man that lived up to the Light of Nature, or to the beſt Light

he had ſhould be ſaved; and ſaid he, <hi>to what Purpoſe is it to believe that Chriſt came into the World &amp; died for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the like,</hi> for a Man may be ſaved without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or believing any of theſe Things; and ſeveral Times ſaid to this effect, that Faith in Chriſt was not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in order to Salvation; and more to the ſame Purpoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Teſtimony, Page 55, 56, <q>About the 20th of <hi>January,</hi> I happen'd to be in Company with Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> and he ſaid to me theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> I made ſome of the People angry at what I preached t'other Day: I reply'd what was that? He ſaid, I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that <hi>the Heathen that lived up to the Light of Nature ſhould be ſaved without Faith in Chriſt:</hi> And on Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Objecting againſt his preaching ſo, Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> teſtifies, that he ſaid, why would you not have me preach up the Truth. Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> ſaid he would preach People out of thoſe falſe and ſtingy Notions which they have been taught in; that the common People out of Pride and Self-conceit, confin'd Salvation only to themſelves: but I will have them to know that the Heathen may be ſaved as well as they can; and more to the ſame Purpoſe. Page 58, Mr. <hi>B</hi>—ſaid, Faith in Chriſt was not in its own Nature neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that all that was neceſſary in order to that End, was that Men ſhould forſake Sin and lead moral Lives; and this Men might do meerly out of Love to Vertue itſelf; and if Men did but attain the End, it was no Matter what Motive they acted upon; and ſaid he, <hi>Maſter Chubb</hi> brings a very ingenious Compariſon to illuſtrate it; and he took down the Book and turned the Place to me, and I read the Compariſon, which was after this Manner; Suppoſe there were a Company of Men in a Houſe, and ſome Perſon ſhould come in and tell them that this Houſe would fall in two Hours, and that they ſhould be all killed if they did not go out of it; now it may be ſome might believe what this Man ſaid; and yet for ſome Reaſons might ſtay in the Houſe: Others might not believe what the Man ſaid; and yet for ſome Reaſons might go out of the Houſe: And ſuppoſe that the Houſe ſhould fall at the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004152_0082_1003E1AF9DC70430"/>
two Hours End, it would not be their believing what this Man ſaid that would ſave their Lives, but their going out of the Houſe, and if they went out of the Houſe their Lives would be ſaved, whether they believed what this Man ſaid or no, ſo (<hi>Chubb</hi> ſaid) it was not Men's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any Thing Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſaid that would ſave them, but their living moral Lives; for if they did ſo the whole End and Deſign of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World would be anſwered; and they ſhould be ſaved whether ever they heard or believed any Thing about Chriſt or not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Meſſi <hi>Nathaniel Wales, Jonathan Bingham, Ralph Wheelock, Jabez Huntington,</hi> and <hi>John Bachus,</hi> jun. all jointly teſtified, Page 48, <q>That they heard Mr. <hi>B</hi>—in depreciating Faith in Chriſt, and ſaying that GOD was not pleaſed nor diſpleaſed with any Man for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving or disbelieving, deliver the ſame Compariſon in Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Pulpit, which he ſhew'd to Mr <hi>Clap</hi> in <hi>Chubb,</hi> which he mention'd there as what he took out of an ingenious Author.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We don't mention theſe Paſſages of theſe Gentlemen's Teſtimonies, as containing the whole Errors that were teſtified againſt Mr. <hi>Breck,</hi> but that they might be compared with the above mentioned Words of Mr. <hi>B</hi>—. You allow the Teſtimonies to be good, and ſay you improved them as ſuch: But if ſo, and their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, even as to the Main, ben't falſe, what ſhall we make of Mr. <hi>Breck'</hi>s aſſerting that he <hi>can truly ſay that be never did believe that Faith was not neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that he never had a Thought that the Heathen doing what they could would entitle 'em to Salvation; far be it from me to imagine any ſuch Thing!</hi> Shall we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably think that Mr. <hi>Breck</hi> has forgot all this? Certainly this at leaſt might well make us cautious inproceeding, and deſire to have ſome thorough Evidence of an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in him!</p>
            <p>You ſay, Page 92, if it be ſaid <hi>there ſhould be a Time of Probation; this there was in his Caſe: For he had been preaching at</hi> Springfield, <hi>after he leſt</hi> Connecticut, <hi>more than a Year and an Half, and approved himſelf orthodox,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004152_0083_1003E15D8C4EB608"/>
by the Tenour of his Converſation and Preaching there.</hi> In this you are miſtaken, for he ſtill perſiſted in ſome of the ſam-erroneous Opinions; and particularly that, that the Heathen might he ſaved without Faith in Chriſt, Nar. Page 7, 8. He told Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> that he diſſented from the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, tho' in ſo little a while after, when he thought it needful to ſerve his Turn, he on a <hi>very ſtrict Examination</hi> (as you ſay it was) conſents to that ſame Confeſſion of Faith, as you have declared, Page 86, 87. And he told one of us, <hi>viz</hi> Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> that he did not depart from any thing that ever he had preached at <hi>Windham;</hi> as is related Page 15 of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative: And this he held till he ſee it would not do to hold it any longer, and then at laſt pretends that he has received better Light than he had at <hi>Windham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Page 94, you miſrepreſent what he ſaid before the Aſſociation, about his charging Mr <hi>Clap</hi> with lying, <hi>viz. That he ſaid he was very ſorry he expreſs'd himſelf in ſo haſty and indecent a Manner; but he muſt inſiſt upon it that in what Mr</hi> Clap <hi>ſaid of him he was wronged.</hi> You was not there as we were: What he indeed ſaid there was this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he might have uſed other Terms, but the Thing that he aſſerted was true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Concluſion of your Book, you put up a very ſolemn Prayer to GOD, wherein you make uſe of the Words of Chriſt juſt before his Crucifixion, that we may be all united in Love and Peace: With reſpect to which we would pray you to conſider how that Prayer ſuits with your Treatment of your Brethren in the Miniſtry, and others, and particularly in that Book. Certainly it is not very decent for a Man while he is trampling on his Neighbour, with flearing Taunts and Deriſion, at the ſame Time to put up a Prayer to GOD, in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Expreſſions, that he and that Man may be united in Love and chriſtian Charity. We would pray you to take a little Notice of the following <hi>Specimen</hi> of your Treatment of us, and your Prayer for Union with us, together;</p>

            <p>Thus, Rev. Sir, we have endeavoured to vindicate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from your Reproaches, and to lay Matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction before you, that you have exceedingly gone out of the Way, and how greatly you have abuſed us, both in what you have done and written: We can't tell what Entertainment it will meet with from you, or with what Frame you will receive it: We earneſtly entreat that you would not ſuffer Reſentment to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo far, but that there may at leaſt be ſome ſerious Conſideration. You ſay ſome ſerious conſiderate Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have been a little ſurprized at our confident appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to GOD as our Judge in this Caſe; which was not, as you injuriouſly repreſent, that we have been sinleſs and perfect in all that we have done in it; but with regard to the <hi>goodneſs of our Cauſe.</hi> and (as we in Words expreſs it) <hi>with reſpect to our uprightneſs in this Affair:</hi> And let who will <hi>be ſurprized</hi> at it we confidently do it ſtill: We pray GOD to judge between us and you. Tho' now poſſibly your Heat of Spirit, and Contempt of us, may forbid any Self-reflections; yet will it always be a Comfort to you, to think that you have obtained the Victory and got your Will in this Caſe, and have been the Inſtrument of rendring the religious State of this County, that before always flouriſhed in an undiſturbed and happy Union, our religious Affairs being, with Peace and Love, &amp; general Conſent, managed within ourſelves? Will you always be glad that you have broke up that Order that has hither to been maintain'd amongſt the Miniſters of the County, for the Preſervation of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Doctrine among us, and have laid us under an Incapacity for defending ourſelves any more from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Error, by opening a Door that Candidates for
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004152_0086_1003E1B34A118F78"/>
the Miniſtry amongſt us may go where they will for their Judges &amp; Approvers? Our only Hope is that GOD himſelf, who has lately ſo wonderfully poured out his Spirit, and wrought in this County, will again appear for the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Intereſt among us, and that he has ſuffered our Hands to be thus weakened, to prepare the Way for the greater Glory to his Power, by carrying on his Work in our Weakneſs, by his own immediate Hand. If you think it not your Duty to repair the Injuries you have done us, we deſire you for your own ſake, that you would not go on to injure us by vilifying and miſrepreſenting us more. If you write again we have theſe Requeſts to make to you, with reſpect to the Manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you ſuppoſe that Reaſon and found Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will ſupport your Cauſe, that you would look upon Banter and Ridicule and ſarcaſtical Reflection to be as needleſs, and not ſo becoming a Miniſter, and ſo let it alone. Don't let us, Rev. Sir, try who can conquer at Scoff and Jeer, but let our Arguments fight it out; not that we glory in the Strength of our own Reaſon, but we glory in the Goodneſs of our Cauſe, which, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive affords good Argument, and therefore ſuch as are not liable to a juſt Anſwer. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you think you have Arguments from the Nature of the Caſe, ſufficient of themſelves to ſupport your Cauſe, we would pray you not to inſiſt on the Vote of the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, or the Judgment of any Perſons or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons whatſoever: We hope we don't fail of any due Honour to the honourable Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives; but might have many Things to ſay concerning that Vote, if it were to the Purpoſe for us to enter into Debate about it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If you pretend to give an Anſwer to the Arguments we in this Letter have inſiſted on, we would pray you not to ſlide over and paſs by that which we evidently intend as the main Force and Spirit of the Argument; but meet the Argument in its proper Courſe, and encounter it there where we evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently lay the greateſt Streſs. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That you would not publiſh Things to the World to do ſame us, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us odious and contemptible, on no other Foundation
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004152_0087_1003E169DC3F0C70"/>
than Hearſay and flying Report. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If you don't ſee Cauſe to anſwer theſe foregoing Requeſts, that you would at leaſt ſhew wherein they are not reaſonable, or what we may juſtly make and expect your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with.</p>
            <p>We leave it with you, Rev.
