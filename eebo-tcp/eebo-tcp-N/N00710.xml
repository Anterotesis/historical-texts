            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF ever there was a time when God ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly calls his Servants to <hi>Cry aloud and not to ſpare, but ſhew his People their tranſgreſſions,</hi> it is now, when <hi>Iniquity ſo abounds and love waxeth ſo cold.</hi> And as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> once ſaid, that <hi>Evil manners occaſion the making of good Laws</hi>; So the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid wickedneſs of ſome notorious ſinners, gives occaſion for the Preaching of Sermons more peculiarly ſerviceable for the rowſing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakning of ſecure ones, and loudly calling them to Repentance; when God toucheth the hearts of his Miniſters, with a feeling ſenſe of the danger of, and tender compaſſion towards
<pb facs="unknown:000856_0003_0FABB3050FE8C8D0"/>
thoſe that are going without regard in the path of deſtruction. That which gave birth to the enſuing <hi>SERMONS,</hi> was the prodigious example of a forlorn young Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that had defiled her ſelf with Whoredoms, and been the unhappy mother of two illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate children ſucceſſively, and became the barbarous Murderer of the latter of them; for which Crime, ſhe there ſtood under a ſentence of Death, upon due Conviction, and that before ſhe had ſeen full Nineteen years in the World: and for the which ſhe hath been ſince righteouſly executed. My Soul was the more deeply affected with her condition, <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe ſhe belonged to my Flock, and had received the Seal of the Covenant from my hands, and was under my Charge; in which I could not but feel an heart thrilling rebuke in the Holy Providence of God: <hi>Partly</hi> becauſe of the moſt amazing, and ſcarce paralel'd induration of heart, and tremendous Wickedneſs which ſhe diſcovered in and under her Impriſonment, to the deep conſternation of all ſerious ones that were acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall. Which will, I hope, plead ſufficiently for the ſuitableneſs of the Subjects treated of, and the ſeverity of the Words uſed in the proſecution of them. <hi>But ſhe is now gone, and hath given up her account to the Judge of all.</hi> Yet her example remains, and ſtands for the
<pb facs="unknown:000856_0004_0FABB3051B6F8770"/>
Warning of others. And doubtleſs God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that <hi>the living ſhould lay it to heart,</hi> and learn leſſons of Caution thereby. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured, according to the Grace given me, to Level theſe Diſcourſes for the Admonition of others, leaſt they alſo provoke a Sin hating God, to give them up to be more aſtoniſhing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his righteous ſeverity. And there are, I fear, <hi>more abominations</hi> as great as theſe, which have not yet ſeen the light; and may her example, and theſe warnings drawn forth by it, drive ſuch to a timely Repentance, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their peace with God. Let young Ones more eſpecially learn by her, <hi>To Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator early,</hi> and beware of ſuch ſins as were leading to the bringing of her to a fearful end; in particular let all Children, and ſuch as are under the Command of Parents and Family Government, beware of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Parents, and thoſe that have the Authority over them; let them be warned to take heed to themſelves of being linked in vain company, and take the wiſe mans counſel, Prov. 1.10. <hi>My Son, if Sinners entice thee conſent thou not.</hi> Let them beware of <hi>prophaning Gods Holy Sabbaths:</hi> of unneceſſary abſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Worſhip of God in his Houſe, or neglecting of any opportunities of attending on his Holy Ordinances; and let them be adviſed <hi>to keep their feet when they come to the
<pb facs="unknown:000856_0005_0FABB3064FCC28B0"/>
Houſe of God,</hi> and not ſuffer their hearts to wander into the corners of the earth, when they ſhould be learning what God the Lord hath to ſay unto them. Let them be warned againſt the neglect of <hi>Secret Prayer, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and be afraid of living content in an <hi>Unregenerate State,</hi> trifling away a day of grace, and putting off calls, and counſels, and the ſtrivings of the Spirit of God with them, as things that may be thought of ſoon enough, when they have taken their fill of their mad mirth, and glutted themſelves with ſenſual pleaſures; all of which Sins that poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acknowledged her ſelf to have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently guilty of: leſt, if you be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by her example, an Holy God ſhould be provoked to <hi>leave you up to your own hearts luſts.</hi> Be ſure therefore to read in her a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that truth, <hi>that for theſe things the Wrath of God cometh on the children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Let Parents be rouzed up by this to take more care, and uſe more prudence in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that Authority over their Children, which God hath veſted them withal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of an over fond indulgence, in giving them an unreſtrained liberty: let it awaken them to ſay themſelves out with more induſtry, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, in <hi>training them up in the nur<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

make them more affectionate and importunate in praying with them, and for them; and put them upon the more watchful care over themſelves in their whole converſation, that they ſet no evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples before them, but write them a copy in their lives of all the counſels &amp; admonitions which they offer to them: fearing leſt, if they by their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect bring guilt on themſelves, their children ſhould be <hi>forſaken of God,</hi> and prove an <hi>heavineſs to their Parents,</hi> as this fooliſh Child did. May all that <hi>Fear God,</hi> and peculiarly his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath given a ſpecial charge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>to feed his Lambs,</hi> be excited hereby to more anxious ſolicitude, and induſtrious endeavours for the Souls of all whom they are concerned withal, and more eſpecially for the Riſing Generation, that they may not become <hi>a stubborn and a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Generation, a Generation that ſet not their heart aright, and whoſe ſpirit is not ſtedfast with God</hi>: And may the following Sermons be made any way ſerviceable to theſe good ends and purpoſes, God ſhall have the Glory; to whoſe gracious Bleſſing I Commend it, with my moſt hearty Prayers, Who am,</p>

            <p>I ſhall not now ſpend time in inquiring after the Occaſion of the penning of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> or in Analyſing of it. Let it ſuffice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that <hi>David</hi> in <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5, 6. repreſents the miſerable condition of wicked men, on the account of the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God, as it ſtands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged againſt ſinners for ſin. The ſumm of it is, that God <hi>takes no pleaſure in them,</hi> but <hi>hates &amp; abhors them,</hi> and therefore will not <hi>admit</hi> them into his <hi>favour,</hi> but will bring <hi>deſtruction</hi> on them: and one would think that every word
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000856_0008_0FABB30833358710"/>
ſhould be an envenomed arrow in the Heart or Conſcience of the ungodly. Our <hi>Text</hi> is one of thoſe ſhafts taken out of Gods quiver, and ſhot at every unregenerate Soul; and Oh! that they might be throughly wounded by it. The words before us are an aſſertion delivered by the mouth of Truth it ſelf, and may well terrify and amaze every Chriſtleſs Soul. In them we may obſerve two things. 1. The <hi>Subject</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>the fooliſh</hi>: I ſhall not inſiſt on the various uſages of this word in Scriptures; it is ſometimes improved in a good ſenſe; and ſometimes it is made uſe of in a bad ſenſe; and in this latter it is here: and thus it is frequently uſed for a <hi>Fool,</hi> or a <hi>Mad-man</hi>: and therefore many tranſlations read it, <hi>Inſani</hi>; the mad or diſtracted; men that are out of their wits 2. The <hi>thing aſſerted</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, <hi>they ſhall not stand in thy ſight.</hi> Hebr. <hi>before thine eyes, i. e.</hi> Gods, for of Him the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> is ſpeaking. <hi>Eyes</hi> are aſcribed to God after the manner of men, for he is a Spiritual being, and hath neither ſenſes, nor organs of ſenſe: and the word [Stand] ſignifies to be in <hi>a ſettled Condition:</hi> and it is in the laſt conjugation, which farther intends the ſignification. To ſtand then in Gods ſight, or before his eyes, intends an enjoying of, or being ſettled in his favour. It is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> taken from the favourites of Princes, who are admitted into their preſence, and ſtand before them at all times. And in this negative the contrary affirmative is included, <hi>i. e.</hi> they
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000856_0009_0FABB308D8114140"/>
ſhall fall before him, and be thruſt out of his ſight; and it alſo intends that he cannot bear the ſight of them, and will baniſh them his preſence. This may be referred to the preſent life and time; but hath a more peculiar reſpect to the great day of Accounts.</p>
            <p>Hence,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>All impenitent Sinners are fooliſh and mad, and therefore ſhall not ſtand in Gods ſight; which will render them extreamly miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three Propoſitions contained in this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> I. That all impenitent Sinners are fooliſh and mad.</p>
               <p>There are a ſort of perſons in the world, whom God in his word, is pleaſed to put the Character of fools and mad men upon, who are neither naturals, or void of the uſe of reaſon, conſidered as men; nor yet bereft of their underſtandings, through occaſional dotage or frenzy in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: and who are they? we have a ſummary account of them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. <hi>My people is fooliſh, they have not known me, they are ſottiſh Children, and they have no underſtanding; they are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</hi> The ſumm

Such as are afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Gentiles, who have not the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> the light of a natural Conſcience, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrivings of the Spirit of God in them; they are therefore ſaid to be a <hi>Law to themſelves, and their Conſciences to bear witneſs, and either to accuſe or excuſe, Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. and the Providences of God, which ought to be improved by that light, to excite them to repentance: thus the <hi>Goodneſs of God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>lead to it, Rom.</hi> 2.4. and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefits are called <hi>witneſſes, Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>his Judgments</hi> alſo are <hi>that the Inhabitants of the World may learn righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 26.9. (2) Such as thoſe enjoy who ſit under the means of Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſhews them the evil and danger of their ſins, and not only invites them to Repentance, but alſo gives them all ſuitable directions, and the greateſt imaginable encouragements to help them in it; and theſe are afforded to ſuch as are in the Covenant with him, Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>he ſheweth his word to Jacob, his statutes and judgments to Iſrael: he hath not dealt ſo with any nation.</hi> Impenitence in the former of theſe is a note of inexcuſable fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſo it is charged on their <hi>fooliſh minds, Rom.</hi> 1.21. how much more then may it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the latter, and their folly be reputed the <hi>Paroxiſm</hi> of madneſs? inaſmuch as they have a price in their hands, and have not an heart to make uſe of it; and whence is that, but becauſe

they are fools; according to, Prov. 17.16. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there a price in the hands of a fool to get wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſeeing he hath no heart to it?</hi> they have life and death ſet before them, and they chuſe death; they have the way to eſcape the Wrath of God, and obtain Eternal Life, and regard it not; they are told whicher their ſinful courſes do lead, and where they will end, and yet they will take no warnings, but run wilfully and violently on to their own deſtruction, like that fool, Prov. 7.22, 23. <hi>he goeth after her ſtraitway, as the ex goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a fool to the correction of the Stocks, till a dart ſtrike through his liver, as a bird hacteth to the ſnare, and knoweth not that it is for his life</hi>; they are invited and entreated to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God, and to put away their ſins by repentance, and they mind it not, but ſtop their ears, and harden their hearts, &amp; turn their backs; they have a day of viſitation, in which the <hi>things of their peace</hi> are ſet before them, and <hi>do not know it</hi>; they ſee others of their fellow ſinners cut off by Gods awful Judgments, and it makes no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon them: yea, they themſelves are brought to ſorrow and ſhame; and ſtill they will not be reclaimed: and were not <hi>madneſs in their heart,</hi> could they do ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. II.</hi> That therefore ſuch Sinners ſhall not ſtand in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Could that <hi>Philistian</hi> Prince ſay, 1 Sam. 21.14,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000856_0014_0FABB30F9AA040F0"/>
15. <hi>the man is mad, wherefore then have ye hrought him to me? have I need of mad men</hi>? &amp;c. and will not God declare as much concerning theſe? yea, he hath ſaid it, Text. Here two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no ſuch as theſe ſhall ſtand in Gods ſight. That this is ſo, our <hi>Text</hi> fully aſſerts, and many other parallel <hi>Scriptures</hi> confirm. All that lies before us at preſent, is to conſider what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this. The words are a threatning, and indeed a very awful one, as will preſently appear. Here then let it be obſerved, that the expreſſion may refer either to the time preſent, or that which is to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With reſpect to the time preſent; and then it intends that God will cut ſhort their lives, and hurry them out of the World before they ſhould have died, according to the ordinary courſe of nature; hence we read, Pſal. 55.23. <hi>bloody and deeeitful men ſhall not live out half their days</hi>; and Eccleſ. 7.17. <hi>be not wicked overmuch, why ſhouldſt thou dy before the time?</hi> It is a common favour which God allows to men as he ſees meet, to ſpare them, and let them fill up their number of dayes; whereas ſuch fools have reaſon to expect to be debarred of this priviledge, and poſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before hand. But I inſiſt not here, though this alſo affords matter of awful conſideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With reſpect to the time to come: and then to ſtand in Gods ſight, intends to enjoy his ſpecial favour and love, and we have this infelicity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11, and there are two ſeaſons
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000856_0015_0FABB31059942438"/>
wherein they ſhall be debarred of this favour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the day of Judgment. In ſome ſenſe all muſt ſtand before him then; <hi>i. e.</hi> all ſhall be cited to make their perſonal appearance before God, and receive their doom; but by ſtanding then, we are to underſtand their being <hi>acquitted</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> by him as his Redeemed; theſe only are ſaid to ſtand then; whereas theſe fools ſhall fall before the Judge; they ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaimed by him, he will ſay to them, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I know you not,</hi> Mat. 7.23. they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and have a ſentence of death pronounced on them, Mat. 25.41. <hi>Depart ye curſed,</hi> and in this reſpect it is ſaid, Pſal. 1.5. <hi>the ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Eternal Kingdom; into which the righteous ſhall be received, and partake in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting <hi>Viſion of God,</hi> theſe ſhall then be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Mat. 8.12. <hi>The Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs.</hi> We obſerved that the word ſignifies, <hi>A Settled Condition</hi>: Heaven is the Godly mans Inheritance, and when he comes there, he ſhall ſettle to remove no more; but there is no ſettlement for theſe, but an everlaſting excluſion from the preſence of God, which is a puniſhment ordained for them, 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 1.9. they ſhall never have one look or pitty or compaſſion from God any more for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the reaſon of this is, becauſe they are ſuch fools, this will appear, if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all men are fooliſh in their Natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,

ſtate, it is bred in, and born with them; it is the Wiſe mans obſervation. in Prov. 22.15. <hi>fooliſhneſs is bound up in the heart of a Child,</hi> and we have it more diſtinctly ſet forth in, Pſal. 58.3, 4 5. <hi>The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go aſtray as ſoon as they be born, ſpeaking lies.</hi> Ignorance of God, and alienation from him is rooted in the hearts of all the poſterity of ſinful <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Apoſtle give <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n us a true account how it is with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very natural man, before regenerating Grace hath renowed him, Eph. 4.18 <hi>having the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkned, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That yet there are a great many of theſe that ſhall ſtand in Gods ſight. God hath not <hi>left</hi> this fooliſh and ſinful race without all <hi>hope.</hi> The Doctrine before us, is not to drive the wretched children of men to <hi>deſpair.</hi> There have been ſuch as have added to their natural folly, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wickedneſſes, whereby they have expreſſed the height of their madneſs, who yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have been made partakers in this grace, to be heavens favourites, and taken near unto God, and entituled to all the Glories of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, what ſaith the Apoſtle? 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Neither Fornicators,</hi> &amp;c <hi>ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God, and ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed,</hi> &amp;c. and he puts himſelf in the number, in that declaration of his, Tit. 3.3. <hi>for we our ſelves alſo
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000856_0017_0FABB312F379F2B0"/>
were ſometime fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving of divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in order to this they muſt be made wiſe. Though God ſaves ſuch as have been foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, yet he doth not ſave them <hi>in</hi> their folly, but <hi>from</hi> it. God hates ſin, and it is his holy and pure nature that is diſplayed in his ſo doing, as Hab. 1.13. <hi>thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.</hi> There muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a change wrought in them, they muſt be cured of this diſtemper, in order to their obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this priviledge, though God be <hi>Gracious,</hi> yet he is <hi>Holy</hi>; and will not baulk this <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his, but diſplay it in the application of his grace to ſinful men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There muſt therefore a work of Sanctification paſs upon them, in which Sin muſt be ſubdued, and grace muſt be implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That God offers this wiſdom to all that live under the Goſpel, and invites them to ſeek to him for it. Herein God ſhews his good will to ſuch, in that he hath told them wherein the true wiſdom conſiſts, Job 28.28. <hi>to man he ſaith, the fear of God, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding</hi>; and hath pointed them to know where it is treaſured, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Col 2.13. <hi>in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> bids them come to him for it, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them ſo to do, Jam. 1.5. <hi>if any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000856_0018_0FABB3135E304580"/>
him</hi>; yea, and expoſtulates with ſinners about their refuſing of it, as one that is grieved, Prov. 1.22. <hi>how long ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? and ye ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it is by their impenitency that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners procure this to themſelves. If they would have hearkened to Gods voice, and received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, it had not been ſo: but becauſe they have hardened their hearts againſt all Counſel, and would not receive his reproofs, though he followed them with repeated cries and calls, and tried all courſes with them unto wonderful long ſuffering, he therefore puts them out of his ſight, and they ſhall fall before his judgment; hitherto therefore God reduceth the reaſon, and lays the charge on which the threatning is built; Prov. 1.24, &amp;c. <hi>becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will alſo laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. III.</hi> That this will render them extreamly miſerable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is here ſetting forth the miſerable ſtate of Impenitent Sinners; and the ſumme of all infelicity is contained in this very thing. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve therefore;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a woful infelicity for a Sinner to be every day expoſed to deſtruction, to have the Wrath of God continually impending over him,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000856_0019_0FABB3142017A320"/>
to be in the ſtate mentioned, Pſal. 7.11. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day</hi>; to have the Arm of Divine Vengeance up, with the glittering Sword of revenging Juſtice, ready to give him the deadly ſtroak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have nothing before him but a fearful expectation of fiery indignation which ſhall devour him, when it lights upon him; in the fulneſs of his ſtrength and folly, to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſend him down to the pit of endleſs miſery; ſuch is the condition of impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at the beſt; read at leiſure, Job 18.5. to end, and you ſhall find it there aſtoniſhingly deſcribed, and ſee 1 Theſ. 5.3. <hi>when they ſhall ſay, peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Their condition muſt needs be fearful who ſhall fall before God in the judgment: who ſhall not be able to ſtand, when they ſhall appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the great and terrible day. It is a dreadful thing to ſtand at an Humane Bar, and to have ſentence of death pronounced upon one by the Judge; it fills the by ſtanders with conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and what horror hath ſeized ſuch as have been under it? What ſhrieks, and cries have they uttered! what will it then be when the Judge of all the Earth ſhall ſay to the man, as Mat. 21.41. <hi>Depart thou curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Which Sentence will be immediately followed with as terrible an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and yet ſuch is the portion of Impenitent Sinners.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000856_0020_0FABB3151E18B258"/>3. That to loſe the ſight and favour of God for ever, is the quinteſſence of everlaſting miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; what ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Pſal 30.5. <hi>in thy favour is life.</hi> 63.3. <hi>thy loving kindneſs is better than life.</hi> 16. ult. <hi>in thy preſence is fulneſs of joys</hi>; and the Apoſtle thought he had backed his Exhortation with a moſt potent argument in, Heb. 12.14. <hi>follow after Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee God; in his light</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can we <hi>ſee light</hi>; and there is nothing but <hi>outer darkneſs</hi> out of it; he that loſeth God, loſeth all: there is nothing but deſtruction that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth this excluſion, Hoſ. 9 12. <hi>Wo to them when I depart from them,</hi> they fall under Gods indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we are told, Pſal. 11 6. <hi>upon the wicked be ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tempeſt; this ſhall be the portion of their cup</hi>; how miſerable then muſt theſe forlorn creatures needs be!</p>

               <p>Learn hence the grievous folly of thoſe that embolden themſelves in ſin, on preſumption of Gods mercy. The truth is, the fooliſhneſs of Impenitency in nothing appears more, than in the arguings by which men ſtrengthen themſelves in it: and among theſe, I know none more amazing, than the deluſion of a falſe hope in mercy; notwithſtanding men perſiſt in iniquity, and refuſe to return, this is that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, Pſal. 50.21. <hi>theſe things thou haſt done,

and I kept ſilence: thou thoughtest that I was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch an one as thy ſelf.</hi> And the Prophet urgeth it on them, Jer. 7.9, 10. <hi>Will you ſteal, murder, commit adultery,</hi> &amp;c <hi>and come and ſtand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſay, we are delivered to do all theſe abominations</hi>?

they that have them not muſt needs <hi>dy without knowledge,</hi> it is the main deſign of the means to point us to this; God gives <hi>Paſtors to feed men with knowledge and underſtanding,</hi> Jer. 3.15. What he ſaith of his <hi>Proverbs,</hi> may be applyed to the whole book of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3; 4. <hi>To know wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and instruction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you periſh in your impenitency under theſe means, you will never be cured. Sinners, by their hardneſs of heart, withſtand the efficacy of the Word and Ordinances; and when once it comes to that, that ſinners do practically ſay, as they did expreſsly, Jer. 44.16. <hi>As to the word which thou ſpeakeſt to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee</hi>; their caſe is next to deſperate We have God therefore expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating with ſuch, Pſal. 94.8. <hi>Ye fools, when will you be wiſe?</hi> Theſe are the only means which God hath appointed to bring ſinners to their right minds; and if the operation be contrary, it argues their caſe to be deplorable. Hence that complaint of our Saviour, Math. 23.37, 38. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>how often would I have gathered,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ye would not: therefore is your houſe left unto you deſolate.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. However you now deſpiſe inſtruction, yet you will mourn for it at laſt. It will be a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to loſe Gods preſence for ever, though now you can ſay unto him <hi>depart,</hi> yet when it comes to be your lot indeed to loſe all your hope of his favour, this will be unconceivable bit<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

and nothing will make it more bitter than to think, I had a day of Grace, wiſdom himſelf pleaded with me, ſtretched out his hands all the day long to me; I heard the precious truths of the Goſpel, I was told of my miſerable ſtate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to conſider of it, offered help out of it; was waited upon with line upon line, ſtriven with, both by Parents, and Godly friends, and faithful Miniſters, and by the Spirit himſelf together with them: I was told what it would come to; and yet I deſpiſed, I ſcorned, I would have mine own ways, and grew the more reſolute in them, and now I am but <hi>filled with my own devices, and made to eat of the fruit of my own ways</hi>: and how dreadful an eccho of Conſcience will this be? and yet we are told that thus it will be in the end, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.11. &amp;c. <hi>and thou mourn at laſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſay, how have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence think what a doom is haſtning upon you, and what an execution will follow that. You muſt very ſhortly appear before God; your day of Grace will ſoon be at an end; the time is drawing near when God will ſay that his Spirit ſhall ſtrive no more with you; the <hi>ax</hi> which <hi>lyeth at the root all</hi> this while, will <hi>cut you down,</hi> you muſt hear your terrible Judge ſay, <hi>depart from me, I know thee not, thou worker of iniquity:</hi> and when that word is once paſt, the ſentence will take place. And whither muſt you go, when you depart from him, but to <hi>everlaſting burnings</hi>? to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000856_0025_0FABB31D231BF210"/>
the <hi>worm that dyes not, to the fire that is not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> to eternal torments, to dwell with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and damned, and feel the endleſ impreſſions of the fury of a provoked God? and <hi>can your hearts endure?</hi> let theſe terrours of the Lord work on your hearts and perſwade them.</p>
               <p>And to that end,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be convinced of your folly and madneſs. As long as you are wiſe in your own eſteem, there is no hope that ever you ſhould be ſo indeed; or ſo much as comply with the means that are made uſe of to render you ſo; it is the remark in, Prov. 26.12. <hi>Seest thou a man that is wiſe in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. Converſion</hi> begins at <hi>Conviction</hi>; and men are led to that Conviction by <hi>Conſideration,</hi> as, Ezek. 18.28. <hi>Becauſe he conſidereth, and turneth away from his tranſgreſſions</hi> &amp;c. And think how unreaſonable a thing it is to chuſe Sin before Holineſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unprofitable vanities, before the glories of the everlaſting Kingdom: to gratify your luſts, and undoe your Souls; for a few moments pleaſure, in the gratification of the ſenſes, to ſuffer eternal ſeparation from God, and the fearful impreſſions of his inſupportable wrath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Deeply reſent your danger. Think it not a ſmall and inconſiderable thing to loſe Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence; and take heed of counting it a light matter to be thruſt out of it, after all the offers of it that have been made to you, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that have been put into your hands to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000856_0026_0FABB31DDBC1BE50"/>
gain it, and the importunate entreaties with which it hath been urged upon you, have been neglected, and deſpiſed by you. Yea, <hi>ſolemnly</hi> conſider, that you can in nothing more <hi>diſhonour</hi> God, or <hi>provoke</hi> him to haſten your wo day, and ſpeedily to put you out of his ſight at the fartheſt diſtance, than by <hi>hardning</hi> of your <hi>hearts</hi> againſt all his calls and warnings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be often pondering what a God you have to do withall. <hi>He is a great and a terrible God</hi>; if you loſe his favour, and procure his anger to burn upon you, you will certainly fall before it. What ſaith he? Pſal. 76.7. <hi>Thou, even those art to be feared; and who may ſtand in thy ſight when once thou art angry? He is an holy God</hi>; he hates, and is reſolved ſignally to teſtify his diſpleaſure at ſin; and wo to thoſe that muſt be made the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that diſpleaſure of his, better had it been for them, <hi>if they had never been born.</hi> He is a <hi>Juſt God,</hi> and he will not ſuffer the righteouſneſs of his Law to fail; and if bold ſinners will thruſt themſelves upon the ſwords point, they ſhall feel the ſmart of it, to their confuſion. He is a <hi>True God,</hi> and faithful to his threatnings as well as to his promiſes, and if he hath ſaid, that the <hi>fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight,</hi> let all impenitent ſinners look to themſelves, for they ſhall find that the <hi>Strength of Iſrael is not a man that he ſhouldly, or a ſon of man, that he ſhould repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the conſideration of all this make you haſty, and in earneſt to fly to God for his <hi>Spirit</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:000856_0027_0FABB31EA52C8290"/>
and <hi>Grace</hi> to make you wiſe. This is the right improvement that ſinners ought to make of the <hi>Terrours of the Lord</hi>: it ſhould make them afraid of the wrath of God, and put them into trembling at the apprehenſion of their danger; and by this fear to be ſtimulated to an uneaſineſs and reſtleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their preſent condition, and cauſe them to cry aloud to God, for his pitty and help, and by his Holy Spirit to work in them that great Change by which they may be turned from folly to wiſdom, <hi>from darkneſs to his marvailous light, from ſin to God.</hi> And let the dread of ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery as this ſeparation will certainly produce, be a ſpur to quicken you to make no more delays, leſt whiles you diſpiſe the mercy offered, and trifle away a precious day of Grace which you enjoy, you pull down vengeance on your own heads, &amp; be put beyond hope for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And to make you the more earneſt, look on, and take warning by every awful monument of Gods diſpeaſure on this account. There are thoſe Judgments of his in the World, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to be exemplary, for the rouſing up of ſecure ſinners, and terrifying of them under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his <hi>Holineſs</hi> therein diſplayed. When any are left by God to themſelves, and by their own naughtineſs run themſelves upon the ſword of civil Juſtice, and muſt be cut off by it, God would have <hi>all Iſrael to hear, and fear, and do no more ſo preſumptuouſly.</hi> Such an one we have now, in the Providence of God ſet before us; and the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000856_0028_0FABB31F7A0A1BC8"/>
Lord give us all the Grace to learn by it, and let young ones in a ſpecial manner, and more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, ſuch as are in their ſins, and leading a courſe, poſſibly as vile and abominable as that was which led her into this ſnare; take warning from this, and let it be a ſolemn admonition to you: let her <hi>Hiſtory</hi> be your <hi>Caution,</hi> leſt God be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to make you an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> too.</p>
               <p>And now let me direct my ſpeech to her, but let all ſinners in the Congregation take warning by it, and not look upon themſelves unconcerned. Let me then ſay unto you, that your own ſin hath found you out, and God hath made you a Spectacle to the world, of his righteous indignation. Your life is forfeited as to man; you are made a <hi>Curſe,</hi> and may not be ſuffered to live, but muſt be <hi>Cut off,</hi> leſt otherwiſe the Judgments of God ſhould fall upon the land. But ſtill <hi>there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing,</hi> with regard to your poor immortal Soul; though you muſt <hi>flee to the pit, and no man may ſtay you</hi>; yet Sovereign Grace can ſay of you, as, <hi>Job</hi> 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Deliver her from going down to the pit, I have found a ranſom:</hi> only know and be aſſured, that if ever you be <hi>Saved,</hi> you muſt be <hi>Converted</hi>; and in order to your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Converted, you muſt be <hi>Humbled.</hi> And for your help, I have five things to adviſe you about; and do you look up unto God, that you may be enabled ſolemnly to entertain them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000856_0029_0FABB3201CDC6998"/>1. Think what an egregious fool you have been; if ever God ſhew you mercy, he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print this thought on your heart very deep. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member then, you were born and brought up in a <hi>Land of Uprightneſs,</hi> in the <hi>Valley of Viſion,</hi> where Chriſt and Salvation by him hath been publiſhed. You were admitted in your Childhood to partake in the priviledges of the <hi>Goſpel Covenant</hi>; &amp; have been by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> Sealed to the Service of God, and devoted to be for him and no other. You have doubtleſs had many private warnings and counſels given you by your Parents, and Kindred, and Godly Neighbours. You have ſat under the clear Diſpenſations of the Word of God, in which you have been many a time over, told of your ſinful courſes, and the certain deſtruction that they would lead you to, if you held on in them, and been ſolemnly adviſed to <hi>break off your ſins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>; and all arguments have been uſed with you to perſwade you of the neceſſity and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your ſo doing. You have ſeen and heard of the falls of others, and of the miſery which they brought themſelves into thereby. You have been your ſelf left by God to fall into ſcandalous ſins, and warned thereby to beware and not to go on, leſt ſome worſe thing ſhould befal you; and yet how have you <hi>deſpiſed inſtruction,</hi> &amp; ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reproofs, and more deſperately reſolved in your own ways and courſes, until the holy God was provoked to leave you up to your ſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his reſtraining grace from you, and ſo ſuffer
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000856_0030_0FABB321EFD5AE88"/>
you, by your unaccountable madneſs, to lay your ſelf open to the Sword of Juſtice, and you muſt now dye, as one <hi>that would not be inſtructed</hi>; and you may well reflect on that expoſtulation, and think, that you hear God ſo ſaying to you, Jer. 2.17. <hi>haſt thou not procured this to thy ſelf, in that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?</hi> Cry out then bitterly of this your own fooliſhneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be convinced of the amazing danger which you have expoſed your ſelf to, by your fearful <hi>hardneſs of heart</hi>; and tremble to think, that this hardneſs that you are under the power of, may be <hi>Judicial.</hi> I am ſure it is ſo ſometimes, in Gods righteous judgment, with ſuch as God hath ſpoken to, uſed many endeavours with, but they would not receive his advice: <hi>affected hardneſs</hi> is very often puniſhed in this life, with <hi>inflicted hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; as Pſal. 81.11, 12. <hi>my people would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me. So I gave them up to their own hearts lusts, and they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in their own counſels</hi>; and what more fearful plague can befal any ſoul on this ſide of Hell? Had not your heart been dreadful hardned, would you not have taken warning by the firſt fall which God left you to, to have avoided ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more expoſing of your ſelf to ſuch another; nay, would it not have driven you to have ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for grace to prevent you, and for forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace through the blood of Chriſt? Had not your heart been deſperately obdurate, would
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000856_0031_0FABB32293A58A80"/>
you, when by your moſt egregious wickedneſs, you had again fallen into your former ſin, have run your ſelf over ſuch a precipice as this, to expoſe your ſelf, by adding of Murder to Whoredoms, to have your life taken away from you by the Hand of Juſtice; but rather have ſought your peace with God? Had not your heart been har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than an Adamant, would not the horridneſs of that Sin of Murder, which without all reaſon, and by an unaccountable deſperateneſs you preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated your ſelf into, have made you to relent? whereas inſtead of diſcovering a <hi>broken heart, and a contrite ſpirit,</hi> upon a reflection on it, your whole carriage both before and at your Trial, and at the very pronouncing of a Sentence of Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, hath been ſuch, and ſo ſtupendous, as hath put a grief of heart, into all that fear God, who have either ſeen it, or heard of it; &amp; what do you think this Impenitency will lead to at length, if God do not graciouſly heal you of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. See what a little time you have left you, and how ſoon your caſe will be determined for Eternity. I know, that there is never a bold and ſecure Sinner in the Congregation, who can tell but that he may be Cited before Gods Tribunal, ſooner than you ſhall, and had therefore need to ſee to his own concern: But this you know, that you are dead in the Law, and may every day expect to have the Warrant Signed, and warning given you to go to Execution. Well; bethink
<pb facs="unknown:000856_0032_0FABB323161EF2D8"/>
your ſelf; no more opportunity for the ſecuring your Souls Eternal Welfare is before you. When once you are dead, you are fixed unchangeably; if your peace be not made before then, you are gone for ever: And Oh, what a great work have you to do in a little time? and the Lord knows whether at preſent it be ſo much as begun in you; yea, there are fearful tokens that it is not. Oh that this pungent word may, by his grace give a forcible ſtroak unto it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suitably repent of all your follies in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Repentance and Pardon are inſeparable; &amp; you are told who it is that hath the diſpenſation of both, <hi>viz Chriſt:</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>him hath God exalted with his Right-hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins</hi>; and be ſure to ſeek to him for it, as you hope to obtain it; let all the obſtinacy and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart which you have laboured of, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bitter to you, call all your ſins to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and let every one of them be confeſſed &amp; bewailed apart; and more peculiarly thoſe ſins that have brought you to this, your pride, your diſobedience to your Parents, your impatience of Family Government, your company keeping, your Whoredoms, and your deſpiſing of Chriſt, who hath offered himſelf to you; and let all this lead you to the fountain of Iniquity, to the ſource or original of all abominations, and make you to confeſs with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. <hi>behold I was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi>

Beware of hiding, excuſing, extenuating, falſely denying of any thing, wherein the Glory of God is concerned: what ſaid he to <hi>Achan,</hi> when Gods Providence had diſcovered him, Joſh 7.19. <hi>My ſon, give glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, &amp; make confeſſion to him</hi>; and be ſure to pour out your heart before God, with the moſt aggravating ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, in all the circumſtances, with deepeſt ſelf loathings and hatred of your ſins, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly renouncing of them; remember what is ſaid, Prov. 28.13. <hi>he that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh ſhall have mercy.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. Now humbly betake your ſelf to the blood of ſprinkling; come to the fountain opened, to be waſhed in; there is enough in the blood of Chriſt for your pardon and healing, 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin</hi>; there wants not vertue in him to ſave ſuch an one as you are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are aſſured, Heb. 7.25. <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Iſa 1.18 <hi>though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> There have as great ſinners as you, ſought mercy, and found it.

               <p>— And after this the Judgment.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THIS Verſe is the <hi>protaſis</hi> of a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the <hi>Apostle</hi> makes uſe of in his Diſcourſe; which needs not for the preſent be inſiſted on, or laid open, in as much as we have now to do but with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Doctrine contained in the words themſelves. Among all thoſe things which men are invited to the ſerious contemplation of, there are none
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000856_0036_0FABB32925F44B18"/>
that carry more of ſolemnity in them, than thoſe of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi>: becauſe the former of theſe puts an end to mans life and time, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities; and the other diſpoſeth them to an Everlaſting and Unchangeable Eſtate. Death it ſelf is ſtiled a <hi>King of Terrours</hi> in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> could call it, <hi>[TON PHOBERON PHOBERATAION] of fearful things, the moſt fearful</hi>; but that which adds to the tremendouſneſs of it, is that it is a paſſage to the great and laſt Judgment, which the ignorant <hi>Gentiles</hi> had but dark notice of; but is evidently manifeſted in the Word of God, which we <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> are favoured withal. The verſe before us, gives us an intimation of both theſe, and of the certainty of them, as things which are appointed. The word [<hi>appointed</hi>] ſignifies both a <hi>deſignation,</hi> &amp; a <hi>reſervation</hi> of a thing; notifying that, as there is an Eternal purpoſe for it in the Decree of God, ſo it is his fixt and unchangeable will that it ſhall ſo be; and accordingly all men are reſerved for it. It is the latter of theſe ſtatutes then that I am now to treat of, though with that reſpect as it is conſequent upon the former. In the words then, there are three things to be obſerved:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A Statute for the Judgment is aſſerted; and thereby we are aſſured that it ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail; for the appointment mentioned in the beginning of the <hi>verſe</hi> hath reference to this as well as to death; and this is the firſt and moſt proper ſignification of the word.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="unknown:000856_0037_0FABB329E4F9A708"/>(2.) The time when it ſhall be, <hi>after</hi> that men dy. And although we are not told how ſoon it ſhall be after, yet we have Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to conclude, that every ones perſonal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will follow preſently upon it; though the great and general Judgment is reſerved until the conſummation of all things, as will be farther obſerved anon.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The ſubjects of it, or who they are on whom this Judgment ſhall paſs: <hi>men,</hi> indefinitely expreſſed; it intends all men: this Judgment is as extenſive as Death; yea there have been, &amp; will be ſome exceptions from the general Rule about Death, who have been tranſlated, or ſhall be changed; but even theſe alſo ſhall come to the Judgment.</p>
            <p>Hence,</p>

                  <hi>A certain Death ſhall be followed with as certain a Judgment. It is every whit as certain that men ſhall come unto Judgment, as that they ſhall Dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That every one muſt dy ſooner or later, is an acknowledged truth by all, and proved by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal experience: though, Oh how few do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to good purpoſe?

the enſuing account which they ſhall be called unto, and look no further than the Grave, where they think there will be an end of them, which muſt needs make them unconcerned for that which comes after. But here we are led into the contemplation of a more awful truth, which is no leſs real, though not ſo obvious to the ſenſes. I ſhall not at preſent enter upon any diſtinct or methodical diſcourſe about this matter, but only make ſome curſory glances on it. There are therefore three or four brief <hi>Obſervations</hi> which I ſhall make on this truth, to make it practicable.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> That there is a <hi>future Judgment</hi> to which all reaſonable Creatures ſhall be called. How far the Doctrine of a future Judgment hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the light of nature, in the Conſciences of men acted by humane reaſon, without the help of Scripture revelation, I ſhall not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But that it is an Article of faith, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by the infallible Oracles of that God who cannot ly, or be miſtaken, is written with Sun beams in his word. Read for this, Eccleſ. 12.14. <hi>God will bring every work into Judgment with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi> Acts 17.31. <hi>he hath appointed a day in which he will Judge the World in righteouſneſs, by the man whom he hath appointed.</hi> 2 Cor. 5 10. <hi>we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in the body</hi>; and we have a deſcription of it
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000856_0039_0FABB32C5074C4C0"/>
given to us by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, in <hi>Math.</hi> 25.33, <hi>to end.</hi> And it muſt need be ſo for, there is a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Government</hi> of God, to be acknowledged, in the managment whereof he will bring all reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures to an everlaſting ſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery, according to their Obedience or Diſobedience to the Law of that Government, in proſecution whereof he will diſplay the Glory of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> God deals with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his Government, according to the nature which he ſaw meet to beſtow on them in their Creation. Now when God Created man, he made him a reaſonable Creature, and thereby ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being treated in the way of a Covenant, by precepts and promiſes, and threatnings; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which capacity, he gave him a Command, and required his obedience to it; promiſed him a reward of life, in caſe of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of perfect Obedience thereunto; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Death againſt him in caſe he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey. He hath alſo, upon mans <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> by which he fell under a Curſe of <hi>Death,</hi> revealed to him <hi>a new and a living way</hi> for his recovery out of that miſery into which he was plunged; and hath treated ſome of that race with a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in which he hath promiſed them life upon their compliance with it, and menaced them with damnation, yea <hi>double damnation,</hi> on their neglect of it. All theſe things are abundantly teſtified to in the Word of God: Now men are, according to their behaviour, with reſpect to this diſcovery
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000856_0040_0FABB32CD7656528"/>
which God hath made of himſelf to man, and obligation which he hath laid him under, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of everlaſtingly: In order unto which they are to paſs under a <hi>Trial.</hi> Where there is a Law given to reaſonable Creatures, eſtabliſhed with Sanctions, there muſt needs be a Judgment, in which their relation thereto is to be examined, and a retribution made to them accordingly. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have complied with the <hi>Rule</hi> given to them, and are to receive a reward of life; or they have revolted therefrom, &amp; have not ſought and made their peace, according to the tenour of the Covenant of Grace; and then they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the wages of ſin, which is death, as we are told, Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> He therefore that acknowledgeth a Government of God over rational beings, muſt needs believe that there ſhall be a Judgment, or a time of Trial and Recompences.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> That this Judgment is after Death; this is the order that it is manifeſtly put in, <hi>Text.</hi> That there are many awful and ſtupendous <hi>Judgments</hi> that God brings upon men in this world, is not to be denied; in which he declares his Holineſs and juſt Indignation at ſin; and hence we are told, Pſal. 9.14. <hi>The Lord is known by the Judgment that he executeth.</hi> There is alſo a Court which God hath ſet up in mens <hi>Conſciences,</hi> at which Bar they are ſometimes ſolemnly tried, and being there convicted of breaking the Holy Law of God, &amp;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000856_0041_0FABB32D9B5861A8"/>
laying themſelves open to the vengeance therein threatned, they are filled with horrors. But it is another Judgment whereof we are now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which men are to appear before God, and receive from him their final doom, which, when it is once paſt, ſhall be immediately put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now this men come not to in this life, but after they are dead; ſo that death is not, as too many vainly dream, the laſt news that ſhall be heard of men, but there is ſomething more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and amazing that comes after it, and that is the Judgment. There is <hi>a Judgment to come</hi>; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> Preached to <hi>Faelix,</hi> at the report whereof he <hi>trembled,</hi> Acts 24.25. and when is that, but when men are paſt from time, and have done the work which they were engaged in in this life? while men are in this world, converſant in the body, they are upon probation for Etetnity, they are laying in, and making way for their account, and all that they do here bears a proper reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; for they are <hi>the works which are done in the body,</hi> which muſt be called to an after reckoning, 2 Cor. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 10. hence ſinners are ſaid in this time to be <hi>

                     </gap> up unto themſelves wrath against the day of wrath, Rom.</hi> 2 5. It is evident, that neither good men nor evil men are in this life, openly diſtinguiſhed in the obſervable Providences of God, except in ſome ſpecial inſtances; <hi>love and hatred cannot be known by all that is before them, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. yea, the wiſe man hath an obſervation, as if often times, the outward face of things look with a
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000856_0042_0FABB32E6E45C3A0"/>
contrary aſpect, Eccleſ. 8 14 <hi>there be just men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; &amp; there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous.</hi> What ſhall we ſay? It is for the preſent a day of patience &amp; forbearance with which God ſees meet to treat men, even the worſt of men withal, in which he lets them alone for a while, &amp; ſuffers them to go on, till they have filled up their meaſure: and though they give him uncountable and very grievous provocations, yet he falls not upon them. But yet he is brought in laughing at them all the while, and we are told the reaſon of it, Pſal 37.13. <hi>The Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his day is coming.</hi> Since then men are not called to their reckoning here, it remains that they be ſummoned to it afterwards; inaſmuch as it is certain, that God will ſooner or later manifeſt the glory of his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and make it known that he is the great <hi>Potentate</hi> and Ruler of Angels and men.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> That there is a particular Judgment to which every man ſhall be called immediately after Death. It is true, the general Judgment is reſerved for the great and laſt day, when, after the whole affair of time is wound up, God will call all reaſonable Creatures to an account; and, having raiſed up their dead bodies to life, and re-united them to their Souls, of which Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection alſo the word of God gives us the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; he will cite them before his Tribunal,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000856_0043_0FABB332C3B347E8"/>
and diſpoſe of them in their whole perſons eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, which day is peculiarly Celebrated in the Book of God; which, though it alſo follows after mans death, yet it will not be till a long time after a great many have dyed, and ſeen Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and that becauſe there were other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to be born, and live, and dy, until the whole <hi>Series</hi> of them, according to the Divine appointment, be conſummated. But there is, beſides this, another more particular one, which paſſeth upon the Soul, on its departure from the body, which, though it be not ſo frequently, or expreſly ſpoken of in the Holy Scriptures, yet there are alſo ſufficient intimations of it there to be found, enough to confirm our faith in the belief of it. This is an indubitable truth, that the Soul of man doth not dy a proper natural Death; nor is it capable of it. The man indeed is ſaid to die, by reaſon of the diſſolution of the bond of Union, and the ſeparation which is thereupon made between the Soul and Body, whereupon the body remains a Carcaſe, and muſt ſuffer Corruption, after which there muſt be a powerful Reſurrection beſtowed on it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its being made capable of ſtanding forth in Judgment. But it is otherwiſe with the Soul; that, in its ſeparate ſtate, ſtill retains its Spiritual and Immortal nature, which it is in no other way able to loſe but by an <hi>Annihilation</hi>; and it is accordingly diſpoſed of preſently to its unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate, whether it be of weal or wo. When
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000856_0044_0FABB334BAC96488"/>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> dyeth, his Soul is forth with carryed by a Convoy of <hi>Angels,</hi> into <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> and that is no other but a place and ſtate of actual Felicity. When the Wicked Rich man dyes, the next news that we hear of his Soul is <hi>in Hell,</hi> whether it is carried, and where it is diſpoſed of; and that not only as in a Priſon, but as a place of Execution, where it ſuffers the penalty which its ſin had procured for it: for this reaſon we have him pouring out his doleful complaint, Luk. 16.24. <hi>I am tormented in this flame.</hi> And we have <hi>Abraham</hi> brought in declaring concerning them both, <hi>Verſe</hi> 25. <hi>He is comforted, and thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi> When the penitent Thief dyes, he is the ſame day entertained with his Saviour <hi>in Paradiſe</hi>; for ſo Chriſt himſelf promiſed to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. which muſt needs intend a ſtate of actual bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enjoyed in that place. And why was <hi>Paul</hi> in ſuch a ſtrait, and ſo deſirous to <hi>depart? Phil.</hi> 1.23. it was <hi>to be with Christ,</hi> which he ſaith <hi>is beſt of all</hi>; which it could not be, if he did not preſently enter into communion with Chriſt in bleſſedneſs. Now certainly, mens going actually to receive rewards and puniſhments, neceſſarily infers a Judgment that is paſt upon them in order thereunto: for thoſe things are beyond all queſtion, diſpoſed of by God, in the exerciſe of his Government over the Creature, as he is the Judge of all. Beſides, there is ſuch an Indefinite aſſertion uſed by the wiſe man, which amounts to an univerſal, and hath a reſpect to all ſorts of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000856_0045_0FABB335F83F46D8"/>
men, Eccl. 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> Theſe two returns are put together as contemporary; and all Souls do not return to God as their Father, to be admitted into his Kingdom, and to dwell with him, and enjoy his favourable preſence for ever; that is a priviledge proper only to the Godly, and none ſhall enjoy it but thoſe whom Chriſt hath Redeemed and Saved. As for the ungodly, it is ſaid concerning them, Pſal 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell and all the nations that forget God.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to God as a Judge, to be doomed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by him, according to his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> That this is an awfull conſideration to men while they live, and peculiarly ſo to ſuch as are juſt ready to dy. I may not tarry at theſe things, to give a diſtinct and particular account of them, but muſt only give ſome brief glances at them: And there are two aſſertions in this Obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It carryes awe in it to men while they live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to put them on the greateſt Circumſpection to themſelves in their whole courſe. If there were no Judgment to come, what need would there be for men to take any care how or after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they lead their lives? The <hi>Epecurian Doctrine,</hi> let us drink and drab, let us revel and ſwagger, and give every ſenſual luſt its freeſt ſcope to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000856_0046_0FABB3369CF617D0"/>
it ſelf, might plead, if not reaſon, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and ſecurity; for, if there be no after reckoning, there is then no danger at all. But this thought, if it be rightly entertained, will be a ſtrong curb to ſin, and a ſharp ſpur to duty, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it muſt needs lead mens thoughts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſuch meditations as theſe: There is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a future Judgment, in which I am perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally concerned. I am Gods Creature, and am placed under the Rule of his ſpecial Government, and intereſted in the Sanctions of his Holy Law. I am now a probationer for that day, and all that I am doing in this world hath a reference unto that, and muſt come under the ſtrict examen of it. Every thought of mine heart, every word of my mouth, and every deed that I do, will then be called over, and tryed whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to, or diſſonant from the Rule, by the which I muſt be either acquitted or condemned; and ſo exact will that ſcrutiny be, that not ſo much as one idle word ſhall eſcape it, <hi>Math</hi> 12.36. <hi>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment.</hi> I am under the watchful eye of an all-ſeeing God, who keeps an exact account of all my thoughts, words and deeds, and will certainly in that day, bring them into open light, and ſet them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before me; <hi>For God will bring every work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judgment with every ſecret thing,</hi> Eccl. 12.14. I muſt dy ere long, and there is no poſſible avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, and then to the Judgment I muſt,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000856_0047_0FABB33759743470"/>
whether I will or no; and it will be utterly in vain for me to tire the <hi>Rocks and Mountains, to hide me from the preſence of the great God,</hi> or ſecure me from making my appearance before his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat. There will need no witneſs then to be produced to prove any of the matters that ſhall be alledged againſt me; ſince mine own Conſcience is an exact regiſter of all things, and will be more than a thouſand witneſſes. I am, all the time that I am living in this world <hi>laying up treaſures</hi> for eternity, and thoſe either of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or of miſery, which ſhall be righteouſly diſtributed to me, according as I have been lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in in this time. I have a righteous Judge unto whom I muſt give up my accounts, with whom there is no reſpect of perſons, and a vain thing it is to hope to bribe him; but according as my true ſtate, upon the moſt exact enquiry, ſhall be found, ſo will he take order about me, and paſs the ſentence either of abſolution or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon me. Now, what a check would ſuch reflections as theſe are, throughly believed, and fixedly entertained, give to the mad young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in the midſt of all his frolicks, and mar all the mirth of his greedy luſts, turning it into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs? God therefore offers ſuch a memento as this is to theſe. Eccl. 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth, and let thine heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:000856_0048_0FABB33823278EB8"/>
Yea, how would it put every one of us upon greater warineſs to our ſelves, and make a deep impreſſion of that advice upon our hearts, Eph. 5.15. <hi>See that you walk circumſpectly, not as fools but as wiſe, redeeming the time.</hi> How would it put us upon pondering our way, and living by rule, and make us afraid of raſh &amp; precipitant ruſhing into any action? I am ſure that <hi>Job</hi> tells us that he was awed by ſuch a thought as this, and upon it to look well to himſelf, leſt at any time he ſhould expoſe himſelf to the danger of not being able to hold up his head, when he ſhould be called to a reckoning, Job 31.14. <hi>What then ſhall I do when God riſeth up? and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And what an amazing thought muſt it needs be to them, that are at the point of death, except they have made their peace with God? As for thoſe indeed, who have through grace obtained a pardon &amp; acceptance unto life through the New-Covenant, this thought muſt needs afford to them all preciouſneſs and deſirableneſs; though ſtill, the very nature of the thing will carry in it an holy awe on their hearts. But as for all others, how can they, at ſuch an hour, look upon it without horror? Truly, the uncertainty of death, and the certainty of the following Judgment, and Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning he muſt then be called to, is enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to fill the ſinner with conſternation, for that he hath reaſon every moment to be afraid of the arreſt: though careleſs men, put away the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000856_0049_0FABB338F2AAB7E8"/>
thoughts of this, on preſumption that <hi>the viſion is for many days to come.</hi> But when he perceives that he hath but a very few days or hours to ſtay; death now ſtares him in the face, ſhews him its Warrant, and tells him he muſt be gone, &amp; there is no hope of a longer reprieve; what a tumult will it raiſe in him, and what pungent thoughts muſt it needs fill him withal? can he but reflect and ſay? my working time is now done, my day in which I have been laying up for another world, is over, and I am now ready to paſs into an amazing Eternity; and what an unconceivable change will it make with me? what little hope have I that this Change is like to be unto me for the better, and not for the worſe? I have indeed been hard at work in my little time, and purſued my buiſineſs with great eagerneſs, but what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of work is it that I have been doing? I have been laying up of vaſt treaſures, but where is it they are ſtored? I am now going to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Judge; my naked ſoul, muſt, in a very little while be brought before his Tribunal; and he will certainly recompence me, without all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, <hi>according to what I have done in the body, whether it be good or evil</hi>: If the life I have led in this world hath been wicked, how can I expect that my <hi>latter end ſhould be peace</hi>? There is an Heaven and an Hell before me, one whereof will receive me as ſoon as I depart; but into which of theſe am I like to paſs? the Judge will certainly appoint me to one or the other of them. Oh!
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000856_0050_0FABB339C6115C28"/>
where ſhall this Immortal Soul of mine lodge, when it ſhall be called out of this mortal body, &amp; ſhall be required at mine hands? Have I any good reaſon to think that it ſhall be received by the bleſſed <hi>Angels,</hi> and lodged in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome; or rather fall into the hands of rageful <hi>Devils,</hi> and be burried to endleſs <hi>torments</hi>? What manner of life is it that I have been leading in the World? Which way is it that I have been going? Have I choſen that <hi>narrow way that leads unto life,</hi> which there are but <hi>a few that find?</hi> or have I not rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and gone in <hi>the broad way that leads to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> in which the multitude of mankind are travelling? what Guilt is it that I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting to my ſelf by tranſgreſſing of Gods Law, and expoſing my ſelf to the curſe of it? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny horrid and amazing ſins do there ſtare me in the face? ſins which I have committed againſt light, againſt conſcience, againſt mercy and pati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence, againſt counſels and warnings, againſt the ſtrivings of the Spirit of God? and what hope have I that theſe ſins are forgiven, and ſhall not be laid to my charge? what grounds have I to think that my perſon is accepted with God? and what is the foundation on which my hopes are built? have I truly and cordially repented of theſe ſins of mine, or rather hardned mine heart againſt all calls, and counſels, into impenitence? have I really forſaken theſe ſins, never to have to do with them more, or do I <hi>not hold them faſt, and refuſe to let them go?</hi> Have I gotten into Chriſt by a true
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000856_0051_0FABB33BA7DE19B8"/>
and living faith? Have I made my Judge mine Advocate and my friend? or have I not deſpiſed all his offers of Grace and Mercy, and reſiſted his Spirit who ſtrove with me, and thereby horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aggravated my Guilt, provoked him to take Vengeance on me? How ſhall I appear before this Great and Terrible God? muſt I in that condition be haled to his Judgment Seat? is there nothing to be done yet for my ſafety, that I may not fall under his terrible indignation, but may meet him with comfort? muſt I dy, and be judged, and condemned, and damned for ever? Happy, yea thrice happy are they that can ſay as he, 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge will give me at that day.</hi> But as for me, what ſhall I do?</p>
               <p>I had choſen this text for a moſt ſolemn oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which had been deſigned for this day; which, in pity to an Immortal Soul, and to give Opportunity of a farther ſpace for repentance is deferred. God grant it to obtain the deſired end. But I hope, with his bleſſing, it may prove a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſubject, both to the miſerable object, and to the whole Congregation. I ſhall therefore offer at a brief Application of it.</p>
