            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>S</hi> 1. IT was as long ago, as the year 1637. that a Faithful Minister of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose Name was Mr <hi>Edward Symons,</hi> did in a Sermon afterwards Printed, thus Express himselfe;

An <hi>Observation,</hi> Or, <hi>I</hi> had almost said, an <hi>Inspiration,</hi> very dismally now verify'd upon us!

And behold, This very Morning, when I was intending to utter among you such Things as these, we are cast into an <hi>Heartquake</hi> by Tidings of an <hi>Earthquake</hi> that has lately happened at <hi>Jamaica:</hi> an horrible <hi>Earthquake,</hi> whereby the <hi>Tyrus</hi> of the English <hi>America,</hi> was at once pull'd into the Jawes of the Gaping and Groaning Earth, and many Hundreds of the Inhabitants buried alive.

The Devil is going to be Dislodged of the <hi>Air,</hi> where his present Quarters are; God will with flashes of hot <hi>Lightning</hi> upon him, cause him to <hi>fall as Lightning</hi> from his Ancient Habitations: And the <hi>Raised Saints</hi> will there have a <hi>New Heaven,</hi> which, <hi>We expect according to the Promise of God.</hi> Now, a little before this thing, you'l be like to see the Devil, more <hi>sensibly</hi> and <hi>visibly</hi> Busy upon <hi>Earth</hi> perhaps, than ever he was before: You shall oftner hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Apparitions</hi> of the Devil, and about poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple strangely Bewitched, <hi>Possessed</hi> and <hi>Obsessed,</hi> by Infernal Fiends. When our Lord is going to set up His Kingdom, in the most <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>visible</hi> manner that ever was, and in a manner answering the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> in the Mount, it is a thousand to one, but the Devil will in sundry parts of the World, assay the like for Himself, with a most A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Imitation: and Men, at least in <hi>some</hi> Corners of the World, and perhaps in <hi>such</hi> as God may have some special Designs upon, will to their Cost, be more Familiarized with the <hi>World of Spirits</hi> than they had been formerly.</p>

I Remember I have read of a famous man, who having a <hi>Clock-Watch</hi> long Lying by him, out of Kilture in his Trunk, it unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably Struck Eleven just before he Dy'd. Why, there are many of you, for whom I am to do that office this day: I am to tell you, <hi>You are come to your</hi> Eleventh <hi>Hour</hi>; there is no more than a <hi>Twelfth Part</hi> at most, of your life yet behind.

Then, <hi>Seducing Spirits,</hi> came to <hi>Root</hi> in this Vineyard, but God so Rated them off, that they have not prevail'd much further than the Edges of our Land. After this, we have had a continual <hi>Blast</hi> upon some of our principal Grain, Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diminishing a vast part of our <hi>Ordinary Food.</hi> Herewithal, Wasting <hi>Sicknesses,</hi> especially Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Mortal Agues, have Shot the Arrows of Death in at our Windows. Next, We have had many Adversaries of our own Language, who have been perpetually assaying to deprive us of those <hi>English Liberties,</hi> in the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof these Territories have been Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. As if this had not been enough; The <hi>Tawnies</hi> among whom we came, have Watered our Soyl, with the Blood, of many Hundreds of our Inhabitants. Desolating <hi>Fires</hi> also have many times laid the chief Treasure of the whole Province in Ashes. As for <hi>Losses</hi> by Sea, <hi>they</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:000657_0075_0FA9A370F7ECBA08"/>
have been multiply'd upon us: and particularly in the present <hi>French War,</hi> the whole English Nation have observed, That no part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has proportionably had so many Vessels ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as our poor <hi>New-England.</hi> Besides all which, now at last the Devils are (if I may so speak) <hi>in Person</hi> come down upon us, with such a <hi>Wrath,</hi> as is justly <hi>much,</hi> and will quickly be <hi>more,</hi> the Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the World. Alas, I may Sigh over <hi>this</hi> Wilderness, as <hi>Moses</hi> did over <hi>his,</hi> in Psal. 90.7, 9. <hi>We are consumed by thine Anger, and by thy Wrath we are Troubled: All our Dayes are passed away in thy Wrath.</hi> And I may add this unto it, <hi>The Wrath of the Devil too has been Troubling and Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, all our Dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what will become of this poor <hi>New-England</hi> after all? Shall we Sink, Expire, Perish, before the <hi>Short Time</hi> of the Devil shall be finished? I must confess, That when I consider the lamentable <hi>Unfruitfulness</hi> of men, among us, under as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and perspicuous Dispensations of the Gospel, as are in the World; and when I consider the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining State of the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi> in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with the most horrible Indisposition that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ever was, to Recover out of this Declension; I cannot but <hi>Fear</hi> lest it comes to this, and lest an <hi>Asiatic</hi> Removal of Candlesticks come upon us. But upon some other Accounts, I would fain <hi>Hope</hi> otherwise; and I will give <hi>you</hi> therefore the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to Try what Inferences may be drawn from these probable Prognostications.</p>

As for the <hi>French</hi> Cloud which hangs over <hi>England,</hi> tho' it be like to Rain Showers of <hi>Blood</hi> upon a Nation, where the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Blessed Jesus, has been too much treated, as an <hi>Unholy Thing</hi>; yet I believe, God will shortly scatter it: and my Belief is grounded upon a Bottom, that will bear it.

               <p>All this while, Mr. <hi>Beacon</hi> had no Advice of any thing amiss attending his Brother then in <hi>England</hi>; but about the latter end of <hi>June</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,

While she was there, she said in the hearing of two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, <hi>Mr</hi> Pacy <hi>keeps a great stir about his child, but let him stay till he has done as much by his Children, as I have done by mine</hi>: and being asked, What she had done to her Children, she answered, <hi>She had been fain to open her Childs mouth with a Tap to give it Victuals.</hi> The Deponent added, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Days, the Fits of his Daughters were such, that they could not preserve either Life or Breath, without the help of a Tap. And that the Children cry'd out of <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> and of <hi>Rose Cullender,</hi> as afflicting them, with their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The Fits of the Children, were various.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000657_0119_0FA9A2B8719052F0"/>
They would sometimes be Lame on one side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes on t'other. Sometimes very sore; sometimes restored unto their Limbs, and then Deaf, or Blind, or Dumb, for a long while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Upon the Recovery of their Speech, they would Cough extreamly; and with much Flegm, they would bring up Crooked Pins; &amp; one time, a Two-penny Nail, with a very broad Head. Commonly at the end of every Fit, they would cast up a Pin. When the Children Read, they could not pronounce the Name of, <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jesus</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> but would fall into Fitts; and say, Amy Duny <hi>says, I must not use that Name.</hi> When they came to the Name of <hi>Satan,</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> they would clap their Fingers on the Book, crying out, <hi>This bites, but it makes me speak right well</hi>! The Children in their Fitts, would often cry out, <hi>There stands</hi> Amy Duny, <hi>or,</hi> Rose Cullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and they would afterwards relate, <hi>That these Witches appearing before them, threatned them, that if they told what they saw or heard, they would Torment them ten times more than ever they did before.</hi>

                  <p n="5">V. <hi>Margaret Arnold,</hi> the Sister of Mr. <hi>Pacy,</hi> testify'd unto the like Sufferings being upon the Children, at her House, whither her Brother had Removed them. And that sometimes, the Children (<hi>only</hi>) would see things like Mice, run about the House; and one of them sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly snap't one with the Tongs, and threw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Fire, where it screeched out like a Rat. At another time, a thing like a Bee, flew at the Face of the younger Child; the Child fell into a Fitt; and at last Vomited up a, <hi>Two-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nail,</hi> with a Broad Head; affirming, <hi>That the Bee brought this Nail, and forced it into her mouth.</hi> The Child would in like manner be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted with Flies, which brought Crooked Pins, unto her, and made her first swallow them, and then Vomit them. She one Day caught, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible <hi>Mouse,</hi> and throwing it into the Fire, it Flash'd like to Gun-Powder. None besides the Child saw the <hi>Mouse,</hi> but every one saw the <hi>Flash.</hi> She also declared, out of her Fitts, that in them, <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> much tempted her to Destroy Her self.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. As for <hi>Ann Durent,</hi> her Father Testifyed That upon a Discontent of <hi>Rose Cull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

the Assizes. But her Mother Testify'd, that Her Daughter having formerly been Afflicted with Swooning Fitts, and Recovered of them; was now taken with a great Pain in her Stomach; and New Swooning Fitts. That she took little Food, but every Day Vomited Crooked Pins. In her first Fitts, she would Extend her Arms, and use Postures, as if she catched at something, and when her Clutched Hands were forced open, they would find several Pins diversely Crooked, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably lodged there. She would also maintain a Discourse with some that were Invisibly present, when casting abroad her Arms, she would often say, <hi>I will not have it</hi>! but at last say, <hi>Then</hi> I <hi>will have it</hi>! and closing her Hand, which when they presently after opened, a Lath-Nail was found in it. But Her great complaints were of being Visited by the shapes of <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> and <hi>Rose Cullender.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. As for <hi>Susan Chandler,</hi> Her Mother Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, That being at the search of <hi>Rose Cullender,</hi> they found on her Belly a thing like a Teat, of an Inch long; which the <hi>said Rose</hi> ascribed to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

At the end of the long Teat, there was a little Hole, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, is if newly Sucked; and upon straining it, a white milky matter issued out. The Deponent further said, That her Daughter being one day concerned at <hi>Rose Cullenders</hi> taking her by the Hand, she fell very sick, and at Night cry'd out,

                     <hi>That</hi> Rose Cullendet <hi>woald come to Bed unto her</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Her Fitts grew violent, and in the Intervals of them, she declared, <hi>That she saw</hi> Rose Cullender <hi>in them, and once having of a great Dog with her.</hi> She also vomited up crooked Pins; and when she was brought into Court, she fell into her Fitts. She Recovered her self in some Time, and was asked by the Court, whether she was in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take an Oath, and give Evidence. She said, she could; but having been Sworn, she fell into her Fitts again, and, <hi>Burn her! Burn her!</hi> were all the words that she could obtain power to speak. Her Father likewise gave the same Testimony with her Mother; as to all but the Search.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Here was the Sum of the Evidence: which Mr. Serjeant <hi>Keeling,</hi> thought not sufficient to Convict the Prisoners. For admitting the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were Bewitched, yet, said he, it can never be Apply'd unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> a very Learned Person then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, gave his Opinion, that these persons were Bewitched. He added, That in <hi>Denmark,</hi> there had been lately a great Discovery of Witches; who used the very same way of Afflicting people, by Conveying Pins and Nails into them. His Opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion was, that the Devil in Witchcrafts, did Work upon the Bodies of Men and Women, upon a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Foundation</hi>; and that he did Extraordinarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict

The Experiment about the <hi>Usefulness,</hi> yea, or <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> whereof Good Men have sometimes disputed, was divers Times made, That though the Afflicted were utterly deprived of all sense in their Fitts, yet upon the <hi>Touch</hi> of the Accused, they would so screech out, and Fly up, as not upon any other persons. And yet it was also found that once upon the touch of an innocent person, the like effect follow'd, which put the whole Court unto a stand: altho' a small Reason was at length attempted to be given for it.</p>

They afterwards, did with much Difficulty get it home to the yard; but could not for their Lives get the Cart near the place, where they should unload. They were fain to unload at a great Distance; and when they were Tired, the Noses of them that came to Assist them, would burst forth a Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; so they were fain to give over till next m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

that he was forced to Unyoke him, that he might get him home. He then put his Oxen, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, upon <hi>Salisbury</hi> Beach, where Cattle did use to get <hi>Flesh.</hi> In a few days, all the Oxen upon the Beach were found by their Tracks, to have run unto the mouth of <hi>Merrimack-River,</hi> and not returned; but the next day they were found come ashore upon <hi>Plum-Island.</hi> They that sought them, used all imaginable gentleness, but they would still run away with a violence that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly Diabolical, till they came near the mouth of <hi>Merrimack-River</hi>; when they ran right into the Sea, swimming as far as they could be seen. One of them then swam back again, with a swiftness, amazing to the Beholders, who stood ready to receive him, and help up his Tired Carcase: but the Beast ran furiously up into the Island, and from thence, thorough the Marishes, up into <hi>Newbury</hi> Town, and so up into the Woods; and there after a while found near <hi>Amesbury.</hi> So that, of Fourteen good Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, there was only this saved: the Rest were all cast up, some in one place, and some in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, Drowned.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>John Atkinson</hi> Testify'd, That he Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a Cow, with a Son of <hi>Susanna Martins,</hi> whereat she muttered, and was unwilling he should have it. Going to Receive this Cow, tho' he Hamstring'd her, and Halter'd her, she of a Tame Creature grew so mad, that they

                  <p n="5">V. <hi>Bernard Peache</hi> testify'd, That being in Bed, on a Lords-day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>Night, he heard a scrabbling at the Window, whereat he then saw, <hi>Susanna Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> come in, and jump down upon the Floor. She took hold of this Deponents Feet, and drawing his Body up into an Heap, she lay upon him, near Two Hours; in all which time he could neither speak nor stirr. At length, when he could begin to move, he laid hold on her Hand, and pulling it up to his mouth, he bit three of her Fingers, as he judged, unto the Bone. Whereupon she went from the Chamber, down the Stairs, out at the Door. This Deponent thereupon called unto the people of the House, to advise them, of what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and he himself did follow her. The people saw her not; but there being a Bucket at the Left<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was likewise the print of her two Feet just without the Threshold; but no more sign of any Footing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</p>
                  <p>At another time this Deponent was desired by the Prisoner, to come unto an Husking of Corn, at her House; and she said, <hi>If he did not come, it

were better that he did</hi>! He went not; but the Night following, <hi>Susanna Martin,</hi> as he judged, and another came towards him. One of them said, <hi>Here he is</hi>! but he having a Quarter-staff, made a Blovv at them. The Roof of the Barn, broke his Blow; but following them to the Window, he made another Blow at them, and struck them down; yet they got up, and got out, and he saw no more of them.</p>
                  <p>About this time, there was a Rumour about the Town, that <hi>Martin</hi> had a Broken Head; but the Deponent could say nothing to that.</p>
                  <p>The said <hi>Peache</hi> also testify'd, the Bevvitching of Cattle to Death, upon <hi>Martins</hi> Discontents.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. <hi>Robert Downer</hi> testifyed, That this Prisoner being some years ago prosecuted at Court for a Witch, he then said unto her, <hi>He believed she was a Witch.</hi> Whereat she being Dissatisfied, Said, <hi>That some Shee-Devil would Shortly fetch him away</hi>! Which words were heard by others, as well as himself. The Night following, as he lay in his Bed, there came in at the Window, the likeness of a <hi>Cat,</hi> which Flew upon him, took fast hold of his Throat, lay on him a considerable while, and almost killed him. At length he remembred, what <hi>Susanna Martin,</hi> had threatned the Day before; and with much striving he cryed out, <hi>Avoid, thou Shee-Devil! In the Name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Avoid!</hi> Whereupon it left him, leap'd on the Floor, and Flew out at the Window.</p>

            <p>First, If you are not fond of <hi>Temptation,</hi> be not fond of Needless, or Too much <hi>Retirement.</hi> Where was it, that the Devil fell upon our Lord? it was when he was <hi>Alone</hi> in the Wilderness. We should all have our Times to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> every Day; and if the <hi>Devil</hi> go to scare us out of our Chambers, with such a Bugbear, as <hi>That hee'll appear to us,</hi> yet stay in spite of his teeth, stay to finish your Devotions; he <hi>Lyes,</hi> he dare not show his head.
