            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A RECOMMENDATION, By the Reverend Mr. MICHAEL BOSTON, The Author's Grandſon:</head>
            <p>HUMAN NATURE in its FOURFOLD STATE, was the firſt production of my venerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, introduced to the Public. It made its firſt appearance in the year 1720. Since that period, it has undergone at an average, One complete Edition every two years. Twenty thouſand Copies of it have been exported to America, from one ſingle City in Scotland, beſides thoſe that have been ſent to the Continent from England and Ireland. The rapid ſale of the Book upon its firſt Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a demonſtrative proof of the eſteem in which it was then held: and the uninterrupted demand for it ſtill, ſhows that the Principles it inculcates, are yet held in repute. All that I need further to add, is, That the preſent Edition is printed from that one Reviſed and Corrected by the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and may therefore be eſteemed correct.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is a maxim among wiſe men, That the knowledge of perſons is of as great uſe in the conduct of human life, as the knowledge of things: and it is moſt certain, that he who knows the various tempers, humours, and diſpoſitions of men, who can find out their turn of thought, and penetrate into the ſecret ſprings and principles of their actings, will not be at a loſs to find out proper means for compaſſing his aims, will eaſily preſerve himſelf from ſnares, and either evite or overcome difficulties. But the knowledge of human nature, morally conſidered, or, in other words of the temper and diſpoſition of the ſoul in its moral powers, is of much greater value; as it is of uſe in the concerns of an unchangeable life and world: he who is poſſeſſed of ſo valuable a branch of knowledge, is thereby cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ated to judge aright of himſelf, to underſtand true Chriſtianity, and to conceive juſtly of perfect happineſs, and conſummate miſery.</p>
            <p>The depravity of human nature is ſo plainly taught, yea inculcated in ſacred Scripture, and is ſo obvious to every thinking man's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who ſearches his own breaſt, and reflects duly on his temper and actings, that it is ſurprizingly ſtrange and wonderful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how it comes to paſs, that this important truth is ſo little underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea ſo much diſbelieved, by men who bear the name of goſpel Miniſters Are there not perſons to be found in a neighbouring nation, in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of preachers, appearing daily in pulpits, who are ſo unacquanted with their Bibles and themſelves, that they ridicule the doctrine of original ſin as unintelligible jargon? If they are perſons of a moral life and converſation, they ſeem to imagine, they cannot become better than they are; if they are immoral. they ſeem to indulge a conceit, that they can become virtuous, yea religious, when they pleaſe. Theſe are the men who talk of the dignity of human nature, of greatneſs of mind, nobleneſs of ſoul, and generoſity of ſpirit: as if they intended to perſuade themſelves and others, that pride is a good principle, and do not know, that pride and ſelfiſhneſs are the bane of mankind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of all the wickedneſs, and much of the miſery to be found in this and in the other world; and is indeed that, wherein the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of human nature properly conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Upright <hi>Adam's</hi> nature faintly adumbrated the divine, in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate s;elf-eſteem, in an adequate ſelf-love and delightful reflexion on his own borrowed excellency, regulated by a juſt eſteem of, and ſupreme love to his adored Creator: whence a peaceful ſerenity of mind, a loving, compaſſionate and benevolent diſpoſition of ſoul, a depth of thought and brightneſs of imagination, delightfully employed in the rapturous contemplation of his beloved Maker's infinite perfections thus bearing the divine image, and reſembling GOD that made him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But no ſooner did he diſobey the divine probatory command, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The modeſt, and therefore hitherto anonymous author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſes, Mr. <hi>Thomas Boſton,</hi> having handled this ſubject, in preaching to his own obſcure parochial congregation of Etterick, in the ſheriffdom of <hi>Selkirk,</hi> had a particular view to their benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in printing and publiſhing them; and therefore the ſtile and method is plain and ſimple, and the firſt edition printed on coarſe paper; but the ſubject is ſo comprehenſive and important, ſo well managed, and the book has been ſo well received, that it now appears in the world more embelliſhed as well as better corrected than formerly.</p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice to recommend it to thoſe who have a right taſte of genuine Chriſtianity, that all the Author's notions flow ſo directly from the ſacred fountain, that it is to be doubted, if he has had much recourſe to any other help that his Bible and his GOD for aſſiſtance: Mean time, I am aware of an exception from theſe who rank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among the polite part of mankind, as that there is the ſame harſh peculiarity of dialect in it, which is commonly to be found in books of practical divinity. But I beg leave to obſerve, That the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect they except againſt, is borrowed from ſacred ſcripture; and like-as <hi>it has pleaſed</hi> GOD, <hi>by the fooliſhneſs of preaching, to ſave them that believe;</hi> ſo alſo to countenance what they are diſpleaſed with, by the opperations of his Spirit on the minds of true Chriſtians as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience witneſſeth. However, I heartily wiſh, the exception were altogether removed, by ſome perſons digeſting into a methodical treatiſe, the views of human nature in its primitive perfection, in its depraved condition, and in its retrieved ſtate, who is maſter of modern ſtile, and throughly underſtands the ſubjects diſcourſed in this book, that by becoming all things to all men, Some, <hi>viz.</hi> Of all ranks and kinds of men, may be gained.</p>
            <p>I am not declaim at large in favours of religion; this were to write a book by way of preface. Many able pens have been employed in recommending it to the world, by ſtrong arguments drawn from its uſefulneſs to ſociety, its ſuitableneſs to the dignity of the rational na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the advantages ariſing to men from it in this and the other world. But, after all, may not one be allowed to doubt, if religion be rightly underſtood by all its patrons? may not the beauties and excellencies of a precious gem be elegantly deſcribed by a naturaliſt, or jeweller, who never ſaw the particular one he talked of, and knows little of its nature, leſs of the conſtruction of its parts, and nothing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> proper uſe? Are there not men of bright parts, who reaſon finely in defence of religion, and yet are ſo much ſtrangers to it, that they brand the perſons who are ſo happy as to be poſſeſſed of
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:045042_0005_101F7C70F275A9E0"/>
it, with the hard name of ſpiritualiſts, reckoning them a kind of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> unworthy of their regard. The truth is, Chriſtianity is a myſtery, mere reaſon does not comprehend it There is a ſpiritual diſcerning neceſſary to its being rightly underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence it comes to paſs that men of great learning and abilities, tho' they read the Scriptures with attention, and comment learnedly upon them; yet do not, yea cannot, enter into the vein of thought peculiar to the inſpired penman, becauſe they ſhare not of the ſame Spirit: wherefore it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, the natural, that is, unregenerate man, not to <hi>know the things of God, neither indeed to be capable of knowing them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, it is eaſy to conclude. That no pedantic apology on the part of the Author, for appearing in print, or fawning compliments to the courteous reader, on the part of the prefacer, are to be expected The truth is, both the one and the other are rather little arts, vailing pedantry and conceit, than evidences of modeſty and good-ſenſe. It is of more uſe to recommend the peruſal of the book to perſons of all ranks and degrees, from a few ſuitable topicks, than to ſhew wherein this Edition differs from the firſt.</p>
            <p>That all mankind, however differenced by their rank and ſtation in the world, have an equal concern in what is revealed concerning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other and future world, will be readily owned; and it muſt be as readily granted, that however allowable it may be for men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and parts, to pleaſe themſelves with fineneſs of language, fullneſs of thought, and exact connection in writings upon other ſubjects; yet they ought not to indulge themſelves in the ſame taſte in diſcourſes on divine things, leſt they expoſe themſelves to the juſt cenſure of acting with the ſame indiſcretion, as a perſon in danger of famiſhing by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, would be guilty of, if he perverſly rejected plain wholſome food, when offered to him, for no other reaſon than the want of palatable ſauce, or order and ſplendor in ſerving it up.</p>
            <p>The ſacred book we call the Bible, has a peculiar ſublimity in it, vailed with unuſual dialect and ſeeming inconnection: but it is not therefore to be rejected by men who bear the name of Chriſtians, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> uncouth or unintelligible; true wiſdom dictates quite another thing, it counſels us, by frequent reading, to acquaint ourſelves well with it, become accuſtomed to its peculiar phraſes, and ſearch into its ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: upon this ground, that the matters contained in it, are of the utmoſt conſequence to us, and when rightly underſtood, yield a refined delight, much ſuperior to what is to be found in reading the beſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten books on the moſt entertaining ſubjects. What pleads for the parent is a plea for the progeny; practical diſcourſes upon divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are the genuine offspring of the ſacred text, and ought therefore to be read carefully and with attention, by perſons of all ranks and degrees, though they are indeed calculated for, and peculiarly adapted to ſuch as move in low ſpheres of life.</p>

carefully to read books of practical divinity, That many of them are not written on the ſame motives and principles as other books are; the authors have often a peculiar divine call to publiſh them, and well founded hope of their being uſeful to advance Chriſtianity in the world In conſequence whereof it is, that great numbers have reaped benefit by reading them, eſpecially in childhood and youth; many have been converted by them; and it may be queſtioned, if ever there was a true Chriſtian, ſince the art of printing made theſe books common, who has not, in ſome ſtage of life, reaped conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from them. This book recommends itſelf in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by its being a ſhort ſubſtantial ſyſtem of practical divinity, in ſo much, that it may with truth be aſſerted, That a perſon who is throughly acquainted with all that is here taught, may, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his eternal intereſt, remain ignorant of other things, which pertain to the ſcience called divinity. It is therefore earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the ſerious and frequent peruſal of all, but eſpecially of ſuch as are in that ſtage of life called youth, and are ſo ſtationed in the world, as not to be frequently opportuned to hear ſermons, and read comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It is doubtleſs incumbent on maſters of families to make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of ſpiritual as well as bodily food, for their children and ſervants; this is effectually done by putting practical books in their hands: and therefore this book is humbly and earneſtly recommended as a family-book, which all the members of it are not only allowed, but deſired to peruſe.</p>
            <p>As to the difference betwixt this and the former edition, which gives it preference, it lies chiefly in the Author's not only having reviſed the ſtile, but the thought in many places, and corrected both, ſo as to ſet ſeveral important truths in a clearer light, and make the ſtile of the book now uniform, which formerly was not ſo, becauſe of the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of peculiar words and phraſes in uſe amongſt practical divines, eſpecially of the church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were interſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the former edition, and introduced by another hand, for the ſake of ſuch perſons as are not accuſtomed to them. It remains, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer not only ſubjoin his name, which was concealed in the firſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a teſtimony that he eſteems the Author, and values the book, but that he may thereby recommend it in a particular manner to the peruſal of perſons of his own acquaintance If in his aſſiſting towards its being publiſhed, and in prefacing both editions, he has not run un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, he has what will bear him up under all cenſures; the charitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <bibl>ECCLES. vii. 29.</bibl>
                  <p>Lo! this only have I found, That GOD hath made Man upright: But they have ſought out many Inventions.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE are four things very neceſſary to be known by all that would ſee Heaven: <hi>Firſt,</hi> What Man was in the ſtate of innocence, as GOD made him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What he is in the ſtate of corrupt nature, as he hath unmade himſelf. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What he muſt be in the ſtate of grace, as created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, if ever he be made a partaker of the inheritance of the ſaints in light And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What he ſhall be in his eternal ſtate, as made by the Judge of all, either perfectly happy, or compleatly miſerable, and that forever. Theſe are weighty points, that touch the vitals of practical godlineſs, from which moſt men, and even many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, in theſe dregs of time, are quite eſtranged. I deſign therefore, under the divine conduct, to open up theſe things, and apply them.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt of them, namely, The ſtate of Innocence: that beholding man poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a palace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ruins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the more affect us; we may the more prize that matchleſs Perſon, whom the Father has appointed the repairer of the breach; and that we may, with fixed reſolves, betake ourſelves to that way which leadeth to the city that hath unmoveable foundations. In the text we have three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſtate of Innocence wherein man was created, <hi>God hath made man upright.</hi> By Man here, we are to underſtand our firſt Parents; the archetypal pair, the root of mankind, the compendized world, and the fountain from whence all generations have ſtreamed; as may appear by comparing Gen. v. 1, 2. <hi>In the day that God created man, in the likeneſs of God made he him, male and female created he them, and bleſſed them,</hi> (as the root of mankind,) <hi>and called their name Adam.</hi> The original words is the ſame in our text, in this ſenſe, man was made right, (agreeable to the nature of God, whoſe work is perfect) without any imperfection, corruption, or principle of corruption in his body or ſoul. He was made upright; that is, ſtraight with the will and law of God, without any irregularity in his ſoul. By the ſet it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:045042_0015_101F7C9CF2238688"/>
got in its creation, it directly pointed towards God, as his chief end; which ſtraight inclination was repreſented as in an emblem, by the erect figure of his body a figure that no other living creature partakes of. What David was in a goſpel ſenſe, that was he in a legal ſenſe, one according to God's own heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altogether righteous, pure and holy. God made him thus: he did not firſt make him, and then make him righteous; but in the very making of him, he made him righteous. Original righteouſneſs was concreated with him; ſo that in the ſame moment he was a man, he was a righteous man, morally good; with the ſame breath that God breathed in him a living ſoul, he breathed in him a righteous ſoul</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is man's fallen ſtate: <hi>But they have ſought out many inventions.</hi> They fell off from their reſt in God, and fell upon ſeeking inventions of their own to mend their caſe; and they quite marred it. Their ruin was from their own proper motion: they would not abide as God had made them, but they ſought out inventions to deform and undo themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerve here the certainty and importante of thoſe things, <hi>Lo! this only have I found.</hi> &amp;c. Believe them they are the reſult of a narrow ſearch, and a ſerious inquiry performed by the wiſeſt of men. In the two preceeding verſes, Solomon repreſents himſelf as in queſt of goodneſs in the world, but the iſſue of it was he could find no ſatisfying iſſue of his ſearch after it; though it was not for want of pains: for he counted one by one, to find out the account: <hi>Behold! this have I found,</hi> (ſaith the Preacher) to wit, <hi>That</hi> (as the ſame word is read in our text) <hi>yet my ſoul ſeeketh, but I find not</hi> He could make no ſatisfying diſcovery of it, which might ſtay his enquiry. He found good men very rare, one, as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among a thouſand; good women more rare, not one good among his thouſand wives and concubines, 1 Kings xi 3. But could that ſatisfy the grand query, <hi>Where ſhall Wiſdom be found?</hi> No, it could not; (and if the experience of others in this point, run contrary to Solomon's, as 'tis no reflection on his diſcerning it can as little decide the queſtion, which will remain undetermined till the laſt day.) But, amidſt all this uncertainty, there is one point found out, and fixed: <hi>This have I found.</hi> Ye may depend upon it as moſt certain truth, and be fully ſatisfied in it: <hi>Lo this!</hi> fix your eyes upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a matter worthy of moſt deep and ſerious regard; <hi>to wit.</hi> That man's nature is now depraved, but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation was not from God, for <hi>He made man upright;</hi> but from themſelves, <hi>They have ſought out many inventions.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of <hi>MAN's</hi> Original Righteouſneſs.</head>
               <p>FIRST, As to the righteouſneſs of this ſtate, conſider, that as uncreated righteouſneſs, the righteouſneſs of God is the ſupreme rule; ſo all created righteouſneſs, whether of men or angels, hath reſpect to a law as its rule, and is a conformity thereunto A creature can no more be morally independent on God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in it's actions and powers, than it can be naturally independent on him. A creature, as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt acknowledge the Creator's will as it's ſupreme law for as it cannot be without him, ſo it muſt not be but for him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will: yet no law obliges, until it be revealed And hence it follows, that there was a law which man, as a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was ſubjected to in his creation; and that this law was revealed to him. <hi>God made man upright,</hi> ſays the text This preſuppoſeth a law to which he was conformed in his creation; as when any thing is made regular, or according to rule, of neceſſity the rule itſelf is preſuppoſed. Whence we may gather, that this law was no other than the eternal, indiſpenſible law of righteouſneſs, obſerved in all points by the ſecond Adam, oppoſed by the carnal mind, ſome notions of which remain yet among the Pagans, who, <hi>having not the law, are a law unto themſelves,</hi> Rom. ii. 15. In a word, this law is the very ſame which was afterwards ſummed up in the Ten Commandments, and promulgate on Mount Sinai to the Iſraelites, called by us the Moral Law: and man's righteouſneſs conſiſted in conformity to this law or rule. More particularly, there is a two fold conformity required of a man; a conformity of the powers of his ſoul to the law, which you may call habitual righteouſneſs; and a conformity of all his actions to it, which is actual righteouſneſs. Now, God made man habitually righteous; man was to make himſelf actually righteous: the former was the ſtock God put into his hand; the latter, the improvement he ſhould have made of it. The ſum of what I have ſaid, is, that the righteouſneſs wherein man was created, was the conformity of all the faculties and powers of his ſoul to the moral law. This is what we call original righteouſneſs, which man was originally endued with. We may take it up in theſe three things.</p>
               <p>FIRST, Man's underſtanding was a lamp of light. He had perfect knowledge of the law, and of his duty accordingly: he was made after God's image, and conſequently could not want knowledge, which is a part thereof, Col. iii. 10. <hi>The new Man is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi> And indeed this was neceſſary, to fit him for univerſal obedience, ſeeing no obedience can be according to the law, unleſs it proceed from a ſenſe of the commandment of God requiring it. 'Tis true, Adam had not the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:045042_0017_101F7CA1EED401B0"/>
law written upon tables of ſtone, but it was written upon his mind, the knowledge thereof being concreated with him. God impreſſed it upon his ſoul, and made him a law to himſelf, as the remains of it among the heathers do teſtify, Rom. ii. 14, 15. And ſeeing man was made to be the mouth of the creation, to glorify God in his works; we have ground to believe he had naturally an exquiſite knowledge of the works of God. We have a proof of this, in his giving names to the beaſts of the field, and the fowls of the air, and theſe ſuch as expreſs their nature: <hi>Whatſoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof,</hi> Gen. ii. 19. And the dominion which God gave him over the creatures, ſoberly to uſe and diſpoſe of them according to his will (ſtill in ſubordination to the will of God) ſeems to require no leſs than a knowledge of their natures. And beſides all this, his perfect knowledge of the law, proves his knowledge in the management of civil affairs, which, in reſpect of the law of God, <hi>a good man will guide with diſcretion,</hi> Pſal. cxii. 5.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, His will lay ſtraight with the will of God, Eph. iv. 24. There was no corruption in his will, no bent nor inclination to evil; for that is ſin properly and truly ſo called: hence the apoſtle ſays, Rom. vii. 7. <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the law; for I had not known luſt, except the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> An inclination to evil, is really a fountain of ſin, and therefore inconſiſtent with that rectitude and uprightneſs which the text expreſly ſays he was endued with at his creation. The will of man then was directed, and naturally inclined to God and goodneſs, tho' mutably. It was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by its original make, to follow the Creator's will, as the ſhadow does the body; and was not left in an equal ballance to good and evil: for at that rate he had not been upright, nor habitually conform to the law, which in no moment can allow the creature not to be inclined towards God as his chief end, more than it can allow man to be a god to himſelf. The law was impreſſed upon Adam's ſoul: now this according to the new covenant, by which the image of God is repaired, conſiſts in two things: 1. Putting the law into the mind, denoting the knowledge of it: 2. Writing it in the heart, denoting inclinations in the will, anſwerable to the commands of the law, Heb. viii. 10. So that, as the will, when we conſider it as renewed by grace, is by that grace natively inclined to the ſame holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all it's parts which the law requires; ſo was the will of man (when we conſider him as God made him at firſt) endued with natural inclinations to every thing commanded by the law. For if the regenerate are partakers of the divine nature, as undoubtedly they are, for ſo ſays the Scripture, 2 Pet. i. 4. And if this divine nature can import no leſs than inclinations of the heart to holineſs; then, ſurely Adam's will could not want this inclination; for in him the image of God was perfect. It is true, 'tis ſaid, Rom. ii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this denotes only their knowledge of that law, ſuch as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:045042_0018_101F7CA3B41000C0"/>
Apoſtle to the Hebrews, in the text cited, takes the word <hi>heart,</hi> in another ſenſe, diſtinguiſhing it plainly from the mind. And it muſt be granted, that, when God promiſeth in the new covenant, to write his law in the hearts of his people, it imports quite another thing than what Heathens have: for tho' they have notions of it in their mind, yet their hearts go another way; their will has got a ſet and a blaſs quite contrary to that law; and therefore, the expreſſion ſuitable to the preſent purpoſe, muſt needs import, beſides theſe notions of the <hi>mind,</hi> inclinations of the <hi>will</hi> going along therewith; which inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tho' mixed with corruption in the regenerate, were pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed in upright Adam In a word as Adam knew his Maſter's pleaſure in the matter of duty ſo his <hi>will</hi> ſtood inclined to what he know.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, His affections were orderly, pure and holy; which is a neceſſary part of that uprightneſs wherein man was created. The Apoſtle has a poſition, 2 Theſſ iii. 5. <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God:</hi> that is, <hi>The Lord ſtraighten your hearts,</hi> or make them ly ſtraight to the love of God: and our text tells us, man was thus made ſtraight. <hi>The new man is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. iv. 24 Now this holineſs as it is diſtinguiſhed from righteouſneſs, may import the purity and orderlineſs of the affections. And thus the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Tim. ii. 8. will have men to pray, <hi>Lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting:</hi> becauſe, as troubled water is unfit to receive the image of the ſun; ſo the heart, filled with impure and diſorderly affections, is not fit for divine communications. Man's ſenſitive appetite was indeed naturally carried out towards objects grateful to the ſenſes. For ſeeing man was made up of body and ſoul, and God made this man to glorify and enjoy him; and for this end to uſe his good creatures in ſubordination to himſelf: it is plain that man was naturally inclined both to ſpiritual and ſenſible good; yet to ſpiritual good, the chief good as his ultimate end. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſenſitive motions and inclinations, were ſubordinate to his reaſon and will, which lay ſtraight with the will of God, and were not, in the leaſt, contrary to the ſame. Otherwiſe he ſhould have been made up of contradictions; his ſoul being naturally inclined to God as the chief end, in the ſuperior part thereof, and the ſame ſoul inclined to the creature as the chief end in the inferior part thereof, as they call it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is impoſſible; for man, at the ſame inſtant, cannot have two chief ends. Man's affections them in his primitive ſtate, were pure from all defilement, free from all diſorder and diſtemper, becauſe in all their motions they were duly ſubjected to his clear reaſon, and his holy will. He had alſo an executive power anſwerable to his will; a power to do the good which he knew ſhould be done, and which he inclined to do, even ſo fulfil the whole law of God. If it had not been ſo, God would not have required of him perfect obedience; for to ſay that <hi>the Lord gathereth where he hath not ſtrawed,</hi> is but the blaſphemy of a wicked heart, againſt a good and bountiful God, Mat. xxv. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:045042_0019_101F7CA5DEA82118"/>From what has been ſaid, it may be gathered, that the original righteouſneſs explained was univerſal and natural; yet mutable.</p>
               <p>FIRST, It was univerſal; both with reſpect to the ſubject of it, the whole man; and the object of it, the whole law. Univerſal I ſay, with reſpect to the ſubject of it; for this righteouſneſs was diffuſed through the whole man; it was a bleſſed leaven that leavened the whole lump. There was not one wrong pin in the tabernacle of human nature, when God ſet it up, however ſhattered it is now. Man was then holy in ſoul, body, and ſpirit: while the ſoul remained untainted, it's lodging was kept pure and undefiled: the members of the body were conſecrated veſſels, and inſtruments of righteouſneſs, A combat betwixt fleſh and ſpirit, reaſon and appetite; nay the leaſt inclination to ſin, luſt of the fleſh in the inferior part of the ſoul, was utterly inconſiſtent with this uprightneſs, in which man was created: and as been invented to vail the corruption of man's nature, and to obſcure the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt: it looks very like the language of fallen Adam, laying his own ſin at his Maker's door, Gen. iii. 12. <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat:</hi> But as this righteouſneſs was univerſal in reſpect of the ſubject, becauſe it ſpread through the whole man, ſo alſo it was univerſal, in reſpect of the object, the holy law: There was nothing in the law, but what was agreeable to his reaſon and will, as God made him: tho' ſin hath now ſet him at odds with it: his ſoul was ſhapen out, in length and breadth to the commandment, tho' exceeding broad: ſo that this original righteouſneſs was not only perfect in parts, but in degrees.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, As it was univerſal, ſo it was natural to him, and not ſupernatural in that ſtate. Not that it was eſſential to man, as man; for then he could not have loſt it, without the loſs of his very being; but it was con-natural to him: He was created with it, and it was neceſſary to the perfection of man, as he came out of the hand of God: neceſſary to conſtitute him in a ſtate of integrity. Yet,</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, It was mutable; it was a righteouſneſs that might be loſt, as is manifeſted by the doleful event: His will was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely indifferent to good or evil; God ſet it towards good only; yet he did not ſo fix and confirm it's inclinations, that it could not alter. No, it was moveable to evil: and that only by man himſelf, God having given him a ſufficient power to ſtand in this integrity, if he had pleaſed: Let no man quarrel God's works in this; for if Adam had been unchangeably righteous, he behoved to have been ſo either by nature, or by free gift: by nature he could not be ſo, for that is proper to God, and incommunicable to any creature: if by free gift, then no wrong was done him, in with-holding of what he could not crave. Confirmation in a righteous ſtate, is a reward of grace, given upon continuing righteous, thro' the ſtate of trial; and would have been given to Adam, if he had ſtood out the time appointed for probation by the Creator; and accordingly is given to the ſaints,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:045042_0020_101F7CAC871AF458"/>
upon the account of the merits of Chriſt, who was obedient even to the death And herein believers have the advantage of Adam, that they can never totally nor finally fall away from grace.</p>
               <p>Thus was man made originally righteous, being created in God's own image, Gen. i. 27. which conſiſts in the poſitive qualities of knowledge, righteouſneſs and holineſs, Col. iii. 10. Eph. iv. 24. All that God made was very good, according to their ſeveral natures, Gen. i. 31. And ſo was man morally good, being made after the image of Him, who is <hi>good and upright,</hi> Pſal. xxv. 8 Without this, he could not have anſwered the great end of his creation, which was to know, love, and ſerve his God, according to his will. Nay, he could not be created otherwiſe: for he behoved either to be conform to the law, in his powers, principles, and inclinations, or not: if he was, then he was righteous: and if not, he was a ſinner, which is abſurd and horrible to imagine</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of <hi>MAN'S</hi> Original Happineſs.</head>
               <p>SECONDLY, I ſhall lay before you ſome of those things which did accompany or flow from the righteouſneſs of man's primitive ſtate: Happineſs is the reſult of holineſs; and as it was an holy, ſo it was an happy ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Man was then a very glorious creature. We have reaſon to ſuppoſe, that as Moſes' face ſhone when he came down from the mount, ſo man had a very lightſome and pleaſant countenance, and beautiful body, while as yet there was no darkneſs of ſin in him at all. But ſeeing God himſelf is glorious in holineſs, (Exod. xv. 11.) ſurely that ſpiritual comelineſs the Lord put upon man at his creation, made him a very glorious creature. O! how did light ſhine in his holy converſation, to the glory of the Creator! while every action was but the darting forth of a ray and beam of that glorious, unmixed light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God had ſet up in his ſoul; while that lamp of love, lighted from Heaven, continued burning in his heart, as in the holy place; and the law of the Lord, put in his inward parts by the finger of God, was kept by him there, as in the moſt holy: There was no impurity to be ſeen without; no ſquint look in the eyes, after any unclean thing; the tongue ſpoke nothing but the language of Heaven: And, in a word, <hi>The King's ſon was all glorious within, and his clothing of wrought gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was the favourite of Heaven: He ſhone brightly in the image of God. who cannot but love his own image, where-ever it appears. While he was alone in the world, he was not alone, for God was with him: His communion and fellowſhip was with his Creator, and that immediately; for as yet there was nothing to turn away the face of God from the work of his own hands; ſeeing ſin had not as yet entered, which alone could make the breach.</p>
               <p>By the favour of God, he was advanced to be confederate with Heaven, in the firſt Covenant, called, The Covenant of Works. God reduced the Law, which he gave in his creation, into the form
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:045042_0021_101F7CAE0F1C5CC8"/>
of a Covenant, whereof perfect obedience was the condition: life was the thing promiſed, and death the penalty. As for the condition, one great branch of the natural Law was, that man believe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ſhall reveal, and do whatſoever he ſhall command: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly God making this Covenant with man, extended his duty to the not eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; and the law thus extended, was the rule of man's covenant-obedience. How eaſy were theſe terms to him, who had the natural law written on his heart; and that inclining him to obey this poſitive Law, revealed to him, it ſeems, by an audible voice, (Gen. ii. 16.) the matter whereof was ſo very eaſy ? And indeed it was highly reaſonable that the rule and matter of his covenant-obedience ſhould be thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: that which was added, being a thing in itſelf indifferent, where his obedience was to turn upon the preciſe point of the will of God, the plaineſt evidence of true obedience, and it being in an external thing, wherein his obedience or diſobedience would be moſt clear and conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>Now, upon this condition, God promiſed him life, the continuance of natural life in the union of ſoul and body; and of ſpiritual life in the favour of his Creator: he promiſed him alſo eternal life in heaven, to have been entered into, when he ſhould have paſſed the time of his trial upon earth, and the Lord ſhould ſee meet to tranſport him into the upper Paradiſe. This promiſe of life was included in the threatning of death mentioned, Gen. ii. l7. For while God ſays, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> it is in effect, <hi>If thou do not eat of it, thou ſhalt ſurely live:</hi> And this was ſacramentally confirmed by another tree in the garden, called therefore, <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> which he was debarred from, when he had ſinned, Gen. iii. 22, 23. —<hi>Leſt he put forth his hand, and take alſo of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live for ever. Therefore the Lord God ſent him forth from the garden of Eden.</hi> Yet it is not to be thought, that man's life and death did hang only on this matter of the forbidden fruit, but on the whole Law; for ſo ſays the Apoſtle, Gal. iii. 10. <hi>It is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> That of the forbidden fruit, was a revealed part of Adam's religion; and ſo behoved expreſly to be laid before him: but as to the natural Law, he naturally knew death to be the reward of diſobedience; for the very Heathens were not ignorant of this: <hi>Knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. i. 32. And moreover, the promiſe included in the threatning, ſecured Adam's life according to the Covenant, as long as he obeyed the natural Law with the addition of that poſitive command; ſo that he needed nothing to be expreſſed to him in the Covenant, but what concerned the eating of the forbidden fruit: That eternal life in heaven was promiſed in this Covenant, is plain from this, that the threatning was of eternal death in hell; to which when man had made himſelf liable, Chriſt was promiſed, by his death to purchaſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:045042_0022_101F7CB26430F038"/>
eternal life: and Chriſt himſelf expounds the promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works of eternal life, while he promiſeth the condition of that Covenant, to a proud young man, who tho' he had not Adam's ſtock, yet would needs enter into life in the way of working, as Adam was to have done under this covenant, Matth. xix. 17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life,</hi> (viz. eternal life, by doing, ver. 16.) <hi>keep the Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The penalty was death, Gen. ii. 17 <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> The death threatned was ſuch, as the life promiſed was; and that moſt juſtly, to wit, temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal death. The event is a commentary on this: for that very day he did eat thereof, he was a dead man in law; but the execution was ſtopped, becauſe of his poſterity then in his loins; and another Covenant was prepared; however, that day his body got it's death-wound, and became mortal. Death alſo ſeized his ſoul: he loſt his original righteouſneſs and the favour of God; witneſs the gripes and throws of conſcience, which made him hide himſelf from God. And he became liable to eternal death, which would have actually followed of courſe, if a Mediator had not been provided, who found him bound with the cords of death, as a malefactor ready to be led to execution. Thus you have a ſhort deſcription of the Covenant into which the Lord brought man, in the eſtate of innocence.</p>
               <p>And ſeemeth it a ſmall thing unto you, that earth was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with heaven? This could have been done to none but him, whom the King of heaven delighted to honour. It was an act of grace worthy of the gracious God whoſe favourite he was; for there was grace and free favour in the firſt covenant, tho' <hi>the exceeding riches of grace,</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it, Eph. ii 7.) was reſerved for the ſecond. It was certainly an act of grace, favour, and admirable condeſcenſion in God, to enter into a covenant, and ſuch a covenant with his own creature. Man was not at his own, but at God's diſpoſal: Nor had he any thing to work with, but what he had received from God. There was no proportion betwixt the work and the promiſed reward. Before that covenant, man was bound to perfect obedience, in virtue of his natural dependence on God: and death was naturally the wages of ſin; which the juſtice of God could and would have required, tho' there had never been any covenant betwixt God and man: but God was free; man could never have required eternal life as the reward of his work, if there had not been ſuch a Covenant. God was free to have diſpoſed of his creature as he ſaw meet: and if he had ſtood in his integrity as long as the world ſhould ſtand, and there had been no Covenant promiſing eternal life to him upon his obedience; God might have withdrawn his ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand at laſt, and ſo made him creep back into the womb of nothing, whence almighty power had drawn him out: And what wrong could there have been in this, while God ſhould have taken back what he freely gave? But now the Covenant being made, God becomes debtor to his own faithfulneſs: if man will work, he may
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:045042_0023_101F7CB72823E100"/>
crave the reward on the ground of the Covenant: Well might the angels then, upon his being raiſed to this dignity, have given him that ſalutation, <hi>Hail thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God made him lord of the world, prince of the inferior creatures, univerſal lord and emperor of the whole earth. His Creator gave him dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowls of the air, over all the earth; yea, and every living thing that liveth upon the earth: <hi>He put all things under his feet,</hi> Pſal. viii. 6, 7, 8. He gave him a power ſoberly to uſe and diſpoſe of the creatures in the earth, ſea, and air. Thus man was God's depute-governor in the lower world; and this his dominion was an image of God's ſovereignty. This was common to the man and the woman; but the man had one thing peculiar to him, to wit, that he had dominion ever the woman alſo, 1 Cor. xi. 7. Behold how the creatures came to him, to own their ſubjection, and to do him homage as their lord; and quietly ſtood before him, till he put names on them as his own, Gen. ii. 10. Man's face ſtruck an awe upon them; the ſtouteſt creatures ſtood aſtoniſhed, tamely and quietly adoring him as their lord and ruler. Thus was man <hi>crowned with glory and honour,</hi> Pſal. viii. 5. The Lord dealt moſt liberally and bountifully with him, <hi>put all things under his feet;</hi> only he kept one thing, one tree in the garden out of his hands, even the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
               <p>But you may ſay, And did he grudge him this? I anſwer, Nay; but when he had made him thus holy and happy, he graciouſly gave him this reſtriction, which was in it's own nature, a prop and ſtay to keep him from falling. And this I ſay, upon theſe three grounds. (1) As it was moſt proper for the honour of God, who had made man lord of the lower world, to aſſert his ſovereign dominion over all, by ſome particular viſible ſign; ſo it was moſt proper for man's ſafety. Man being ſet down in a beautiful paradiſe, it was an act of infinite wiſdom, and of grace too, to keep from him one ſingle tree, as a viſible teſtimony, that he muſt hold all of his Creator, as his great Landlord; that ſo, while he ſaw himſelf lord of the creatures, he might not forget that he was ſtill God's ſubject. (2.) This was a memorial of his mutable ſtate given in to him from heaven, to be laid up by him for his great caution: For man was created with a free will to good, which the Tree of Life was an evidence of: but his will was alſo free to evil, and the Forbidden Tree was to him a memorial thereof. It was, in a manner, a continual watch-word to him againſt evil, a beacon ſet up before him, to bid him beware of daſhing himſelf to pieces, on the rock of ſin. (3.) God made man upright, directed towards God as the chief end. He ſet him like Moſes, on the top of the hill, holding up his hands to heaven: and as Aaron and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r ſtayed up Moſes' hands, Exod. xv. 10, 11, 12. ſo God gave man an erect figure of body, and forbid him the eating of this tree; to keep him in that poſture of uprightneſs, wherein he was created. God made the beaſts looking down towards the earth, to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:045042_0024_101F7CB8ECC891B0"/>
ſhew that their ſatisfaction might be brought from thence; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it does afford them what is commenſurable to their appetite: but the erect figure of man's body, which looketh upward, ſhewed him, that his happineſs lay above him in God; and that he was to expect it from heaven, and not from earth. Now this fair Tree, of which he was forbidden to eat, taught him the ſame leſſon; that his happineſs lay not in enjoyment of the creatures, for there was a want even in Paradiſe: ſo that the forbidden Tree was in effect the hand of all the creatures, pointing man away from themſelves to God for happineſs: It was a ſign of emptineſs hung before the door of the creation, with that inſcription, <hi>This is not your reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As he had a perfect tranquillity within his own breaſt, ſo he had a perfect calm without: His heart had nothing to reproach him with; conſcience then had nothing to do, but to direct, approve and feaſt him: and without, there was nothing to annoy him: The happy pair lived in perfect amity; and tho' their knowledge was vaſt, true and clear, they knew no ſhame: Tho' they were naked, there were no bluſhes in their faces; for ſin, the ſeed of ſhame was not yet ſown, Gen. ii. 25. and their beautiful bodies were not capable of injuries from the air; ſo they had no need of clothes, which are origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the badges of our ſhame: They were liable to no diſeaſes, nor pains; and tho' they were not to live idle; yet toil, wearineſs, and ſweat of the brows, were not known in this ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Man had a life of pure delight, and undreggy pleaſure in this ſtate: Rivers of pure pleaſures run through it: The earth, with the product thereof, was now in its glory; nothing had yet come in, to mar the beauty of the creatures. God ſet him down, not in a common place of the earth; but in <hi>Eden,</hi> a place eminent for pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the name of it imports: nay, not only in <hi>Eden,</hi> but in the <hi>garden of Eden;</hi> the moſt pleaſant ſpot of that pleaſant place: a garden planted by God himſelf, to be the manſion-houſe of this his favourite. As, when God made the other living creatures, he ſaid, <hi>Let the water bring forth the moving creature,</hi> Gen i. 20. And, <hi>Let the earth bring firt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the living creature,</hi> ver. 24. But when man was to be made, he ſaid, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> ver. 20. So, when the reſt of the earth was to be furniſhed with herbs and trees, God ſaid, <hi>Let the earth bring forth graſs, and the fruit-tree,</hi> Gen. i. 11. But of paradiſe it is ſaid, <hi>God planted it,</hi> chap. ii. 8. which cannot but denote a ſingular excellency in that garden, beyond all other parts of the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> beautiful earth. There he wanted neither for neceſſity nor delight: for there was <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry tree that is pleaſant to the ſight, and good for food,</hi> ver. 9. He know not theſe delights which luxury has invented for the gratifying of luſts: but his delights were ſuch as came out of the hand of God; without paſſing thro' ſinful hands, which readily leave marks of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity on what they touch. So his delights were pure, his pleaſures refined. And yet may <hi>I now ſhew you a more excellent way: wiſdom had entered into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is heart:</hi> ſurely then knowledge was pleaſant unto
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:045042_0025_101F7CBBD6AC8120"/>
his ſoul. What delight do ſome find in their diſcoveries of the works of nature, by the ſcrapes of knowledge they have gathered! but how much more exquiſite pleaſure had <hi>Adam,</hi> while his piercing eyes read the book of God's works, which God laid before him, to the end he might glorify him in the ſame; and therefore he had ſurely ſitted him for the work! but above all, his knowledge of God, and that as his God, and the communion he had with him, could not but afford him the moſt refined and exquiſite pleaſure in the innermoſt receſſes of his heart. Great is that delight which the ſaints find in theſe views of the glory of God, that their ſouls are ſometimes let into, while they are compaſſed about with many infirmities; but much more may well be allowed to ſinleſs <hi>Adam;</hi> no doubt he reliſhed theſe pleaſures at another rate</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He was immortal. He would never have died, if he had not ſinned; it was in caſe of ſin that death was threatned, Gen. ii 17. which ſhews it to be the conſequent of ſin, and not of the ſinleſs human nature. The perfect conſtitution of his body, which came out of God's hand very good; and the righteouſneſs and holineſs of his ſoul, removed all inward cauſes of death: nothing being prepared for the grave's devouring mouth, but the vile body, Philip iii 21. And <hi>thoſe who have ſinned,</hi> Job xxiv. 19. And God's ſpecial care of his innocent creature, ſecured him againſt outward violence. The apoſtle's teſtimony is expreſs, Rom. v. 12. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin.</hi> Behold the door by which death came in! Satan wrought with his lies till he got it opened, and ſo death entred; and therefore is he ſaid to have been <hi>a murderer from the beginning</hi> John viii. 44.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhown you the holineſs and happineſs of man in this ſtate. If any ſhall ſay, What's all this to us, who never taſted of that holy and happy ſtate? They muſt know it nearly concerns us, in ſo far as <hi>Adam</hi> was the root of all mankind, our common head and repreſentative; who received from God our inheritance and ſtock to keep it for himſelf and his children, and to convey it to them. The Lord put all mankind's ſtock (as it were) in one ſhip: and, as we ourſelves ſhould have done, he made our common father the pilot. He put a bleſſing in the root, to have been, if rightly managed, diffuſed into all the branches. According to our text, making <hi>Adam</hi> upright, he made man upright; and all mankind had that upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him; for, <hi>if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oot be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> But more of this afterwards. Had <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, none would have quarrelled the repreſentation.</p>
               <p>USE I. For <hi>Information.</hi> This ſhews us, (1) That not God, but man himſelf was the cauſe of his ruin. God made him upright: his Creator ſet him up, but he threw himſelf down. Was the Lord's directing and inclining him to good the reaſon of his woful choice? Or did heaven deal ſo ſparingly with him, that his preſſing wants ſent him to hell to ſeek ſupply? Nay, man was, and is, the cauſe of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:045042_0026_101F7CC1EF27BF30"/>
his own ruin. (2.) God may moſt juſtly require of men perfect obedience to his law, and condemn them for their not obeying it perfectly, tho' now they have no ability to keep it. In ſo doing, <hi>he gathers</hi> but <hi>where he has ſtrawed.</hi> He gave man ability to keep the whole law; man has loſt it by his own fault: but his ſin could never take away that right which God hath to exact perfect obedience of his creature, and to puniſh in caſe of diſobedience. (3.) Behold here the infinite obligation we ly under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> who with his own precious blood has bought our eſcheat. and freely makes offer of it again to us, Hoſ xiii. 9. and that with the advantage of everlaſting ſecurity, that it can never be altogether loſt any more, John x. 28, 29. Free grace will fix thoſe, whom free-will ſhook down into a gulf of miſery.</p>
               <p>USE II. This reacheth a reproof to three ſorts of perſons. (1.) To theſe, who hate religion in the power of it, where-ever it appears; and can take pleaſure in nothing, but in the world and their luſts. Surely thoſe men are far from righteouſneſs; they are <hi>haters of God,</hi> Rom. i 30. for they are haters of his image. Upright <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, would have been a great eye-ſore to all ſuch perſons; as he was to the ſerpent, whoſe ſeed they prove themſelves to be, by their malignity. (2.) It reproves thoſe who put religion to ſhame, and thoſe who are aſhamed of religion, before a graceleſs world. There is a generation who make ſo bold with the God that made them, and can in a moment cruſh them, that they ridicule piety, and make a mock of ſeriouſneſs. <hi>Againſt whom do ye ſport your ſelves? Againſt whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue?</hi> Iſa. lvii. 4. Is it not againſt God himſelf, whoſe image, in ſome meaſure repaired on ſome of his creatures, makes them fools in your eyes? But <hi>be ye not mockers, leſt your bands be made ſtrong,</hi> Iſa. xxviii. 22. Holineſs was the glory God put on man, when he made him: but now ſons of men turn that glory into frame, becauſe they themſelves glory in their ſhame — There are others that ſecretly approve of religion, and in religious company will profeſs it: who at other times, to be neighbour-like are aſhamed to own it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo weak are they, that they are blown over with the wind of the wicked's mouth. A broad laughter, an impious jeſt, a ſilly gibe out of a prophane mouth, is to many an unanſwerable argument againſt religion and ſeriouſneſs; for in the cauſe of religion, they are <hi>as ſilly doves without heart.</hi> O that ſuch would conſider that weighty word! Mark viii 38. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſinful gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</hi> (3.) It reproves the proud ſelf-conceited profeſſor, who admires himſelf in a garment he hath patched together of rags. There are many, who, when once they have gathered ſome ſcrapes of knowledge of religion, and have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſome reformation of life, do ſwell big with conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; a ſad ſign that the effects of the fall ly ſo heavy upon them,

that they have not as yet come to themſelves, Luke xv. 17. They have eyes behind, to ſee their attainments; but no eyes within, no eyes before, to ſee their wants, which would ſurely humble them: for true knowledge makes men to ſee, both what once they were, and what they are at preſent; and ſo is humbling, and will not ſuffer them to be content with any meaſure of grace attained; but puts them on to preſs forward, <hi>forgetting the things that are behind,</hi> Philip. iii. 13, 14. But thoſe men are ſuch a ſpectacle of commiſeration, as one would be, that had ſet his palace on fire, and were glorifying in a cottage he had built for himſelf out of the rubbiſh, tho' ſo very weak, that it could not ſtand againſt a ſtorm.</p>
               <p>USE III Of <hi>lamentation.</hi> Here was a ſtately building, man carved like a fair palace, but now lying in aſhes: let us ſtand and look on the ruins, and drop a tear. This is a lamentation, and ſhall be for a lamentation. Could we chuſe but to weep, if we ſaw our country ruined, and turned by the enemy into a wilderneſs? If we ſaw our houſes on fire, and our houſholds periſhing in the flames? But all this comes far ſhort of the diſmal ſight, <hi>man fallen as a ſtar from heaven!</hi> Ah! may not we now ſay, <hi>O that we were as in months paſt,</hi> when there were no ſtains in our nature, no clouds on our minds, no pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our hearts. Had we never been in better caſe, the matter had been leſs: but <hi>they that were brought up in ſcarlet,</hi> do now <hi>embrace dung-hills.</hi> Where is our primitive glory now! Once no darkneſs in the mind, no rebellion in the will, no diſorder in the affections. But, ah! <hi>How is the faithful city become an harlot? Righteouſneſs lodged in it; but now murderers. Our ſilver is become droſs, our wine mixed with water.</hi> That heart which was once the temple of God, is now turned into a den of thieves. Let our name be <hi>Ichabod,</hi> for the glory is departed. Happy waſt tho O man, who was like unto thee! No pain or ſickneſs could affect thee, no death could approach thee, no ſigh was heard from thee, till theſe bitter fruits were plucked off the forbidden tree. Heaven ſhone upon thee, and earth ſmiled: thou waſt: the companion of angels, and the envy of devils. But how low is he now laid, who was created for dominion, and made lord of the world! <hi>The crown is fallen from our head: wo unto us that we have ſinned.</hi> The creatures that waited to do him ſervice, are now, ſince the fall, ſet in battle-array againſt him; and the leaſt of them having commiſſion proves too hard for him. Waters overflow the old world, fire conſumes <hi>Sodom;</hi> the ſtars in their courſes fight againſt <hi>Siſera;</hi> frogs, flies, lice, <hi>&amp;c</hi> turn executioners to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians;</hi> worms eat up <hi>Herod:</hi> yea, man needs a league with the beaſts, yea, with the very <hi>ſtones of the field,</hi> Job. v. 13. having reaſon to fear, that every one that findeth him will ſlay him. Alas! how are we fallen? How are we plunged into a gulf of miſery! The ſun has come down on us, death has come in at our windows; our enemies have put out our two eyes, and ſport themſelves with our miſeries.

               <p>The ſcope and deſign of theſe words is, to clear God's juſtice, in bringing the flood on the old world. There are two particular cauſes of it taken notice of in the preceeding verſes. (1.) Mixt marriages, ver. 2. <hi>The ſons of God,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Enos,</hi> profeſſors of the true religion, married with the daughters of men, the profane, curſed race of <hi>Cain.</hi> They did not carry the matter before the Lord, that he might <hi>chuſe for them,</hi> Pſal. xlviii. 14. But without any reſpect to the <hi>will</hi> of God, they choſe; not according to the rules of their faith, but of their fancy: <hi>they ſaw that they were fair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and their marriage with them, occaſioned their divorce from God. This was one of the cauſes of the deluge, which ſwept away the old world. Would to God all profeſſors in our day, could plead not guilty: but tho' that ſin brought on the deluge, yet the deluge hath not ſwept away that ſin; which, as of old, ſo in our day, may juſtly be looked upon, as one of the cauſes of the decay of religion. It was an ordinary thing among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> to change their gods, as they changed their condition into a married lot: and many ſad inſtances the Chriſtian world affords of the ſame, as if people were of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s opinion, That religion is only for thoſe that have no other care upon their heads, Exod. v. 17. (2.) Great oppreſſion, ver. 4. <hi>There was giants in the earth in thoſe days,</hi> men of great ſtature, great ſtrength, and monſtrous wickedneſs, <hi>filling the earth with violence,</hi> ver. 11. But neither their ſtrength nor treaſures of wickedneſs, could profit them in the day of wrath. Yet the gain of oppreſſion ſtill carries many over the terror of this dreadful example. Thus much for the connexion, and what particular crimes that generation was guilty of. But every perſon that was ſwept away with the flood could not be guilty of theſe things, and <hi>ſhall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> Therefore, in my text, there is a general indictment drawn up agaiſt them all, <hi>The wickedneſs of man was great in the earth,</hi> &amp;c. And this is well inſtructed, for <hi>God ſaw it.</hi> Two things are laid to their charge here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Corruption of life, wickedneſs, great wickedneſs. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this of the wickedneſs of their lives; for it is plainly diſtinguiſhed from the wickedneſs of their hearts. The ſins of their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, were great in the nature of them, and greatly aggravated by their attending circumſtances: and this not only among thoſe of the race of curſed <hi>Cain,</hi> but thoſe of holy <hi>Seth:</hi> the wickedneſs of man was great. And then it is added, <hi>in the earth.</hi> (1.) To vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate God's ſeverity, in that he not only cut off ſinners, but defaced the beauty of the earth; and ſwept off the brute creatures from it, by the deluge; that as men had ſet the marks of their impiety, God might ſet the marks of his indignation, <hi>on the earth.</hi> (2.) To ſhew the heinouſneſs of their ſin, in making the earth, which God had ſo adorned for the uſe of man, a ſink of ſin, and a ſtage whereon to act their wickedneſs, in defiance of heaven. God ſaw this corruption of life, he not only knew it, and took notice of it, but he made them to know, that he did take notice of it; and that he had not forſaken the curſt, tho' they had forſaken heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Corruption of nature. <hi>Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> All their wicked practices are here traced to the fountain and ſpring-head; a corrupt heart was the ſource of all. The ſoul which was made upright in all its faculties, is now wholly diſordered. The heart, that was made according to God's own heart, is now the reverſe of it, a forge of evil imaginations, a ſink of inordinate affections, and a ſtore-houſe of all impiety,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:045042_0030_101F7CCFE9B41A08"/>
Mark vii. 21, 22. Behold the heart of the natural man, as it is opened in our text. The mind is defiled; the thoughts of the heart are evil; the will and affections are defiled: the imagination of the thoughts of the heart, (<hi>i e.</hi> whatſoever the heart frameth within itſelf by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as judgment. choice, purpoſes, devices, deſires, every inward motion); or rather, the frame of thoughts of the heart (namely, the frame, make, or mould, of theſe, 1 Chron. xxix. 18.) is evil. Yea, and <hi>every imagination, every frame,</hi> of his thoughts, is ſo. The heart is ever framing ſomething; but never one right thing: the frame of thoughts, in the heart of man, is exceeding various: yet are they never caſt into a right frame: But is there not, at leaſt, a mixture of good in them? <hi>No,</hi> they are only evil, there is nothing in them truly good and acceptable to God: nor can any thing be ſo that comes out of that forge: where not the Spirit of God, but <hi>the prince of the power of the air worketh,</hi> Eph. ii. 2. Whatever changes may be found in them, are only from evil to evil: for the imagination of the heart, or frame of thoughts in natural men, is evil continually, or every day: From the firſt day, to the laſt day in this ſtate, they are in midnight darkneſs; there is not a glimmering of the light of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them; not one holy thought can ever be produced by the unholy heart. O what a vile heart is this! O what a corrupt nature is this! the tree that always brings forth fruit, but never good fruit, whatever ſoil it be ſet in, whatever pains be taken on it, muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be an evil tree: and what can that heart be, whereof every imagination, every ſet of thoughts, is only evil, and that continually? Surely that corruption is ingrained in our hearts, interwoven with our very natures, has ſunk into the marrow of our ſouls; and will never be cured, but by a miracle of grace. Now ſuch is man's heart, ſuch is his nature, till regenerating grace change it. God that ſearcheth the heart ſaw man's heart was ſo, he took ſpecial notice of it: and the faithful and true witneſs cannot miſtake our caſe; tho' we are moſt apt to miſtake ourſelves in this point, and generally do overlook it.</p>

and all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> Had the hiſtory of the deluge been tranſmitted unto us, without the reaſon thereof in the text, we might thence have gathered the corruption and total depravation of man's nature: for what other quarrel could a holy and juſt God have with the infants that were deſtroyed by the flood, ſeeing they had no actual ſin? If we ſaw a wiſe man, who having made a curious piece of work, and heartily approved of it when he gave it out of his hand, as fit for the uſe it was deſigned for riſe up in wrath and break it all in pieces, when he looked on it afterwards; would we not thence conclude the frame of it had been quite marred, ſince it went out of his hand, and that it does not ſerve for that uſe it was at firſt deſigned for? How much more, when we ſee the holy and wiſe God, deſtroying the work of his own hands, once ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by him very good, may we conclude that the original frame thereof is utterly marred, that it cannot be mended, but it muſt needs be new made, or loſt altogether?

But did the deluge carry off this corruption of man's nature? Did it mend the matter? No it did not. God, in his holy providence, <hi>That every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the new world may become guilty before God,</hi> as well as the old, permits that corruption of nature to break out in <hi>Noah,</hi> the father of the new world, after the deluge was over. Behold him as another <hi>Adam,</hi> firming in the fruit of a tree. Gen. ix. 20, 21. He <hi>planted a vineyard, and he drank of the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent.</hi> More than that, God gives the ſame reaſon againſt a new deluge, which he gives in our text for bringing that on the world: <hi>I will not,</hi> (ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>again curſe the ground any more for man's ſake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.</hi> Gen. viii. 21. Whereby it is intimated, that there is no mending of the matter by this means; and that if he would always take the ſame courſe with men that he had done, he would be always ſending deluges on the earth, ſeeing the corruption of man's nature remains ſtill. But tho' the flood could not carry off the corruption of nature, yet it pointed at the way how it is to be done; <hi>to wit,</hi> That men muſt be born of water and of the Spirit, raiſed from ſpiritual death in ſin, by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>came by water and blood;</hi> out of which a <hi>new world</hi> of ſaints ariſe in regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even as the new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>FIRST, I am to confirm the doctrine of the corruption of nature: to hold the glaſs to your eyes, wherein you may ſee your ſinful nature: which, tho' God takes particular notice of it, many do quite overlook.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> How the ſcripture takes particular notice of fallen <hi>Adam</hi>'s communicating his image to his poſterity, Gen, v. 3. <hi>Adam begat a ſon in his own likeneſs, after his image, and called his name Seth.</hi> Compare with this, ver 1. of that chapter, <hi>In the day that God created man, in the likeneſs of God made be him.</hi> Behold here, how the image after which man was made, and the image after which he is begotten, are oppoſed. Man was made in the likeneſs of God: that is, a holy and righteous God made a holy and righteous creature: but fallen <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſon, not in the likeneſs of God, but in his own likeneſs; that is, corrupt ſinful <hi>Adam</hi> begat a corrupt ſinful ſon. For as the image of God bore righteouſneſs and immortality in it, as was cleared before, ſo this image of fallen <hi>Adam</hi> bore corruption and death in it, 1 Cor. xv. 49 50. compare ver. 22. <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that fifth chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> being to give us the firſt bill of mortality, that ever was in the world, uſhers it in with this, that dying <hi>Adam</hi> begat mortals. Having ſinned, he became mortal, according to the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſo he begat a ſon, in his own likeneſs, ſinful, and therefore mortal: thus ſin and death paſſed on all. Doubtleſs, he begat both <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> in his own likeneſs, as well as <hi>Seth.</hi> But it is not recorded of <hi>Abel;</hi> becauſe he left no iſſue behind him, and his falling the firſt ſacrifice to death in the world, was a ſufficient document of it: nor of <hi>Cain,</hi> to whom it might have been thought peculiar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his monſtrous wickedneſs; and beſides, all his poſterity was drowned in the flood: but it is recorded of <hi>Seth,</hi> becauſe he was the father of the holy ſeed; and from him all mankind, ſince the flood, has deſcended, and fallen <hi>Adam</hi>'s own likeneſs with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:045042_0033_101F7CDC69A03C18"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears from that ſcripture text, Job xiv. 4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</hi> Our firſt parents were unclean, how then can we be clean? How could our immediate parents be clean? Or, how ſhall our children be ſo? The unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here aimed at is a ſinful uncleanneſs; for it is ſuch as makes man's days full of trouble: and it is natural, being derived from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean parents: <hi>Man is born of a woman,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>And how can he be clean that is born of a woman?</hi> Job xxxv. 4. An omnipotent God whoſe power is not here challenged, could bring a clean thing out of an unclean; and did ſo, in the caſe of the Man CHRIST; but no other can. Every perſon that is born according to the courſe of nature, is born unclean. If the root be corrupt, ſo muſt the branches be. Neither is the matter mended, tho' the parents be ſanctified ones: for they are but holy in part, and that by grace, not by nature; and they beget their children as men, not as holy men. Wherefore, as the circumciſed parent begets an uncircumciſed child, and after the pureſt grain is ſown, we reap corn with the chaff; ſo the holieſt parents beget unholy children, and cannot communicate their grace to them, as they do their nature; which many godly parents find true, in their ſad experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider the confeſſion of the Pſalmiſt <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. li. 6. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> Here he aſcends from his actual ſin, to the fountain of it, namely, corrupt nature. He was a man according to God's own heart; but from the beginning it was not ſo with him. He was begotten in lawful marriage; but when the lump was ſhapen in the womb, it was a ſinful lump. Hence the corruption of nature is called <hi>the old man;</hi> being as old as ourſelves, older than grace, even in thoſe that are ſanctified from the womb.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hear our Lord's determination of the point, John iii. 5. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> Behold the univerſal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of mankind, all are fleſh. Not that all are frail, tho' that is a ſad truth too; yea, and our natural frailty is an evidence of our natural corruption; but that is not the ſenſe of this text: but here is the meaning of it, all are corrupt and ſinful, and that naturally: hence our Lord argues here, that becauſe they are fleſh, therefore they muſt be born again, or elſe they <hi>cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</hi> ver. 3, 5. And as the corruption of our nature evidenceth the abſolute neceſſity of regeneration; ſo the abſolute neceſſity of regeneration plainly proves the corruption of our nature: for why ſhould a man need a ſecond birth, if his nature were not quite marred in the firſt birth? Infants muſt be born again, for that is an <hi>except</hi> (John iii. 3) which admits of no conception. And therefore, they were circumciſed under the Old Teſtament, as having <hi>the body of the ſins of the fleſh,</hi> (which is conveyed to them by natural generation) to put off, Col. ii. 11. And now by the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, they are to be baptized; which ſays they are unclean, and that there

Nay, brutes, in ſome ſort, have the advantage of the natural man, who is ſunk a degree below them. He is more witleſs, in what concerns him moſt, than the ſtork, or the turtle, or the crane, or the ſwallow, in what is for their intereſt, Jer. viii. 7. He is more ſtupid than the ox or aſs.

Nay, more than all this, the ſcripture holds out the natural man, not only as wanting the good qualities of thoſe creatures; but as a compound of the evil qualities of the worſt of the creatures, in which do concenter the fierceneſs of the lion, the craft of the fox, the unteachableneſs of the wild aſs, the filthineſs of the dog and ſwine, the poiſon of the aſp, and ſuch like. Truth itſelf calls them <hi>ſerpents, a generation of vipers;</hi> yea more, even <hi>children of the devil,</hi> Mat. iii. 7. John viii. 44. Surely then, man's nature is miſerably corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>We are by nature children of wrath,</hi> Eph. ii. 3. We are worthy of, and liable to the wrath of God; and this by nature: and therefore, doubtleſs, we are by nature ſinful creatures. We are condemned before we have done good or evil; under the curſe, ere we know what it is. <hi>But will a lion roar in the foreſt while he hath no prey?</hi> Amos iii. 4. that is, Will a holy and juſt God roar in his wrath againſt man, if he be not, by his ſin, made a prey for wrath?

ſo ſoft, but there is ſome thorn of uneaſineſs in it. And at length death the wages of ſin, comes after theſe its harbingers, and ſweeps all away. Now, what but ſin has opened the ſluice? There is not a complaint nor ſigh heard in the world, nor a tear that falls from our eye, but it is an evidence that man is fallen as a ſtar from heaven; for <hi>God diſtributeth ſorrow in his anger,</hi> Job xxi. 17 This is a plain proof of the corruption of nature: foraſmuch as thoſe that have not yet actually ſinned, have their ſhare of theſe ſorrows; yea, and draw their firſt breath in the world weeping, as if they knew this world, at firſt ſight, to be a <hi>Dochim,</hi> the place of weepers. There are graves of the ſmalleſt, as well as of the largeſt ſize, in the church-yard; and there are never wanting ſome in the world, who like Rachel, <hi>are weeping for their children, becauſe they are not,</hi> Mat. ii. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Obſerve how early this <hi>corruption of nature</hi> begins to appear in young ones: <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, that <hi>even a child is known by his doings,</hi> Prov. xx. 11. It may ſoon be diſcerned, what way the bias of the heart lies. Do not the children of ſallen <hi>Adam,</hi> before they can go alone, follow their father's footſteps? What a vaſt deal of little pride, ambition, curioſity, vanity, wilfulneſs, and averſeneſs to good appears in them: And when they creep out of infancy, there is a neceſſity of uſing <hi>the rod of correction to drive away the fooliſhneſs that's bound in their heart,</hi> Prov. xxii 15. Which ſhews, that if grace prevail not, the child will be as Iſhmael, <hi>a wild aſs man,</hi> as the word is, Gen. xvi. 13</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Take a view of the manifold groſs out-breakings of ſin, in the world. <hi>The wickedneſs of man is yet great in the earth.</hi> Behold the bitter fruits of the corruption of our nature, Hoſ. iv. 2. <hi>By ſwearing and lying, and killing and ſtealing, and commiting adultery, they break out,</hi> (like the breaking forth of water) <hi>and blood toucheth blood.</hi> The world is filled with filthineſs, and all manner of lewdneſs, wickedneſs, and profanity. Whence is this deluge of ſin on the earth, but from the breaking up of the fountains of <hi>the great deep,</hi> the heart of man; <hi>out of which proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts. covetouſneſs, wickedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Mark vii, 21, 22. Ye will, it may be, thank God with a whole heart, that ye are not like theſe other men: and indeed ye have better reaſon for it than, I fear, ye are aware of; for, <hi>as in water, face anſwereth to face, ſo the heart of man to man,</hi> Prov. xxvii. 19. As looking into clear water, ye ſee your own face; ſo looking into your heart, ye may ſee other men's there: and looking into other men's, in them ye may ſee your own. So that the moſt vile and profane wretches that are in the world ſhould ſerve you for a looking glaſs; in which you ought to diſcern the corruption of your own nature: and if you do ſo, ye would, with a heart truly touched, thank God, and not yourſelves, indeed, that ye are <hi>not as other men,</hi> in your lives; ſeeing the corruption of nature is the ſame in you, as in them.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Caſt your eye upon theſe terrible convulſions the world is thrown into by the luſt of men: Lions make not a prey of lions, nor wolves of wolves: but men are turned wolves to one another, <hi>biting and devouring one another.</hi> Upon how ſlight occaſions will men ſheath their ſwords in one another's bowels! The world is a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where the cleareſt fire men can carry about with them, will not fright away the wild beaſts that inhabit it, (and that becauſe they are men, and not brutes) but one way or other they will be wounded. Since <hi>Cain</hi> ſhed the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> the earth has been turned into a ſlaughter-houſe; and the chace has been continued ſince <hi>Nimrod</hi> began his hunting; on the earth, as in the ſea, the greater ſtill devouring the leſſer. When we ſee the world in ſuch a ferment, every one ſtabbing another with words or ſwords, we may conclude there is an evil ſpirit among them. Theſe violent heats among <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſons, ſpeak the whole body to be diſtempered, the whole head to be ſick, and the whole heart faint. They ſurely proceed from an inward cauſe, James vi. 1. <hi>Luſts that war in our members.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider the neceſſity of human laws, fenced with terrors and ſeverities; to which we may apply what the apoſtle ſays, 1 Tim. i. 9. That <hi>the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. Man was made for ſociety: and God himſelf ſaid of the firſt man, when he had created him, that it was <hi>not meet that he ſhould be alone:</hi> yet the caſe is ſuch now, that, in ſociety, he muſt be hedged in with thorns. And that from hence we may the better ſee the corruption of man's nature, conſider, (1.) Every man naturally loves to be at full liberty himſelf; to have his own will for his law; and if he would follow his natural inclinations, would vote himſelf out of the reach of all laws, divine and human. And hence ſome (the power of whoſe hands has been anſwerable to their natural inclination) have indeed made themſelves abſolute, and above laws; agreeable to man's monſtrous deſign at firſt, to be as gods, Gen. iii. 5. Yet, (2.) There is no man that would willingly adventure to live in a lawleſs ſociety: and therefore, even pirates and robbers have laws among themſelves, tho' the whole ſociety caſt off all reſpect to law and right. Thus men diſcover themſelves to be conſcious of the corruption of nature; not daring to truſt one another, but upon ſecurity. (3.) How dangerous ſoever it is to break thro' the hedge: yet the violence of luſt makes many adventure daily to run the riſk. They will not only ſacrifice their credit and conſcience, which laſt is highly eſteem'd in the world; but for the pleaſure of a few moments, immediately ſucceeded with terror from within, they will lay themſelves open to a violent death by the laws of the land wherein they live. (4.) The laws are often made to yield to men's luſts. Sometimes whole ſocieties run into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, that like a company of priſoners, they break off their fetters, and put their guards to flight; and the voice of laws cannot be heard for the noiſe of arms. And ſeldom is there a time wherein
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:045042_0037_101F7CEA8C33BFB0"/>
there are not ſome perſons ſo great and daring, that the laws dare not look their impetuous luſts in the face; which made <hi>David</hi> ſay in the caſe of <hi>Joab,</hi> who had murdered <hi>Abner, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(5.) Conſider what neceſſity often appears of ammending old laws, and making new ones; which have their riſe from new crimes that man's nature is very fruitful of. There would be no need of mending the hedge, if men were not like unruly beaſts, ſtill breaking it down. It is aſtoniſhing to ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what figure the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were ſeparated unto God, from among all the nations of the earth do make in their hiſtory; what horrible confuſions were among them, when there was no king in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as you may ſee, in the xviii. xix. xx. and xxi. chapters of <hi>Judges:</hi> how hard it was to reform them, when they had the beſt of magiſtrates: and how quickly they turned aſide again, when they got wicked rulers. I cannot but think, that one grand deſign of that ſacred hiſtory, was to diſcover the corruption of man's nature, the abſolute need of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his grace: and that we ought in the reading of it, to improve it to that end. How cutting is that word, the Lord has to <hi>Samuel,</hi> concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. ix. 17. <hi>The ſame ſhall reign over</hi> (or, as the word is, <hi>ſhall reſtrain) my people.</hi> O the corruption of man's nature! the awe and dread of the God of heaven reſtrains them not: but they muſt have gods on the earth to do it <hi>to put them to ſhame,</hi> Judges xviii. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Conſider the remains of that natural corruption in the ſaints. Tho' grace has entered, yet corruption is not quite expelled: tho' they have got the new creature, yet much of the old corrupt nature remains: and theſe ſtruggle together within them, as the twins in <hi>Rebekah</hi>'s womb, Gal. v. 17. They ſaid it preſent with them at all times, and in all places, even in the moſt retired corners. If a man have an ill neighbour, he may remove; if he have an ill ſervant, he may put him away at the term: if a bad yoke fellow, he may ſometimes leave the houſe, and be free of moleſtation that way. But ſhould the ſaint go into a wilderneſs, or ſet up his tent in ſome remote rock in the ſea, where never foot of man, beaſt, nor fowl had touched, there will it be with him. Should he be, with <hi>Paul,</hi> caught up to the third heavens, it ſhall come back with him, 2 Cor xii. 7. It followeth him as the ſhadow doth the body: it makes a blot in the faireſt line he can draw. It is like the fig-tree in the wall, which, how nearly ſoever it was cut, yet ſtill grow till the wall was thrown down; for the roots of it are fixed in the heart, while the ſaint is in the world, as with bands of iron and braſs. It is eſpecially active when he would do good, Rom. vii. 21. then the fowls come down upon the carcaſes. Hence often in holy duties, the ſpirit even of a ſaint (as it were) evaporates: and he is lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

remains of the corruption of nature in the godly, to themſelves; for they groan under it; and to prove it to them, were to hold out a candle to let men ſee the ſun: and as for the wicked, they are ready to account mole-hills in the ſaint, as big as mountains; if not to reckon them all hypocrites. But conſider theſe few things on this head. (1.) <hi>If it be thus in the green tree, how muſt it be in the dry?</hi> The ſaints are not born ſaints; but made ſo by the power of regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2.) The ſaints groan under the remains of it as a heavy burden? hear the Apoſtle, Rom. vii. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am! Who ſhall deliver me from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

No, no; only he is dead, and feels not the ſinking weight. Many a groan is heard from a ſick bed; but never one from a grave. In the ſaint, as in the ſick man, there is a mighty ſtruggle; life and death ſtriving for the maſtery: but in the natural man, as in the dead corpſe, there is no noiſe; becauſe death bears full ſway. (3.) The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And this is the caſe of all unregenerate, who <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> If the garden of the diligent afford him new work daily, in cutting off and rooting up; ſurely that of the ſluggard muſt needs be all grown over with thorns.</p>

Some children, by their features and lineaments of their face, do, as it were, father themſelves: and thus we do reſemble our firſt parents. Every one of us bear the image and impreſs of their fall upon him: and to evince the truth of this, I do appeal to the conſciences of all, in theſe following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> Is not a ſinful curioſity natural to us? And is not this a print of <hi>Adam</hi>'s image? Gen. iii. 6. Is not men naturally much more deſirous to know new things, than to practiſe old known truths? How like to old <hi>Adam</hi> do we look in this, itching after novelties, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhing old ſolid doctrines? We ſeek after knowledge rather than holineſs; and ſtudy moſt to know theſe things, which are leaſt edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Our wild and roving fancies need a bridle to curb them, while good ſolid affections muſt be quickened and ſpurred up</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> If the LORD, by his holy law and wiſe providence do put a reſtraint upon us, to keep us back from any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth not that reſtraint whet the edge of our natural inclinations, and make us ſo much the keener in our deſires: And in this do we not betray it plainly that we are <hi>Adam</hi>'s children. Gen. iii. 2, 3, 6. I think this
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:045042_0039_101F7CEE0BC33EE8"/>
cannot be denied: for daily obſervation evinceth, that it is a natural principle; that <hi>ſtolen waters are ſweet, and bread eaten in ſecret, is pleaſant.</hi> Prov. ix. 17. The very heathens are convinced, that man was poſſeſſed with this ſpirit of contradiction, tho' they knew not the ſpring of it. How often do men give themſelves the looſe in theſe things, in which, if God had left them at liberty, they would have bound up themſelves! but corrupt nature takes a pleaſure in the very jumping over the hedge. And is it not a repeating of our father's folly, that men will rather climb for forbidden fruit, than gather what is ſhaken off the true of good providence to them, when they have God's expreſs allowance for it!</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Which of all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> is not naturally diſpoſed to hear the <hi>inſtruction that cauſeth to err?</hi> And was not this the rock our firſt parents ſplit upon?

                  <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Do not the eyes in our head often blind the eyes of the mind? And was not this the very caſe of our firſt parents? Gen iii. 6. Man is never more blind than when he is looking on the objects that are pleaſant to ſenſe. Since the eyes of our firſt parents were opened to the forbidden fruit, men's eyes have been the gates of deſtruction to their ſouls; at which impure imaginations and ſinful deſires have entred the heart, to the wounding of the ſoul, waſting of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and bringing diſmal effects ſometimes on whole ſocieties, as in <hi>Achan</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Joſhua</hi> vii. 21. Holy <hi>Job</hi> was aware of this danger, from theſe two little rowling bodies, which a very ſmall ſplinter of wood will make uſeleſs; ſo as (with that King who durſt not, with his ten thouſand, meet him that came with twenty thouſand againſt him, Luke xiv. 31, 32.) he ſendeth and deſireth conditions of peace, Job xxxi. 1. <hi>I have made a covenant with mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> Is it not natural for us, to care for the body, even at the expence of the ſoul? This was one ingredient in the ſin of our firſt parents, Gen. iii. 6.

                  <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> Is not every one by nature diſcontent with his preſent lot in the world; or with ſome one thing or other in it? This alſo was <hi>Adam</hi>'s caſe, Gen. iii. 5, 6. Some one thing is always miſſing; ſo that man is a creature given to changes. And if any doubt of this, let them look over all their enjoyments; and after a review of them, liſten to their own hearts, and they will hear a ſecret murmuring for want of ſomething: tho' perhaps, if they conſidered the matter aright, they would ſee that it is better for them, to want, than to have that ſomething. Since the hearts of our firſt parents flew out at their eyes, on the forbidden fruit, and a night of darkneſs was thereby brought on the world; their poſterity have a natural diſeaſe, which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls, <hi>The wandring of the deſires,</hi> (or, as the word is, <hi>The walking of the ſoul,</hi>) Eccl. vi 9. This is a ſort of a diabolical trance, wherein the ſoul traverſeth the world; feeds itſelf with a thouſand airy nothings: ſnatcheth at this and the other created excellency, in imagination and deſire: goes here and there, and every-where, except where it ſhould go. And the ſoul is never cured of this diſeaſe, till overcoming grace bring it back, to take up its everlaſting reſt in God thro' Chriſt: but till this be, if man were ſet again in paradiſe, the garden of the Lord; all the pleaſures there would not keep him from looking, yea, and leaping over the hedge a ſecond time.</p>
                  <p n="7">7<hi>thly,</hi> Are we not far more eaſily impreſſed and influenced by evil counſels and examples, than by thoſe that are good? You will ſee this was the ruin of <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen iii. 6 Evil example, to this day, is one of <hi>Satan</hi>'s maſter devices to ruin men. And tho' we have by nature, more of the fox than of the lamb; yet that ill property ſome obſerve in this creature, <hi>viz.</hi> That if one lamb ſkip into a water, the reſt that are near will ſuddenly follow, may be obſerved alſo in the diſpoſition of the children of men; to whom it is very natural to embrace an evil way, becauſe they ſee others upon it before them.

And nothing is more plain, than that generally men chuſe rather to do what the moſt do, than what the beſt do.</p>
                  <p n="8">8<hi>thly,</hi> Who of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſons needs be taught the art of <hi>ſowing fig-leaves together,</hi> to cover their nakedneſs? Gen. iii. 7. When we have ruined ourſelves, and made ourſelves naked, to our ſhame; we naturally ſeek to help ourſelves by ourſelves: and many poor ſhifts are fallen upon, as ſilly and inſignificant as <hi>Adam</hi>'s fig-leaves. What pains are men at, to cover their ſin from their own conſciences, and draw all the fair colours upon it that they can? And when once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions are faſtened upon them, ſo that they cannot but ſee themſelves
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:045042_0041_101F7CF75BE0AC48"/>
naked; it is as natural for them to attempt to ſpin a cover to it out of their own bowels, as for fiſhes to ſwim in the waters, or birds to fly in the air. Therefore, the firſt queſtion of the convinced is, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> Acts ii. 27. How ſhall we qualify ourſelves? What ſhall we perform? Not minding that the new creature is God's own workmanſhip (or deed, Eph. ii. 10.) more than <hi>Adam</hi> thought of being clothed with ſkins of ſacrifices, Gen. iii. 21.</p>
                  <p n="9">9<hi>thly,</hi> Do not <hi>Adam</hi>'s children naturally follow his footſteps, in hiding themſelves from the preſence of the LORD, Gen. iii. 8. We are every whit as blind in this matter as he was, who thought to hide himſelf from the preſence of God among the ſhady trees of the garden. We are very apt to promiſe ourſelves more ſecurity in a ſecret ſin, than in one that is openly committed. <hi>The eye of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, ſaying, No eye ſhall ſee me,</hi> Job xxiv. 15. And men will freely do that in ſecret, which they would be aſhamed to do in the preſence of a child; as if darkneſs could hide from an all-ſeeing God. Are we not naturally careleſs of communion with God; ay, and averſe to it? Never was there any communion betwixt God and <hi>Adam</hi>'s children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Lord himſelf had not the firſt word. If he would let them alone, they would never inquire after him. Iſa. lvii. 16. <hi>I hide me.</hi>—Did he ſeek after a hiding God? Very far from it.—<hi>He went on in the way of his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10<hi>thly,</hi> How loath are men to confeſs ſin, to take guilt and ſhame to themſelves? And was it not thus in the caſe before us? Gen. iii. 10. <hi>Adam</hi> confeſſeth his nakedneſs, which he could not get denied; but not one word he ſays of his ſins: here was the reaſon of it, he would fain have hid it if he could. It is as natural for us to hide ſin, as to commit it. Many ſad inſtances thereof we have in this world; but a far clearer proof of it we ſhall get at the day of judgment, the day in which <hi>God will judge the ſecrets of men,</hi> Rom. ii. 16. Many a foul mouth will then be ſeen, which is now <hi>wiped, and ſaith, I have done no wickedneſs,</hi> Prov. xxx. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Is it not natural for us to extenuate our ſin, and transfer the guilt upon others? And when God examined our guilty firſt parents, did not <hi>Adam</hi> lay the blame on the woman? And did not the woman lay the blame on the ſerpent? Gen. iii. 12, 13. Now <hi>Adam</hi>'s children need not be taught this helliſh policy; for before they can well ſpeak, (if they cannot get the fact denied) they will cunningly liſpout ſomething to leſſen their fault, and lay the blame upon another. Nay, ſo natural is this to men, that in the greateſt of ſins, they will lay the fault upon God himſelf; they will blaſpheme his holy providence, under the miſtaken name of misfortune or ill luck, and thereby lay the blame of their ſin at heaven's door. And was not this one of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tricks after his fall? Gen. iii. 12. <hi>And the man ſaid, the woman whom thou ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

There was but one woman then in the world; ſo that one would think he needed not have been ſo nice and exact in point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her; yet ſhe is as carefully marked out in his defence, as if there had been ten thouſand. <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt me:</hi> here he ſpeaks, as if he had been ruined with God's gifts. And to make the ſhift look the blacker, it added to all this, <hi>thou gaveſt to be with me,</hi> a conſtant companion, to ſtand by me as a helper. This looks as if <hi>Adam</hi> would have fathered an ill deſign upon the Lord, in giving him this gift. And after all, there is a new demonſtrative here, before the ſentence is compleat: he ſays not, <hi>The woman gave me,</hi> but <hi>the woman ſhe gave me,</hi> emphatically, as if he had ſaid, <hi>She, even She gave me of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

But his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is quickly over, in one word, (is he ſpoke it) <hi>and I did eat.</hi> And there is nothing here to point to himſelf, and as little to ſhew what he had eaten. How natural is his black art to <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity? He that runs may read it. So univerſally does <hi>Solomon</hi>'s obſerve hold true, Prov. xvii. 3. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of men perverteth his ways, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord</hi> Let us then call fallen Adam, <hi>father;</hi> let us not deny the relation, ſeeing we bear his image.</p>
                  <p>And now to ſhut up this point, ſufficiently confirmed by concurring evidence from the Lord's word, our own experience and obſervation; let us be perſuaded to believe the doctrine of the corruption of our nature: and to look to the ſacred <hi>Adam,</hi> the bleſſed JESUS, for the application of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

into the hands of our grand adverſary, as <hi>Samſon</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and are deprived of our two eyes. <hi>There is none that underſtandeth,</hi> Rom. iii. 11. <hi>Mind and conſcience are defiled,</hi> Tit. i. 15.

And his imaginations, or reaſonings muſt be caſt down, by the power of the word, being of a piece with his judgment, 2 Cor. x. 5 But to point out this <hi>corruption</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>underſtanding</hi> more particularly, let theſe following things be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a natural weakneſs in the minds of men, with reſpect to ſpiritual things. The apoſtle determines concerning every one that is not endued with the graces of the Spirit, <hi>That he is blind, and cannot ſee afar off,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 9. Hence the Spirit of God in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, clothes, as it were, divine truths with earthly figures, even as parents teach their children, uſing ſimilitudes, Hoſ. xii. 10. Which, tho' it doth not cure, yet doth evidence this natural weakneſs in the minds of men. But we want not plain proofs of it from experience. As, (1.) How hard a taſk is it to teach many people the common principles of our holy religion, and to make truths ſo plain as they may underſtand them? Here there muſt be <hi>precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line,</hi> Iſa. xxviii. 9. Try the ſame perſons in other things, they ſhall be found <hi>wiſer in their generation than the children of light.</hi> They underſtand their work and buſineſs in the world, as well as their neighbours; tho' they be very ſtupid and unteachable in the matters of God. Tell them how they may advance their worldly wealth, or how they may gratify their luſts, and they will quickly underſtand theſe things; tho' it is very hard to make them know how their ſouls may be ſaved; or how their hearts may find reſt in Jeſus Chriſt. (2.) Conſider theſe who have many advantages, beyond the common gang of mankind; who have had the benefit of good education and inſtruction; yea, and are bleſt with the light of grace in that meaſure, wherein it is diſtributed to the ſaints on earth: yet how ſmall a portion have they of the knowledge of divine things! What ignorance and confuſion do ſtill remain in their minds! How often are they mired, even in the matter of practical truths, and ſpeak as a child in theſe things. It is a pitiful weakneſs that we cannot perceive the things which God has revealed to us: and it muſt needs be a ſinful weakneſs, ſince the law of God requires us to know and believe them. (3.) What dangerous miſtakes are to be found amongſt men, in their concerns of greateſt weight! what woful deluſions prevail over them! do we not often ſee thoſe, who otherwiſe, are the wiſeſt of men, the moſt notorious fools, with reſpect to their ſoul's intereſt, Matth. xi. 25. <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent.</hi> Many that are eagle-eyed in the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:045042_0044_101F7D00F3D7FCE8"/>
trifles of time, are like owls and bats in the light of life. Nay truly, the life of every natural man is but one continued dream and deluſion: out of which he never awakes, till either by a new light darted from heaven into his ſoul, he come to himſelf, Luke xv. 17. or, <hi>in hell he lift up his eyes,</hi> chap. xvi 24. And therefore in ſcripture account, be he never ſo wiſe, he is a fool and a ſimple one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man's underſtanding is naturally overwhelmed with groſs darkneſs in ſpiritual things. Man, at the inſtigation of the devil, attempting to break out a new light in his mind, (Gen. iii. 5.) inſtead of that, br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ke up the doors of the bottomleſs pit: ſo, as by the ſmoak thereof, he was buried in darkneſs. When God at firſt had made man, his mind was a lamp of light: but now when he comes to make him over again in regeneration, he finds it darkneſs, Eph. v. 8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs.</hi> Sin has cloſed the windows of the ſoul, darkneſs is over all that region. It is the land of darkneſs and ſhadow of death, where the light is as darkneſs. The prince of darkneſs reigns there, and nothing but the works of darkneſs are framed there. We are both ſpiritually blind, and cannot be reſtored without a miracle of grace. This is thy caſe, whoſoever thou art, if thou art not born again. And that you may be convinced in this matter, take thoſe following evidences of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. The darkneſs that was upon the face of the world before, and at the time when Chriſt came, ariſing as <hi>the ſun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> upon the earth. When <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin had loſt that primitive light wherewith he was endued in his creation, it pleaſed God to make a gracious revelation of his mind and will to him, touching the way of ſalvation, Gen iii. 15. This was handed down by him, and other godly fathers, before the flood: yet the natural darkneſs of the mind of man prevailed ſo far againſt that revelation, as to carry off all ſenſe of true religion from the old world, except what remained in <hi>Noah</hi>'s family, which was preſerved in the ark. After the flood, as men multiplied on the earth, the natural darkneſs of mind prevails again, and the light decays, till it died out among the generality of mankind, and is preſerved only among the poſterity of <hi>Shem.</hi> And even with them it was well near its ſetting, when God called <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>ſerving other gods,</hi> Joſh. xxiv. 15. God gives <hi>Abraham</hi> a more clear and full revelation, and he communicates the ſame to his family, Gen. xvii. 19. yet the natural darkneſs wears it out at length, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e that it was preſerved among the poſterity of <hi>Jacob.</hi> They being carried down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that darkneſs prevailed ſo, as to leave them very little ſenſe of true religion: and a new revelation behoved to be made them in the wilderneſs. And many a cloud of darkneſs got above that, now and then, during the time from <hi>Moſes</hi> to CHRIST. When CHRIST came, the world was divided into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> and the true light with them, were within an incloſure, Pſal. cxliii. 19, 20. Betwixt them and the <hi>Gentile</hi> world, there was a partition wall of GOD's making, namely, the ceremonial law; and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:045042_0045_101F7D02C4404990"/>
upon that there was reared up another of man's own making, namely, a rooted enmity betwixt the parties, Eph ii. 14, 15. If we look abroad without the incloſure, (and except thoſe proſelytes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who, by means of ſome rays of light breaking forth unto them from within the incloſure, having renounced idolatry, worſhipped the true God, but did not conform to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> rites) we ſee noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>dark places of the earth, full of the habitations of cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lty,</hi> Pſal. lxxiv. 20. Groſs darkneſs covered the face of the <hi>Gentile</hi> world; and the way of ſalvation was utterly unknown among them. They were drowned in ſuperſtition and idolatry; and had multiplied their idols to ſuch a vaſt number, that above thirty thouſand are reckoned to have been worſhipped by thoſe of <hi>Europe</hi> alone. Whatever wiſdom was among their Philoſophers, <hi>the world by</hi> that <hi>wiſdom knew not God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1 21. and all their reſearches in religion were but groping in the dark, Acts x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. 27. If we look within the incloſure, and, except a few that were groaning and waiting for the Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we will ſee a groſs darkneſs on the face of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Tho' <hi>to them were committed the oracles of God;</hi> yet they were moſt corrupt in their doctrine Their traditions were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; but the knowledge of theſe things wherein the life of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lies, was loſt: <hi>Maſters of Iſrael</hi> knew not the nature and neceſſity of regeneration, John iii. 10. Their religion was to build on their birth privilege, as children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Matth. iii. 9. to glory in their circumciſion, and other external ordinances, Philip. iii. 2, 3. And to reſt in the law, (Rom. ii. 17.) after they had, by their falſe gloſſes, cut it ſo ſhort, as they might go well near to the fulfilling of it, Matth. v.</p>
                  <p>Thus was darkneſs over the face of the world, when CHRIST <hi>the true Light</hi> came into it: and ſo is darkneſs over every ſoul, till he, as the <hi>Day-ſtar,</hi> ariſe in the heart. The former is an evidence of the latter. What, but the natural darkneſs of men's minds, could ſtill thus wear out the light of external revelation in a matter upon which eternal happineſs did depend? Men did not forget the way of preſerving their lives: but how quickly did they loſe the knowledge of the way of ſalvation of their ſouls; which are of infinite more weight and worth! when patriarchs and prophets teaching was ineffectual, men behoved to be taught of GOD himſelf; who alone can open the eyes of the underſtanding. But, that it might appear, that the corruption of man's mind lay deeper than to be cured by mere external revelation; there were but very few converted by CHRIST's preaching, <hi>who ſpoke as never man ſpok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The great cure on the generation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to be performed, by the Spirit accompanying the preaching of the apoſtles; who, according to the promiſe, (John xlv. 12.) were to do great works. And if we look to the miracles wrought by our bleſſed Lord, we will find, that by applying the remedy to the ſoul, for the cure of bodily diſtempers, (as in the caſe of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:045042_0046_101F7D06E2E8B0F8"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the diſeaſes of the ſoul. I find a miracle wrought upon one that was born <hi>blind,</hi> performed in ſuch a way, as ſeems to have been deſigned to let the world ſee in it, as in a glaſs, their caſe and cure, John ix. 6. <hi>He made clay, and anointed the eyes of the blind man, with the clay.</hi> What could more fitly repreſent the blindneſs of men's minds, than eyes cloſed up with earth? Iſa vi. 1 <hi>ſhut their eyes;</hi> ſhut them up by anointing or <hi>caſting them with mortar,</hi> as the word would bear. And Chap. xliv. 18. <hi>he hath ſhut their eyes;</hi> the word properly ſignifies, <hi>he hath plaiſtered their eyes;</hi> as the houſe in which the leproſy had been, was to be plaiſtered, Lev. xiv. 42. Thus the Lord's word diſcovers the deſign of that ſtrange work; and by it ſhews us, that the eyes of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are naturally ſhut. Then the blind man muſt go and waſh off this clay in the pool of <hi>Siloam;</hi> no other water will ſerve this purpoſe. If that pool had not repreſented him, whom the Father ſent into the world, <hi>to open the blind eyes,</hi> (Iſa. xlii. 7.) I think the Evangeliſt had not given us the interpretation of the name, which he ſays, ſignifies, <hi>ſent,</hi> John ix. 7. And ſo we may conclude, that the natural darkneſs of our minds is ſuch, as there is no cure for; but from the blood and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe eye-ſalve, only can make us ſee, Rev. iii. 18.</p>

men, touching the way to happineſs, there are almoſt as many opinions as there are men; they being <hi>turned every one to his own way,</hi> Iſa. liii. 6. They are like the blind <hi>Sodomites</hi> about <hi>Lot</hi>'s houſe, all were ſeeking to find the door, ſome grope one part of the wall for it, ſome another; but none of them could certainly ſay, he had found it: and ſo the natural man may ſtumble on any good but the chief good. Look into thine own unregenerate heart, and there thou wilt ſee all turned upſide down: heaven lying under, and earth a-top, look into thy life, there thou mayſt ſee, how thou art playing the madman, ſnatching at ſhadows, and neglecting the ſubſtance, eagerly flying after <hi>that which is not,</hi> and ſlighting that which is, and will be for ever.</p>

He knows not what a God he has to deal with; he is unacquainted with Chriſt; and knows not what ſin is. The greateſt graceleſs wits are blind as moles in theſe things. Ay, but ſome ſuch can ſpeak of them to good purpoſe: and ſo might theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the temptations, ſigns and miracles, their eyes had ſeen, (Deut. xxix. 3.) to whom nevertheleſs the Lord had not <hi>given an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear, unto that day,</hi> ver. 4. Many a man that bears the name of a Chriſtian, may make <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s confeſſion of ſaith, Exod. v. 2. <hi>I know not the Lord, neither will</hi> they <hi>let go</hi> when he commands them to part with. God is with them as a prince in diſguiſe among his ſubjects, who meets with no better treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them, than if they were his fellows, Pſal. l. 21. Do they know Chriſt, or ſee his glory, and any beauty in him for which he is to be deſired? if they did, they would not ſlight him as they do: a view of his glory would ſo darken all created excellency, that they would take him for, and inſtead of all, and gladly cloſe with him, as he offereth himſelf in the goſpel, John iv. 10. Pſal ix. 10. Matth. xiii. 44, 45, 59. Do they know what ſin is, who hug the ſerpent in their boſom, hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to let it go? I own indeed they may have a natural knowledge of thoſe things, as the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> had or Chriſt, whom they ſaw and converſed with: but there was ſpiritual glory in him, perceived by believers only, Joh i. 14 and in reſpect of that glory, <hi>the</hi> (unbelieving) <hi>world knew him not,</hi> ver. 10. But the ſpiritual knowledge of them they cannot have; it is above the reach of the carnal mind, 1 Cor. ii. 14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: neither can he know them, for they are ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually diſcerned.</hi> He may indeed diſcourſe of them; but no other

He has ſome notions of ſpiritual truths, but ſees not the things themſelves, that are wrapt up in the words of truth, 1 Tim. i. 7. <hi>Underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm.</hi> In a word natural men fear, ſeek, confeſs, they know not what. Thus may you ſee man's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding naturally is overwhelmed with groſs darkneſs in ſpiritual things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is in the mind of man a natural bias to evil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to paſs, that whatever difficulties it finds, while occupied about things truly good, it acts with a great deal of eaſe in evil; as being in that caſe, in its own element, Jer. iv. 22. The carnal mind drives heavily in the thoughts of good; but furiouſly in the thoughts of evil. While holineſs is before it, fetters are upon it: but when once it has got over the hedge, it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. As when a man, by a violent ſtroke on the head, loſeth his ſight, there ariſeth to him a kind of falſe light, whereby he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a thouſand airy nothings; ſo man being ſtruck blind to all that is truly good, and for his eternal intereſt, has a light of another ſort brought into his mind; his eyes are opened, knowing evil, and ſo are the words of the tempter verified, Gen. iii. 5. The words of the Prophet are plain, <hi>They are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge,</hi> Jer. iv. 22. The mind of man has a natural dexterity to deviſe miſchief: none are ſo ſimple, as to want ſkill to contrive ways to gratify their luſts, and ruin their ſouls: tho' the power of every one's hand cannot reach to put their deviſes in execution.

Why ſhould we be ſurpriſed with the product of corrupt wits: their cunning devices to afront heaven, to oppoſe and run down truth and holineſs, and to gratify their own and other men's luſt? They row with the ſtream; no wonder they make great progreſs: their ſtock is within them, and increaſeth by uſing of it: and the works of darkneſs are contrived with the greater advantage, that the mind is wholly deſtitute of ſpiritual light, which, if it were in them, in any meaſure, would ſo far mar the work, 1 John iii. 9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin;</hi> he does it not as by art, for <hi>his ſeed remaineth in him.</hi> But on the other hand, <hi>It is a ſport for a ſoul to do miſchief: but a man of underſtanding hath wiſdom,</hi> Prov. x. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> who wiſt not what to do, before the prieſt began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult God, is quickly determined when once the prieſt's hand was in: his own heart then gave him an anſwer, and would not allow him to wait an anſwer from the Lord, 1 Sam. xiv. 18, 19. Such a deviliſh dexterity hath the carnal mind, in deviling what may moſt effectually divert men from their duty to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 3. Doth not the carnal mind naturally ſtrive to graſp ſpiritual things in imagination; as if the ſoul were quite immerſed in fleſh and blood, and would turn every thing into its own ſhape? Let men who are uſed to the forming of the moſt abſtracted notion, look into their own ſouls, and they ſhall find this bias in their minds: whereof the idolatry, which did of old, and ſtill doth, ſo much prevail in the world, is an unconteſtable evidence. For it plainly diſcovers, that men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally would have a viſible deity, and ſee what they worſhip: and therefore they <hi>changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image,</hi> Rom. i. 23. The reformation of theſe nations (bleſſed be the Lord for it) hath baniſhed idolatry, and images too, out of our churches: but heart-reformation only can break down mental idolatry, and baniſh the more ſubtile and refined image-worſhip, and repreſentation of the Deity, out of the minds of men. The world, in the time of its darkneſs, was never more prone to the former, than the unſanctified mind is to the latter. And hence are horrible, monſtrous, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen thoughts of God, Chriſt, the glory above, and all ſpiritual things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 4. What a difficult taſk is it to detain the carnal mind before the Lord! how averſe is it to the entertaining of good thoughts, and dwelling in the meditation of ſpiritual things! if one be driven, at any time, to think of the great concerns of his ſoul, it is no harder work to hold in an unruly hungry beaſt, than to hedge in the carnal mind, that it get not away to the vanities of the world again. When God is ſpeaking to men by his word, or they are ſpeaking to him in prayer, doth not the mind often leave them before the Lord, like ſo many <hi>idols that have eyes, but ſee not; and ears, but hear not?</hi> The carcaſe is laid down before God, but the world gets away the heart: tho' the eyes be cloſed, the man ſees a thouſand vanities: the mind, in the mean time, is like a bird got looſe out of the cage, ſkipping from buſh to buſh; ſo that, in effect, the man never comes to himſelf, till he be <hi>gone from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Say not, it is impoſſible to get the mind fixed. It is hard indeed, but not impoſſible. Grace from the Lord can do it, Pſal. cviii. 1. Agreeable objections will do it. A pleaſant ſpeculation will arreſt the minds of the inquiſitive: the worldly man's mind is in little hazard of wandering, when he is contriving of buſineſs, caſting up his accounts, or telling his money:
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:045042_0050_101F7D1295E19000"/>
if he anſwer you not at firſt, he tells you, he did not hear you, he was buſy; his mind was fixed. Were we admitted into the preſence of a king to petition for our lives, we would be in no hazard of gazing through the chamber of preſence: But here lies the caſe, the carnal mind, employed about any ſpiritual good, is out of its element, and therefore cannot fix.</p>

                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 5 But however hard it is to keep the mind on good thoughts, it ſticks as glue to what is evil and corrupt like itſelf! 2 Pet. ii. 14. <hi>Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from ſin.</hi> Their eyes cannot ceaſe from ſin; (ſo the words are conſtructed) that is, their hearts and minds venting by the eyes, what is within, are like a furious beaſt, which cannot be held in, when once it has got out its head. Let the corrupt imagination once be let looſe on its proper object; it will be found hard work to call it back again, tho' both reaſon and <hi>will</hi> be for its retreat. For then it is in its own element; and to draw it off from its impurities, is as the drawing of a fiſh out of the water, or the renting of a limb from a man. It runs like fire ſet to a train of powder, that reſteth not till it can get no further.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 6. Conſider how the carnal imagination ſupplies the want of real objects to the corrupt heart; that it may make ſinners happy, at leaſt, in the imaginary enjoyment of their luſts. Thus the corrupt heart feeds itſelf with imagination-ſins: the unclean perſon is filled with ſpeculative impurities, having eyes full of adultery; the covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man fills his heart with the world, tho' he cannot get his hands full of it; the malicious perſon, with delight, acts his revenge within his own breaſt) the envious man, within his own narrow ſoul, beholds, with ſatisfaction, his neighbour laid low enough; and every luſt finds the corrupt imagination a friend to it in time of need. And this it doth, not only when people are awake, but ſometimes even when they are aſleep; whereby it comes to paſs, that theſe ſins are acted in dreams, which their hearts were carried out after, while they were awake. I know ſome do queſtion the ſinfulneſs of theſe things: But can it be thought they are conſiſtent with that holy nature and frame of ſpirit, which was in innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> and in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhould be in every man? It is the corruption of nature then, that makes filthy dreamers condemned, Jude 8. <hi>Solomon</hi> had experience of the exerciſe of grace in ſleep: in a dream he prayed, in a dream he made the beſt choice; both were accepted of God, 1 Kings iii. 5,— 15. And if a man may, in his ſleep, do what is good and acceptable to God, why may he not alſo, when aſleep, do that which is evil and diſpleaſing to God? The ſame <hi>Solomon</hi> would have men aware of this; and preſcribes the beſt remedy againſt it, namely, <hi>The law upon the heart,</hi> Prov. vi. 20, 21. <hi>When thou ſleepeſt,</hi> (ſays he, ver. 22.) <hi>it ſhall keep thee,</hi> to wit, from the ſinning in thy ſleep; that is, from ſinful dreams: For one's being kept from ſin, (not his being kept from affliction) is the immediate proper effect of the law of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon the heart, Pſal. cxix. 11. And thus the whole verſe is
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:045042_0051_101F7D14A6027418"/>
to be underſtood, as appears from verſe 23. <hi>For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light, and reproofs of inſtruction are the way of life.</hi> Now the law is a lamp of light, as it guides in the way of duty; and inſtructing reproofs from the law, are the way of life, as they keep from ſin: neither do they guide into the way of peace, but as they lead into the way of duty; nor do they keep a man out of trouble, but as they keep him from ſin. And remarkable is the particular in which <hi>Solomon</hi> inſtanceth, namely, the ſin of uncleanneſs, <hi>to keep thee from the evil woman:</hi> and ver. 24. which is to be joined with verſe 22. incloſing the 23d in a parentheſis, as ſome verſions have it. Theſe things may ſuffice to convince us of the natural bias of the mind to evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is in the carnal mind, an oppoſition to ſpiritual truths, and an averſion to the receiving of them. It is as little a friend to divine truths, as it is to holineſs. The truths of natural religion, which do, as it were, force their entry into the minds of natural men, they hold priſoners in unrighteouſneſs, Rom. i. 18. And as for the truths of revealed religion, there is <hi>an evil heart of unbelief</hi> in them, which oppoſeth their entry; and there is an armed force—neceſſary to captivate the mind to the belief of them, 2 Cor. x 4, 5. God has made a revelation of his mind and will to ſinners, touching the way of ſalvation: he has given us the doctrine of his holy word: but do natural men believe it indeed? No, they do not; <hi>for he that believeth not on the Son of God, believeth not God,</hi> as is plain from 1 John v. 10. They believe not the promiſes of the word: they look on them, in effect, only as fair words; for theſe that receive them, are thereby made <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 4. The promiſes are as ſilver cords let down from heaven to draw ſinners unto God, and to waft them over into the promiſed land; but they caſt them from them. They believe not the threatnings of the word. As men travelling in defarts carry fire about with them, to fright away wild beaſts: ſo God has made his law a firey law, Deut. xxxiii. 2. hedging it about with threats of wrath: But men naturally are more brutiſh than beaſts themſelves; and will needs touch the firey ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountain, tho' they ſhould <hi>be thruſt through with a dart.</hi> I doubt not, but moſt, if not all of you, who are yet in the black ſtate of nature will here plead, <hi>Not guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But he confutes their confidence, roundly telling them, John v. 46. <hi>Had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me.</hi> Did ye believe the truths of God, ye durſt not reject, as ye do, Him who is truth itſelf. The very difficulty you find in aſſenting to this truth, bewrays that unbelief I am charging you with. Has it not proceeded ſo far with ſome at this day, that it has ſteeled their fore-heads with the impudence and impiety, openly to reject all revealed religion? Surely it is <hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. How few are there who have been bleſt with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward illumination, by the ſpecial operation of the Spirit of Chriſt, letting them into a view of divine truths in their ſpiritual and heavenly luſtre! How have you learned the truths of religion, which ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to believe! Ye have them merely by the benefit of external revelation, and of your education; ſo that you are Chriſtians, juſt becauſe you were not born and bred in a Pagan, but in a Chriſtian country. Ye are ſtrangers to the inward work of the holy Spirit, bearing witneſs by, and with the word in your hearts; and ſo you cannot have the aſſurance of faith, with reſpect to that outward divine revelation made in the word, 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11, 12. And therefore ye are ſtill unbelievers. <hi>It is written in the prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God—Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me,</hi> ſays our Lord, John vi. 45. Now ye have not come to Chriſt, therefore ye have not been <hi>taught of God;</hi> ye have not been ſo taught, and therefore ye have not come; ye believe not. Behold the revelation from which the faith even of the fundamental principles in religion doth ſpring, Matth. xvi. 17, 18. <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God—Bleſſed art thou Simon Barjona; for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</hi> If ever the Spirit of the LORD take a dealing with thee, to work in thee that faith, which is of the <hi>operation of God;</hi> it may be, as much time will be ſpent in razing the old foundation, as will make thee find a neceſſity of the <hi>working of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

See how they fall, like ſtars from heaven, when Antichriſt prevails, 2 Theſſ. ii 11, 12. <hi>God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth.</hi> They fall into damning deluſions: becauſe they never really believed the truth, tho' they themſelves and others too thought they did believe it.

Conſider the utter inconſiſtency of moſt men's lives, with the principles of religion which they profeſs; ye may as ſoon bring eaſt and weſt together, as their principles and practice. Men believe that fire will burn them, and therefore they will not throw themſelves into it: but the truth is, moſt men live as if they thought the goſpel a mere fable, and the wrath of God revealed in his word againſt their unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs, a mere ſcare-crow. If ye believe the doctrines of the word, how is it that ye are ſo unconcerned about the ſtate of your ſouls before the LORD? How is it that you are ſo

little concerned with that weighty point, whether ye be born again or not? Many live as they were born, and are like to die as they live, and yet live in peace. Do ſuch believe the ſinfulneſs and miſery of a natural ſtate? Do they believe they are <hi>children of wrath?</hi> Do they believe there is no ſalvation without regeneration? and no regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but what makes man a new creature? If you believe the promiſes of the word, why do you not embrace them, and labour to enter into the promiſed reſt? What ſluggard would not dig for a hid treaſure, if he really believed he might ſo obtain it? Men will work and ſweat for a maintenance; becauſe they believe that by ſo doing they will get it: yet they will be at no tolerable pains for <hi>the eternal weight of glory:</hi> why, but becauſe they do not believe the word of promiſe? Heb. iv. 1, 2. If ye believe the threatnings, how is it that you live in your ſins, live out of Chriſt, and yet hope for mercy? Do ſuch believe God to be the holy and juſt One, who <hi>will by no means clear the guilty?</hi> No, no, none believe, <hi>None</hi> (or next to none) <hi>believe what a juſt GOD the LORD is, and how ſeverely he puniſheth.</hi>

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is in the mind of man a natural <hi>proneneſs to lies and falſhood,</hi> which make for the ſafety of luſts. <hi>They go aſtray as ſoon as they be born, ſpeaking lies,</hi> Pſal. lvii. 3. We have this with the reſt of the corruption of our nature, from our firſt parents. God revealed the truth to them; but through the ſolicitation of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they firſt doubted of it; they diſbelieved it, and embraced a lie inſtead of it. And for an unconteſtible evidence hereof, we may ſee that firſt article of the devil's creed, <hi>ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> Gen. iii. 4. which was obtruded by him on our firſt parents, and by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; naturally embraced by their poſterity, and held faſt, till a light from heaven oblige them to quit it. It ſpreads itſelf through the lives of natural men; who, till their conſciences be awakened, walk after their own luſts: ſtill retaining the principle, <hi>That they ſhall not ſurely die.</hi> And this is often improved to that perfection, that the man can ſay, over the belly of the denounced curſe, <hi>I ſhall have peace, tho' I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thirſt,</hi> Deut. xxix. 19. Whatever advantage the truths of God have over error, by means of education, or otherwiſe; error has always, with the natural man, this advantge againſt truth, namely, That there is ſomething within him, which ſays, <hi>O that it were true;</hi> ſo that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> mind lies fair for aſſenting to it. And here is the reaſon of it. The true doctrine is, <hi>the doctrine that is according to godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim vi. 3. and <hi>the truth which is after godlineſs,</hi> Tit. i, 1. Error, is the doctrine which is according to ungodlineſs; for there is never an error in the mind, nor an untruth vented in the world, (in matters of religion) but what has an affinity with one corruption of the heart or other: according to that of the apoſtle, 2 Theſſ ii. 21 <hi>They believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> So that truth and error being otherwiſe attended with equal advantages for their reception, error, by this means, has moſt ready acceſs into the minds
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:045042_0054_101F7D1FF84BFCC0"/>
of men in their natural ſtate. Wherefore, it is nothing ſtrange that men reject the ſimplicity of goſpel truths and inſtitutions, and greedily embrace error and external pomp in religion; ſeeing they are ſo agreeable to the luſts of the heart, and the vanity of the mind of the natural man. And from hence alſo it is, that ſo many embrace atheiſtical principles; for none do it but in compliance with their irregular paſſions: none but theſe, whoſe advantage it would be that there was no God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Man is naturally high minded; for when the goſpel comes in power to him, it is employed in <hi>caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itſelf againſt the knowledge of God,</hi> 2 Cor x. 5. Lowlineſs of mind is not a flower that grows in the field of nature; but is planted by the finger of God in a renewed heart, and learned of the lowly Jeſus. It is natural to man to think highly of himſelf, and what is his own; for the ſtroke he has got by his fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> has produced a falſe light, whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

His ways is right becauſe it is his own: for <hi>every way of a man is right in his own eyes,</hi> Prov. xxi. 2. His ſtate is good, becauſe he knows no better: he is alive without the law, Rom. vii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is another tower of <hi>Babel</hi> reared up againſt heaven; and ſhall not fall while the power of darkneſs can hold it up. The word batters it, yet it ſtands; one while breaches are made in it, but they are quickly repaired; at another time, it is all made to ſhake; but ſtill it keeps up; till either God himſelf, by his Spirit, raiſe an heart-quake within the man, which tumbles it down; and leaves not one ſtone upon another, (2 Cor. x. 41, 45.) or death batter it down and raze the foundations of it, Luke xvi. 23. And as the natural man thinks highly of himſelf, ſo he thinks meanly of God, whatever he pretends, Pſal. l. 21. <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch an one as thyſelf.</hi> The doctrine of the goſpel, and the myſtery of Chriſt are fooliſhneſs to him; and in his practice he treats them as ſuch, 1 Cor. i. 13. and ii. 14. He brings the word and the works of God in the government of the world, before the bar of his carnal reaſon; and there they are preſumptuouſly cenſured and condemned, Hoſ. xiv. 9. Sometimes the ordinary reſtraint of providence is taken off, and <hi>Satan</hi> is permitted to ſtir up the carnal mind; and in that caſe it is like an ant's ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However ſome do magnify the power of free-will, a view of the ſpirituality of the law, to which acts of moral diſcipline do in no ways anſwer; and a deep inſight into the corruption of nature, given by the inward operation of the Spirit, convincing of ſin, righteouſneſs and judgment, would make men find an abſolute need of the power of free-grace, to remove the bands of wickedneſs from off the free-will. To open up this plague of the heart, I offer theſe following things to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is, in the unrenewed <hi>will,</hi> an utter inability for what is truly good and acceptable in the ſight of God: The natural man's <hi>will</hi> is in <hi>Satan</hi>'s fetters; hemmed in, within the circle of evil, and cannot move beyond it, more than a dead man can raiſe himſelf out of his grave, Eph. ii. 1. We deny him not a power to chuſe, purſue and act, what, on the matter, is good: but though he can <hi>will</hi> what is good and right, he can <hi>will</hi> nothing aright and well. John xv. 5. <hi>Without me,</hi> i. e ſeparate from me, as a branch from the ſtock, (as both the word and context do carry it) <hi>ye can do nothing;</hi> to wit, nothing truly and ſpiritually good His very choice and deſire of ſpiritual things is carnal and ſelfiſh, John vi. 26. <hi>Ye ſeek me becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</hi> He not only comes to Chriſt, but he cannot come. John vi. 44. And what can one do acceptable to God, who believeth not on him whom the Father hath ſent? To evidence this inability for good in the unregenerate, conſider theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. How often does the light ſo ſhine before men's eyes: that they cannot but ſee the good they ſhould chuſe, and the evil they ſhould refuſe; and yet their hearts have no more power to comply with that light than if they were arreſted by ſome inviſible hand? They ſee what is right; yet they follow, and cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

follow, what is wrong. Their conſciences tells them the right way, and approves of it too; yet cannot their <hi>will</hi> be brought up to it: their corruption ſo chains them, that they cannot embrace it; ſo they ſigh, and go backward, over the belly of their light. And if it be not thus, how is it that the word, and way of holineſs meets with ſuch entertainment in the world? How is it that clear arguments and reaſon on the ſide of piety and a holy life, which bear in themſelves even on the carnal mind, do not bring men over to that ſide? Altho' the being of a heaven and a hell, were but a <hi>may be,</hi> it were ſufficient to determine the will to the choice of holineſs, were it capable to be determined thereto by mere reaſon: but men, knowing the judgment of God, (that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death) not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them, Rom. i 32. And how is it that theſe who magnify the power of free-will do not confirm their opinion before the world, by an ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, in a practice as far above others in holineſs, as the opinion of their natural ability is above others? Or is it maintained only for the protection of luſts, which men may hold faſt as long as they pleaſe; and when they have no more uſe for them, can throw them off in a moment, and leap out of <hi>Delilah</hi>'s lap into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever uſe ſome make of that principle: it does of itſelf, and in its own nature, caſt a broad ſhadow for a ſhelter to wickedneſs of heart and life. And it may be obſerved, that the generality of the hearers of the goſpel, of all denominations are plagued with it: for it is a root of bitterneſs, natural to all men; from whence do ſpring ſo much fearleſſneſs about the ſoul's eternal ſtate; ſo many delays and off-puts in that weighty matter, whereby much work is laid up for a death-bed by ſome; while others are ruined by a legal walk, and unacquainted with the life of faith, and the making uſe of Chriſt for ſanctification; all flowing from the perſuaſion of ſufficient natural abilities. So agreeable is it to corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 2. Let thoſe, who, by the power of the ſpirit of bondage, having had the law laid out before them, in its ſpirituality, for their conviction ſpeak and tell, if they found themſelves able to incline their hearts towards it, in that caſe; nay, if the more that light ſhone into their ſouls, they did not find their hearts more and more unable to comply with it. There are ſome, who have been brought unto the place of the breaking forth, who are yet in the devil's camp, that from their experience can tell, light let into the mind, cannot give life to the will, to enable it to comply therewith: and could give their teſtimony here, if they would. But take <hi>Paul</hi>'s teſtimony concerning it, who, in his unconverted ſtate, was far from believing his utter inability for good; but learned it by experience, Rom. vi.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. I own, the natural man may have a kind of love to the law: but here lies the ſtreſs of the matter, he looks on the holy law in a carnal dreſs: and ſo, while he hugs a creature of his own fancy, he thinks he has the law, but in very deed he is without the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:045042_0057_101F7D2BAF9F0270"/>
law: for as yet he ſees it not in its ſpirituality: if he did, he would find it the very reverſe of his own nature, and what his will could not fall in with, till changed by the power of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is in the unrenewed <hi>will</hi> an averſeneſs to good. Sin is the natural man's element; he is loath to part with it, as the fiſhes are to come out of the water into dry land. He not only cannot come to Chriſt, but he will not come, John v. 40. He is polluted, and hates to be waſhen, Jer. xiii. 27 <hi>Wilt thou not be made clean? When ſhall it once be?</hi> He is ſick, but utterly averſe to the remedy: he loves his diſeaſe ſo, that he loaths the Phyſician. He is a captive, a priſoner, and a ſlave; but he loves his conqueror, his jailor and maſter: he is fond of his fetters, priſon and drudgery; and has no liking to his liberty. For evidence of this averſeneſs to good, in the will of man, I ſhall inſtance in ſome particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. The untowardneſs of children. Do we not ſee them naturally, lovers of ſinful liberty! How unwilling are they to be hedged in? How averſe to reſtraint? The world can bear witneſs, that they are, <hi>as bullocks unaccuſtomed to the yoke;</hi> and more, that it is far eaſier to bring young bullocks tamely to bear the yoke; than to bring young children under diſcipline, and make them tamely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the reſtraint of ſinful liberty. Every body may ſee in this, as in a glaſs, that man is naturally wild and wilful, according to <hi>Zophar</hi>'s obſerve, Job xi. 12. that <hi>man is born like a wild aſs</hi>'s <hi>colt.</hi> What can be ſaid more? He is like a colt, the colt of an aſs, the colt of a wild aſs Compare Jer. ii. 24. <hi>A wild aſs uſed to the wilderneſs, that ſnuffeth up the wind at her pleaſure, in her occaſion who can turn her away?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 2. What pain and difficulty do men often find in bringing their hearts to religious duties? And what a taſk is it to the carnal heart to abide at them? It is a pain to it, to leave the world but a little, to converſe with God. It is not eaſy to borrow time from the many things, to beſtow it upon the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> Men often go to God in duties, with their faces towards the world; and when their bodies are on the mount of ordinances, their hearts will be found at the foot of the hill, <hi>going after their covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 31. They are ſoon wearied of well-doing; for holy duties are not agreeable to their corrupt nature. Take notice of them at their worldly buſineſs, ſet them down with their carnal company, or let them be ſucking the breaſts of a luſt; time ſeems to them to fly, and drive furiouſly, ſo that it is gone ere they are aware. But how heavily does it drive, while a prayer, a ſermon, or a ſabbath laſts? The Lord's day is the longeſt day of all the week with many; and therefore they muſt ſleep longer that morning, and go ſooner to bed that night, than ordinarily they do; that the day may be made of a tolerable length: for their hearts ſay within them, <hi>when will the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

grace nor the good manners to ſtay till the bleſſing be pronounced, but like the beaſts, their head is away as ſoon as one puts his hand to looſe them; why, but becauſe while they are at ordinances, they are, as Doeg, <hi>detained before the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. xxii. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 3. Conſider how the <hi>will</hi> of the natural man doth <hi>rebel againſt the light,</hi> Job xxiv. 13. Light ſometimes entreth in, becauſe he is not able to hold it out: but he loveth darkneſs rather than light. Sometimes by the force of truth, the outer door of underſtanding is broken up; but the inner door of the <hi>will</hi> remains faſt bolted. Then luſts riſe againſt light; corruption and conſcience encounter, and fight as in the field of battle; till corruption getting the upper hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is forced to give back: convictions are murdered: and truth is made and held priſoner, ſo that it can create no more diſturbance. While the word is preached or read, or the rod of God is upon the natural man, ſometimes convictions are darted in on him, and his ſpirit is wounded, in greater or leſſer meaſure: but theſe convictions not being able to make him fall, he runs away with the arrows ſticking in his conſcience; and at length, one way or other, gets them out, and licks himſelf whole again. Thus, while the light ſhines, men, naturally averſe to it, wilfully ſhut their eyes; till God is provoked to blind them judicially, and they become proof againſt the, word and providences too: ſo they may go where they will, they can ſit at eaſe; there is never a word from heaven to them, that goeth deeper than into their ears, Hoſ iv. 17. <hi>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 4. Let us obſerve the reſiſtance made by elect ſouls, when the Spirit of the Lord is at work, to bring them from <hi>the power of Satan unto God. Zion</hi>'s King gets no ſubjects but by ſtroke of ſword, <hi>in the day of his power,</hi> Pſal. cx. 2, 3. None come to him, but ſuch as are drawn by a divine hand, John vi. 44. When the Lord comes to the ſoul, he finds the ſtrong man keeping the houſe, and a deep peace and ſecurity there, while the ſoul is faſt aſleep in the devil's arms. But <hi>the prey muſt be taken from the mighty, and the captive delivered.</hi> Therefore the Lord awakens the ſinner, opens his eyes, and ſtrikes him with terror, while the clouds are black above his head, and the ſword of vengeance is held to his breaſt. Now he is at no ſmall pains to put a fair face on a black heart; to ſhake off his fears, to make head againſt them, and to divert himſelf from thinking on the unpleaſant and ungrateful ſubject of his ſoul's caſe. If he cannot ſo rid himſelf from them, carnal reaſon is called in to help, and urgeth that there is no ground for ſo great fear; all may be well enough yet: and if it be ill with him, it will be ill with many. When the ſinner is beat from this, and ſees no advantage of going to hell with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſcience ſays, <hi>To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts:</hi> but he cries, <hi>To-morrow, Lord, to-morrow, Lord;</hi> and <hi>juſt now Lord,</hi> till that now is never like to come. And thus, many times, he comes from
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:045042_0059_101F7D2F49A9C528"/>
his prayers and confeſſions, with nothing, but a breaſt full of ſharper convictions; for the heart doth not always caſt up the ſweet morſel, as ſoon as confeſſion is made with the mouth, Judges x. 10.—16. And when conſcience obligeth them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, when he is ſo preſſed, that he muſt needs ſay before the Lord, that he is content to part with all his idols; the heart will be giving the tongue the lie. In a word, the ſoul, in this caſe, will ſhift from one thing to another; like a fish with the hook in his jaws, till it can do no more, and power come to make it ſuccumb, as <hi>the wild aſs in her month,</hi> Jer. ii. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is in the will of man a natural proneneſs to evil, a woful bent towards ſin. Men naturally are <hi>bent to backſliding from God,</hi> Hoſ. ii 7. They hang (as the word is) towards backſliding; even as a hanging wall, whoſe <hi>breaking cometh ſuddenly at an inſtant.</hi> Set holineſs and life upon the one ſide, ſin and death upon the other; leave the unrenewed will to itſelf, it will chuſe ſin, and reject holineſs. This is no more to be doubted, than that water, poured on the ſide of a hill, will run downward but not upward, or that a flame will aſcend and not deſcend.</p>

Not that the rod of itſelf will do this: the ſad experience of many parents teſtifies the contrary: and <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf tells you, Prov. xxvii. 22. <hi>Though thou ſhouldſt bray a fool in a mortar, among wheat, with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from him.</hi> It is ſo bound in his heart.

I own indeed, that while the natural man looks on God as the Creator and Preſerver of the world; becauſe he loves his own ſelf, therefore his heart riſeth not againſt the being of his Benefactor: but this enmity will quickly appear, when he looks on God, as the Rector and Judge of the world, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, under the pain of the curſe, to exact holineſs, and girding him with the cords of death, becauſe of his ſin.

God has made our Maſter <hi>heir of all things,</hi> and we are ſent to court a ſpouſe for him. There is none ſo worthy as he; none more unworthy than they to whom this match is promiſed; but the prince of darkneſs is preferred before the Prince of Peace. A diſmal darkneſs overclouded the world by <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, more terrible than if the ſun, moon and ſtars had been for ever wrapt up in blackneſs of darkneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yet we fly like night owls from it; and like the wild beaſts, lay ourſelves down in our dens; when the ſun ariſeth, we are ſtruck blind with the light thereof; and, as creatures of darkneſs, love darkneſs rather than light. Such is the enmity of the hearts of men againſt Chriſt, in his prophetical office.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The natural man is an enemy to Chriſt in his prieſtly office. He is appointed of the Father <hi>a Prieſt for ever:</hi> that, by his alone ſacrifice and interceſſion, ſinners may have peace with, and acceſs to God; but Chriſt crucified is a ſtumbling block, and fooliſhneſs to the unrenewed part of mankind, to whom he is preached, 1 Cor. i 23. They are not for him, as the <hi>new and living way.</hi> Nor is he by the voice of the world, <hi>an High Prieſt over the houſe of God.</hi> Corrupt nature goes quite another way to work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. None of <hi>Adam</hi>'s children naturally incline to receive the bleſſing in borrowed robes; but would always, according to the ſpider's motto, <hi>owe all to themſelves;</hi> and ſo climb up to heaven on a thread ſpun out of their own bowels. For they <hi>deſire to be under the law,</hi> Gal. iv. 24. And <hi>go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. x. 3. Man, naturally, looks on GOD as a great Maſter; and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:045042_0067_101F7D4AACC94178"/>
himſelf as his ſervant, that muſt work and win heaven as his wages. Hence, when conſcience is awakened, he thinks that, to the end he may be ſaved, he muſt anſwer the demands of the law; ſerve God <hi>as well as he can,</hi> and pray for mercy wherein he comes ſhort. And thus many come to duties, that never come out of them to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 2. As men, naturally, think highly of their duties, that ſeem to them, to be well done; ſo they look for acceptance with God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <hi>as their work is done,</hi> not <hi>according to the ſhare they have in the blood of Chriſt. Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 3. The natural man going to God, in duties, will always be found, either to go without a mediator, or with more than the only Mediator JESUS CHRIST. Nature is blind, and therefore venturous: it ſets a man a going immediately to God without Chriſt; to ruſh into his preſence, and put their petitions in his hand, without being introduced by the Secretary of heaven, or putting their requeſts into his hand. So fixed is this diſpoſition in the unrenewed heart, that when many hearers of the goſpel are converſed with upon the point of their hopes of ſalvation, the name of Chriſt will ſcarcely be heard from their mouths. Aſk them how they think to obtain the pardon of ſin? they will tell you, they beg and look for mercy, becauſe God is a merciful God; and that is all they have to confide in. Others look for mercy for Chriſt's ſake; but how do they know that Chriſt will take their plea in hand. Why, as the Papiſts have their mediators with the Mediator, ſo have they. They know he cannot but do it; for they pray, confeſs, mourn, and have great deſires, and the like; and ſo have ſomething of their own to commend them unto him: they were never made poor in ſpirit, and brought empty-handed to Chriſt, to lay the ſtreſs of all on his atoning blood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The natural man is an enemy to Chriſt in his kingly office. The Father has appointed the Mediator King in Zion, Pſal. ii. 6. And all to whom the goſpel comes, are commanded, on their higheſt peril, to <hi>kiſs the Son,</hi> and ſubmit themſelves unto him, ver. 12. But the natural voice of mankind is, <hi>Away with him;</hi> as you may ſee, ver. 2, 3. They will not have him to reign over them, Luke xix. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. The workings of corrupt nature to wreſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of his hands. No ſooner was he born, but being <hi>born a King,</hi> Herod perſecuted him, Matth. ii. And when he was crucified, they ſet up over his head his accuſation written, <hi>This is Jeſus, the King of the Jews,</hi> Matth. xxvii. 37. Though his kingdom be a ſpiritual kingdom, and not of this world; yet they cannot allow him a kingdom within a kingdom, which acknowledgeth no other head or ſupreme, but the royal Mediator. They make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> with his royal prerogatives, changing his laws, inſtitutions and ordinances, modelling his worſhip according to the devices of their own hearts; introducing new offices
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:045042_0068_101F7D4CC9A2B878"/>
and officers into his kingdom, not to be found in <hi>the book of the manner</hi> of his kingdom, diſpoſing of the external government thereof, as may beſt ſuit their carnal deſigns. Such is the enmity of the hearts of men againſt Zion's KING.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid</hi> 2 How unwilling are men, naturally to ſubmit unto, and be hedged in by the laws and diſcipline of his Kingdom! As a King, he is a Law-giver, (Iſa. xxxiii 22.) and has appointed an external government, diſcipline and cenſors, to controul the unruly, and to keep his profeſſed ſubjects in order, to be exerciſed by officers of his own appointment, Matth. xviii. 17, 18 1 Cor. xii. 28. 1 Tim. v. 17. Heb. xiii 17. But theſe are the great eye-ſores of the carnal world, who love ſinful liberty, and therefore cry out, <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us,</hi> Pſal. ii. 3. Hence this work is found to be, in a ſpecial manner, a ſtriving againſt the ſtream of corrupt nature, which, for the moſt part, puts ſuch a face on the church, as if there were <hi>no King in Iſrael,</hi> every one doing that which is <hi>right in his own eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evid.</hi> 3. However natural men may be brought to feign ſubmiſſion to the King of ſaints, yet luſts always retain the throne and dominion in their hearts, and they are ſerving <hi>divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. iii. 3. None but theſe in whom Chriſt is formed, do really put the crown on his head, and receive the kingdom of Chriſt within them. His crown is <hi>the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his eſpouſals.</hi> Who are they, whom the power of grace has not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, that will allow him to ſet up, and to put down, in their ſouls, as he will? Nay, as for others, any lord ſhall ſooner get the rule over them, than <hi>the Lord of glory:</hi> they kindly entertain his enemies, and will never abſolutely reſign themſelves to his government, till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered in a day of power. Thus ye may ſee that the natural man is an enemy to Jeſus Chriſt in all his offices.</p>
                  <p>But O! how hard is it to convince men in this point! They are very loth to take with it. And in a ſpecial manner, the enmity of the heart againſt Chriſt in his prieſtly office, ſeems to be hid from the view of moſt of the hearers of the goſpel. Yet there appears to be a peculiar malignity in corrupt nature againſt that office of his. It may be obſerved, that the <hi>Socinians,</hi> theſe enemies of our bleſſed Lord, allow him to be properly a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>King,</hi> but deny him to be properly a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And this is agreeable enough to the corruption of our nature; for under the covenant of works, the Lord was known as a <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> and alſo as a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Ruler;</hi> but not at all as a <hi>Prieſt:</hi> ſo man knows nothing of the myſtery of Chriſt, as <hi>the way to the Father,</hi> till it be revealed to him. And when it is revealed, the will riſeth up againſt it; for corrupt nature lies croſs to the myſtery of Chriſt, and the great contrivance of ſalvation, through a crucified Saviour, revealed in the goſpel. For clearing of which weighty truth, let theſe four things be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="unknown:045042_0069_101F7D4EF0AA4468"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſoul's falling in with the grand device of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſetting the matters of ſalvation on that footing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, is declared by the ſcriptures of truth to be an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mark of a real ſaint, who is happy here, and ſhall be happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Matth. xi. 6. <hi>And bleſſed is he, whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> 1 Cor. i. 23, 24. <hi>But we preach Chriſt crucified, unto the Jews a ſtumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooliſhneſs: but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt, the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> Philip iii. 3. <hi>For we are the circumciſion which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh.</hi> Now how could this be, if nature could comply with that grand device.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Corrupt nature is the very reverſe of the goſpel contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In the goſpel, God promiſeth Jeſus Chriſt as the great means of re-uniting man to himſelf: he has named him as the Mediator, one <hi>in whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> and will have none but him, Matth. xvii. 5. But nature <hi>will have none of him,</hi> Pſal lxxxi. 11 God appointed the place of meeting for the reconciliation, namely, <hi>the fleſh of Chriſt;</hi> accordingly, <hi>God was in Chriſt,</hi> (2 Cor. v. 29.) as the tabernacle of meeting, to make up the peace with ſinners; but natural men, tho' they ſhould die for ever, will not come thither John v. 40. <hi>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi> In the way of the goſpel, the ſinner muſt ſtand before the Lord in an imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>d righteouſneſs: but corrupt nature is for an inherent righteouſneſs: and therefore, ſo far as natural men follow after righteouſneſs, they follow after the law of righteouſneſs, Rom. ix 31, 32. and not after <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> Nature is always for building up itſelf, and to have ſome grounds for boaſting: but the great deſign of the goſpel is to exalt grace, to depreſs nature, and exclude boaſting, Rom. iii 27. The ſum of our natural religion is, to do good from and for ourſelves, John v. 44. The ſum of the goſpel religion is, to deny ourſelves and to do good from and for Chriſt, Philip i. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Every thing in nature is againſt believing in Jeſus Chriſt. What beauty can the blind man diſcern in a crucified Saviour, for which he is to be deſired? How can the will, naturally impotent, yea and averſe to good, make choice of him? Well may the ſoul then ſay to him in the day of the ſpiritual ſiege, as the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou ſhalt not come in hither,</hi> 2 Sam. v. 6. The way of nature is to go into one's ſelf for all; according to the fundamental maxim of unſanctified morality, <hi>That a man ſhould truſt in himſelf;</hi> which according to the doctrine of faith, is mere fooliſhneſs; for ſo it is determined, Prov. xviii. 26. <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart is a fool.</hi> Now faith is the ſoul's going out of itſelf for all: and this nature, on the other hand, determines to be fooliſhneſs, 1 Cor. i. 18, 23. Wherefore there is need of the working of mighty power, to cauſe ſinners to believe, Eph. i. 19. Iſa. liii. 1. We ſee promiſes of welcome to ſinners, in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:045042_0070_101F7D53AEDC79A8"/>
the goſpel-covenant, are ample, large and free, clogg'd with no conditions, Iſa. lv. 1. Rev. xxii. 17. If they cannot believe his bare word, he has given them his oath upon it, Ezek. xxxiii. 11. And for their greater aſſurance, he has appended ſeals to his ſworn covenant, namely, the holy ſacraments. So that no more could be demanded of the moſt faithleſs perſon in the world, to make us believe him, than the Lord hath condeſcended to give us, to make us believe himſelf. This plainly ſpeaks nature to be againſt believing, and theſe who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lee to Chriſt for refuge, to have need of ſtrong conſolation. (Heb vi. 18.) to blame their ſtrong doubts, and propenſity to unbelief. Farther, alſo it may be obſerved, how, in the word ſent to a ſecure, graceleſs generation, their objections are anſwered aforehand; and words of grace are heaped one upon another, as ye may read, Iſa. lv. 7, 8, 9. Joel ii. 13. Why? Becauſe the Lord knows, that when theſe ſecure ſinners are throughly wakned, doubts, fears, and carnal reaſonings againſt believing, will be going within their breaſts, as thick as duſt in a houſe, raiſed by ſweeping a dry floor.</p>

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>rupt nature is bent towards the way of the law, or covenant of works; and every natural man, ſo far as he ſets himſelf to ſeek after ſalvation, is engaged in that way; and will not quit it, till beat from it by divine power. Now the way of ſalvation by works, and that of free grace in Jeſus Chriſt, are inconſiſtent, Rom. xi. 6. <hi>And if by grace; then it is no more of works; otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe work is no more work.</hi> Gal. iii. 13. <hi>And the law is not of FAITH; but the man that DOTH them ſhall live in them</hi> Wherefore, if the will of man naturally incline to the way of ſalvation by the law; it lies croſs to the goſpel contrivance.

This ſhines through the whole hiſtory of the Bible: but as true as it is, this has been the point principally oppoſed by corrupt nature. One may well ſay, that of all errors in religion, ſince Chriſt, the Seed of the woman was preached, this of works, in oppoſition to free grace in him, was the firſt that lived; and it is likely to be the laſt that dies. There have been vaſt numbers of errors, which ſprung up one after another, whereof, at length, the world became aſhamed and weary; ſo that they died out. But this has continued, from <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt author of this hereſy, unto this day; and never wanted ſome that clave to it, even in the times of greateſt light.

And ſo he wrote his indignation againſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and acceptance with God, through faith, in oppoſition to works, in the blood of his brother, to convey it down to peſterity. And ſince that time, the unbloody ſacrifice has often ſwimmed in the blood of thoſe that rejected it.

of the pureſt liquor put into it, ſo the natural man turns the very goſpel into law; and transforms the covenant of grace into a covenant of works The ceremonial law was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a real goſpel; which held blood, death, and tranſlation of guilt before their eyes continually, as the only way of ſalvation: yet their very table (<hi>i e.</hi> their altar, with the ſeveral ordinances pertaining thereto, Mal i. 12) was <hi>a ſnare unto them,</hi> Rom. ii. 9. while they uſe it to make up the defects in their obedience to the moral law, and clave to it ſo, as to reject him whom the altar and ſacrifices pointed them to, as the ſubſtance of all: even as <hi>Hagar,</hi> whoſe it was only to ſerve, was by their father brought into her miſtreſs's bed; nor without a myſtery in the purpoſe of God, <hi>for theſe are the two covenants,</hi> Gal. iv. 24. Thus is the doctrine of the goſpel corrupted by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and other enemies to the doctrine of free grace. And indeed, however natural men's heads may be ſet right in this point; as ſurely as they are out of Chriſt, their faith, repentance and obedience, (ſuch as they are) are placed by them in the room of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs; and ſo truſted to, as if by theſe they fulfilled a new law</p>

What a ſtruggle, as for life, will be in the heart ere they be got parted? I may have occaſion to touch upon this afterwards. In the mean time, take the Apoſtle's ſhort, but pithy deſcription of it, Rom x. 3 <hi>For they being ignorant of God</hi>'s <hi>righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> They go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like an eager diſputant in ſchools, ſeeking to eſtabliſh the point in queſtion: or like a tormentor, extorting a confeſſion from one upon the rack.

all this pains about a tottering righteouſneſs? Becauſe, ſuch as it is, it is their own. What ails them at Chriſt's righteouſneſs? Why, that would make them free grace's debtors for all; and that is what the proud heart by no means can ſubmit t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">(2) It is a violent death, Rom vii 4 <hi>Ye are become dead to the law,</hi> being killed, ſlain, or put to death, as the word bears. The law itſelf has a great hand in this; the huſband gives the wound, Gal ii. 19. <hi>I though the law am dead to the law.</hi> The ſoul that dies this death, is like a loving wife matched with a rigorous huſband: ſhe does what ſhe can to pleaſe him, yet he is never pleaſed; but toſſeth, haraſſeth, and beats her, till ſhe break her heart, and death ſets her free; as will afterwards more fully appear. Thus it is made evident, that men's hearts are naturally bent to the way of the law, and ly croſs to the goſpel contrivance: and the ſecond article of the charge, againſt you that are unregenerate, is verified, namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye are enemies <hi>to the Son of God.</hi>

This is the caſe of all men in their natural ſtate, Pſal. xiv. 2, 3. <hi>The Lord looked down—to ſee if there were any that did—ſeek God.

They are <hi>lovers of their ownſelves,</hi> (2 Tim. iii. 2.) <hi>more than God,</hi> verſe 4. Wherefore, Jeſus Chriſt having come into the world, to bring men back to God again, came to bring them out of themſelves in the firſt place, Matth. xvi. 25. The godly groan under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of this woful diſpoſition of the heart: they acknowledge it, and ſet themſelves againſt it, in its ſubtile and dangerous inſinuations. The unregenerate, tho' moſt inſenſible of it, are under the power thereof; and whitherſoever they turn themſelves, they cannot move without the circle of ſelf: they ſeek themſelves, they act for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; their natural, civil and religious actions, from whatever ſpring they come, do all run into, and meet in, the dead ſea of ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Moſt men are ſo far from making God their chief end, in their natural and civil actions; that in theſe matters, God is not in all their thoughts. Their eating and drinking, and ſuch like natural actions, are for themſelves; their own pleaſure or neceſſity, without any higher end: Zech vii. 6. <hi>Did ye not eat for yourſelves?</hi> They have no eye to the glory of God in theſe things, as they ought to have, 1 Cor. x. 31. They do not eat and drink, to keep up their bodies for the Lord's ſervice; they do them not, becauſe God has ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> neither do theſe <hi>drops of ſweetneſs</hi> God has put into the creature, raiſe up their ſouls towards that ocean of delight that is in the Creator, tho' they are indeed a ſign hung out at heaven's door, to tell men of the fulneſs of goodneſs that's in God himſelf, Acts xiv. 16. But it is ſelf, and not God, that is ſought in them by natural men.

Their eyes are held, that they ſee not the glory of God They ſeek God indeed, but not for himſelf, but for themſelves They ſeek him not at all, but for their own welfare: ſo their whole life is woven into one web of practical blaſphemy; making God the means, and ſelf their end, yea, their chief end.</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Conſcience</hi> is corrupt and defiled, Tit i. 15. It is an evil eye, that fills one's converſation with much darkneſs and confuſion; being naturally unable to do its office; till the Lord, by letting in a new light to the ſoul, awaken the conſcience; it remains ſleepy and unactive. Conſcience can never do its work, but according to the light it hath to work by. Wherefore ſeeing the natural man cannot ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually diſcern ſpiritual things, (1 Cor. ii. 14.) the conſcience naturally is quite uſeleſs in that point: being caſt into ſuch a deep ſleep, that nothing but a ſaving illuminations from the Lord, can ſet it on work in that matter. The light of the natural conſcience in good and evil, ſin and duty, is very defective; therefore tho' it may check for groſſer ſins; yet as to the more ſubtile workings of ſin, it cannot check for them, becauſe it diſcerns them not. Thus conſcience will fly in the face of many, if at any time they be drunk, ſwear, neglect prayer, or be guilty of any groſs ſin; who otherwiſe have a profound peace; tho' they live in the ſin of unbelief, are ſtrangers to ſpiritual worſhip, and the life of faith. And natural light being but faint and languiſhing in many things which it doth reach, conſcience in that caſe ſhoots like a ſtitch in one's ſide, which quickly goes off; its incitements to duty, and checks for and ſtruggles againſt ſin, are very remiſs, which the natural man eaſily gets over. But becauſe there is a falſe light in the dark mind, the natural conſcience following the ſame will call <hi>evil good, and good evil,</hi> Iſa. v. 20. And ſo it is often found like a blind and furious horſe, which doth violently run down himſelf, his rider, and all that doth come in his way, John xvi. 2. <hi>Whoſoever kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Even the <hi>Memory</hi> bears evident marks of this corruption. What is good and worthy to be minded, as it makes but ſlender im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſo that impreſſion eaſily wears off; the memory, as a leaking veſſel, lets it ſlip, Heb. ii. 1. As a ſieve that is full, when in the water, lets all go when it is taken out; ſo is the memory, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſpiritual things. But how does it retain what ought to be forgotten? Naughty things ſo bear in themſelves upon it, that though men would fain have them out of mind, yet they ſtick there like giue. However forgetful men be in in other things, it is hard to forget an injury. So the memory often furniſhes new fuel to old luſts; makes men in old age to re-act the ſins of their youth, while it preſents them again to the mind with delight, which thereupon licks up the former vomit. And thus it is like the riddle, that lets through the pure grain, and keeps the refuſe. Thus far of the corruption of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Body</hi> itſelf alſo is partaker of this corruption and defilement, ſo far as it is capable thereof. Wherefore the Scripture calls it <hi>ſinful fleſh,</hi> Rom. viii. 3. We may take this up in two things. (1.) The natural temper, or rather diſtemper of the bodies of <hi>Adam</hi>'s children, as it is an effect of original ſin; ſo it hath a native tendency to ſin, incites to ſin, leads the ſoul into ſnares, yea, is itſelf a ſnare to the ſoul. The body is a furious beaſt, of ſuch metal, that if it be not beat down, kept under, and brought into ſubjection, it will caſt the ſoul into much ſin and miſery, 1 Cor. ix. 27. There's a vileneſs in the body, (Phil. iii. 21.) which, as to the ſaints, will never be removed, until it be melted down in a grave, and caſt into a new mould, at the reſurrection to come forth a ſpiritual body: and will never be carried off from the bodies of thoſe, who are not partakers of the reſurrection to life. (2.) It ſerves the ſoul in many ſins. Its members are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or weapons of unrighteouſneſs, whereby men fight againſt God, Rom. vi. 13. The eyes and ears are open doors, by which impure motions and ſinful deſires enter the ſoul; <hi>the tongue is a world of iniquity;</hi> James iii. 6. <hi>an unruly evil, full of deadly poiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n,</hi> ver. 8. By it the impure heart vents a great deal of its filthineſs. <hi>The throat is an open ſepulchre,</hi> Rom. iii. 13. The feet run the devil's errands, ver. 15. The belly is made a god, Philip, iii. 19. Not only by drunkards and riotous livers, but by every natural man, Zech. vii. 6. So the body naturally is an agent for the devil; and a magazine of armour againſt the Lord.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, man by nature is wholly corrupted: <hi>From the ſole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no ſoundneſs in him.</hi> And as in a dunghill, every part contributes to the corruption of the whole; ſo the natural man, while in that ſtate, grows ſtill worſe and worſe. The ſoul is made worſe by the body, and the body by the ſoul: and every faculty of the ſoul ſerves to corrupt another more and more. Thus much for the ſecond general Head.</p>

                  <p>THIRDLY, I ſhall ſhew how man's nature comes to be thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The heathens perceived that man's nature was corrupted: but how ſin had entred, they could not tell. But the Scripture is very plain in that point, Rom. v. 12. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world.</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>By one man</hi>'s <hi>diſobedience, many were made ſinners. Adam</hi>'s ſin corrupted man's nature, and leavened the whole lump of mankind. We putrified in <hi>Adam,</hi> as our root. The root was poiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and ſo the branches were envenomed; the vine turned the <hi>vine of Sodom,</hi> and ſo the grapes became <hi>grapes of gall. Adam,</hi> by his ſin, became not only guilty, but corrupt; and ſo tranſmits guilt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to his poſterity, Gen. v. 3. Job xiv. 4. By his ſin he ſtript himſelf of his original righteouſneſs, and corrupted himſelf: we were in him repreſentatively, being repreſented by him, as our moral head, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His firſt ſin is imputed to us; therefore juſtly are we left under the want of his original righteouſneſs, which, being given to him as a common perſon, he caſt off, by his ſin; and this is neceſſarily followed, in him and us, by the corruption of the whole nature; righteouſneſs and corruption being two contraries, one of which muſt needs always be in man, as a ſubject capable thereof. And <hi>Adam</hi> our common father being corrupt, we are ſo too; for <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although it is ſufficient to evince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> righteouſneſs of this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that it was from the Lord, who doth all things well; yet to ſilence the murmurings of proud nature, let theſe few things further be conſidered, (1.) In the covenant wherein <hi>Adam</hi> repreſented us, eternal happineſs was promiſed to him and his poſterity upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, that is, <hi>Adam</hi>'s perfect obedience, as the repreſentative for all mankind: whereas, if there had been no covenant, they could not have pleaded eternal life, upon their moſt perfect obedience, but might have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who in that caſe would not have conſented to that repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? (2.) <hi>Adam</hi> had a power to ſtand given him, being made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. He was as capable to ſtand for himſelf, and all his poſterity, as any after him could be for themſelves. This trial of mankind, in their head, would ſoon have been over, and the crown won to them all, had he ſtood; whereas, had his poſterity been independent on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and every one left to act for himſelf, the trial would have been continually a carrying on, as men came into the world. (3.) He had natural affections the ſtrongeſt to engage him, being our common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as ours. He had no ſeparate intereſt from ours; but if he forgot ours, he behoved to have forgot ours, he behoved to have forgot his own. (5.) If he had ſtood, we ſhould have had the light of his mind, the righteouſneſs of his will, and holineſs of his affections, with entire purity tranſmitted unto us; we could not have fallen; the crown of glory, by his obedience, would have been for ever ſecured to him and his. This is evident from the nature of a federal repreſentation; and no reaſon can be given why, ſeeing we are loſt by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, we ſhould not have been ſaved by his obedience. On the other hand, it is reaſonable, that he falling, we ſhould, with him, bear the loſs. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Such as quarrel this diſpenſation, muſt renounce their part in Chriſt; for we are no otherwiſe made ſinners by <hi>Adam,</hi> than we are made righteous by Chriſt; from whom we have both imputed and inherent righteouſneſs. We no more made choice of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> for our head and repreſentative in the ſecond covenant; than we did of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt covenant.</p>
                  <p>Let none wonder that ſuch an horrible change would be brought on by one ſin of our firſt parents, for thereby they turned away from God, as their chief end, which neceſſarily infers an univerſal deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their ſin was a complication of evils, a total apoſtaſy from God, a violation of the whole law. By it they broke all the ten commands at once. (1.) They choſe new gods. They made their belly their god, by their ſenſuality: ſelf their god, by their ambition; yea, and the devil their god, believing him, and diſbelieving their Maker. (2.) Tho' they received, yet they obſerved not that ordinance of God, about the forbidden fruit. They contemned that ordinance ſo plainly enjoined them, and would needs carve out to themſelves, how to ſerve the Lord. (3.) They took the name of the Lord their God in vain: deſpiſing his attributes, his juſtice, truth, power, &amp;c. They groſly profaned that ſacramental tree; abuſed his word, by not giving credit to it; abuſed that creature of his, which they ſhould not have touched, and violently miſconſtrued his providence; as if God, by forbidding them that tree, had been ſtanding in the way of their happineſs; and therefore he ſuffered them not to eſcape his righteous judgment. (4.) They remembered not the Sabbath to keep it holy, but put themſelves out of a condition to ſerve God aright on his own day. Neither kept they that ſtate of holy reſt, wherein God had put them. (5.) They caſt off their relative duties. <hi>Eve</hi> forgets herſelf, and acts without advice of her huſband, to the ruin of both; <hi>Adam</hi> inſtead of admoniſhing her to repent, yields to the temptation, and confirms her in her wickedneſs. They forgot all duty to their poſterity. They honoured not their Father in heaven; and therefore their days were not long in the land which the Lord their God gave them. (6.) They ruined themſelves, and all their poſterity. (7.) Gave up themſelves to luxury and ſenſuality (8.) Took away what was not their own, againſt the expreſs will of the great Owner. (9.) They bore falſe witneſs, and lied againſt

the Lord, before angels, devils, and one another; in effect giving out that they were hardly dealt by, and that heaven grudged their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. (10.) They were diſcontent with their lot, and coveted an evil covetouſneſs to their houſe; which ruined both them and theirs. Thus was the image of God on man defaced all at once.</p>

Oxen cannot feed in the ſea, nor fiſhes in the fruitful fields. A ſwine brought into a palace, would get away again, to wallow in the mire. A corrupt nature tends ever to impurity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Learn from this, the nature and neceſſity of regeneration. <hi>Firſt,</hi> This diſcovers the nature of regeneration in theſe two things, (1.) It is not a partial, but a total change, tho' imperfect in this life. Thy whole nature is corrupted, and therefore the cure muſt go thro' every part. Regeneration makes not only a new head for knowledge, but a new heart, and new affections for holineſs. <hi>All things become new,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 17. If one who has received many wounds, ſhould be cured of them all, ſave one only, he might bleed to death, by that one, as well as a thouſand. So if the change go not through the whole man, it is naught. (2.) It is not a change made by human induſtry, but by the mighty power of the Spirit of God. A man muſt be <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> John iii. 5 Accidental diſeaſes may be cured by men, but theſe which are natural, not without a miracle, John ix. 22. The change wrought upon men, by good education, or forced upon them, by a natural conſcience, tho' it may paſs among men for a ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

change, it is not ſo; for our nature is corrupt, and none but the God of nature can change it. Tho' a gardiner, ingrafting a pear branch into an apple tree, may make the apple-tree bear pears; yet the art of man cannot change the nature of the apple-tree: ſo one may pin a new life to his old heart, but he can never change the heart. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This alſo ſhews the neceſſity of regeneration. It is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary in order to ſalvation, John iii. 3 <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> No unclean thing can enter the new <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but thou art wholly unclean, while in thy natural ſtate. If every member of thy body were disjointed, each joint behoved to be looſed, ere the members could be ſet aright again. This is the caſe of thy ſoul, as thou haſt heard: and therefore thou muſt be <hi>born again;</hi> elſe thou ſhalt never ſee heaven, unleſs it be far off, as the rich man in hell did. Deceive not thyſelf: no Mercy of GOD, no Blood of CHRIST will bring thee to heaven, in thy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate: for God will never open a fountain of mercy, to waſh away his own holineſs and truth: nor did Chriſt ſhed his precious <hi>blood,</hi> to blot out the truths of God, or to overturn God's meaſures about the ſalvation of ſinners. Heaven! What would you do there, that are not <hi>born again?</hi> Ye that are no ways fitting for Chriſt the head. That would be a ſtrange ſight, a holy head, and members <hi>wholly corrupt!</hi> a head full of treaſures of grace, members wherein are nothing but treaſures of wickedneſs! a head obedient to death, and heels kicking againſt heaven! Ye are no ways adapted to the ſociety above, more than beaſts for converſe with men. Thou art a hater of true holineſs: and at the firſt ſight of a ſaint there, would cry out, <hi>Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy!</hi> Nay, the unrenewed man, if it were poſſible he could go to heaven, in that ſtate, he would no otherwiſe go to it, than now he comes to the duties of holineſs, that is, leaving his heart behind him.</p>
                  <p>USE II. For <hi>Lamentation.</hi> Well may we lament thy caſe, O na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, for it is the ſaddeſt caſe one can be in, out of hell. It is time to lament for thee; for thou art dead already, dead whilſt thou liveſt; thou carrieſt about with thee a dead ſoul in a living body: and becauſe thou art dead, thou canſt not lament thy own caſe. Thou art loathſome in the ſight of God; for thou art altogether corrupt. Thou <hi>haſt no good</hi> in thee; thy ſoul is a maſs of darkneſs, rebellion, and vileneſs before the Lord. Thou thinkeſt, perhaps, that thou haſt a good heart to God, good inclinations, and good deſires: but God knows there is nothing good in thee, but <hi>every imagination of thine heart is only evil.</hi> Thou <hi>canſt do no good;</hi> thou canſt do nothing but ſin. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thou art <hi>the ſervant of ſin,</hi> Rom. vi. 17. and therefore <hi>free from righteouſneſs,</hi> ver. 20. Whatever righteouſneſs be, (poor ſoul) thou art free of it; thou doſt not, thou canſt not meddle with it. Thou art under the dominion of ſin, a dominion where righteouſneſs can have no place. Thou art a child and ſervant of the devil, tho'
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:045042_0083_101F443D01BA6DB8"/>
thou be neither wizzard nor witch: ſeeing thou art yet in the ſtate of nature, John viii. 44 <hi>Ye are of your father the devil.</hi> And to prevent any miſtake, conſider, that ſin and Satan have two ſorts of ſervants, (1.) There are ſome employed, as it were, in coarſer work: thoſe bear the devil's mark in their fore-heads, having no form of godlineſs; but are profane, groſly ignorant, mere moraliſts, not ſo much as performing the external duties of religion, but living to the view of the world; as ſons of earth, only <hi>minding earthly things,</hi> Philip. iii. 19. (2) There are ſome employed in a more refined ſort of ſervice to ſin, who carry the devil's mark in their right hand; which they can, and do hide from the view of the world. Theſe are cloſs hypocrites, who ſacrifice as much to the corrupt mind, as the other to the fleſh, Eph. ii. 3. Theſe are ruined by a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernable trade of ſin: pride, unbelief, ſelf-ſeeking, and the like, ſwarm in, and prey upon their corrupted, wholly corrupted ſouls. Both are ſervants of the ſame houſe; the latter as far as the former from righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> How is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt be able to do any good, thou whoſe nature is wholly corrupt? Can fruit grow where there is no root? Or, can there be an effect without a cauſe? <hi>Can the fig-tree bear olive berries? Either a vine figs?</hi> If thy nature be wholly corrupt, as indeed it is, all thou doſt is certainly ſo too; for no effect can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the virtue of its cauſe. <hi>Can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit?</hi> Matth. vii. 18.</p>
                  <p>Ah! What a miſerable ſpectacle is he that can do nothing but ſin? Thou art the man, whoſoever thou art, that art yet in thy natural ſtate. Hear, O ſinner, what is thy caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Innumerable ſins compaſs thee about. Mountains of guilt are lying upon thee. Floods of impurities overwhelm thee. Living luſts of all ſorts roll up and down in the dead ſea of thy ſoul; where no good can breathe, becauſe of the corruption there. Thy lips are unclean: the opening of thy mouth is as the opening of an unripe grave, full of ſtench and rottenneſs, Rom. iii. 13. <hi>Their throat is an open ſepulchre.</hi> Thy natural actions are ſin, for <hi>when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourſelves; and drink for yourſelves?</hi> Zech. vii. 6. Thy civil actions are ſin, Prov. xxi. 4. <hi>The plowing of the wicked is ſin.</hi> Thy religious actions are ſin, Prov. xv. 8. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> The thoughts and imaginations of thy heart, are only evil. A deed may be ſoon done, a word ſoon ſpoken, a thought ſwiftly paſſeth through the heart: but each of theſe is an Item in thy accounts. O ſad reckoning! as many thoughts, words, actions; as many ſins. The longer thou liveſt, thy accounts ſwell the more. Should a tear be dropt for every ſin, thine head behoved to be waters, and thine <hi>eyes a fountain of tears;</hi> for nothing but ſin comes from thee. Thy heart frames nothing but <hi>evil imaginations;</hi> there is nothing in thy life, but what is framed by thine heart; and therefore there is nothing in thy heart or life but evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="unknown:045042_0084_101F7D852077BCB0"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> All thy religion, if thou haſt any, is loſt labour; as to acceptance with God, or any ſaving effect to thyſelf. Art thou yet in thy natural ſtate? Truly then thy duties are ſins, as was juſt now hinted. Would not the beſt wine be lothſome in a <hi>veſſel wherein there is no pleaſure?</hi> So is the religion of an unregenerate man. Under the law: the garment which the fleſh of the ſacrifice was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in, tho' it touched other things, did not make them holy: but he that was unclean touching any thing, whether common or ſacred, made it unclean. Even ſo thy duties cannot make thy corrupt ſoul holy, tho' they in themſelves be good; but thy corrupt heart defiles them, and makes them unclean, Hag. ii. 12, 13, 14. Thou waſt went to divide thy works into two ſorts; ſome good, ſome evil; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u muſt count again and put them all under one head; for God writes on them all, <hi>only evil.</hi> This is lamentable: It will be no wonder to ſee thoſe beg in harveſt, who fold their hands to ſleep in ſeed time: but to be labouring with others in the ſpring, and yet have nothing to reap when the harveſt comes, is a very ſad caſe; and will be the caſe of all profeſſors living and dying in their natural ſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Thou canſt not help thyſelf. What canſt thou do to take away thy ſin, who art wholly corrupt? Nothing truly but ſin. If a natural man begin to relent, drop a tear for his ſin and reform, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the corrupt heart apprehends, at leaſt, a merit of congruity: he has done much himſelf, (he thinks) and God cannot but do more for him on that account. In the mean time he does nothing but ſin: ſo that the congruous merit is the leper that muſt be put out of the camp; the dead ſoul buried out of ſight: and the corrupt lump caſt into the pit. How canſt thou think to recover thyſelf by any thing thou canſt do? Will mud and filth waſh out filthineſs? and wilt thou purge out ſin by ſinning? <hi>Job</hi> took a potſherd to ſcrape himſelf, becauſe his hands were as full of boils as his body. This is the caſe of thy corrupt ſoul: not to be recovered but by Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe ſtrength was dried up like a potſherd, Pſal. xxii. 15. Thou art poor indeed, extremely miſerable and poor, Rev. iii. 17. Thou haſt no ſhalter but a refuge of lies; no garment for thy ſoul, but filthy rags; nothing to nouriſh it but huſks that cannot ſatisfy. More than that, thou haſt got ſuch a bruiſe in the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is not yet cured, that thou art without ſtrength, Rom. v 6. unable to do or work for thyſelf; nay, more than all this, thou canſt not ſo much as ſeek aright, but lieſt helpleſs, as an infant expoſed in the open field, Ezek. xvi. 5.</p>
                  <p>USE III. I exhort you to believe this ſad truth. Alas! it is evident, it is very little believed in the world. Few are concerned to get their corrupt converſation changed; but fewer, by far, to get their nature changed: Moſt men know not what they are, nor what ſpirits they are of: they are as the eye, which ſeeing many things, never ſees itſelf. But until ye know, every one the plague of his own heart, there is no hope of your recovery. Why will you not believe it? Ye have plain ſcripture-teſtimony for it; but you are loth to entertain

ſuch an ill opinion of yourſelves. Alas! that is the nature of your diſeaſe, Rev. iii. 17. <hi>Thou—knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Lord open their eyes to ſee it, before they die of it; and in hell lift up their eyes, and ſee what they will not ſee now.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſhut up this weighty point of the corruption of man's nature, with a few words to another doctrine from the text.</p>
                  <p>DOCTRINE <hi>God takes ſpecial notice of our natural corruption, or the ſin of our nature.</hi> This he teſtifies two ways, 1. By his word, as in the text. <hi>God ſaw—that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was enly evil continually</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See Pſal xiv. 2, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. By his works. God writes his particular notice of it, and diſpleaſure with it, as in many of his works, ſo eſpecially in theſe two:</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) In the death of the infant children of men. Many miſeries they have been expoſed to: they were drowned in the deluge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in <hi>Sodom</hi> by fire and brimſtone; they have been ſlain with the ſword, daſhed againſt the ſtones, and are ſtill dying ordinary deaths. What is the true cauſe of this? On what ground doth a holy God thus purſue them? Is it the ſin of their parents? That may be the occaſion of the Lord's raiſing the proceſs againſt them: but it muſt be their own ſin that is the ground of the ſentence paſſing on them: for <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die,</hi> ſaith God, Ezek. xviii. 4. Is it their own actual ſin? They have none. But as men do with toads and ſerpents, which they kill at firſt ſight, before they have done any hurt, becauſe of their venomous nature, ſo is it in this caſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) In the birth of the elect children of God. When the Lord is about to change their nature, he makes the ſin of their nature ly heavy on their ſpirits. When he mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2.) Untenderneſs towards thoſe that fall: Many in that caſe caſt off all bowels of Chriſtian compaſſion; for they do not <hi>conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leſt they alſo be tempted,</hi> Gal. vi. 1. Men's paſſions are often higheſt againſt the faults of others, when ſin ſleeps ſoundly in their own breaſts. Even good <hi>David,</hi> when he was at his worſt, was moſt violent againſt the faults of others. While his conſcience was aſleep under his guilt, in the matter of <hi>Uriah;</hi> the Spirit of the Lord takes notice, that his <hi>anger was greatly kindled againſt the man,</hi> in the parable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Sam xii. 5.

(3.) There are not a few, who, if they be kept from affliction in worldly things, and from groſs out-breakings in their converſation, know not what it is to have a ſad heart. If they meet with a croſs, which their proud hearts cannot ſtoop to bear, they will be ready to ſay, O to be gone: but the corruption of their nature never makes them long for heaven. Luſts ſcandalouſly breaking out at a time, will mar their peace: but the ſin of their nature never makes them a heavy heart. (4.) Delaying of repentance, in hopes to ſet about it afterwards. Many have their own appointed time for repentance and reformation: as if they were ſuch complete maſters over their luſts, that they can allow them to gather more ſtrength, and yet over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. They take up reſolutions to amend, without an eye to Jeſus Chriſt, union with him, and ſtrength from him; a plain evidence they are ſtrangers to themſelves; and ſo they are left to themſelves, and their flouriſhing reſolutions wither; for as they ſee not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſo they get not the benefit of the dew from heaven to water them.

The bias of the heart to the way of the covenant of works, is a hidden plague of the heart to many. All the difficulty they find is, in getting up their hearts to duties: they find no difficulty in getting their hearts off them, and over them to Jeſus Chriſt. How hard is it to ſtave men off from their own righteouſneſs? Yet it is very hard to convince them of their leaning to it at all. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Pride and ſelf-conceit. A view of the <hi>corruption of nature</hi> would be very humbling; and oblige him that has it, to reckon himſelf the <hi>chief of ſinners.</hi> Under the greateſt attainments and enlargements, it would be ballaſt to his heart, and <hi>hide pride from his eyes.</hi> The want of thorough humiliation, piercing to the ſin of one's nature, is the ruin of many profeſſors: for digging deep makes great difference betwixt wiſe and fooliſh builders, Luke vi. 48, 49.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I will lay before you a few things, in which ye ſhould have a ſpecial eye to the ſin of your nature. (1.) Have a ſpecial eye to it in your application to Jeſus Chriſt. Do you find any need of Chriſt, which ſends you to him as the Phyſician of ſouls? O forget not your diſeaſe when you are with the Phyſician. They never yet knew well their errand to Chriſt, that went not to him for the ſin of their nature: for his blood to take away the guilt of it, and his Spirit to break the power of it. Tho' in the bitterneſs of your ſouls, you ſhould lay before him a catalogue of your ſins of ommiſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which might reach from earth to heaven; yet if the ſin of your nature were wanting in it, aſſure yourſelves, you have forgot the beſt part of the errand a poor ſinner has to the Phyſician of ſouls. What would it have availed the people of <hi>Jericho,</hi> to have ſet before <hi>Eliſha</hi> all the veſſels in their city full of <hi>the water that was naught,</hi> if they had not led him forth to the ſpring, to caſt in the ſalt there? 2 Kings ii. 19.20, 21. The application is eaſy. (2.) Have a ſpecial eye towards it in your repentance, whether initial or progreſſive, in your firſt repentance, and in the renewing of your repentance, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Tho' a man be ſick, there is no fear of death, if the ſickneſs ſtrike not his heart; and there is as little fear of the death of ſin, as long as the ſin of our nature is not touched. But if ye would repent indeed, let the ſtreams lead you up to the fountain; and mourn over your corrupt nature, as the cauſe of all ſin, in heart, lip, and life. Pſal. li. 4, 5. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and none this evil in thy ſight — Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> (4.) Have a ſpecial eye upon it, in your mortification. Gal. v. 24. <hi>And they that are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh.</hi> It is the root of bitterneſs, that muſt be ſtruck at, which the ax of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be laid to; elſe we labour in vain.

He that would walk aright, muſt have one eye upwards to Jeſus Chriſt; and another inward to the corruption of his own nature. It is not enough that we look about us, we muſt alſo look within us. There the wall is weakeſt: there our greateſt enemy lies; and there are grounds for daily watching and mourning.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I ſhall offer ſome reaſons, why we ſhould eſpecially notice the ſin of our nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe of all ſins it is the moſt extenſive and diffuſive. It goes through the whole man, and ſpoils all. Other ſins mar particular parts of the image of God; but this doth at once deface the whole. A diſeaſe affecting any particular member of the body is ill; but that which affects the whole is worſe. The corruption of nature is the poiſon of the old ſerpent, caſt into the fountain of action: and ſo infects every action, every breathing of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the cauſe of all particular luſts, and actual ſins, in our hearts and lives. It is the ſpawn which the great <hi>Leviathan</hi> has left in the ſouls of men; from whence comes all the fry of actual ſins and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Mark vii. 21. <hi>Out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. It is the bitter fountain: particular luſts are but rivulets running from it: which bring forth into the life, a part only, and not the whole of what is within. Now the fountain is ſtill above the ſtreams: ſo where the water is good, it is beſt in the fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where it is ill, it is worſt there. The corruption of nature being that which defiles all, itſelf muſt needs be the moſt abominable thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It Is virtually all ſin: for it is the ſeed of all ſins which want but the occaſion to ſet up their heads: being in the corruption of nature, as the effect in the virtue of its cauſe. Hence it is called <hi>a body of death,</hi> (Rom. vii. 24) as conſiſting of the ſeveral members, belonging to ſuch <hi>a body of ſins,</hi> (Col ii 11.) whoſe life lies in ſpiritual death. It is the curſed ground, fit to bring forth all manner of noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weeds. As the whole neſt of venemous creatures muſt needs be more dreadful, than any few of them that come creeping forth; ſo the ſin of thy nature, that mother of abominations muſt be worſe than any particular luſts, that appear ſtirring in thy heart and life. Never did every ſin appear in the converſation of the vileſt wretch that ever lived; but look thou into thy corrupt nature, and there thou mayeſt ſee all and every ſin in the ſeed and root thereof. There is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lneſs of all unrighteouſneſs there, Rom. i.29. There is atheiſm, idolatry, blaſphemy, murder, adultery, and whatſoever is vile. Poſſibly none of theſe appear to thee in thy heart: but there is more in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable depth of wickedneſs, than thou knoweſt. Thy corrupt heart is like an ant's neſt, on which, while the ſtone lieth, none of them appear: but take off the ſtone, ſtir them up, but with the point
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:045042_0089_101F7D9932125FE8"/>
of a ſtraw, you will ſee what a ſwarm is there, and how lively they be Juſt ſuch a ſight would thy heart afford thee, did the Lord but withdraw the reſtraint he has upon it, and ſuffer Satan to ſtir it up by temptation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.The ſin of our nature is, of all ſins, the moſt fixed and abiding. Sinful actions, tho' the guilt and ſtain of them may remain, yet in themſelves they are paſſing. The drunkard is not always at his cup, nor the unclean perſon always acting lewdneſs. But the corruption of nature is an abiding ſin: it remains with men in its full power by night and by day, at all times, fixed as with bands of iron and braſs: till their nature be changed by converting grace; and the remains of it continue with the godly, until the death of the body. Pride, envy, covetouſneſs, and the like, are not always ſtirring in thee. But the proud, envious, carnal nature is ſtill with thee: even as the clock that is wrong, is not always ſtriking wrong; but the wrong ſet continues with it, without great intermiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the great reigning ſin, Rom. vi. 12. <hi>Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> There are three things you may obſerve in the corrupt heart. (1.) There is the corrupt nature; the corrupt ſet of the heart whereby men are unapt for all good, and fitted for all evil. This the apoſtle here calls, ſin which reigns. (2.) There are particular luſts, or diſpoſitions of that corrupt nature, which the Apoſtle calls the luſts thereof; ſuch as pride, covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c</hi> (3.) There is one among theſe, which is (like <hi>Saul</hi> amongſt the people) higher by far than the reſt, namely, <hi>the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us,</hi> Heb. xii. 1. This we uſually call the predominate ſin, becauſe it doth, as it were, reign over other particular luſts; ſo that other luſts muſt yield to it. Theſe three are like a river which divides itſelf into many ſtreams, whereof one is greater than the reſt. The corruption of nature is the river-head, which has many particular luſts, in which it runs: but it mainly diſburdens itſelf into what is commonly called one's predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſin. Now all of theſe being fed by the ſin of our nature; it is evident that ſin is the great reigning ſin, which never loſeth its ſuperiority over particular luſts, that live and die with it, and by it. But as in ſome rivers, the main ſtream runs not always in one and the ſame channel: ſo particular predominants may be changed, as luſts in youth may be ſucceeded by covetouſneſs in old age. Now, what doth it avail to reform in other ſins, while the great reigning ſin remains in its full power? What tho' ſome particular luſt be broken? If that ſin, the ſin of our nature keep the throne, it will ſet up another in its ſtead: as when a water-courſe is ſtopt in one place, while the fountain is not dammed up, it will ſtream forth another way. And thus ſome caſt off their prodigality, but covetouſneſs comes up in its ſtead: ſome caſt away their profanity, and the corruption of nature ſends not its main ſtream that way as before: but it rans in another channel, namely, in that of a <hi>legal diſpoſition, ſelf-righteouſneſs,</hi> or the like, ſo
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:045042_0090_101F4439B26B8438"/>
that people are ruined by their not eying the ſin of their nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is an hereditary evil, Pſal. li. 5. <hi>In ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> Particular luſts are not ſo, but in the virtue of their cauſe. A prodigal father may have a frugal ſon: but this diſeaſe is neceſſarily propagated in nature, and therefore hardeſt to cure. Surely then the word ſhould be given out againſt this ſin, as againſt the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Kings xxii. 31. <hi>Fight neither with ſmall nor great, ſave only with this:</hi> for this ſin being broke, all other ſins are broken with it; and while it ſtands entire, there is no victory.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That ye may get a view of the corruption of your nature, I would recommend to you three things (1.) Study to know the ſpirituality and extent of the law of God, for that is the glaſs wherein you may ſee yourſelves (2.) Obſerve your hearts at all times, but eſpecially under temptation. Temptation is a fire that brings up the ſcum of the vile heart: do ye carefully mark the firſt riſings of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Go to God through Jeſus Chriſt, for illumination by his Spirit. Lay out your ſoul before the Lord, as willing to know the vileneſs of your nature: ſay unto him, <hi>That which I know not, teach thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi> and be willing to take in light from the word. Believe, and you ſhall ſee. It is by the word the Spirit teacheth, but, without the Spirit's teaching, all other teaching will be to little purpoſe. Tho' the goſpel ſhould ſhine about you, like the ſun at noon-day; and this great truth be never ſo plainly preached: you will never ſee yourſelves aright, until the Spirit of the Lord light his candle within your breaſt: the fulneſs and glory of Chriſt, the corruption and vileneſs of our nature, are never rightly learned, but where the Spirit of Chriſt is the teacher.</p>
                  <p>And now to ſhut up this weighty point, let the conſideration of what is ſaid, commend Chriſt to you all. Ye that are brought out of your natural ſtate of corruption unto Chriſt, be humble; ſtill coming to Chriſt, and improving your union with him, to the further weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the remains of this natural corruption. Is your nature changed? It is but in part ſo. The day was, ye could not ſtir; now ye are cured: but remember the cure is not yet perfected, ye ſtill go halting. And tho' it were better with you than it is; the remembrance of what you were by nature, ſhould keep you low. Ye that are yet in your natural ſtate, take with it: believe the corruption of your nature: and let Chriſt and his grace be precious in your eyes. O that ye would at length be ſerious about the ſtate of your ſouls! What mind ye to do? Ye muſt die; ye muſt appear before the judgment ſeat of God. Will ye ly down, and ſleep another night at eaſe, in this caſe? Do it not: for before another day you may be ſiſted before God's dreadful tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, in the grave cloaths of your corrupt ſtate; and your vile ſouls caſt into the pit of deſtruction, as a corrupt lump, to be for ever buried out of God's ſight. For I teſtify unto you all, there is no peace with God, no pardon, no heaven for you, in this ſtate: there is but a ſtep betwixt you and eternal deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord:
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:045042_0091_101F7DA2424ED200"/>
if the brittle thread of your life, which may be broke with a touch, ere you are aware, be indeed broken while you are in this ſtate; you are ruined for ever, and without remedy. But come ſpeedily to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> he has cleanſed as vile ſouls as yours; and he will yet <hi>cleanſe the blood that he hath cleanſed,</hi> Joel iii. 21. Thus far of the ſinfulneſs of man's natural ſtate.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>HAVING ſhewed you the ſinfulneſs of man's natural ſtate, I come now to lay before you the miſery of it. A ſinful ſtate cannot be but a miſerable ſtate. If ſin go before, wrath follows of courſe. Corruption and deſtruction are ſo knit together, that the Holy Ghoſt calls deſtruction, even eternal deſtruction, <hi>corruption,</hi> Gal. vi. 8. <hi>He that ſoweth to his fleſh,ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> that is, everlaſting deſtruction; as is clear from its being oppoſed to life everlaſting, in the following clauſe. And ſo the Apoſtle having ſhown the <hi>Epheſians</hi> their real ſtate by nature, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, altogether corrupt; he tells them in the words of the text, their relative ſtate, namely, that the pit was digged for them, while in that ſtate of corruption: being dead in ſins, they were by nature children of wrath, even as others.</p>
               <p>In the words we have four things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The miſery of a natural ſtate; it is a ſtate of wrath, as well as a ſtate of ſin. <hi>We were,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>children of wrath,</hi> bound over, and liable to the wrath of God; under wrath in ſome meaſure; and, in wrath, bound over to more, even the full meaſure of it in hell, where the floods of it go over the priſoners for ever. Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> in his wrath, adjudging <hi>David</hi> to die, (1 Sam. xx. 31.) and <hi>David,</hi> in his wrath, paſſing ſentence of death againſt the man in the parable, (2 Sam. xii. 5.) ſay each of them, of his ſuppoſed criminal, <hi>He ſhall ſurely die:</hi> or, as the words in the firſt language are, <hi>he is a ſon of death.</hi> So the natural man is a child of wrath, a ſon of death. He is a malefactor dead in law, lying in chains of guilt: a criminal held faſt in his ſetters, till the day of execution: which will not fail, unleſs a pardon be obtained from his God, who is his judge and party too. By that means, indeed, children of wrath may become children of the kingdom. The phraſe in the text, however common it is in holy
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:045042_0092_101F7DA5A8435B98"/>
language, is very ſignificant. And as it is evident, that the Apoſtle calling natural men, <hi>the children of diſobedience,</hi> (ver. 2) means more, than that they were diſobedient children; for ſuch may the Lord's own children be: ſo to be children of wrath, is more than ſimply to be liable to, or under wrath. Jeſus Chriſt was liable to, and under wrath: but I doubt we have any warrant to ſay, he was a child of wrath. The phraſe ſeems to intimate, that men are, whatſoever they are in their natural ſtate, under the wrath of God; that they are wholly under wrath: wrath is, as it were, woven into their very nature, and mixeth itſelf with the whole of the man; who is (if I may ſo ſpeak) a very lump of wrath, a child of hell, as the iron in the fire is all fire, For men naturally are children of wrath, come forth, ſo to ſpeak, out of the womb of wrath; <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd was the ſon of a night, (which we render <hi>came up in a night,</hi> Jonah iv. 10.) as if it had come out of the womb of the night; (as we read of the womb of the morning, Pſal. cx. 3.) and ſo, the birth following the belly whence it came, was ſoon gone. The ſparks of fire are called ſons of the burning coal, Job v. 7. marg. Iſa. xxi. 10. <hi>O my threſhing, and the corn</hi> (or <hi>ſon) of my floor,</hi> threſhen in the floor of wrath, and, as it were brought forth by it. Thus the natural man is a child of wrath: <hi>it comes into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones,</hi> Pſal. cix. 18. For, tho' <hi>Judas</hi> was the only ſon of perdition amongſt the Apoſtles; yet all men, by nature, are of the ſame family.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the riſe of this miſery: men have it by nature. They owe it to their nature: not to their ſubſtance or offence: for that neither is nor was ſin, and therefore cannot make them children of wrath; tho' for ſin it may be under wrath: not to their nature as qualified, at man's creation, by his Maker: but to their nature as vitiated and corrupted by the fall. To the vicious quality, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their nature, (whereof before) which is their principle of action, and ceaſing from action, the only principle is an unregenerate ſtate. Now by this nature, men are children of wrath; as in time of peſtilential infection, one draws in death together with the diſeaſe then raging. Wherefore ſeeing from our firſt being, as children of <hi>Adam,</hi> we be corrupt children, ſhapen in iniquity, conceived in ſin; we are alſo, from that moment, children of wrath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The univerſity of this miſery. All are by nature children of wrath; <hi>We,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>even as others; Jews</hi> as well as <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Thoſe that are now, by grace, the children of God, were, by nature, in no better caſe, than thoſe that are ſtill in their natural ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is a glorious and happy change intimated here; we were children of wrath, but are not ſo now; grace has brought us out of that fearful ſtate. This the Apoſtle ſays of himſelf and other believers. And thus, it well becomes the people of God to be often ſtanding on the ſhore looking back to the red-ſea of the ſtate of wrath, they were ſometimes weltering in, even as others.</p>

                  <head>Man's natural State, a State of Wrath.</head>
                  <p>DOCTRINE, <hi>The ſtate of nature is a ſtate of wrath.</hi> Every one in a natural unregenerate ſtate, is in a ſtate of wrath. We are born <hi>children of wrath;</hi> and continue ſo, until we be born again. Nay, as ſoon as we were children of <hi>Adam,</hi> we were children of wrath.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall uſher in what I am to ſay on this point, with a few obſerves touching the univerſality of this <hi>ſtate of wrath;</hi> which may ſerve to prepare the way of the word into your conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Wrath has gone as wide as ever ſin went. When angels ſinned, the wrath of God brake in upon them as a flood; <hi>God ſpared not the angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 4. And thereby it was demonſtrated, that no natural excellency in the creature will ſhield it from the wrath of God; if once it becomes a ſinful creature. The fineſt and the niceſt piece of the workmanſhip of heaven, if once the Creator's image upon it be defaced by ſin, God can and will daſh it in pieces, in his wrath; unleſs ſatisfaction be made to juſtice, and that image be repaired; neither of which the ſinner himſelf can do. <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned; and the whole lump of mankind was leavened, and bound over to the fiery oven of God's wrath. And from the text ye may learn, (1.) That ignorance of that ſtate cannot free men from it; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that knew not God, <hi>were by nature children of wrath, even as others.</hi> A man's houſe may be on fire, his wife and children periſhing in the flames; while he knows nothing of it, and therefore is not concerned about it. Such is your caſe, O ye that are ignorant of theſe things! wrath is ſilently ſinking into your ſouls, while you are bleſſing yourſelves, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall have peace.</hi> Ye need not a more certain token, that ye are <hi>children of wrath,</hi> than that ye never yet ſaw yourſelves ſuch. Ye cannot be the children of God, that never yet ſaw yourſelves children of the devil. Ye cannot be in the way to heaven, that never ſaw yourſelves by nature in the high road to hell. Ye are groſly ignorant of your ſtate by nature; and ſo ignorant of God, and of Chriſt, and your need of him: and tho' ye look on your ignorance as a covert from wrath; yet take it out of the mouth of God himſelf, that it will ruin you if it be not removed, Iſa. xxvii. 11. <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them.</hi> See 2 Theſſ. i. 8. Hoſ. iv. 6. (2.) No outward privileges can exempt men from this ſtate of wrath; for the <hi>Jews,</hi> the children of the kingdom, God's peculiar people, were <hi>children of wrath even as others.</hi> Tho' ye be church-members, partakers of all church privileges; tho' you be deſcended of godly parents, of great and honourable families; be what ye will, ye are by nature, heirs of hell, <hi>children of wrath.</hi> (3.) No profeſſion, nor attainments in a profeſſion of religion, do or can exempt a man from this ſtate of wrath. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of the ſtraiteſt ſect of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> religion, Acts xxvi. 5, yet a <hi>child of wrath, even as others,</hi> till he was
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:045042_0094_101F7DA93431CD18"/>
converted. The cloſe hypocrite, and the profane, are alike as to their ſtate; however different their converſations be: and they will be alike in their fatal end, Pſal. cxxv. 5. <hi>As for ſuch as turn aſide unto their crooked ways, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</hi> (4.) Young ones that are yet but ſetting out into the world, have not that to do, to make themſelves <hi>children of wrath,</hi> by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the graceleſs multitude. They are <hi>children of wrath by nature:</hi> ſo it is done already: they were born heirs of hell; they will indeed make themſelves more ſo, if they do not, while they are young, flee from the wrath they were born to, by fleeing to Jeſus Chriſt.— <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Whatever men are now by grace, they were even as others, by nature. And this may be a ſad meditation to them, that have been at eaſe from their youth, and have had no changes.</p>
                  <p>Now, theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall, in the firſt place, ſhew what this ſtate of wrath is; next, confirm the doctrine; and then apply it.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I am to ſhew what this ſtate of wrath is. But who can fully deſcribe the wrath of an angry God? None can do it. Yet ſo much of it muſt be diſcovered, as may ſerve to convince men of the abſolute neceſſity of fleeing to Jeſus Chriſt, out of that <hi>ſtate of wrath.</hi> Anger in men is a paſſion, and commotion of the ſpirit for an injury received, with a deſire to reſent the ſame. When it comes to a height, and is fixed in one's ſpirit, it is called wrath. Now there are no paſſions in God, properly ſpeaking: they are inconſiſtent with his abſolute uuchangeableneſs, and independency; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (to remove the miſtake of the <hi>Lycaonians,</hi> who thought they were gods) tell them, they were <hi>men of like paſſions</hi> with themſelves, Acts xiv. 15. Wrath then is attributed to God, not in reſpect of the affection of wrath, but the effects thereof. Wrath is a fire in the bowels of a man, tormenting the man himſelf: but there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation in God. His wrath does not in the leaſt mar that infinite rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e and happineſs, which he hath in himſelf. It is a moſt pure undiſturbed act of his will producing dreadful effects againſt the ſinner. It is little we know of an infinite God: but condeſcending to our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he is pleaſed to ſpeak of himſelf to us, after the manner of men. Let us therefore notice man's wrath, but remove every thing in our conſideration of the wrath of God, that argues imperfection: and ſo we may attain to ſome view of it, however ſcanty. By this means we are led to take up the wrath of God againſt the natural man in theſe three.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is wrath in the heart of God againſt him. The Lord approves him not, but is diſpleaſed with him. Every natural man lies under the diſpleaſure of God; and that is heavier than mountains of braſs, Altho' he be pleaſed with himſelf, and others be pleaſed with him too; yet God looks down on him, as diſpleaſed. <hi>Firſt,</hi> His perſon is under God's diſpleaſure: <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. v. 5. A godly man's ſin is diſpleaſing to God, yet his perſon is

There is a fire of wrath burns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually againſt him, in the heart of God. They are as dogs and ſwine, moſt abominable creatures in the ſight of God. Tho' their natural ſtate be gilded over with a ſhining profeſſion, yet they are abhorred of God: they are to him as <hi>ſmoke in his noſe,</hi> Iſa. lxv. 5. and lukewarm water, to be <hi>ſpewed out of his mouth,</hi> Rev, iii. 16. <hi>whited ſepulchres,</hi> Matth. xxiii. 27. <hi>a generation of vipers,</hi> Matth. xii. 34. and a <hi>people of his wrath,</hi> Iſa. x. 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is diſpleaſed with all they do: It is impoſſible for them to pleaſe him, being unbelievers, Heb. xi. 6. He hates their perſons: and ſo hath no pleaſure in, but is diſpleaſed with their beſt works, Iſa lvi. 3. <hi>He that ſacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck,</hi> &amp;c. Their duty, as done by them, is <hi>an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov xv. 8. And as men turn their back upon them whom they are angry with; ſo the Lord's refuſing communion with the natural man in his duties, is a plain indication of this wrath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is wrath in the word of God againſt him. When wrath is in the heart, it ſeeks a vent by the lips: ſo God fights againſt the natural man with <hi>the ſword of his mouth,</hi> Rev ii. 16. The Lord's word never ſpeaks good of him, but always curſeth or condemneth him. Hence it is, that when he is awakened, the word read or preached often increaſeth his horror. <hi>Firs;t,</hi> It condemns all his actions, together with his corrupt nature. There is nothing he does, but the law declares it to be ſin. It is a rule of perfect obedience, from which he always in all things, declines; and ſo it rejects every thing he doth as ſin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It pronounceth his doom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth God's curſe againſt him, Gal. iii. 10. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe: for it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of law, to do them.</hi> Be he never ſo well in the world, it pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a woe from heaven againſt him, Iſa.iii. 11. The Bible is a quiver filled with arrows of wrath againſt him, ready to be poured in on his ſoul. God's threatnings in his word, hang over his head as a black cloud, ready to ſhower down on him every moment. The word is indeed the ſaint's ſecurity againſt wrath, but it binds the natural man's ſin and wrath together, as a certain pledge of his ruin, if he continue in that ſtate. So the conſcience being awakened, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this tie made by the law, the man is filled with terrors in his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is wrath in the hand of God againſt the natural man. He is under heavy ſtrokes of wrath already, and is liable to more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> There is wrath on his body. It is a piece of curſed day, which wrath is ſinking into by virtue of the threatning of the firſt covenant, Gen. ii. 17. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> There is never a diſeaſe, gripe nor ſtitch, that affects him, but it comes on him with the ſting of God's indignation in it. They are all cords of death, ſent before to bind the priſoner.</p>

                     <pb n="99" facs="unknown:045042_0096_101F7DB0D04976D0"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> There is wrath upon his ſoul. (1.) He can have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; he is <hi>fooliſh, and ſhall not ſtand in God's ſight,</hi> Pſal v. 5. When <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, God turned him out of paradiſe: and natural men are, as <hi>Adam</hi> left them, baniſhed from the gracious preſence of the Lord; and can have no acceſs to him in that ſtate. There is war betwixt heaven and them: and ſo all commerce is cut off. <hi>They are without God in the world,</hi> Eph. ii. 12. The ſun is gone down on them, and there is not the leaſt glimpſe of favour towards them from heaven. (2) Hence the ſoul is left to pine away in its iniquity. The natural darkneſs of their minds, the averſeneſs to good in their wills, the diſorder of their aſſertions, and diſtemper of their conſciences, and all their natural plagues, we left upon them in a penal way; and being ſo left, increaſe daily. God caſts a portion of worldly goods to them, more or leſs; as a bone is thrown to a dog: but alas! his wrath againſt them appears, in that they get no grace. The Phyſician of ſouls comes by them, and goes by them, and cures others beſide them; while they are conſuming away in their iniquity, and ripning daily for utter deſtruction. (3.) They ly open to fearful additional plagues on their ſouls, even in this life. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sometimes they meet with deadning ſtrokes; ſilent blows from the hand of an angry God; arrows of wrath that enter into their ſouls without noiſe, Iſa. vi. 10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. God ſtrives with them for a while, and convictions enter their conſciences; but they rebel againſt the light: and by a ſecret judgment, they are knocked on the head; ſo that, from that time, they do as it were, live and rot above ground. Their hearts are deadned; their affections withered; their conſciences ſtupified; and their whole ſouls blaſted; <hi>caſt forth as a branch, and withered,</hi> John xv. 16. They are plagued with judicial blindneſs. They ſhut their eyes againſt the light, and they are given over to the devil, the god of this world, to be blinded more, 2 Cor. iv. 4. Yea, <hi>God ſends them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie,</hi> 2 Theſſ. ii. 11. <hi>even conſcience,</hi> like a ſelf light on the ſhore leads them upon rocks; by which they are broken in pieces. They harden themſelves againſt God; and he gives up with them, and leaves them to Satan and their own hearts, whereby they are hardned more and more. They are often given up unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be wanting in his houſe, there is one thing that is never wanting there, Prov. iii. 33. <hi>The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked.</hi> Wrath is on all that he has; on the bread that he eats, the liquor he drinks, and clothes which he wears. <hi>His baſket and ſtore are curſed,</hi> Deut. xxviii. 17. Some things fall wrong with him; and that comes to paſs by virtue of his wrath; other things go according to his wiſh, and there is wrath in that too; for it is a ſnare to his ſoul, Prov. i 32. <hi>The proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them.</hi> This wrath turns his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings into curſes, Mal ii. 2. <hi>I will curſe your bleſſings: yea, I have curſed them already.</hi> The holy law is a killing letter to him, 2 Cor. iii. 6. The miniſtry of the goſpel, <hi>a ſavour of death unto death,</hi> chap. ii. 15. In the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper, <hi>he eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor xi. 29. Nay, more than all that, Chriſt himſelf is to him, <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 8. Thus wrath follows the natural man, as his ſhadow doth his body.</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> He is under the power of Satan, Acts xxvi. 18. The devil has overcome him, ſo he is his by conqueſt; his lawful captive, Iſa. xlix. 24. The natural man is condemned already, John iii. 18. and therefore under the heavy hand of <hi>him that hath the power of death, that is the devil.</hi> And he keeps his priſoner, in the priſon of a natural ſtate, bound hand and foot, Iſa. lxi 1. <hi>Laden with divers luſts,</hi> as chains wherewith he holds them faſt. Thou needeſt not, as many do, call on the devil to take thee; for he has a faſt hold of thee already, as a child of wrath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The natural man has no ſecurity for a moment's ſafety from the wrath of God its coming on him to the uttermoſt. The curſe of the law denounced againſt him, has already tied him to the ſtake: ſo that the arrows of juſtice may pierce his ſoul; and in him may meet all the miſeries and plagues that flow from the avenging wrath of God. See how he is ſet as a mark to the arrows of wrath, Pſal. vii. 11, 12, 13. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day. If he turn not, he will whet his ſword: he hath bent his bow, and made it ready; he hath alſo prepared for him the inſtruments of death.</hi> Doth he ly down to ſleep? There is not a promiſe, he knows of, or can know, to ſecure him that he ſhall not be in hell ere he awake. Juſtice is purſuing, and cries for vengeance on the ſinner: the law caſts the fire balls of its curſes continually upon him: waſted and long tired pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is that which keeps in his life: he walks amidſt enemies armed againſt him: his name may be <hi>Magor Miſſabib,</hi> i. e. <hi>terror round about,</hi> Jer. xx. 3. Angels, devils, men, beaſts, ſtones, heaven, and earth, are in readineſs, on a word of command <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rom the Lord, to ruin him.</p>
                  <p>Thus the natural man lives, but he muſt die too; and death is a dreadful meſſenger to him It comes upon him armed with wrath, and puts three ſad charges in his hand (1) Death chargeth him to bid an eternal farewell to all things in this world; to leave it, and make away to another world. Ah! what a dredful charge muſt this
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:045042_0098_101F7DB79E3BBF00"/>
be to a child of wrath! He can have no comfort from heaven; for God is his enemy: and as for the things of the world, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his luſts, which were the only ſprings of his comfort; theſe are in a moment dried up to him for ever. He is not ready for another world: he was not thinking of removing ſo ſoon: or if he was, yet he has no portion ſecured to him in another world, but that which he was born to, and was increaſing all his days, namely, <hi>a treaſure of wrath.</hi> But go he muſt; his clay god, the world, muſt be parted with, and <hi>what has he more?</hi> There was never a glimmering of light, or favour from heaven, to his ſoul: and now the wrath that did hang in the threatning as <hi>a cloud like a man's hand,</hi> is darkning the face of the whole heaven above him: and if he <hi>look unto the earth,</hi> (from whence all his light was wont to come) <hi>behold trouble and darkneſs, dirtneſs of anguiſh; and he ſhall be driven to darkneſs,</hi> Iſa. viii 22. (2) Death chargeth ſoul and body to part till the great day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His ſoul is required of him, Luke xii 20. O what a miſerable parting muſt this be to a child of wrath! care was indeed taken to provide for the body things neceſſary for this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alas! there is nothing laid up for another life to it; nothing to be a ſeed of glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: as it lived, ſo it muſt die, and riſe again ſinful fleſh; fuel for the fire of God's wrath. As for the ſoul, he was never ſolicitous to provide for it. It lay in the body, dead to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all things truly good; and ſo muſt be carried out into the pit, in the grave cloths of its natural ſtate: for now that death comes, the companions in ſin muſt part. (3.) Death chargeth the ſoul to compear before the tribunal of God, while the body lies to be carried to the grave, Eccleſ. xii. 7. <hi>The ſpirit ſhall return unto God who gave it.</hi> Heb. ix 2, 7. <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto all men once to die, but after this the judgment.</hi> Well were it for the ſinful ſoul if it might be buried together with the body. But that cannot be: it muſt go and receive its ſentence; and ſhall be ſhut up in the priſon of hell, while the curſed body lies impriſoned in the grave, till the day of the general judgment.</p>
                  <p>When the end of the world, appointed of God, is come; the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ariſe. Then ſhall the weary earth, at the command of the Judge, caſt forth the bodies; the curſed bodies of theſe that lived and died in their natural ſtate: <hi>The ſea, death, and hell, ſhall deliver up their dead,</hi> Rev. xx. 13. Their miſerable bodies and ſouls ſhall be re-united, and they ſitted before the tribunal of Chriſt. Then ſhall they receive that fearful ſentence, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>part from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,</hi> Matth. xx. 41. Whereupon <hi>they ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> ver. 49. They ſhall be eternally ſhut up in hell, never to get the leaſt drop of comfort, nor the leaſt eaſe of their torment. There they will be puniſhed with the puniſhment of <hi>loſs:</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for ever from the preſence of God, his angels and ſaints. All means of grace, all hopes of a delivery, ſhall be for ever cut off from their eyes. They ſhall not have <hi>a drop of water to cool their
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:045042_0099_101F7DB95CBAB0C8"/>
tongues,</hi> Luke xvi. 24, 25. They ſhall be puniſhed with the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>ſenſe.</hi> They muſt not only depart from God; but depart into fire, into everlaſting fire. There the worm, that ſhall gnaw them, ſhall never die; the fire, that ſhall ſcorch them, ſhall never be quenched. God ſhall, thro' all eternity, hold them up with the one hand, and pour the full vials of wrath into them with the other.</p>
                  <p>This is that ſtate of wrath natural men live in; being under much of the wrath of God, and liable to more. But for a further view of it, let us conſider the qualities of that wrath (1.) It is irreſiſtible, there is no ſtanding before it. <hi>Who may ſtand in thy ſight, when once thou art angry?</hi> Pſal. lxxxvi. 7. Can the worm, or the moth, defend itſelf againſt him that deſigns to cruſh it? As little can worm man ſtand before an angry God Fooliſh man indeed practically bids a defiance to heaven: but the Lord often, even in this world, opens ſuch ſluices of wrath upon them, as all their might cannot ſtop; but they are carried away thereby, as with a flood. How much more will it be ſo in hell? (2.) It is unſupportable. What one cannot reſiſt, he will ſet himſelf to bear: but, <hi>Who ſhall dwell with devouring fire? Who ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> God's wrath is a weight that will ſink men into the loweſt hell. It is a burden no man is able to ſtand under. <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear it?</hi> Prov. xviii. 14. (3.) It is unavoidable to ſuch as will go on impenitently in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſe. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy,</hi> Prov. xxix 1. We may now fly from it indeed, by flying to Jeſus Chriſt: but ſuch as fly from Chriſt, ſhall never be able to avoid it. Whither can men fly from an avenging God? Where will they find a ſhelter? The hills will not hear them; the mountains will be deaf to their loudeſt cries; when they cry to them, to <hi>hide them from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> (4.) It is <hi>powerful and fierce wrath,</hi> Pſal. xc. 11. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? Even according to thy fean, ſo is thy wrath.</hi> We are apt to fear the wrath of man more than we ought: but no man can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the wrath of God to be more dreadful than it really is: the power of it can never be known to the utmoſt; ſeeing it is infinite, and (properly ſpeaking) has no utmoſt: how fierce ſoever it be, either on earth, or in hell, God can ſtill carry it further. Every thing in God is moſt perfect in its kind; and therefore no wrath is ſo fierce as his. O ſinner, how wilt thou be able to endure that wrath, which will <hi>tear thee in pieces,</hi> Pſal. l. 22. and <hi>grind thee to powder,</hi> Luke xx 18. The hiſtory of the two ſhe bears, that tare the children of <hi>Bethel,</hi> is an awful on, 2 Kings ii. 23, 24. But the united force of the rage of lions, leopards, and ſhe bears bereaved of their whelps, is not ſufficient to give us even a ſcanty view of the power of the wrath of God, Hoſ. xiii. 7, 8. <hi>Therefore I will be unto them as a lion; as a leopard by the way will I obſerve them. I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rent the caul of their heart,</hi> &amp;c. (5) It is penetrating and piercing wrath. It is burning wrath, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:045042_0100_101F7DBE9A2F6A38"/>
firey indignation. There is no pain more exquiſite, than that which is cauſed by fire; and no fire ſo piercing as the fire of God's indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>burns into the loweſt hell,</hi> Deut. xxxii. 22. The arrows of men's wrath can pierce fleſh, blood and bones: but cannot reach the ſoul: but the wrath of God will ſink into the ſoul, and ſo pierce a man in the moſt tender part. Like as, when a perſon is thunder-ſtruck, oft-times there is not a wound to be ſeen in the ſkin; yet life is gone, and the bones are, as it were, melted: ſo God's wrath can penetrate into, and melt one's ſoul within him, when his earthly comforts ſtand about him entire, and untouched as in <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s caſe, Dan. v. 6. (6.) It is conſtant wrath, running parallel with the man's continuance in an unregenerate ſtate; conſtantly attending him, from the womb to the grave. There are few ſo dark days, but the ſun ſometimes looketh out from under the clouds: but the wrath of God, is an abiding cloud on the ſubjects of it, John iii 36. <hi>The wrath of God abideth on him</hi> that believes not. (7.) It is eternal. O miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoul! If thou fly not from this wrath unto Jeſus Chriſt, thy miſery had a beginning, but it ſhall never have an end. Should devouring death wholly ſwallow thee up, and for ever hold thee faſt in a grave; it would be kind, but thou muſt live again, and never die; that thou mayſt be ever dying, <hi>in the hands of the living God.</hi> Cold death will quench the flame of man's wrath againſt us, if nothing elſe do it: but God's wrath, when it has come on the ſinner, millions of ages will ſtill be <hi>the wrath to come,</hi> Matth. iii. 7. 1 Theſſ. i. 10. As the water of a river is ſtill coming, how much ſoever of it has paſſed. While God is, he will purſue the quarrel. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Howſoever dreadful it is, and tho' it be eternal, yet it is moſt juſt wrath: it is a clear fire, without the leaſt ſmoak of unjuſtice. The ſea of wrath raging with greateſt fury againſt the ſinner, is clear as chryſtal. The Judge of all the earth can do no wrong. He knows no tranſports of paſſion, for they are inconſiſtent with the perfection of his nature. <hi>Is God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, who taketh vengeance? (I ſpeak as a man) God forbid: for then, how ſhall God judge the world?</hi> Rom. iii. 5, 6.</p>

                  <head>The Doctrine of the State of Wrath confirmed and vindicated.</head>
                  <p n="2">II. I ſhall confirm the doctrine. Conſider, (1.) How peremptory the threatning of the firſt covenant is; <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. ii. 17. Hereby ſin and puniſhment being connected, the veracity of God aſcertains the execution of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Now all men being by nature under this covenant, the breach of it lays them under the curſe. (2.) The juſtice of God requires that a child of ſin be a child of wrath; that the law being broken, the ſanction thereof ſhould take place. God, as man's ruler and Judge, cannot but do right, Gen. xviii. 25 Now it is a righteous thing with God to recompence ſin with wrath, 2 Theſſ. i. 6. He is <hi>of purer eyes than to behold evil,</hi> Hab. i. 13. And <hi>he hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:045042_0101_101F7DC200C24278"/>
iniquity,</hi> Pſal. v. 6. (3.) The horrors of a natural conſcience prove this. There is a conſcience in the breaſts of men, which can tell them, they are ſinners; and therefore liable to the wrath of God. Let men, at any time, ſoberly commune with themſelves, and they will find they have the witneſs in themſelves, <hi>knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things, are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. i. 32. (4) The pangs of the new birth, the work of the ſpirit of bondage on elect ſouls, in order to their converſion, demonſtrate this. Hereby their natural ſinfulneſs and miſery, as liable to the wrath of God, are plainly taught them, filling their hearts with fear of that wrath. Now that this ſpirit of bondage is no other than the Spirit of God, whoſe work is to convince of ſin, righteouſneſs, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (John xvi. 8.) this teſtimony muſt needs be true; for the Spirit of truth cannot witneſs an untruth. Mean while, true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers being freed from the ſtate of wrath, <hi>receive not the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but receive the Spirit of adoption,</hi> Rom. iii. 15. And therefore, if fears of that nature do ariſe, after the ſoul's union with Chriſt: they come from the ſaint's own ſpirit, or from a worſe. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The ſufferings of Chriſt plainly prove this doctrine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Son of God, a Son under wrath, but becauſe the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of men were children of wrath? He ſuffered the wrath of God, not for himſelf, but for thoſe that were liable to it in their own perſons. Nay, this not only ſpeaks us to have been liable to wrath; but alſo that wrath muſt have a vent, in the puniſhing of ſin. If this was done in the green tree, what will become of the dry? What a miſerable caſe muſt a ſinner be in that is out of Chriſt; that is not vitally united to Chriſt, and partakes not of his Spirit? God, who ſpared not his own Son, ſurely will not ſpare ſuch an one.</p>
                  <p>But the unregenerate man, who has no great value for the honour of God, will be apt to riſe up againſt his Judge, and in his own heart condemn his procedure. Nevertheleſs the Judge being infinitely juſt, the ſentence muſt be righteous. And therefore, to ſtop thy mouth, O proud ſinner, and to ſtill thy clamour againſt the righteous Judge, conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thou art a ſinner by nature, and it is highly reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that guilt and wrath be as old as ſin. Why ſhould not God begin to vindicate his honour, as ſoon as vile worms begin to impare it? Why ſhall not a ſerpent bite the thief, as ſoon as he leaps over the hedge? Why ſhould not the threatning take hold of the ſinner, as ſoon as he caſts away the command?

where were the proportion? Moreover, ſin deſerves the miſery, but our beſt works do not deſerve the happineſs: yet both are ſet before us; ſin and miſery, holineſs and happineſs What reaſon is there then to complain? (2.) How ſevere ſoever the threatnings be, yet all has enough ado to reach the end of the law. <hi>Fear him,</hi> ſays our LORD, <hi>which, after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him,</hi> Luke xii. 5. This beſpeaks our dread of divine power and majeſty; but yet how few fear him indeed! The LORD knows the ſinner's heart to be exceedingly intent upon fulfilling their luſts: they cleave ſo fondly to thoſe fulſome breaſts, that a ſmall force does not ſuffice to draw them from them. They that travel through deſarts, where they are in hazard from wild beaſts, have need to carry fire along with them: and they have need of a hard wedge that have knotty timber to cleave; ſo a holy law muſt be fenced with a dreadful wrath, in a world lying in wickedneſs. But who are they that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of that wrath as too great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thoſe to whom it is too little to draw them off from their ſinful courſes? It was the man who pretended to fear his Lord, becauſe he was an auſtere man, that kept his <hi>pound laid up in a napkin:</hi> and ſo he was <hi>condemned out of his own mouth,</hi> Luke xix. 20, 21.22. Thou art that man, even thou whoſe objection I am anſwering. How can the wrath thou art under, and liable to, be too great, while yet it is not ſufficient to awaken thee to fly from it? Is it time to relax the penalties of the law, when men are tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the commands of it under foot? (3.) Conſider how God dealt with his own Son, whom <hi>he ſpared not,</hi> Rom. viii. 32. The wrath of God ſeized on his ſoul and body both, and brought him into the duſt of death. That his ſufferings were not eternal, flowed from the quality of the ſufferer, who was infinite; and therefore able to bear at once, the whole load of wrath: and upon that account, his ſufferings were infinite in value. But in value, they muſt be protracted to an eternity. And what confidence can a rebel ſubject have to quarrel (for his part) a puniſhment execute on the King's Son? (4.) The ſinner doth againſt God what he can. <hi>Behold thou haſt done evil things as thou couldſt,</hi> Jer. iii. 5. That thou haſt not done more, and worſe; thanks to him who reſtrained thee; to the chain which the wolf was kept in by, not to thyſelf. No wonder God ſhew his power on the ſinner, who puts forth his power againſt God, as far as it will reach. The unregenerate man puts no period to his ſinful courſe; and would put no bounds to it neither, if he were not reſtrained by divine power for wiſe ends: and therefore it is juſt he be for ever under wrath. (5.) It is infinite majeſty ſin ſtrikes againſt; and ſo it is, in ſome ſort, an infinite evil. Sin riſeth in its demerit, according to the quality of the party offended. If a man wound his neighbour, his goods muſt go for it; but if he wound his prince, his life muſt go to make amends for that The infinity of God makes infinite wrath the juſt demerit of ſin. God is infinitely diſpleaſed with ſin: and when he acts, he muſt act like himſelf, and ſhew his diſpleaſure by proportionable means.

better be a ſlave to the <hi>Turks,</hi> condemned to the galleys, or under <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, than be under the covenant of works now. All mankind were brought under it in <hi>Adam,</hi> as we heard before: and thou in thy unregenerate ſtate, are ſtill where <hi>Adam</hi> left thee. It is true, there is another covenant brought in: but what is that to thee, who art not brought into it? Thou muſt needs be under one of the two covenants; either under the law, or under grace. That thou art not <hi>under grace, the dominion of ſin</hi> over thee, manifeſtly evinceth; therefore thou art under the law, Rom. vi. 14. Do not think God has laid aſide the firſt covenant, Matth. v. 17, 18. Gal. iii. 10. No, he will <hi>magnify the law, and make it honourable.</hi> It is broken indeed on thy part: but it is abſurd to think, that therefore your obligation is diſſolved. Nay, thou muſt ſtand and fall by it, till thou canſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thy diſcharge from God himſelf, who is thy party in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and this thou canſt not pretend to, ſeeing thou art not in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now, to give you a view of your miſery, in this reſpect, conſider theſe following things, (1.) Hereby ye are bound over to death, in virtue of the threatning of death in that covenant, Gen. ii. 17. The condition being broken, ye fall under the penalty. So it concludes you under wrath. (2) There is no ſalvation for you under this covenant, but on a condition impoſſible to be performed by you. The juſtice of God muſt be ſatiſfied for the wrong you have done already. God hath written this truth in characters of the blood of his own Son. Yea, and you muſt perfectly obey the law for the time to come. So ſaith the law, Gal. iii. 12. <hi>The man that doth them, ſhall live in them.</hi> Come then, O ſinner, ſee if thou canſt make a ladder, whereby thou mayſt reach the throne of God; ſtretch forth thine arms, and try, if thou canſt fly on the wings of the wind, catch hold of the clouds, and pierce through theſe viſible heavens; and then either climb over, or break through the jaſper walls of the city above. Theſe things ſhalt thou do, as ſoon as thou ſhalt reach heaven in thy natural ſtate, or under this covenant. (3.) There is no pardon under this covenant. Pardon is the benefit of another covenant, with which thou haſt noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do, Acts xiii. 9. <hi>And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes.</hi> As for thee, thou art in the hand of a mercileſs creditor, which will take thee by the throat, ſaying, <hi>Pay what thou oweſt;</hi> and caſt thee into priſon, there to remain, till thou haſt paid the utmoſt farthing: unleſs thou beeſt ſo wiſe as to get a cautioner in time, who is able to anſwer for all thy debt, and get up thy diſcharge. This Jeſus Chriſt alone can do. Thou abideſt under this covenant, and pleadeſt mercy: but what is thy plea founded on? There is not one promiſe of mercy or pardon in that covenant. Doſt thou plead mercy, for mercy's ſake? Juſtice will ſtep in betwixt it and thee; and plead God's covenant threatning, which he cannot deny. (4) There's no place for repentance in this covenant ſo as the ſinner can be helped by it. For as ſoon as ever thou ſinneſt, the law lays its curſe on thee, which is a dead weight

thou canſt by no means throw off; no, not tho' thine <hi>head were waters, and thine eyes a fountain of tears, to weep day and night</hi> for thy ſin. That is <hi>what the law cannot do, in that it is weak through the fleſh,</hi> Rom. viii 3. Now thou art another profane <hi>Eſau,</hi> that hath ſold the bleſſing; and there is no place for repentance tho' thou ſeekeſt it carefully with tears, while under that covenant. (5.) There is no accepting of the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed</hi> under this covenant, which was not made for <hi>good will,</hi> but <hi>good works.</hi> The miſtake in this point ruins many. They are not in Chriſt, but ſtand under the firſt covenant; and yet they will plead this privilege. This is juſt as if one having made a feaſt for thoſe of his own family, when they ſit down at table, another man's ſervant that has run away from his maſter, ſhould preſumptuouſly come forward and ſit down among them: would not the maſter of the feaſt give ſuch a ſtranger that check, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> And ſince he is none of his family, command him to be gone quickly. Tho' a maſter accept the <hi>good will</hi> of his own child for the <hi>dead,</hi> can a hired ſervant expect that privilege? (6.) Ye have nothing to do with Chriſt, while under this covenant. By the law of God a woman cannot be married to two huſbands at once: either death or divorce muſt diſſolve the firſt marriage, ere ſhe can marry another. So we muſt firſt be dead to the law, ere we can be married to Chriſt, Rom. vii. 4. The law is the firſt huſband; Jeſus Chriſt, who raiſeth the dead, marries the widow, that was heart-broken, and ſlain by the firſt huſband. But while the ſoul is in the houſe with the firſt huſband, it cannot plead a marriage-relation to Chriſt; nor the benefits of a marriage-covenant, which is not yet entered into, Gal. v. 4. <hi>Chriſt is become of no effect to you; whoſoever of you are juſtified by the law, ye are fallen from grace.</hi> Peace, pardon, and ſuch like benefits are all benefits of the covenant of grace. And ye muſt not think to ſtand off from Chriſt, and the marriage-covenant with him, and yet plead theſe benefits; more than one man's wife can plead the benefit of a contract of marriage paſt betwixt another man and his own wife. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> See the bill of excluſion, paſt in the court of heaven, againſt all under the covenant of works, Gal. iv. 30. <hi>The ſon of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Motive</hi> 3. Conſider the dreadful inſtances of the wrath of God; and let them ſerve to awaken thee to flee out of this ſtate. Conſider, (1.) How it is fallen on men. Even in this world, many have been ſet up as monuments of divine vengeance; that others might fear. Wrath has ſwept away multitudes, who have fallen together by the hand of an angry God. Conſider how the Lord <hi>ſpared not the old world, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly: and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 5, 6. But it is yet more dreadful to think of that <hi>wepping, wailing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> amongſt thoſe, who in hell lift up their eyes, but cannot get a drop of water to cool their tongues. Believe theſe things, and be warned by them; leſt deſtruction come upon thee, for a warning to others. (2.) Conſider how wrath fell upon the fallen angels, whoſe caſe is abſolutely hopeleſs. They were the firſt that ventured to break the hedge of the divine law; and God ſet them up as monuments of his wrath againſt ſin. They once left their own habitation, and were never allowed to look in again at the hole of the door; but they are <hi>reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day,</hi> Jude 6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Behold how an angry God dealt with his own Son, ſtanding in the room of elect ſinners, Rom viii. 32. <hi>God ſpared not his own Son.</hi> Sparing mercy might have been expected, if any at all.

and wiſdom; ſo that none of thy ſins, however ſecret, can be hid from him. He infallibly finds out all means whereby wrath may be executed, toward the ſatisfying of juſtice. He is of infinite power, and ſo can do what he will againſt the ſinner. How heavy muſt the ſtrokes of wrath be, which are laid on by an omnipotent hand! infinite power can make the ſinner priſoner, even when he is in his greateſt rage againſt heaven. It can bring again the ſeveral parcels of duſt, out of the grave; put them together again, reunite the ſoul and the body, ſiſt them before the tribunal, hurry them away to the pit, and hold them up with the one hand thro' eternity, while they are laſhed with the other. He is infinitely juſt, and therefore muſt puniſh; it were acting contrary to his nature to ſuffer the ſinner to eſcape wrath. Hence the executing of this wrath is pleaſing to him; for tho' the Lord hath no delight in the death of the ſinner, as it is the deſtruction of his own creature, yet he delights in it, as it is the execution of juſtice. <hi>Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt.</hi> Mark the reaſon, <hi>For the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. xi. 6, 7. <hi>I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon them, and I will be comforted,</hi> Ezek. v. 13. <hi>I alſo will laugh at your calamity,</hi> Prov. i. 26. <hi>Finally,</hi> He lives for ever, to purſue the quarrel. Let us therefore conclude, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be awakened then, O young ſinner; be awakened, O old ſinner, who art yet in the ſtate thou waſt born in. Your ſecurity is none of God's allowance, it is the ſleep of death: riſe out of it ere the pit cloſe its mouth on you. It is true, you may put on a breaſt-plate of iron, make your bow braſs, and your hearts as an adamant: who can help it? But God will break that brazen bow, and make that adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine heart, at laſt, to fly into a thouſand pieces. Ye may, if ye will, labour to put thoſe things out of your heads, that ye may yet ſleep in a ſound ſkin, tho' in a ſtate of wrath. Ye may run away with the arrows ſticking in your conſciences to your work, to work them away; or to your beds, to ſleep them out; or to company, to ſport and laugh them away: but convictions ſo ſtifled, will have a fearful reſurrection: and the day is coming, when the arrows of wrath ſhall ſo ſtick in thy ſoul, as thou ſhalt never be able to pluck them out thro' the ages of eternity, unleſs thou take warning in time.</p>
                  <p>But if any deſire to flee from the wrath to come; and for that end, to know what courſe to take; I offer them theſe few advices, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and beſeech them, as they love their own ſouls, to fall in with them.

to juſtify God in this matter. To quarrel with God about it, and to rage like a wild bull in a net, will but fix you the more in it. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of ſoul, before the Lord, is neceſſary for an eſcape. God will not ſell deliverance, but freely gives it to thoſe, who ſee themſelves altogether unworthy of his favour. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Turn your eyes, O priſoners of hope, towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and embrace him as he offereth himſelf, in the goſpel. <hi>There is no ſalvation in any other,</hi> Acts iv. 12. God is a conſuming fire; ye are children of wrath: if the Mediator interpoſe not betwixt him and you, ye are undone for ever. If ye would be ſafe, come under his ſhadow: one drop of that wrath cannot fall there, for he <hi>delivereth us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſſ. i 10. Accept of him in his covenant, wherein he offereth himſelf to thee: and ſo thou ſhalt, as the captive woman, redeem thy life, by marrying the Conqueror. His blood will quench that fire of wrath, which burns againſt thee: in the white raiment of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs thou ſhalt be ſafe; for no ſtorm of wrath can pierce it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I ſhall drop a few words to the ſaints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Remember, <hi>that at that time,</hi> (namely, when ye were in your natural ſtate) <hi>ye were without Chriſt—having no hope, and without God in the world</hi> Call to mind that ſtate, ye were in formerly; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the miſery of it. There are five memorials, I may thence give in to the whole aſſembly of the ſaints, who are no more children of wrath: but heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt, tho as yet in their minority. (1) Remember, that in the day our Lord took you by the hand, ye were in no better condition than others? O what moved him to take you, when he paſt by your neighbours! he found you children of wrath, even as others; but he did not leave you ſo. He came into the common priſon, where you lay in your fetters, even as others: and from amongſt the multitude of condemned malefactors, he picked out you, commanded your fetters to be taken off, put a pardon in your hand, and brought you into the glorious liberty of the children of God; while he left others in the devil's fetters. (2) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member there was nothing in you to engage him to love you, in the day he firſt appeared for your deliverance Ye were children of wrath, even as others, fit for hell, and altogether unfit for heaven: yet the King brought you into the palace: the King's Son made love to you a condemned criminal, and eſpouſed you to himſelf, on the day in which ye might have had been led forth to execution. <hi>Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in the ſight,</hi> Matth ix. 26. (3) Remember, ye were fitter to be lothed than loved in that day. Wonder, that when he ſaw you in your blood, he looked not at you with abhorrence, and paſſed by you. Wonder that ever ſuch a time could be <hi>a time of love,</hi> Ezek xvi. 8. (4.) Remember, ye are decked with borrowed feathers. It is his comelineſs, which is upon you, ver 14. It was he that took off your priſon garments, and clothed you with robes of righteouſneſs, garments of ſalvation garments where with ye are arrayed as the lilies, which toil not, neither do they ſpin. He took the child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

arms, the rope from about your neck; put you in ſuch a dreſs as ye might be fit for the court of heaven, even to eat at the King's table. (5.) <hi>Remember your faults this day;</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s butler, who had forgotten <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Mind how you have forgotten, and how unkindly you have treated him, who remembred you in your low eſtate. <hi>Is this your kindneſs to your friend?</hi> In the day of your deliverance, did ye think, ye could have thus required him, your Lord?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pity the children of wrath, the world that lies in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Can ye be unconcerned for them, ye who were once in the ſame condition? Ye have got aſhore indeed, but your fellows are yet in hazard of periſhing; and will not ye make them all poſſible help for their deliverance? What they are, ye ſometimes were This may draw pity from you, and engage you to uſe all means for their recovery. See Tit. iii. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Admire that matchleſs love, which brought you out of the ſtate of wrath Chriſt's love was active love, he <hi>loved thy ſoul from the pit of corruption.</hi> It was no eaſy work to purchaſe the life of the condemned ſinner? but he gave his life for thy life. He gave his precious blood to quench that flame of wrath, which otherwiſe would have burnt thee up. Men get the beſt view of the ſtars, from the bottom of a deep pit: from this pit of miſery into which thou waſt caſt by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> thou mayſt get the beſt view of the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in all its dimenſions. He is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who took thee out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay. How broad were the ſkirts of that love, which covered ſuch a multitude of ſins! behold the length of it, reaching <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. ciii 17. The depth of it, going ſo low as to deliver thee <hi>from the loweſt hell,</hi> Pſal. lxxxvi. 13. The height of it, in raiſing thee up to <hi>ſit in heavenly places,</hi> Eph. ii. 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Be humble, carry low ſails, walk ſoftly all your years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be not proud of your gifts, graces, privileges, or attainments: but remember ye were children of wrath, even as others. The peacock walks ſlowly, hangs down his ſtarry feathers, while he looks to his black feet. <hi>Look ye to the hole of the pit, whence ye are digged,</hi> and walk humbly as it becomes free grace's debtors.</p>

If your Lord has delivered you from wrath, ye ought, upon that very account, to be wholly his: to act for him, to ſuffer for him and to do whatever he calls you to. The ſaints have no reaſon to complain of their lot in the world, whatever it be. Well may they bear the croſs for him, by whom the curſe was born away from them. Well may they bear the wrath of men, in his cauſe, who has freed them from the wrath of God; and chearfully go to a fire for him, by whom hell-fire is quenched to them.

thy ſoul is not overwhelmed with the wrath of God, is owing purely to Jeſus Chriſt; and ſhall it not then be a temple for his Spirit? That thy heart is not filled with horror and deſpair, is owing to him only; to whom then ſhould it be devoted but to him alone? That thine eyes are not blinded with the ſmoak of the pit, thy hands are not fertered with chains of darkneſs, thy tongue is not broiling in the fire of hell, and thy feet are not ſtanding in that lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, is owing purely to Jeſus Chriſt; and ſhall not theſe eyes be employed for him, theſe hands act for him, that tongue ſpeak for him, and theſe feet ſpeedily run his errands? To him who believes that he was a child of wrath, even as others, but is now delivered by the bleſſed Jeſus; nothing will appear too much, to do or ſuffer for his deliverer, when he has a fair call to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To conclude with a word to all; let no man think lightly of ſin, which lays the ſinner open to the wrath of God. Let not the ſin of our nature, which wreaths the yoke of God's wrath, ſo early, about our necks, ſeem a ſmall thing in our eyes. Fear the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his dreadful wrath. Tremble at the thought of ſin, againſt which God has ſuch fiery indignation. Look on his wrath, and ſtand in awe, and ſin not. Do you think this is to preſs you to ſlaviſh fear? If it were ſo, one had better be a ſlave to God with a trembling heart; than a free man to the devil, with a feared conſcience and a heart of adamant. But it is not ſo, you may love him, and thus fear him too; yea, ye ought to do it, though ye were ſaints of the firſt magnitude. See Pſal. cxix. 10. Matth. x. 28. Luke xii. 5. Heb. xii 28, 29. Altho' ye have paſt the gulf of wrath, being in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet it is but reaſonable, your hearts ſhiver, when ye look back to it. Your ſin ſtill deſerves wrath even as the ſins of others: and it would be terrible to be in a fiery furnace; altho' by a miracle, we were ſo fenced againſt it, as that it could not harm us.</p>

               <p>WE have now had a view of the total corruption of man's nature, and that load of wrath which lies on him, that gulf of miſery he is plunged into in his natural ſtate. But there's one part of his miſery that deſerves particular conſideration; namely, his utter inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to recover himſelf, the knowledge of which is neceſſary for the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:045042_0115_101F7DF347EF8268"/>
due humiliation of a ſinner. What I deſign here is, only to propoſe a few things, whereby to convince the unregenerate man of this his inability; that he may ſee an abſolute need of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the power of his grace.</p>
               <p>As a man that is fallen into a pit, cannot be ſuppoſed to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of it, but by one of two ways; either by doing all himſelf alone, or taking hold of, and improving the help offered him by others: ſo an unconverted man cannot be ſuppoſed to help himſelf out of that ſtate, but either in the way of the law, or covenant of warks, by doing all himſelf without Chriſt: or elſe in the way of the goſpel, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, by exerting his own ſtrength to lay hold upon, and to make uſe of the help offered him by a Saviour. But alas! the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted man is dead in the pit, and cannot help himſelf, either of theſe ways. Not the firſt way: for the firſt text tells us, that when our Lord came to help us, <hi>we were without ſtrength,</hi> unable to recover ourſelves. We were ungodly; therefore under a burden of guilt and wrath; yet without ſtrength, unable to ſtand under it: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to throw it off, or get from under it: ſo that all mankind had undoubtedly periſhed, had not Chriſt died for the ungodly, and brought help to them who could never have recovered themſelves But when Chriſt comes, and offereth help to ſinners, cannot they take it? Cannot they improve help when it comes to their hands? No, the ſecond text tells us, they cannot: <hi>No man can come unto me, (i e.</hi> believe in me, John vi. 35.) <hi>except the Father draw him.</hi> This is a drawing which enables them to come who till then could not come; and therefore could not help themſelves, by improving the help offered It is a drawing, which is always effectual; for it can be no leſs than hearing and learning of the Father, which whoſo partakes of, cometh to Chriſt, ver 25 Therefore, it is not drawing in the way of mere moral ſuaſion, which may be, yea, and always is ineffectual: but it is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by mighty power, Epheſ. i. 19 abſolutely neceſſary for them that have no power in themſelves, to come and take hold of the offered help.</p>
               <p>Hearken then, O unregenerate man, and be convinced, that as thou art in a moſt miſerable ſtate by nature; ſo thou art utterly unable to recover thyſelf, any manner of way. Thou art ruined; and what way wilt thou go to work, to recover thyſelf? Which of theſe two ways wilt thou chuſe? Wilt thou try it alone? Or wilt thou make uſe of help? Wilt thou fall on the way of works, or on the way of the goſpel? I know very well, thou wilt not ſo much as try the way of the goſpel, till once thou haſt found the recovery impracticable, in the way of the law. Therefore we ſhall begin, where corrupt nature teaches men to begin, <hi>viz.</hi> at the way of the law of works.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Sinner, I would have thee believe that thy working will never effect it. Work and do thy beſt; thou ſhalt never be able to work thyſelf out of this ſtate of corruption and wrath. Thou muſt have Chriſt, elſe thou ſhalt periſh eternally. It is only Chriſt in you, can be the hope of glory. But if thou wilt needs try it; then I muſt lay
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:045042_0116_101F7DF6DAA63460"/>
before thee, from the unalterable word of the living God, two things which thou muſt do for thyſelf. And if thou canſt do them: it muſt be yielded, that thou art able to recover thyſelf; but if not, then thou canſt do nothing this way, for thy recovery.</p>
               <p>FIRST, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,</hi> Matth. xix. 17. That is, if thou wilt by doing, enter into life, then perfectly keep the ten commands. For the ſcope of theſe words is, to beat down the pride of man's heart; and to let him ſee the abſolute need of a Saviour, from the impoſſibility of keeping the law. The anſwer is given, ſuitable to the addreſs. Our Lord checks him for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, <hi>Good Maſter,</hi> ver. 16. telling him, <hi>There is none good, but One, that is God,</hi> ver. 17. As if he had ſaid, you think yourſelf a good man, and me another? but where goodneſs is ſpoken of, men and angels may vail their faces before the good God. And as to his queſtion, wherein he diſcovered his legal diſpoſition, Chriſt does not anſwer him, ſaying, <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> that would not have been ſo ſeaſonable in the caſe of one, who thought he could do well enough for himſelf, if he but knew, what good things he ſhould do; but, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the humour the man was in, he bid him <hi>keep the commandments;</hi> keep them nicely and accurately, as thoſe that watch malefactors in priſon, leſt any of them eſcape, and their life go for their's. See then, O unregenerate man, what canſt thou do in this matter; for if thou wilt recover thyſelf in this way, thou muſt perfectly keep the commandments of God.</p>
               <p>And, (1.) Thy obedience muſt be perfect, in reſpect of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of it; that is, thy ſoul, the principle of action, muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure, and altogether without ſin. For the law requires all moral perfection; not only actual, but habitual, and ſo condemns original ſin; impurity of nature, as well as of actions. Now, if thou canſt bring this to paſs; thou ſhalt be able to anſwer that queſtion of Solomon's, ſo, as never one of Adam's poſterity could yet anſwer it, Prov. xx 9 <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean?</hi> But if thou canſt not, the very want of this perfection is a ſin; and ſo lays thee open to the curſe, and cuts thee off from life. Yea, it makes all thine actions, even thy beſt actions ſinful, <hi>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Job xiv. 4. And doſt thou think by ſin, to help thyſelf out of ſin and miſery? (2.) Thy obedience muſt alſo be perfect in parts. It muſt be as broad as the whole law of God: if thou lackeſt one thing, thou art undone; for the law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the curſe on him that continueth not in every thing written therein, Gal. iii. 10. Thou muſt give internal and external obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the whole law; keep all the commands, in heart and life. If thou breakeſt any one of them, that will inſure thy ruin. A vain thought, or idle word, will ſtill ſhut thee up under the curſe. (3.) It muſt be perfect in reſpect of degrees; as was the obedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> while he ſtood in his innocence. This the law requires, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of no leſs, Mat. xxii. 37. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:045042_0117_101F7DFA9AC55908"/>
all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind.</hi> If one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that love required by the law, be wanting; if each part of thy obedience be not ſcrewed up to the greateſt height commanded; that want is a breach of the law, and ſo leaves thee ſtill under the curſe. One may bring as many buckets of water to a houſe that is on fire, as he is able to carry, and yet it may be conſumed; and will be ſo, if he bring not as many as will quench the fire. Even ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou ſhouldſt do what thou art able, in keeping the commands; if thou fail in the leaſt degree of obedience which the law enjoins, thou art certainly ruined for ever; unleſs thou take hold of Chriſt, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all thy righteouſneſs as filthy rags. See Rom. x. 5. Gal. iii. 10. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It muſt be perpetual, as the man Chriſt's obedience was, who always did the things that pleaſed the Father; for the tenor of the law is, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things written in the law, to do them.</hi> Hence, tho' <hi>Adam</hi>'s obedience was for a while abſolutely perfect; yet becauſe at length he tripped in one point, <hi>viz.</hi> in eating the forbidden fruit, he fell under the curſe of the law. If one ſhould live a dutiful ſubject to his prince, till the cloſe of his days, and then conſpire againſt him; he muſt die for his treaſon. Even ſo, tho' thou ſhouldſt, all the time of thy life, live in perfect obedience to the law of God; and only, at the hour of death, entertain a vain thought, or pronounce an idle word: that idle word, or vain thought, would blot out all thy former righteouſneſs, and ruin thee; namely, in this way, in which thou art ſeeking to recover thyſelf.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch is the obedience thou muſt perform, if thou wouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thyſelf in the way of the law. But tho' thou ſhouldſt thus obey: the law ſtakes thee down in the ſtate of wrath, till another demand of it be ſatisfied, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, Thou muſt pay what thou oweſt It is undeniable thou art a ſinner; and whatever thou mayeſt be in time to come, juſtice muſt be ſatisfied for thy ſin already committed. The honour of the law muſt be maintained, by thy ſuffering the denounced wrath. It may be thou haſt changed thy courſe of life, or art now reſolved to do it, and ſet about the keeping of the commands of God: but what haſt thou done, or what wilt thou do, with the old debt? Your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, tho' it were perfect, is a debt due to him, for the time wherein it is performed; and can no more ſatisfy for former ſins, than a tenant's paying the current year's rent, can ſatisfy the maſter for all bygones. Can the paying of new debts acquit a man from old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts? Nay, deceive not yourſelves, you will find theſe laid up in ſtore with God, <hi>and ſealed up among his treaſures,</hi> Deut. xxxii. 34. It remains then, that either thou muſt bear that wrath, to which, for thy ſin, thou art liable according to the law; or elſe, thou muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thou canſt not bear it, and thereupon have recourſe to the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Let me now aſk thee, art thou able to ſatisfy the juſtice of God? Canſt thou pay thy own debt? Surely not: for, ſeeing he is an infinite God, whom thou haſt offended; the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:045042_0118_101F7E00C2646188"/>
puniſhment, being ſuited to the quality of the offence, muſt be infinite. But ſo it is, thy puniſhment, or ſufferings for ſin, cannot be infinite in value, ſeeing thou art a finite creature: therefore they muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in duration or continuance; that is, they muſt be eternal. And ſo all thy ſufferings in this world, are but an earneſt of what thou muſt ſuffer in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Now, ſinner, if thou canſt anſwer theſe demands, thou mayſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thyſelf in the way of the law. But art thou not conſcious of thy inability to do any of theſe things, much more to do them all? Yet if thou do not all, thou doſt nothing. Turn then to what courſe of life thou wilt, thou art ſtill in a ſtate of wrath. Screw up thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the greateſt height thou canſt; ſuffer what God lays upon thee, yea add, if thou wilt to the burden, and walk under all, without the leaſt impatience: yet all this will not ſatisfy the demands of the law; and therefore thou art ſtill a ruined creature. Alas! ſinner, what art thou doing, while thou ſtriveſt to help thyſelf; but doſt not receive and unite with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Thou art labouring in the fire, wearying thyſelf for very vanity; labouring to enter into heaven by the door, which <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin ſo bolted, as neither he, nor any of his loſt poſterity can ever enter by it. Doſt thou not ſee the flaming ſword of juſtice keeping thee off from the tree of life? Doſt thou not hear the law denouncing a curſe on thee for all thou art doing; even for thy obedience, thy prayers, thy tears, thy reformation of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe being under the law's dominion, thy beſt works are not ſo good, as it requires them to be, under the pain of the curſe? Believe it, ſirs, if you live and die out of Chriſt, without being actually united to him as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> a life-giving Spirit, and without coming under the covert of his atoning blood; though you ſhould do the utmoſt that any man on earth can do, in keeping the commands of GOD, ye ſhall never ſee the face of GOD in peace. If you ſhould from this moment, bid an eternal farewel to this world's joy, and all the affairs thereof; and henceforth buſy yourſelves with nothing, but the ſalvation of your ſouls: if you ſhould go into ſome wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, live upon the graſs of the field, and be companions of dragons and owls: if you ſhould retire to ſome dark cavern of the earth, and weep there for your ſins, until ye have wept yourſelves blind yea, wept out all the moiſture of your body; if ye ſhould confeſs with your tongue, until it cleave to the roof of your mouth; pray, till your knees grow hard as horns; faſt, till your body become like a ſkeleton; and after all this, give it to be burnt, the word is gone out of the Lord's mouth in righteouſneſs, and cannot return; you ſhould periſh for ever, notwithſtanding of all this, as not being in Chriſt, John xiv. 6. <hi>No man cometh unto the Father but by me.</hi> Acts iv. 12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other.</hi> Mark xvi. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> (1.) Though thou art able to do many things, thou art not able to do one thing aright: thou canſt do nothing acceptable to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Chriſt, John xv. 5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed man, as thou art, can do nothing but ſin; as we have already evinced. Thy beſt actions are ſin, and ſo they increaſe thy debt to juſtice; how then can it be expected they ſhould leſſen it? (2) If God ſhould offer to ſave men upon condition that they did all they could do, in obedience to his commands: we have ground to think, that theſe who would betake themſelves to that way, ſhould never be ſaved. For where is the man, that does <hi>as well as he can?</hi> Who ſees not many falſe ſteps he has made, which he might have evited? There are ſo many things to be done, ſo many temptations to carry us out of the road of duty, and our nature is ſo very apt to be ſet on fire of hell; that we would ſurely fail, even in ſome point, that is within the compaſs of our natural abilities. But (3.) Though thou ſhouldſt do all thou art able to do, in vain doſt thou hope to be ſaved in that way. What word of God is this hope of thine founded on? It is neither founded on law nor goſpel, and therefore it is but a deluſion. It is not founded on the goſpel; for the goſpel leads the ſoul out of itſelf, to Jeſus Chriſt for all: and it <hi>eſtabliſheth the law,</hi> Rom. iii. 31. whereas this hope of yours cannot be eſtabliſhed, but on the ruin of the law, which God will <hi>magnify and make honourable.</hi> And hence it appears, that it is not founded on the law neither. When God ſet <hi>Adam</hi> a working for happineſs to himſelf, and his poſterity, perfect obedience was the condition required of him; and a curſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in caſe of diſobedience. The law being broken by him, he and his poſterity were ſubjected to the penalty, for ſin committed; and withal ſtill bound to perfect obedience: for it is abſurd to think that man's ſinning and ſuffering for his ſin, ſhould free him from his duty of obedience to his Creator. When Chriſt came in the room of the elect, to purchaſe their ſalvation, the ſame were the terms. Juſtice had the elect under arreſt: if he minds to deliver them, the terms are known. He muſt ſatisfy for their ſin, by ſuffering the puniſhment due to it; he muſt do what they cannot do, viz. <hi>obey</hi> the law perfectly, and ſo fulfil all righteouſneſs. Accordingly, all this he did, and ſo became <hi>the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom x. 4. And now doſt thou think God will abate of theſe terms to thee, when his own Son got no abatement of them? Expect it not, though thou ſhouldſt beg it with tears of blood; for if they prevailed, they behoved to prevail againſt the truth, juſtice and honour of God, Gal. iii. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

fleſh?</hi> He has provided help for them that cannot help themſelves: but thou, inſenſible of thine own weakneſs, wilt needs think to recover thyſelf by thine own works; while thou art no more able to do it, than to remove mountains of braſs out of their place</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude thou art utterly unable to recover thyſelf, by the way of works, or of the law. O that thou wouldſt conclude the ſame concerning thyſelf!</p>
               <p n="2">II. Let us try next, what the ſinner can do to recover himſelf, in the way of the goſpel: It is likely, thou thinkeſt, that howbeit thou canſt not do all, by thyſelf alone; yet Jeſus Chriſt offering thee help, thou canſt of thyſelf embrace it, and uſe it to thy recovery. But, O ſinner, be convinced of thine abſolute need of the grace of Chriſt, for truly there is help offered, but thou canſt not accept of it: there is a rope caſt out to hale ſhip-wrecked ſinners to land: but alas! they have no hands to catch hold of it. They are like infants expoſed in the open field, that muſt ſtarve, tho' their food be lying by them, unleſs one put it into their mouths. To convince natural men of this, let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That although Chriſt is offered in the goſpel, yet they cannot believe in him. Saving faith is <hi>the faith of God's elect;</hi> the ſpecial gift of God to them, wrought in them by his Spirit. Salvation is offered to them that will believe in Chriſt; but how can ye believe? John v. 44. It is offered to theſe that will come to Chriſt; but <hi>no man can come unto him, except the Father draw him.</hi> It is offered to them that will look to him, as lifted up on the pole of the goſpel, Iſa. xiv 22. but the natural man is ſpiritually blind. Rev iii. 17. and as to the things of the Spirit of God, he cannot know them, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 Cor. ii. 14. Nay, whoſoever will, he is welcome; let him come. Rev. xxii. 17. But there muſt be a day of power on the ſinner, before he will be willing, Pſal cx. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man naturally has nothing, wherewithal to improve, to his recovery, the help brought in by the goſpel. He is caſt away in a ſtate of wrath; but is bound hand and foot, ſo that he cannot lay hold of the cords of love, thrown out to him in the goſpel. The moſt ſkilful artificer cannot work without inſtruments, nor can the moſt cunning muſician play well on an inſtrument that is out of tune. How can one believe, how can he repent, whoſe underſtanding is darkneſs, Eph. v 8 whoſe heart is a ſtony heart, inflexible, inſenſible, Ezek. xxxvi. 26. whoſe affections are wholly diſordered and dſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered; who is averſe to good, and bent to evil? The arms of natural abilities are too ſhort to reach ſupernatural help: hence thoſe who moſt excel in them, are oft times moſt eſtranged from ſpiritual things, Matth. xi 24 <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Man cannot work a ſaving change on himſelf: but ſo changed he muſt be, elſe he can neither believe nor repent, nor ever ſee heaven No action can be without a ſuitable principle. Believing, repenting, and the like, are the product of the new nature; and can

effect. Now, we having, by our own fault, diſabled ourſelves; ſhall God loſe his right of requiring our taſk, becauſe we have thrown away the ſtrength he gave us, wherewithal to perform it? Has the creditor no right to require payment of his money, becauſe the debitor has ſquandered it away, and is not able to pay him? Truly, if God can require no more of us than we are able to do; we need no more to ſave us from wrath, but to make ourſelves unable for every duty, and to incapacitate ourſelves for ſerving of God any manner of way, as profane men frequently do: and ſo the deeper one is immerſed in ſin, he will be the more ſecure from wrath; for where God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no duty of us, we do not ſin in omitting it; and where there is no ſin, there can be no wrath. (As to what may be urged by the unhumbled ſoul, againſt the putting of our ſtock in <hi>Adam</hi>'s hand; the righteouſneſs of that diſpenſation was cleared before.) But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the unrenewed man is daily throwing away the very remains of natural abilities; that light and ſtrength which are to be found amongſt the ruins of mankind. Nay, farther, he will not believe his own utter inability to help himſelf; ſo that out of his own mouth he will be condemned. Even thoſe who make their natural impotency to good, a cover to their ſloth, do, with others, delay the work of turning to God from time to time; under convictions, make large promiſes of reformation, which afterward they never regard; and delay their repentance to a death-bed, as if they could help themſelves in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which ſpeaks them to be far from a due ſenſe of their natural inability, whatever they pretend.</p>
               <p>Now, if God can require of men, the duty they are not able to do; he can, in juſtice, puniſh them for their not doing it, notwithſtanding of their inability. If he have power to exact the debt of obedience, he has alſo power to caſt the inſolvent debtor in his priſon, for his not paying it. Further, tho' unregenerate men have no gracious abilities; yet they want not natural abilities, which nevertheleſs they will not improve. There are many things they can do, which they do not, they will not do them; and therefore, their damnation will be juſt, Nay, all their inability to good is voluntary; they will not come to Chriſt, John v. 40. They will not repent, they will die, Ezek. xviii. 51. So they will be juſtly condemned: becauſe they will not turn to God, nor come to Chriſt; but love their chains better than their liberty, and darkneſs rather than light, John iii. 10.</p>

It is your duty to accept of Chriſt as he is offered in the goſpel; to repent of your ſins, and to be holy in all manner of converſation: theſe things are commanded you of God; and his command, not your ability, is the meaſure of your duty. Moreover, theſe calls and exhortations, are the means that God is pleaſed to make uſe of, for converting his elect, and working grace in their hearts: to them, <hi>faith cometh by hearing,</hi> Rom. x. 17. while they
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:045042_0123_101F7E11EA66B4B0"/>
are as unable to help themſelves as the reſt of mankind are. Upon very good grounds may we, at the command of God, <hi>who raiſeth the dead,</hi> go to their graves, and cry in his name, <hi>awake thou that ſleepeſt, and riſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Eph. v. 14. And ſeeing the elect are not to be known, and diſtinguiſhed from others before converſion: as the ſun ſhines on the blind man's face, and the rain falls on the rocks as well as on the fruitful plains; ſo we preach Chriſt to all, and ſhoot the arrow at a venture, which God himſelf directs as he ſees meet. Moreover theſe calls and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not altogether in vain, even to thoſe that are not converted by them. Such perſons may be convinced, tho' they be not converted: altho' they be not ſanctified by theſe means; yet they may be reſtrained by them, from running into that exceſs of wickedneſs, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would arrive at. The means of grace ſerve, as it were, to embalm many dead ſouls, which are never quickned by them; tho' they do not reſtore them to life; yet they keep them from ſmelling ſo rank as otherwiſe they would do. <hi>Finally,</hi> Tho' ye cannot recover yourſelves; nor take hold of the ſaving help offered to you in the goſpel: yet even by the power of nature, ye may uſe the outward and ordinary means, whereby Chriſt communicates the benefits of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ruined ſinners, who are utterly unable to recover themſelves out of the ſtate of ſin and wrath. Ye may, and can, if ye pleaſe, do many things, that would ſet you in a fair way for help from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Ye may go ſo far on, as to be not far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as the diſcreet ſcribe had done, Mark xii. 34. tho' (it would ſeem) he was deſtitute of ſupernatural abilities. Tho' ye cannot cure yourſelves; yet ye may come to the pool, where many ſuch diſeaſed perſons as ye are, have been cured: ye have none to put you into it, yet ye may ly at the ſide of it: and <hi>who knows but the Lord may return, and leave a bleſſing behind him,</hi> as in the caſe of the impotent man, recorded, John v 5, 6, 7, 8. I hope Satan does not chain you to your houſes, nor ſtake you down in your fields on the Lord's day; but ye are at liberty, and can wait at the poſts of wiſdom's door, if ye will. And when ye come thither, he doth not beat drums at your ears, that ye cannot hear what is ſaid: there is no force upon you obliging you to apply all you hear to others; ye may apply to yourſelves what belongs to your ſtate and condition: and when you go home, you are not fettered in your houſes, where perhaps no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious diſcourſe is to be heard; but ye may retire to ſome ſeparate place, where ye can meditate, and poſe your conſcience with pertinent queſtions, upon what ye have heard. Ye are not poſſeſſed with a dumb devil, that ye cannot get your mouths opened in prayer to God. Ye are not ſo driven out of your beds to your worldly buſineſs, and from your worldly buſineſs to your beds again; but ye might, if ye would, beſtow ſome prayers to God upon the caſe of your periſhing ſouls. Ye may examine yourſelves, as to the ſtate of your ſouls, in a ſolemn manner, as in the preſence of God; ye may diſcern that ye

have no grace, and that ye are loſt and undone without it; and may cry unto God for it. Theſe things are within the compaſs of natural abilities, and may be practiſed where there is no grace. It muſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate your guilt, that you will not be at ſo much pains about the ſtate and caſe of your precious ſouls. And if ye do not what you can do: ye will be condemned, not only for your want of grace, but for your deſpiſing of it.</p>

Ye will do for yourſelves, as if ye were to do all; and yet overlook all ye do, as if ye had done nothing. Will ye do nothing for yourſelves, becauſe ye cannot do all?

of their utmoſt endeavours to ſave themſelves: yet the very poſſibility of eſcaping by that means, would determine that one, ſtill to do his beſt with his board. Why then do ye not reaſon with yourſelves, as the four lepers did, who ſat at the gates of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 Kings vii. 3, 4.

               <p>To conclude, let the ſaints admire the freedom and power of grace, which came to them in their helpleſs condition, made their chains fall off, the iron gate to open to them, raiſed the fallen creatures; and brought them out of the ſtate of ſin and wrath, wherein they would have lain and periſhed, had they not been mercifully viſited. Let the natural man be ſenſible of his utter inability to recover himſelf. Know thou art without ſtrength; and canſt not come to Chriſt, till thou be drawn. Thou art loſt, and canſt not help thyſelf. This may ſhake the foundation of thy nopes, who never ſaweſt thy abſolute need of Chriſt and his grace; but thinkeſt to ſhift for thyſelf, by thy civility, morality, drowſy wiſhes and duties; and by a faith and repentance, which have ſprung up out of thy natural powers, without the power and efficacy of the grace of Chriſt.

               <p>WE proceed now to the ſtate of grace, the ſtate of begun recovery of human nature, into which, all that ſhall partake of eternal happineſs, are tranſlated, ſooner, or later, while in this world. It is the reſult of a gracious change, made upon theſe who ſhall inherit eternal life; which change may be taken up in theſe two, (1.) In oppoſition to their natural real ſtate, the ſtate of corruption, there is a change made upon them in regeneration; whereby their nature is changed. (2.) In oppoſition to their natural relative ſtate, the ſtate of wrath, there is a change made upon them, in their union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; by which they are ſet beyond the reach of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Theſe therefore, namely, regeneration, and union with Chriſt, I deſign to handle, as the great and comprehenſive changes on a ſinner, conſtituting him in the ſtate of grace.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe we have in the text, together with the outward and ordinary means, by which it is brought about. The apoſtle here, to excite the ſaints to the ſtudy of holineſs, and particularly of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, put them in mind of their ſpiritual original. He tells them they were born again; and that of incorruptible ſeed, <hi>the word of God.</hi> This ſpeaks them to be brethren, partakers of the ſame new nature; which is the root from which holineſs, and particularly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, doth ſpring. We are once ſinners; we muſt be born again, that we may be ſaints. The ſimple word ſignifies <hi>to be begotten;</hi> and ſo it may be read, Matth. xi. 11. <hi>to be conceived,</hi> Matth. i. 20 and <hi>to be born,</hi> Matth ii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. According, the compound word uſed in the text, may be taken in its full latitude, the laſt notion preſuppoſing the two former: and ſo regeneration is a ſupernatural real change on the whole man, fitly compared to natural or corporal generation, as will afterward appear. The ordinary means of regeneration called

                  <hi>the ſeed,</hi> whereof the new creature is formed, is not corruptible ſeed. Of ſuch indeed, our bodies are generated: but the ſpiritual ſeed, of which the new creature is generated, is incorruptible; namely, <hi>the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> The ſound of the word of God, paſſeth even as other ſounds do: but the word laſteth, liveth and abideth, in reſpect of its everlaſting effects on all upon whom it operates This word, <hi>which by the goſpel is preached unto you,</hi> (ver. 25.) impregnated by the Spirit of God, is the means of regeneration; and by it are dead ſinners raiſed to life.</p>
               <p>DOCTRINE. <hi>All men in the ſtate of grace are born again.</hi> All gracious perſons, namely, ſuch as are in a ſtate of favour with God, and endued with gracious qualities and diſpoſitions, are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons In diſcourſing this ſubject, I ſhall ſhew what regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is: <hi>Next,</hi> Why it is ſo called, and then apply the doctrine.</p>

To remove ſuch miſtakes, let theſe few things be conſidered. (1.) Many call the church their mother, whom God will not own to be his children, Cant. i. 6. <hi>My mother s children (i. e.</hi> falſe brethren) <hi>were angry with me.</hi> All that are baptized are not born again. <hi>Simon</hi> was baptized, yet ſtill <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity,</hi> Acts viii. 13, 23. Where Chriſtianity is the religion of the country, many will be called by the name of Chriſt, who have no more of him, but the name: and no wonder, ſeeing the devil had his goats among Chriſt's ſheep, in theſe places, where but few profeſſed the Chriſtian religion, 1 John ii. 19. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us.</hi> (2) Good education is not regeneration.

Good example is of mighty influence to change the outward man; but that change often goes off, when one changes his company; of which the world affords many ſad inſtances. (3.) A turning from open profanity, to civility and ſobriety, falls ſhort of this ſaving change.

Men may advance to a great deal of ſtrictneſs in their own way of religion; and yet be ſtrangers to the new birth, Acts xxxvi. 5. <hi>After the moſt ſtricteſt ſect of our religion, I lived a Phariſee.</hi> Nature has its own unſanctified ſtrictneſs in religion. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> had ſo much of it, that they looked on Chriſt as little better than a mere libertine. A man whoſe conſcience hath been awakened, and who lives under the felt influence of the covenant of works, what will he not do, that is within the compaſs of natural abilities? It was a truth, tho' it came out of a helliſh mouth, that <hi>ſkin for ſkin, all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi> Job ii. 4. (6.) One may have ſharp ſoul-exerciſes and pangs, and yet die in the birth. Many have been in pain, that have but as it were brought forth wind. There may be ſore pangs and throws of conſcience, which turn to nothing at laſt. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had ſuch convictions, as made them deſire the prayers of others for them. <hi>Judas repented himſelf;</hi> and under terrors of conſcience, gave back his ill-gotten pieces of ſilver. All is not gold that gliſters. Trees may bloſſom fairly in the ſpring, on which no fruit is to be found in the harveſt: and ſome have ſharp ſoul-exerciſes, which are nothing but foretaſtes of hell.</p>
                  <p>The new birth, however in appearance hopefully begun, may be marred two ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some, like <hi>Zarah,</hi> Gen. xxxviii 28, 29 are brought to the birth, but go back again. They have ſharp convictions for a while: but theſe go off, and they turn as careleſs about their ſalvation, as profane as ever: and uſually worſe than ever, <hi>their laſt ſtate is worſe than their firſt,</hi> Mat. xii. 45. They get awakening grace, but not converting grace; and that goes off by degrees, as the light of the declining day, till it iſſue in midnight darkneſs. <hi>Secondly</hi> Some like <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> come forth too ſoon; they are born before the time of the promiſe, Gen xvi. 1, 2. compare Gal. iv. 22. and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. They take up with a mere law-work, and ſtay not till the time of the promiſe of the goſpel.

of the affections, in ſouls that are not at all touched with regenerating grace Where there is no grace, there may, notwithſtanding, be a flood of tears as in <hi>Eſau, who found no place of repentance, tho' he ſought it carefully with tears,</hi> Heb xii. 17. There may be great flaſhes of joy; as in the hearers of the word, repreſented in the parable by the ſtony ground, who anon with <hi>joy receive it,</hi> Matth. xiii. 20. There may alſo be great deſire after good things, and great delight in them too; as in theſe hypocrites deſcribed, Iſa lviii. 2. <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways.—They take delight in approaching unto God.</hi> See how high they may ſometimes ſtand, who yet fall away, Heb. vi. 4, 5, 6 They may be <hi>enlightned, taſte of the heavenly gift, be partakers of the holy Ghoſt, taſte the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come</hi> Common operations of the divine Spirit, like a land flood, make a ſtrange turning of things up-ſide-down. And when they are over, all runs again in the ordinary channel. All theſe things may be, where the ſanctifying Spirit of Chriſt never reſts upon the ſoul, but the ſtony heart ſtill remains; and in that caſe, theſe affections cannot but <hi>wither becauſe they have no root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But regeneration is a real thorough change, whereby the man is made a new creature, 2 Cor. v. 17. The Lord God makes the creature a new creature, as the goldſmith melts down the veſſel of diſhonour and makes it a veſſel of honour. Man is, in reſpect of his natural ſtate, altogether disjointed by the fall; every faculty of the ſoul is, as it were, diſlocate: in regeneration the Lord looſeth every joint, and ſets it right again. Now this change made in regeneration is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A change of qualities or diſpoſitions: it is not a change of the ſubſtance, but of the qualities of the ſoul. Vicious qualities are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the contrary diſpoſitions are brought in, in their room. <hi>The old man is put off,</hi> Eph. iv. 22. <hi>the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w man put on,</hi> ver. 24. Man loſt none of the rational faculties of his ſoul by ſin; he had an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtill, but it was darkened; he had ſtill a will, but it was contrary to the will of God. So in regeneration there is not a new ſubſtance created, but new qualities are infuſed; light inſtead of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, righteouſneſs inſtead of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a ſupernatural change; he that is born again, is born of the Spirit, John iii 5. Great changes may be made by the power of nature, eſpecially when aſſiſted by external revelation. And nature may be ſo elevated by the common influences of the Spirit, that one may thereby be turned into another man, (as <hi>Soul</hi> was, 1 Sam. x 6.) who yet never becomes a new man. But in regeneration nature itſelf is changed, and we become partakers of the divine nature; and this muſt needs be a ſupernatural change. How can we that are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, renew ourſelves, more than a dead man can raiſe himſelf out of his grave? Who, but the ſanctifying Spirit of Chriſt, can form Chriſt in a ſoul, changing it into the ſame image? Who, but the Spirit of ſanctification can give the new heart? Well may we ſay, when we ſee a man thus changed, <hi>This is the finger of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="133" facs="unknown:045042_0130_101F7E2DC7D3E030"/>3. It is a change into the likeneſs of God, 2 Cor iii. 18. <hi>We— beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</hi> Every thing that generates, generates its like: the child bears the image of the parent; and they that are born of God, bear God's image. Man aſpiring to be as God, made himſelf like the devil. In his natural ſtate he reſembles the devil, as a child doth the father, John viii 44. <hi>Ye are of your father the devil.</hi> But when this happy change comes, the image of Satan is defaced, and the image of God reſtored. Chriſt himſelf, who <hi>is the brightneſs of his Father's glory,</hi> is the pattern, after which the new creature is made, Rom. viii 29. <hi>For whom he did for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>know, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son</hi> Hence he is ſaid to be conformed in the regenerate, Gal. iv. 19.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is an univerſal change; all things become new, 2 Cor. vi. 17. It is a bleſt leaven that leavens the whole lump, the whole ſpirit, and ſoul and body. Original ſin infects the whole man; and regenerating grace, which is the ſalve, goes as far as the ſore. This fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſs; goodneſs of the mind, goodneſs of the will, goodneſs of the affections, goodneſs of the whole man One gets not only a new head to know religion, or a new tongue to talk of it; but a new heart to love and embrace it, in the whole of his converſation. When the Lord opens the ſluice of grace on the ſoul's new birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the waters run through the whole man, to purify and make him fruitful. In theſe natural changes ſpoken of before, there are, as it were, pieces of new cloth put into an old garment; a new life ſewed to an old heart: but the gracious change is a thorough change, a change both of heart and life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet it is but an imperfect change. Tho' every part of the man is renewed, there is no part of him perfectly renewed. As an infant has all the parts of a man, but none of them are come to their perfect growth; ſo regeneration brings a perfection of parts, to be brought forward in the gradual advances of ſanctification, 1 Pet ii. 2. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> Although in regeneration there is a heavenly light let into the mind; yet there is ſtill ſome darkneſs there: tho' the will is renewed, it is not perfectly renewed; there is ſtill ſome of the old inclination to ſin remaining: and thus it will be till that which is in part be done away, and the light of glory come <hi>Adam</hi> was created at his full ſtature; but they that are born, muſt have their time to grow up; ſo theſe that are born again, do come forth into the new world of grace, but imperfectly holy; though <hi>Adam,</hi> being created upright, was at the ſame time perfectly righteous, without the leaſt mixture of ſinful imperfection</p>

                  <p>But to come to particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> In regeneration the mind is ſavingly enlightned. There is a new light let into the underſtanding, ſo that they who were <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times darkneſs, are now light in the Lord,</hi> Eph. v 8. The beams of the light of life make their way into the dark dungeon of the heart: then night is over, and the morning-light is come, which will ſhine more and more unto the perfect day. Now the man is illuminated,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the knowledge of God. He has far other thoughts of God, than ever he had before, Hoſ. ii. 20. <hi>I will even betrothe thee unto me in faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> The Spirit of the Lord brings him back to that queſtion, <hi>What is God?</hi> And catechiſeth him anew upon that grand point, ſo as he is made to ſay, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eyes ſeeth thee,</hi> Job xlii. 5. The ſpotleſs purity of God, his exact juſtice, his all-ſufficiency, and other glorious perfections revealed in his word, are, by this new light, diſcovered to the ſoul, with a plainneſs and certainty that doth as far exceed the knowledge it had of theſe things before, as ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration exceeds common fame. For now he ſees what he only heard of before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is enlightned in the knowledge of ſin. He hath other thoughts of it, than he was wont to have. Formerly his ſight could not pierce thro' the cover Satan laid over it: but now the Spirit of God ſtrips it before him, wipes off the paint and fairding; and he ſees it in its native colours, as the worſt of evils: exceeding ſinful, Rom. vii. 12. O what deformed monſters do formerly beloved luſts appear! were they right eyes, he would pluck them out: were they right hands, he would conſent to their cutting off. He ſees how offenſive ſin is to God, how deſtructive it is to the ſoul; and calls himſelf fool, for fighting ſo long againſt the Lord, and harbouring that deſtroyer as a boſom friend.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is inſtructed in the knowledge of himſelf. Regenerating grace cauſeth the prodigal to come to himſelf, Luke xv 17. and makes men full of eyes within, knowing every one <hi>the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>e of his own heart.</hi> The mind being ſavingly enlightned, the man ſees how deſperately corrupt his nature is; what enmity againſt God and his holy law has long lodged there: ſo that his ſoul lothes itſelf. No open ſepulchre, no puddle, ſo vile and loathſome in his eyes as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Ezek. xxxvi 31. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall lothe yourſelves in your own ſight</hi> He is no worſe than he was before: but the ſun is ſhining: and ſo theſe pollutions are ſeen, which he could not diſcern, when there was no dawning in him: as the word is, Iſa. viii. 20. while as yet the day of grace was not broken with him.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="135" facs="unknown:045042_0132_101F7E3417ED61A8"/>4. He is enlightned in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor. i. 23, 24. <hi>But we preach Chriſt crucified, unto the Jews a ſtumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooliſhneſs: but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt, the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> The truth is, unregenerate men, tho' capable of preaching Chriſt, have not (properly ſpeaking) the knowledge of him, but only an opinion, a good opinion of him; as one has of many controverted points of doctrine, wherein he is far from certainty. As when ye meet with a ſtranger upon the road, he behaving himſelf diſcreetly, ye conceive a good opinion of him; and therefore willingly converſe with him; but yet ye will not commit your money to him; becauſe, tho' you have a good opinion of the man, he is a ſtranger to you, ye do not know him. So many, they think well of Chriſt; but they will never commit themſelves to him; ſeeing they know him not. But ſaving illumination carries the ſoul beyond opinion, to the certain knowledge of Chriſt and his excellency, 1 Theſſ. i. 5. <hi>For our goſpel came not unto you in word only, but alſo in power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> The light of grace thus diſcovers the ſuitableneſs of the myſtery of Chriſt, to the divine perfections, and to the ſinner's caſe. Hence the regenerate admire the glorious plan of ſalvation through Chriſt crucified, lay their whole weight upon it, and heartily acquieſce therein: for whatever he be to others, he is to them <hi>Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> But unrenewed men, not ſeeing this, are offended in him; they will not venture their ſouls in that bottom, but betake themſelves to the broken boards of their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſame light convincingly diſcovers a ſuperlative worth, a tranſcendant glory and excellency in Chriſt; which darken all created excellencies, as the riſing ſun makes the ſtars to hide their heads: and ſo it engages <hi>the merchant-man to ſell all that he hath, to buy the one pearl of great price,</hi> Matth. xiii. 45, 46. makes the ſoul well content, to take Chriſt for all, and inſtead of all. Even as an unſkilful merchant, to whom one offereth a pearl of great price, for all his petty wares, dares not venture on the bargain; for tho' he thinks, that one pearl may be more worth than all he has, yet he is not ſure of it: but when a jeweller comes to him, and aſſures him, it is worth double all his wares; he then greedily embraceth the bargain, and chearfully parts with all that he has for that pearl. <hi>Finally,</hi> This illumination in the knowledge of Chriſt, convincingly diſcovereth to men a fulneſs in him, ſufficient for the ſupply of all their wants; enough to ſatisfy the boundleſs deſires of an immortal ſoul They are perſuaded ſuch ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in him, and that in order to be communicate: they depend upon it, as a certain truth; and therefore their ſouls take up their eternal reſt in him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The man is inſtructed in the knowledge of the vanity of the world, Pſal. cxix. 96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection.</hi> Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating grace elevates the ſoul, ſets it, as it were, amongſt the ſtars, from whence this earth cannot but appear a little, yea, a very little
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:045042_0133_101F7E371125B1B8"/>
thing; even as heaven appeared before, while the ſoul was immerſed in the earth. Grace brings a man into a new world; while this world is reputed but a ſtage of vanity, an howling wilderneſs, a valley of tears. God hath hung the ſign of vanity at the door of all created enjoyments; yet how do men throng into the houſe, calling and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſomewhat that is ſatisfying; even after it has been a thouſand times told them, there is no ſuch thing in it, it is not to be got there, Iſa. lvi. 10. <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy ways; yet ſaidſt thou not, There is no hope.</hi> Why are men ſo fooliſh? The truth of the matter lies here, they do not ſee by the light of grace, they do not ſpiritually diſcern, that ſign of vanity They have often indeed made a rational diſcovery of it: but can that truly wean the heart from the world? Nay, no more than painted fire can burn off the priſoner's bands. But the light of grace is the light of life, powerful and efficacious</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> (To ſum up all in one word) In regenerationthe mind is enlightned in the knowledge of ſpiritual things, 1 John ii 20 <hi>Ye have an unction from the holy One</hi> (that is, from Jeſus Chriſt, Rev. iii 18. It is an alluſion to the ſanctuary, whence the holy oil was brought to anoint the prieſts) <hi>and ye know all things,</hi> viz neceſſary to ſalvation. Tho' men be not book-learned, if they be born again, they are Spirit-learned; for all ſuch are taught of God, John vi. 45. The Spirit of regeneration teacheth them what they knew not before; and what they did know, as by the ear only, he teacheth them over again as by the eye. The light of grace is an overcoming light, determining men to aſſent to divine truths on the mere teſtimony of God. It is no eaſy thing for the mind of man, to acquieſce in divine revelation. Many pretend great reſpect to the ſcriptures, whom, nevertheleſs, the clear ſcripture-teſtimony will not divorce from their pre-conceived opinions. But this illumination will make men's minds run, as captives, after Chriſt's chariot-wheels; which, for their part, ſhall be allowed to drive over, and caſt down their own <hi>imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itſelf againſt the knowledge of God.</hi> 2 Cor. x 5. It will make them <hi>receive the kingdom of God as a little child,</hi> Mark x. 15. who thinks he has ſufficient ground to believe any thing, if his father do but ſay it is ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>will</hi> is renewed. The Lord takes away the ſtony heart, and gives a heart of fleſh, Ezek. xxxvi 26. And ſo, of ſtones raiſeth up children to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Regenerating grace is powerful and efficacious, and gives the <hi>will</hi> a new ſet It does not indeed force it: but ſweetly, yet powerfully draws it, ſo that <hi>his people are willing in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ay of his power,</hi> Pſal. cx. 3. There is heavenly oratory in the Mediator's lips, to perſuade ſinners, Pſal. xlv. 2 <hi>Grace is poured into thy lips.</hi> There are cords of a man, and bands of love in his hands, to draw them after him, Hoſ xi. 4. Love makes a net for elect ſouls, which will infallibly catch them, and hale them to land. The cords of Chriſt's love are ſtrong cords: and they need to be ſo; for every
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:045042_0134_101F7E3AA29BCD60"/>
ſinner is heavier than a mountain of braſs: and Satan, together with the heart itſelf, draw the contrary way But love is ſtrong as death; and the Lord's love to the ſoul he died for, is ſtrongeſt love; which acts ſo powerfully, that it muſt come off victorious.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The <hi>will</hi> is cured of its utter inability to will what is good. While the opening of the priſon to them that are bound is proclaimed in the goſpel: The Spirit of God comes to the priſon door, opens it, goe to the priſoner; and by the power of his grace makes his chains fall off; breaks the bond of iniquity, wherewith he was held in ſin, ſo as he could neither will nor do any thing truly good; brings him forth into a large place, <hi>Working in him both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil ii. 13. Then it is that the ſoul, that was fixed to the earth, can move heavenward; the withered hand is reſtored, and can be ſtretched out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is wrought in the <hi>will</hi> a fixed averſion to evil. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, a man gets a <hi>new ſpirit put within him,</hi> Ezek. xxxvi. 26. and that <hi>ſpirit luſteth againſt the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſweet morſel of ſin, ſo greedily ſwallowed down, he now lothes, and would fain be rid of it; even as willingly as one, that had drunk a cup of poiſon, would throw it up again. When the ſpring is ſtopt, the mud lies in the well unmoved: but when once the ſpring is cleared, the waters ſpringing up, will work the mud away by degrees Even ſo, while a man continues in an unregenerate ſtate, ſin lies at eaſe in the heart: but as ſoon as the Lord ſtrikes the rocky heart, with the rod of his ſtrength in the day of converſion, grace is in <hi>him a well of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life,</hi> John iv. working away natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and gradually purifying the heart, Acts xv. 9. The renewed <hi>will</hi> riſeth up againſt ſin, ſtrikes at the root thereof, and the branches too. Luſts are now grievous, and the ſoul endeavours to ſtarve them: the corrupt nature is the ſource of all evil, and therefore the ſoul will be often laying it before the great Phyſician. O what ſorrow, ſhame and ſelf-loathing fill the heart, in the day that grace makes its triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant entrance into it? For now the madman is come to himſelf, and the remembrance of his follies cannot but cut him to the heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>will</hi> is endued with an inclination, bent, and propenſity to good In its depraved ſtate, it lay quite another way; being prone and bent to evil only: but now, by a pull of the omnipotent, all-conquering arm, it is drawn from evil to good, and gets another ſet. And as the former ſet was natural; ſo this is natural too, in reſpect of the new nature given in regeneration which has its own holy luſtings, as well as the corrupt old nature hath its ſinful luſtings, Gal. v. 17. The <hi>will,</hi> as renewed, inclines and points towards God and godlineſs. When God made man, his <hi>will,</hi> in reſpect of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, was directed towards God, as his chief end; in reſpect of its choice, it pointed towards that which God willed. When man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made himſelf, his <hi>will</hi> was framed into the very reverſe hereof: he made himſelf his chief end, and his own <hi>will</hi> his law. But when man
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:045042_0135_101F7E3F2631C560"/>
is new made, in regeneration, grace rectifies this diſorder in ſome meaſure, tho' not perfectly indeed; becauſe we are but renewed in part, while in this world. It brings back the ſinner, out of himſelf, to God as his chief end, truly, tho' not perfectly, Pſal. lxxiii. 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> Philip. i. 21. <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt.</hi> It makes him to deny himſelf, and whatever way he turns, to point habitually towards God; who is the center of the gracious ſoul, its home, its dwelling-place in all generations, Pſal. xc. 1. By regenerating grace, the <hi>will</hi> is framed into a conformity to the <hi>will</hi> of God. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his preceptive <hi>will,</hi> being endued with holy inclinations, agreeable to every one of his commands. The whole law is impreſſed on the gracious ſoul: every part of it is written over on the renewed heart. And altho' remaining corruption makes ſuch blots in the writing, that oft-times the man himſelf cannot read it: yet he that wrote it can read it at all times; it is never quite blotted out, nor can be. What he has written, he has written, it ſhall ſtand: <hi>For this is the covenant, — I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts,</hi> Heb. viii. 10. And it is a covenant of ſalt, a perpetual covenant. It is alſo conformed to his providential <hi>will;</hi> ſo that the man will no more be maſter of his own proceſs; nor carve out his lot for himſelf. He learns to ſay, from his heart, <hi>The will of the Lord be done,—he ſhall chuſe our inheritance for us,</hi> Pſal. xlvii. 4. Thus the <hi>will</hi> is diſpoſed to fall in with thoſe things, which, in its depraved ſtate, it could never be reconciled to.</p>
                  <p>Particularly, (1.) The Lord is reconciled to the covenant of peace. The Lord God promiſeth a covenant of peace to ſinners; a covenant which he himſelf hath framed, and regiſtrated in the Bible: but they are not pleaſed with it; nay, an unrenewed heart cannot be pleaſed with it. Were it put into their hands, to frame it according to their mind; they would blot many things out of it, which God has put in; and put in many things, God has kept out. But the renewed heart is entirely ſatisfied with the covenant, 2 Sam. xxiii. 5. <hi>He hath made with me an everlaſting covenant, ordered in all things and ſure; this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire.</hi> Tho' the covenant could not be brought down to their depraved <hi>will,</hi> their <hi>will</hi> is, by grace, brought up to the covenant; they are well-pleaſed with it: there is nothing in it they would have out; nor is any thing left out of it, which they would have in.

                     <hi>will</hi> is diſpoſed to receive Chriſt Jeſus the Lord. The ſoul is content to ſubmit to him. Regenerating grace undermines, and brings down the tow'ring imaginations of the heart, raiſed up againſt its rightful lord: it breaks the iron ſinew, which kept the ſinner from bowing to him, and diſpoſed him to be no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So the main work in regeneration is done; the fort of the heart is taken: there is room made for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the ſoul; the outer-door of the <hi>will</hi> being now opened to him, as well as the inner-door of the <hi>underſtanding.</hi> In one word, Chriſt is paſſively received into the heart; he is come into the ſoul by his quickning ſpirit, whereby ſpiritual life is given to the man, who in himſelf was dead to ſin. And his firſt vital act we may conceive to be an active receiving of Jeſus Chriſt diſcerned in his glorious excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; that is, a believing on him, a cloſing with him, as diſcerned, offered, and exhibited in the word of his grace, the glorious goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the immediate effect of which is union with him, John i. 12, 13. <hi>To as many as</hi> received <hi>him, to them gave he power</hi> (or privilege) <hi>to become the ſons of God, even to them that</hi> believe on <hi>his Name; which were</hi> born, <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eph. iii. 17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> Chriſt having taken the heart by ſtorm, and triumphantly entered into it, in regeneration, the ſoul by faith yields itſelf to him, as it is expreſſed, 2 Chron. xxx. 8. Thus, this glorious King, who came into the heart by his Spirit; dwells in it by faith. The ſoul being drawn, runs; and being effectually called, comes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In regeneration; there is a happy change made on the affections; they are both rectified and regulated.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This change rectifies the affections, placing them on ſuitable objects, 2 Theſſ. iii. 5. <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God.</hi> The regenerate man's deſires are rectified; they are ſet on God himſelf, and the things above. He who before, cried with the world, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> he changes his note, and ſays, <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon us,</hi> Pſal. iv. Sometimes he ſaw no beauty in Chriſt, for which he was to be deſired; but now he is all deſires, he is <hi>altogether lovely,</hi> Cant. v. 16. The main ſtream of his deſires is turned to run towards God: for there is the one <hi>thing he deſireth,</hi> Pſal. xxvii. 4. He deſires to be holy, as well as to be happy; and rather to be gracious than great. His hopes, which before were low, and ſtaked down to things on earth, are now raiſed, and ſet on the glory which is to be revealed. He entertains the hope of eternal life, founded on the word of promiſe, Tit. i. 2. <hi>Which hope</hi> he has, <hi>as an anchor of the ſoul,</hi> fixing the heart under trials, Heb. vi. 18. And it puts him upon purifying <hi>himſelf, even as God is pure,</hi> John iii. 3. For he is begotten again unto <hi>a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 3. His love is raiſed, and ſet on God himſelf, Pſal. xxviii. 1. On his holy law, Pſal. cxix. 97. Tho' it ſtrike againſt his moſt beloved l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.) the people of God, as the,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:045042_0137_101F7E48EC71C308"/>
are called, 1 Pet. i. 10. He loves God for himſelf, and what is God's, for his ſake. Yea, as being a child of God, he loves his own enemies. His heavenly Father is compaſſionate and benevolent: he maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and the good, <hi>and ſendeth rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt:</hi> and therefore he is in the like manner diſpoſed, Matth. v. 44, 45. His hatred is turned againſt ſin in himſelf and others, Pſal. ci. 3. <hi>I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi> He groans under the remains of it, and longs for deliverance, Rom. vii. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am! Who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> His joys and delights are in God the Lord, in the light of his countenance, in his law, and in his people; becauſe they are like him. Sin is what he chiefly fears; it is a fountain of ſorrow to him now, tho' formerly a ſpring of pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It regulates the affections placed on ſuitable objects. Our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, when placed on the creature, are naturally exorbitant: when we joy in it, we are apt to over-joy; and when we ſorrow, we are ready to ſorrow over-much: but grace bridles theſe affections, clips their wings, and keeps them within bounds, that they overflow not at all their banks. It makes a man <hi>hate his father and mother, and wife and children,—yea, and his own life alſo,</hi> comparatively; that is, to love them leſs than he loves God, Luke xiv. 26. It alſo ſanctifies lawful affections; bringing them forth from right principles, and directing them to right ends. There may be unholy deſires after Chriſt and his grace; as when men deſire Chriſt, not from any love to him, but merely out of love to themſelves. <hi>Give us of your oil,</hi> ſaid the fooliſh virgins, <hi>for our lamps are gone out,</hi> Matth. xxv. 8. There may be an unſanctified ſorrow for ſin; as when one ſorroweth for it, not becauſe it is diſpleaſing to God, but, only becauſe of the wrath annexed to it, as did <hi>Pharaoh, Judas,</hi> and others. So a man may love his father and mother, from more natural principles, without any reſpect to the command of God binding him thereto. But grace ſanctifies the affections in ſuch caſes, making them to run in a new channel of love to God, reſpect to his commands, and regard to his glory. Again, grace ſcrews up the affections where they are too low: It gives the chief ſeat in them to God: and pulls down all other rivals, whether perſons or things, making them ly at his feet, Pſal. lxxiii. 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven, but thee? And there is none upon earth, that I deſire beſide thee.</hi> He is loved for himſelf: and other perſons or things, for his ſake. What is lovely in them, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart, is ſome ray of the divine goodneſs appearing in them: for unto gracious ſouls they ſhine only by borrowed light. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for the ſaints loving all men, and yet hating thoſe that hate God, and contemning the wicked as vile perſons They h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e and contemn them for their wickedneſs: there is nothing of God in that, and therefore nothing lovely or honourable in it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ut they love them for their commendable qualities, or perfections, whether natural or moral; becauſe, in whomſoever theſe are, they are from God, and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:045042_0138_101F7E4BD2EABA48"/>
can be traced to him as their fountain. <hi>Finally,</hi> Regenerating grace ſets the affections ſo firmly on God, that the man is diſpoſed, at God's command, to quit his hold of every thing elſe, in order to keep his hold of Chriſt; to <hi>hate father and mother,</hi> in compariſon with Chriſt, Luke xiv 20. It makes even lawful enjoyments like <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s mantle, to hang looſe about a man; that he may quit them when he is in hazard to be enſnared by holding them.</p>
                  <p>If the ſtream of our affections was never thus turned; we are, doubtleſs, going down the ſtream into the pit. If <hi>the luſt of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>conſcience</hi> is renewed. Now, that a new light is ſet up in the ſoul in regeneration; <hi>conſcience</hi> is enlightned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtructed, and informed That <hi>candle of the Lord,</hi> (Prov xx. 27) is now ſnuffed and brightned; ſo as it ſhines, and ſends forth its light into the moſt retired corners of the heart; diſcovering ſins which the ſoul was not aware of before: and, in a ſpecial manner, diſcovering the corruption or depravity of nature, that ſeed and ſpawn whence all actual ſins proceed This produces the new complaint, Rom vii 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It urgeth the ſovereign authority of God, to which the heart is now reconciled and which it willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: and ſo it engageth the man to his duty, whatever be the hazard from the world; for it fills the heart ſo with the fear of God, that the force of the fear of man is broken. This hath engaged many to <hi>put their life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their hand,</hi> and follow the cauſe of religion they once contemned, and reſolutely walk in the path they formerly abhorred, Gal. i. 23 <hi>

drives the ſinner to Jeſus Chriſt, as the only phyſician that can draw out the ſting of guilt; and whoſe blood alone can <hi>purge the conſcience from dead works,</hi> Heb. ix. 14. refuſing all eaſe offered to it from any other hand. And this is an evidence, that the conſcience is not only fired, as it may be in an unregenerate ſtate; but oiled alſo with regenerating grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As the <hi>Memory</hi> wanted not its ſhare of depravity, it is alſo bettered by regenerating grace. The <hi>memory</hi> is weakned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe things that are not worth their room therein; and men are taught to forget injuries, and drop their reſentments, Mat. v. 44, 45. <hi>Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you,—That ye may be (i. e.</hi> appear to be) <hi>the children of your Father which is in heaven.</hi> It is ſtrengthned for ſpiritual things. We have <hi>Solomon</hi>'s receipt for an ill memory, Prov. iii. 1. <hi>My ſon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>forget not my law.</hi> But how ſhall it be kept in mind? <hi>Let thine heart keep my commandments.</hi> Grace makes a heart-memory, even where there is no good head-memory, Pſal. cxix. 11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in mine heart.</hi> The heart truly touched with the powerful ſweetneſs of truth, will help the memory to retain what is ſo reliſhed. Did divine truths make deeper impreſſions on our hearts, they would thereby impreſs themſelves with more force on our memories, Pſal. cxix. 93. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou haſt quickned me.</hi> Grace ſanctifies the memory. Many have large, but unſanctified memories; which ſerve only to gather knowledge, whereby to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their condemnation; but the renewed memory ſerves to <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his commandments to do them,</hi> Pſal. ciii. 18. It is a ſacred ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, from whence a Chriſtian is furniſhed in his way to <hi>Zion</hi>: for faith and hope are often ſupplied out of it, in a dark hour. It is the ſtore-houſe of former experiences; and theſe are the believer's way-marks, by noticing of which he comes to know where he is, even in a dark time, Pſal. xlii 6. <hi>O my God, my ſoul is caſt down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan,</hi> &amp;c. It alſo helps the ſoul to godly ſorrow and ſelf-loathing, preſenting old guilt anew before the conſcience: and making it bleed afreſh, tho' the ſin be already pardoned, Pſal. xxv. 7. <hi>Remember not the ſins of my youth.</hi> And where unpardoned guilt is lying on the ſleeping conſcience, it is often employed to bring in a word, which in a moment ſets the whole ſoul aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>: as when <hi>Peter remembered the words of Jeſus,—be went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Matth. xxvi. 75. The word of God laid up in a ſanctified memory, ſerves a man to reſiſt temptations, puts the ſword in his hand againſt the ſpiritual enemies, and is a light to direct his ſteps in the way of religion and righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There is a change made on the <hi>Body,</hi> and the members thereof, in reſpect of their uſe: they are conſecrated to the Lord. <hi>Even the Body is—for the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 13. It is the temple of the holy Ghoſt, ver. 19. The members thereof, that were formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin, become inſtruments of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:045042_0140_101F7E53EDAC4A90"/>
unto God, Rom. vi. 13. Servants to righteouſneſs unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ver. 19. The eye that conveyed ſinful imaginations into the heart, is under a covenant, Job xxxi. to do ſo no more; but to ſerve the ſoul in viewing the works, and reading the word of God. The ear that had often been death's porter to let in ſin, is turned to be the gate of life, by which the word of life enters the ſoul. The tongue that ſet on fire the whole courſe of nature, is reſtored to the office it was deſigned for by the Creator; namely, to be an inſtrument of glorifying him, and ſetting forth his praiſe. In a word, the whole man is for God, in ſoul and body, which by this bleſſed change are made his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This gracious change ſhines forth in the converſation. Even the outward man is renewed A new heart makes newneſs of life. When the King's daughter is all glorious within, her cloathing is of wrought gold, Pſal. xlv. 13. The ſingle eye makes the whole body full of light, Matth. vi. 22. This change will appear in every part of one's converſation, particularly in theſe following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. In the change of his company. Tho' ſometime he deſpiſed the company of the ſaints, now they are the excellent in whom is all his delight, Pſal. xvi. 3. <hi>I am a companion of all that fear thee,</hi> ſaith the royal Pſalmiſt, Pſal. cxix. 63. A renewed man joins himſelf with the ſaints: for he and they are like minded, in that which is their main work and buſineſs; they have all one new nature; they are travelling to <hi>Immanuel</hi>'s land, and converſe together in the language of <hi>Canaan.</hi> In vain do men pretend to religion, while ungodly company is their choice; for <hi>a companions of fools ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Prov. xiii. 20.

                  <p n="2">2. In his relative capacity, he will be a new man. Grace makes men gracious in their ſeveral relations, and natively leads them to the conſcientious performance of relative duties. It does not only make good men, and good women; but makes good ſubjects, good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, good wives, children, ſervants, and in a word, good relatives in the church, common-wealth, and family. It is a juſt exception made againſt the religion of many; namely, that they are bad rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they are ill huſbands, wives, maſters, ſervants, &amp;c. How will we prove ourſelves to be new creatures, if we be ſtill juſt ſuch as we were before, in our ſeveral relations, 2 Cor. v. 17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature: old things are paſſed away; behold all things are become new.</hi> Real godlineſs will gain a teſtimony to a man, from the conſciences of his neareſt relations, tho' they know more of his ſinful infirmities, than others do; as we ſee in that caſe. 2 Kings iv. 2. <hi>Thy ſervant, my huſband, is dead, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="144" facs="unknown:045042_0141_101F7E56023A5FA0"/>
ſaints apply themſelves to worldly buſineſs, as well as others; yet their hearts are not ſwallowed up in it. It is evident they are carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a trade with heaven, as well as a trade with earth, Philip. iii 20. <hi>For our converſation is in heaven.</hi> And they go about their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world as a duty laid upon them by the Lord of all; doing their lawful buſineſs, as the will of God, Eph vi. 7. working, becauſe he has ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. They have a ſpecial concern for the advancement of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in the world: they eſpouſe the intereſts of religion, and <hi>prefer Jeruſalem above their chief joy,</hi> Pſal. cxxxvii 6. How privately ſoever they live, grace makes them of a public ſpirit, which will concern itſelf in the ark and work of God; in the goſpel of God; and in the people of God; even theſe of them whom they never ſaw in the face. As children of God, they naturally care for theſe things. They have a new and unwonted concern for the ſpiritual good of others. And no ſooner do they taſte of the power of grace themſelves, but they are inclined to ſet up to be agents for Chriſt and holineſs, in this world; as appears in the caſe of the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who, when Chriſt had manifeſted himſelf to her, <hi>went her way into the city, and ſaith unto the men, Come, ſee a man which told me all things that ever I did! Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> John iv. 28, 29. They have ſeen and felt the evil of ſin, and therefore pity, the world lying in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They would fain pluck the brands out of the fire, remembring that they themſelves were plucked out of it. They will labour to commend religion to others, both by word and example; and rather deny themſelves their liberty in indifferent things, than by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable uſe of it, deſtroy others, 1 Cor. viii. 13 <hi>Wherefore, if m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the child is merely paſſive in generation, ſo is the child of God in regeneration. The one contributes nothing to its own generation; neither does the other contribute any thing, by way of efficiency, to its own regeneration: for tho' a man may lay himſelf down at the pool: yet he hath no hand in moving of the water, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> efficacy in performing of the cure. One is born the child of a king, another the child of a beggar: the child has no hand at all in this difference. God leaves ſome in their depraved ſtate; others he brings into a ſtate of grace or regeneracy. If thou be thus honoured, no thanks to thee; for <hi>who maketh thee to differ from another?</hi> 1 Cor. iv. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is a wonderful contexture of parts in both births. Admirable is the ſtructure of man's body, in which there is ſuch a variety of organs: nothing wanting, nothing ſuperfluous. The Pſalmiſt conſidering his own body, looks on it as a piece of marvellous work: <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

That is, in the womb, where I know not how the bones do grow, more than I know what is a-doing in the loweſt parts of the earth. In natural generation, we are curiouſly wrought, as a piece of needle-work; as the word imports: even ſo it is in regeneration, Pſal. xlv. 14. <hi>She ſhall be brought unto the King, in raiment of needle-work, raiment curiouſly wrought.</hi> It is the ſame word in both texts. And what that raiment is, the Apoſtle tells us, Eph. iv. 24. It is <hi>the new man, which, after God, is created in righteouſneſs and true h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lineſs.</hi> That is the raiment, he ſaith, in the ſame place, we muſt <hi>put on;</hi> not excluding the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Both are curiouſly wrought, as maſter-pieces of the manifold wiſdom of God. O the wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of graces in the new creature! O glorious creature, new-made, after the image of God! It is grace for grace in Chriſt, which makes up the new man, John i 16. Even as in bodily generation, the child has member for member in the parent; has every member the parent has, in a certain proportion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> All this, in both caſes, hath its riſe from that which is in itſelf very ſmall and inconſiderable. O the power of God, in making ſuch a creature of the corruptible ſeed! and much more in bringing forth the new creature from ſo ſmall beginnings: it is as <hi>the little cloud like a man's hand,</hi> which ſpread till heaven <hi>was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain,</hi> 1 Kings xiii 44, 45. A man gets a word at a ſermon, which hundreds beſide him hear and let ſlip: but it remains with him, works in him, and never leaves him, till the little word be turned up ſide-down by it; that is, till he become a new man. It is like the vapour that got up into <hi>Abaſuerus</hi>'s head, and cut off ſleep from his eyes, Eſther vi 1. which proved a ſpring of ſuch motions, as never ceaſed, until <hi>Mordecai,</hi> in royal pomp, was brought on horſe-back through the ſtreet, proud <hi>Haman</hi> trudging at his foot; the ſame <hi>Haman</hi> afterwards hanged, <hi>Mordecai</hi> advanced, and the church delivered from <hi>Haman</hi>'s helliſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

—becometh a tree,</hi> Matth. xiii. 21, 22. God loves to bring great things out of ſmall beginnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Natural generation is carried on by degrees, Job x. 10. <hi>Haſt thou not poured me out as milk, and cruddled me like cheeſe?</hi> So is regeneration. It is with the ſoul, ordinarily, in regeneration, as with the blind man cured by our Lord, who firſt <hi>ſaw men as trees walking,</hi> afterwards ſaw <hi>every man clearly,</hi> Matth. viii. 23, 24, 25. It is true, regeneration being, ſtrictly ſpeaking, a paſſing from death to life, the ſoul is quickned in a moment: like as, when the embryo is brought to perfection in the womb, the ſoul is infuſed into the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lump. Nevertheleſs, we may imagine ſomewhat like conception in ſpiritual generation, whereby the ſoul is prepared for quickening: and the new creature is capable of growth, 1 Pet. ii. 2. and of <hi>life more abundantly,</hi> John x. 10.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>USE I. By what is ſaid, you may try whether you are in the ſtate of grace or not. If ye be brought out of the ſtate of wrath or ruin, into the ſtate of grace or ſalvation; ye are new creatures, ye are born again. But ye will ſay, "How ſhall we know whether "we be born again or not?" <hi>Anſ.</hi> Do you aſk me, if the ſun were riſen, and how you ſhould know, whether it were riſen, or not? I would bid you look up to the heavens, and ſee it with your eyes. And would you know if the light be riſen in your heart? Look in, and ſee. Grace is light, and diſcovers itſelf. Look into thy mind, ſee if it has been illuminate in the knowledge of God. Haſt thou been inwardly taught what God is? Were thine eyes ever turned inward to ſee thyſelf, the ſinfulneſs of thy depraved ſtate; the corruption of thy nature; the ſins of thy heart and life? Waſt thou ever let into a view of the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin? Have thine eyes ſeen King <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his beauty; the manifold wiſdom of God in him, his tranſcendent excellency, and abſolute fulneſs and ſufficiency, with the vanity and emptineſs of all things elſe? Next, What change is there on thy will? Are the ſetters taken off, wherewith it was ſometimes bound up from moving heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? And has thy will got a new ſet? Doſt thou find an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſin, and a proneneſs to good wrought in thy heart? Is thy ſoul turned towards God as thy chief end; is thy will new-molded, into ſome meaſure of conformity to the preceptive and providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial will of God: Art thou heartily reconciled to the covenant of peace, and ſixedly diſpoſed to the receiving of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he is offered in the goſpel? And as to a change on your affections, are they rectified, and placed on right objects? Are your deſires going on after God? Are they "to his name, and remembrance of him?" Iſa. xxvi. 8. Are your hopes in him? Is your love ſet upon him, and your hatred ſet againſt ſin? Does your offending a good God affect your heart with ſorrow, and do you fear ſin more than ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Are your affections regulated? Are they, with reſpect to created comforts brought down, as being too high: and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God in Chriſt, ſcrewed up, as being too low? Has he the chief ſeat in your heart? And are all your lawful worldly comforts and enjoyments laid at his feet? Has thy conſcience been enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and awakened, refuſing all eaſe, but from the application of the blood of a Redeemer? Is thy memory ſanctified, thy body conſecrated to the ſervice of God? And art thou now walking in newneſs of life? Thus ye may diſcover, whether, ye are born again or not.</p>

                     <pb n="149" facs="unknown:045042_0146_101F7E67B633BF68"/>But, for your further help in this matter, I will diſcourſe a little of another ſign of regeneration, namely, <hi>The love of the brethren;</hi> an evidence whereby the weakeſt and moſt timorous ſaints have often had comfort, when they could have little or no conſolation from other marks propoſed to them. This the Apoſtle lays down, 1 John iii. 14. <q>We know that we have paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the brethren.</q>
It is not to be thought, that the Apoſtle, by <hi>the brethren</hi> in this place, means brethren by a common relation to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus: becauſe, however true it is, that univerſal benevolence, a good-will to the whole race of mankind, takes place in the renewed ſoul, as being a lively lineament of the divine image; yet the whole context ſpeaks of thoſe that are the ſons of God, ver. 1, 2. children of God, ver. 10. born of God, ver. 9. diſtinguiſhing betwixt the children of God, and the children of the devil, ver. 10. betwixt theſe that are of the devil, ver. 8, 12. and theſe that are of God, ver. 10. And the text itſelf comes in as a reaſon why we ſhould not marvel that the world hates the brethren, the children of God, ver. 13. How can we marvel at it, ſeeing the love of the brethren is an evidence of one's having paſſed from death to life? And therefore it were abſurd to look for that love amongſt the men of the world, whe are dead in treſpaſſes and ſin. They cannot love the brethren: no marvel then that they hate them. Wherefore it is plain, that by <hi>brethren</hi> here, are meant brethren by regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Now, in order to ſet this mark of regeneration in a true light, conſider theſe three things. (1.) This love to the brethren, is a love to them as ſuch. Then do we love them in the ſenſe of the text, when the grace, or image of God in them, is the chief motive of our love to them. When we love the godly for their godlineſs, the ſaints for their ſanctity or holineſs: then we love God in them, and ſo may conclude, we are born of God; for <hi>every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him,</hi> 1 John v. 1. Hypocrites may love ſaints, on account of a civil relation to them; becauſe of their obliging converſation; for their being of the ſame opinion with themſelves in religious matters: and on many other ſuch like accounts, whereby wicked men may be induced to love the godly. But happy they, who can love them for naked grace in them; for their heaven-born temper and diſpoſition; who can pick this pearl out of a dunghill of infirmities in, and about them; lay hold on it, and love them for it. (2.) It is a love that will be given to all, in whom the grace of God appears. They that love one ſaint, becauſe he is a ſaint, will have love to all the ſaints, Eph. i. 15. They will love all, who to their diſcerning, bear the image of God. They that cannot love a gracious perſon in rags, but confine their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

points ſoever men differ from us, in their judgment or way: yet if they appear to agree with us, in love to God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and in bearing his image; we will love them as brethren, if we ourſelves be of the heavenly family And, (3.)

But, as for them that are born again; their love and affection to the brethren, bears proportion to the degrees of the divine image they diſcern in them.</p>
                  <p>Now, if ye would improve theſe things to the knowledge of your ſtate, I would adviſe you, (1.) To ſet apart ſome time, when ye are at home, for a review of your caſe, and try your ſtate, by what has been ſaid. Many have comfort and clearneſs as to their ſtate, at a ſermon; who in a little time loſe it again: becauſe, while they hear the word preached, they make application of it; but do not conſider of theſe things more deliberately and leiſurely when alone. The action is too ſudden and ſhort, to give laſting comfort. And it is often ſo indeliberate, that it has bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Therefore, ſet about this work at home, after earneſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and out-houſes are to be got. (2.) Renew your repentance before the Lord. Guilt lying on the conſcience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, may darken all your evidences and marks of grace. It provokes the Spirit of grace to depart; and when he goes, our light ceaſes. It is not ſit time for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to read his evidences, when the candle is blown out by ſome conſcience-wounding guilt. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Exert the powers of the new nature; let the graces of the divine Spirit in you, diſcover themſelves by action. If ye would know whether there is a ſacred fire in your breaſt, or not, ye muſt blow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The motions of ſin may really be moſt violent; when a new principle is brought in to caſt it out.

Sin is not quite dead in the regenerate ſoul, it is but dying; and, dying a lingering death, being crucified, no wonder there be great fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when it is ſick at the heart, and death is at the door.

(2.) There is a rational love to Chriſt, which, without theſe ſenſible emotions felt in the former caſe, evidences itſelf by a dutiful regard to the divine authority and command. When one bears ſuch a love to Chriſt, tho' the vehement ſtirrings of affection be wanting, yet he is truly tender of offending a gracious God; endeavours to walk before him <hi>unto all pleaſing;</hi> and grieved at the heart, for what is diſpleaſing unto him, 1 John v. 3. <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.</hi> Now, although that ſenſible love doth not always continue with you: yet ye have no reaſon to account it a hypocritical fit, while the rational love remains with you, more than a faithful and loving wife needs queſtion her love to her huſband, when her fondneſs is abated.</p>

Sirs, ye ſee the outſide of hypocrites, their duties, their gifts, their tears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ye ſee not their inſide; ye do not diſcern their hearts, the bias of their ſpirits. Upon what ye ſee of them, ye found a judgment of charity, as to their ſtate; and ye do well to judge charitably in ſuch a caſe, becauſe ye cannot know the ſecret ſprings of their actings: But ye are ſpeaking, and ought to have a judgment of certainty, as to your own ſtate; and therefore are to look in to that part of religion, which none in the world but yourſelves can diſcern in you; and which ye can as little ſee in others. An hypocrite's religion may appear far greater than that of a ſincere ſoul: but, that which makes the greateſt figure in the eyes of men, is often leaſt worth before God. I would rather utter one of theſe groans the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, Rom. viii. 26. than ſhed <hi>Eſau</hi>'s tears, have <hi>Balaam</hi>'s prophetic ſpirit, or the joy of the ſtony-ground hearers. The fire that ſhall try every man's work, will try, not of what bulk it is, but of what ſort it is, 1 Cor. iii. 13. Now, ye may know what bulk of religion another has: and what tho' it be more bulky than your own? God doth not regard that: Why then do you make ſuch a matter of it? It is impoſſible for you, without divine revelation, certainly to know of what ſort another man's

religion is: but ye may certainly know what ſort your own is of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary revelation; otherwiſe the Apoſtle would not exhort the ſaints to give diligence to make their calling and election ſure, 2 Pet i. 10. Therefore, the attainments of hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I'll tell you two things wherein the meaneſt ſaints go beyond the moſt refined hypocrites. (1) In denying themſelves, renouncing all confidence in themſelves, and their own works, acquieſcing in, being well-pleaſed with, and venturing their ſouls upon God's plan of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thro' Jeſus Chriſt, Matth. v. 3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> And chap. xi. 6. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> Philip. iii. 3. <hi>We are the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> (2.) In a real hatred of all ſin; being willing to part with every luſt, without exception, and comply with every duty the Lord makes, or ſhall make known to them: Pſal. cxix 6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy commandments.</hi> Try yourſelves by theſe.</p>
                  <p>CASE VI.
<q>I ſee myſelf fall ſo far ſhort of the ſaints mentioned in the ſcriptures, and of ſeveral excellent perſons of my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; that, when I look on them, I can hardly look on my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as one of the ſame family with them.</q>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is indeed matter of humiliation, that we get not forward to that meaſure of grace and holineſs, which we ſee is attainable in this life. This ſhould make us more vigorouſly preſs towards the mark: But ſurely it is from the devil, that weak Chriſtians make a rack for themſelves of the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſtrong. And to yield to this temptation, is as unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as for a child to diſpute away his relation to his father, becauſe he is not of the ſame ſtature with his elder brethren. There are ſaints of ſeveral ſizes in Chriſt's family: ſome fathers, ſome young men, and ſome little children, 1 John ii. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>CASE VII.
<q>I never read in the word of God, nor did I ever know of a child of God ſo tempted, and ſo left of God as I am; and therefore no ſaint's caſe being like mine, I cannot <hi>but conclude I am none of their number.</hi>

And many of the children of God have not only been attacked with, but have actually yielded to very groſs temptations for a time. <hi>Peter</hi> denied CHRIST, and curſed and ſwore that he know him not. Mark xiv. 71. <hi>Paul,</hi> when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter, compelled even ſaints to blaſpheme, Acts xxvi. 10, 11.

They will be charged upon the tempter alone, if they be not conſented to; and will no more be laid to the charge of the tempted party, than a baſtard's being laid down at the chaſte man's door, will fix guilt upon him.

And we need not doubt but ſome have had diſtreſſes known only to God, and their own conſciences; and, ſo, to others theſe diſtreſſes are as if they had never been. Yea, and though the ſcripture do contain ſuitable directions for every caſe a child of God can be in; and theſe illuſtrated with a ſufficient number of examples: yet it is not to be imagined, that there are in the ſcriptures perfect inſtances of every particular caſe incident to the ſaints. Therefore, howbeit you cannot find an inſtance of your caſe in the ſcripture; yet bring your caſe to it, and you ſhall find ſuitable remedies preſcribed there for it And ſtudy rather to make uſe of Chriſt for your caſe, who has ſalve for all ſores; than to know if ever any was in your caſe Tho' one ſhould ſhew you an inſtance of your caſe, in an undoubted ſaint; yet none could promiſe it would certainly give you eaſe: for a ſcrupulous conſcience would readily find out ſome difference. And if nothing but a perfect conformity of another's caſe to yours, will ſatisfy, it will be hard, if not impoſſible to ſatisfy you. For it is with people's caſes, as with their natural faces: though faces of all men are of one make; and ſome are ſo very like others, that, at firſt view we are ready to take them for the ſame: yet if you view them more accurately, you will ſee ſomething in every face, diſtinguiſhing it from all others: though poſſibly you cannot tell what it is; wherefore I conclude, that if you

can find in yourſelves the marks of regeneration, propoſed to you from the word; you ought to conclude, you are in the ſtate of grace, though your caſe were ſingular, which is indeed unlikely.</p>

Conſider, (1.) That without regeneration there is no faith, and <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb xi. 6. Faith is a vital act of the new-born ſoul. The Evangeliſt, ſhewing the different entertainment our Lord Jeſus had from different perſons, ſome receiving him, ſome rejecting him, points at regenerating grace, as the true
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:045042_0155_101F7E8440F80C00"/>
riſe of that difference; without which never one would have received him. He tells us, that as many as received him, were theſe which were born—of God, John i. 11, 12, 13. Unregenerate men may preſume; but true faith they cannot have. Faith is a flower, that grows not in the field of nature. As the tree cannot grow without a root, neither can a man believe without the new nature, whereof the principle of believing is a part. (2.) Without regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration a man's works are dead works. As is the principle, ſo muſt the effects be: if the lungs be rotten, the breath will be unſavoury; and he who at beſt is dead in ſin, his works at beſt will be but dead works. <hi>Unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure— being abominable, and diſobedient, and unto every good work, reprobate,</hi> Tit i. 15, 16. Could we ſay of a man, that he is more blameleſs in his life, than any other in the world; that he macerates his body with faſting; and has made his knees as horns with continual praying; but he is not born again: that exception would mar all. And if one ſhould ſay, there is a well-proportioned body, but the ſoul is gone, it is but a dead lump. This is a melting conſideration Thou doſt many things materially good, but God ſaith, All theſe things avail not, as long as I ſee the old nature reigning in the man, Gal. vi. 15. <hi>For in Jeſus Chriſt neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but a new creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou art not born again, (1.) All thy reformation is naught in the ſight of God. Thou haſt ſhut the door, but the thief is ſtill in the houſe. It may be thou art not what once thou waſt, yet thou art not what thou muſt be, if ever thou ſeeſt heaven; for, <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> John iii. 3. (2.) Thy prayers <hi>are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov xv. 8. It may be, others admire thy ſeriouſneſs; thou crieſt as for thy life: but God accounts of the opening of thy mouth, as one would account of the opening of a grave full of rottenneſs, Rom. iii. 13. <hi>Their throat is an open ſepulchre.</hi> Others are affected with thy prayers; which ſeem to them, as if thy would rend the heavens: but God accounts them as the howling of a dog: <hi>They have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds,</hi> Hoſ. vii. 14. Others take thee for a wreſtler and prevailer with God; but he can take no delight with thee, nor thy prayers neither, Iſa. lxvi. 3. <hi>He that killeth an ox, is as if he ſlew a man: he that ſacrificeth a lamb, is as if he cut off a dog's neck,—he that burneth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an idol.</hi> Why not? Becauſe thou art yet in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity. (3.) All thou haſt done for God and his cauſe in the world, though it may be followed with temporal rewards, yet is loſt as to divine acceptance. This is clear from the caſe of <hi>Jehu;</hi> who was indeed rewarded with a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for his executing due vengeance upon the houſe of <hi>Ahab;</hi> as being a work good, for the matter of it, becauſe it was commanded of God, as you may ſee, 2 Kings x. 13.

But I muſt tell thee, God hates thee too, becauſe thou doſt it not in a right manner; and that thou canſt never do, whilſt thou art not born again. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> All thy ſtruggles againſt ſin, in thine own heart and life, are naught. The proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> afflicted his body with faſting, and God ſtruck his ſoul in the mean time with a ſentence of condemnation, Luke xviii. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſtruggled with his covetous temper to that degree, that though he loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs, yet he would not win them by curſing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he died the death of the wicked, Numb. xxxi. 8.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Without regeneration there is no communion with God. There is a ſociety on earth, whoſe <hi>fellowſhip is with the Father, and with the Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John i. 3. But out of that ſociety all the unregenerate are excluded; for they are all enemies to God, as ye heard before at large. Now, <hi>can two walk together, except they be agreed?</hi> Amos iii. 3.

with God in them! ye would not be content with your meat, unleſs it fed you; nor with your clothes, unleſs they kept you warm: and and how can you ſatisfy yourſelves with your duties, while they are not effectual to your communion with God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary to qualify you for heaven. None go to heaven but they that are made meet for it, Col. i. 12. As it was with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s temple, 1 Kings vi 7. ſo it is with the temple above: <hi>It is built of ſtone made ready before it is brought thither;</hi> namely, of lively ſtones, 1 Pet ii. 5 <hi>wrought for the ſame thing,</hi> 2 Cor. v 5. for they cannot be laid in that glorious build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſt as they came out of the quarry of depraved nature: Jewels of gold are not meet for ſwine, and far leſs jewels of glory for unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſinners. Beggars in their rags are not meet for king's houſes; nor ſinners to enter into the king's palace, without the raiment of needle-work, Pſal. xlv 14, 15. What wiſe man would bring fiſhes out of the water to feed in his meadow? or ſend his oxen to feed in the ſea? Even as little are the unregenerate meet for heaven, or is heaven meet for them It would never be liked of by them.</p>
                  <p>The unregenerate would find f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ult with heaven on ſeveral accounts. As (1.) That it is a ſtrange country. Heaven is the renewed man's native country: his Father is in heaven; his mother is Jeruſalem, which is above, Gal. iv 26 He is <hi>born from above,</hi> John iii 3. Heaven is his home, 2 Cor. v. 1. Therefore he looks on himſelf as a ſtranger on this earth, and his head is homeward, Heb. xi. 16 <hi>They deſire a better country, that is, an heavenly.</hi> But the unregenerate man is the man of the earth, Pſal. x. 18. <hi>written in the earth,</hi> Jer. xvii 13. Now, <hi>home is home, be it never ſo homely,</hi> therefore he <hi>minds earthly things,</hi> Philip. iii. 19. There is a peculiar ſweetneſs in our native ſoil; and hardly are men drawn to leave it, and dwell in a ſtrange country. In no caſe does that prevail more, than in this; for unrenewed men would quit their pretenſions to heaven, were it not that they ſee they cannot make a better of it. (2.) There is nothing thereof what they delight moſt in, as moſt agreeable to the carnal heart, Rev. xxi. 27. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it, any thing that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fileth.</hi> When <hi>Mahomet</hi> gave out paradiſe to be a place of ſenſual delights, his religion was greedily embraced: for that is the heaven men naturally chuſe. If the covetous man could get bags full of gold there, and the voluptuous man can promiſe himſelf his ſenſual delights there; they might be reconciled to heaven, and meet for it too: but ſince it is not ſo, tho' they may utter fair words about it, truly it has little of their hearts. (3.) Ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> corner there is filled with that, which of all things they have the leaſt liking of: and that is holineſs, true holineſs, perfect holineſs Were one that abhors ſwine's fleſh, bidden to a feaſt, where all the diſhes were of that ſort of meat, but variouſly prepared; he would find fault with every diſh at the table, notwithſtanding all the art uſed to make them palatable. It is true, there is joys in heaven, but it is holy joy: there are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

in heaven, but they are holy pleaſures: there are places to ſtand by in heaven, but it is holy ground. That holineſs that caſts up in every place, and in every thing there, would mar all to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate (4.) Were they carried thither, they would not only change their place, which would be a great heart break to them: but they would change their company too. Truly they would never like the company there, who care not for communion with God here; nor value the fellowſhip of his people, at leaſt in the vitals of practical godlineſs. Many indeed mix themſelves with the godly on earth, to procure a name to themſelves, and to cover the naughtineſs of their hearts: but that trade could not be managed there. (5.) They would never like the employment of heaven, they care ſo little for it now. The buſineſs of the ſaints there, would be an intolerable burden to them, ſeeing it is not agreeable to their nature To be taken up in beholding, admiring, and praiſing of <hi>him that ſitteth upon the throne, and of the Lamb,</hi> would be work unſuitable, and therefore unſavoury to an unrenewed ſoul. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They would find this fault with it, that the whole is of everlaſting continuance. This would be a killing ingredient in it, to them. How would ſuch as now account the Sabbath-day a burden, brook the celebrating of an everlaſting Sabbath in the heavens?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary to your being admitted into heaven, John iii. 3. No heaven without it Tho' carnal men could digeſt all theſe things, which make heaven ſo unſuitable for them; yet God will never ſuffer them to come thither Therefore born again ye muſt be: elſe ye ſhall never ſee heaven, ye ſhall periſh eternally. For, (1.) There is a bill of excluſion againſt you in the court of heaven, and againſt all your ſort: <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> John iii. 3. Here is a bar before you, that men and angels cannot remove. And to hope for heaven, over the belly of this peremptory ſentence, is to hope that God will recal his word, and ſacrifice his truth and faithfulneſs to your ſafety; which is infinitely more than to hope <hi>the earth ſhall be forſaken for you, and the rock removed out of his place</hi> (2) There is no holineſs without regeneration. It is the new man, which is <hi>created in true holineſs,</hi> Eph. iv. 24. And no heaven without holineſs; for <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii. 14 Will the gates of pearl be opened, to let in dogs and ſwine? No; their place is without, Rev. xxii. 15. God will not admit ſuch into the holy place of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him here; and will he admit them into the holieſt of all hereafter? Will he take the children of the devil, and give them to ſit with him in his throne? Or will he bring the unclean into the city, whoſe ſtreet is pure gold? Be not deceived, grace and glory are but two links of one chain, which God has joined, and no man ſhall put aſunder. None are tranſplanted into the paradiſe above, but out of the nurſery of grace below. If ye be unholy while in this world, ye will be for ever miſerable in the world to come. (3.) All the

                        </gap>et at nought all his counſel?</hi> Prov. i. 25, 26. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is an infallible connection betwixt a finally unregenerate ſtate and damnation, riſing from the nature of the things themſelves: and from the decree of heaven, which is fixed and unmoveable as mountains of braſs, John iii. 3. Rom. viii. 6. <hi>To be carnally minded is death.</hi> An unregenerate ſtate is hell in the bud. It is eternal deſtruction in embryo; growing daily, tho' thou doſt not diſcern it. Death is painted on many a fair face, in this life. Depraved nature makes men meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the damned, in utter darkneſs. (1.) The heart of ſtone within thee, is a ſinking weight, as a ſtone naturally goes downward; ſo the hard ſtony heart tends downward to the bottomleſs pit. Ye are hardned againſt reproof: though ye are told your danger; yet you will not ſee it, ye will not believe it. But remember, that the conſcience its being now feared with a hot iron, is a ſad preſage of everlaſting burnings. (2.) Your unfruitfulneſs under the means of grace, fits you for the ax of God's judgments, Matth. iii. 10. <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the fire.</hi> The withered branch is fuel for the fire, John xv. 6. Tremble at this ye deſpiſers of the goſpel: if ye be not thereby made meet for heaven, ye will be like the barren ground, bearing briers and thorns, nigh <hi>unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned,</hi> Heb. vi. 8. (3.) The helliſh diſpoſition of mind, which diſcover themſelves in profanity of life, fit the guilty for the regions of horror. A profane life will have a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able end. <hi>They which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. v. 19, 20, 21. Think on this, ye prayerleſs perſons, ye mockers of religion, ye curſers and ſwearers, ye unclean, and unjuſt perſons, who have not ſo much as moral honeſty to keep you from lying, cheating and ſtealing. What ſort of a tree think ye it to be, upon which theſe fruits grow? Is it a tree of righteouſneſs, which the Lord hath planted? Or is it ſuch an one as cumbers the ground, which God will pluck up for fuel to the fire of his wrath? (4.) Your being dead in ſin makes you meet to be wrapt in flames of brimſtone, as a winding ſheet; and to be buried in the bottomleſs pit, as in a grave. Great was the cry in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the firſt-born in each family was dead; but are there not many families, where all are dead together? Nay, many there are, who are <hi>twice dead, plucked up by the roots.</hi> Sometime, in their life, they have been rouzed by apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of death, and its conſequences; but now they are ſo far on in their way to the land of darkneſs, that they hardly ever have the leaſt glimmering of light from heaven. (5.) The darkneſs of your minds preſageth eternal darkneſs O the horrible ignorance ſome are plagued with while others who have got ſome rays of morning light into their heads; are utterly void of ſpiritual light in their hearts! If
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:045042_0160_101F7E92A8774890"/>
ye knew your caſe, ye would cry out, Oh! darkneſs! darkneſs! dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs making way for the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever! The face-covering is upon you already, as condemned perſons; ſo near are ye to everlaſting darkneſs. It is only Jeſus Chriſt who can ſtop the execution, pull the napkin off the face of the condemned malefactor, and put a pardon in his hand, Iſa. xxv. 7. <hi>And he will deſtroy in this mountain, the face of the covering caſt over all people,</hi> i e. The face-covering caſt over the condemned, as in <hi>Haman</hi>'s caſe, Eſther vii. 8. <hi>As the word went out of the king</hi>'s <hi>mouth, they covered Human</hi>'s <hi>face. Laſtly,</hi> The chains of darkneſs ye are bound with in the priſon of your depraved ſtate, Iſa. lxi. 1. fits you to be caſt into the burning fiery furnace. Ah miſerable men! Sometimes their conſciences ſtir within them, and they begin to think of amending their ways. But alas! they are in chains, they cannot do it. They are chained by the heart; their luſts cleave ſo faſt to them, that they cannot, nay, they will not, ſhake them off. Thus you ſee what affinity there is betwixt an unregenerate ſtate, and the ſtate of the damned, the ſtate of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and irretrievable miſery; be convinced then, that ye muſt be born again; put a high value on the new birth, and eagerly deſire it.</p>
                  <p>The text tells you, that <hi>the word is the ſeed,</hi> whereof the new creature is formed: therefore take heed to it, and entertain it, for it is your life. Apply yourſelves to the reading of the Scripture. Ye that cannot read, cauſe others read it to you. Wait diligently on the preaching of the word, as by divine appointment, the ſpecial mean of converſion: <hi>for—it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 21. Wherefore caſt not yourſelves out of Chriſt's way; reject not the means of grace, leſt ye be found to judge yourſelves unworthy of eternal life. Attend carefully to the word preached. Hear every ſermon, as if you were hearing for eternity: and take heed, the fowls of the air pick not up this ſeed from you as it is ſown. Give thyſelf wholly to it, 1 Tim iv 15. Receive it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, 1 Theſſ ii. 13. And hear it with application, looking on it as a meſſage ſent from heaven, to you in particular tho' not to you only, Rev iii. 22 <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the churches</hi> Lay it up in your hearts, meditate upon it: and be not as the unclean beaſts, that chew not the cud. But by earneſt prayer beg the dew of heaven may fall on thy heart, that the ſeed may ſpring up there.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, (1.) Receive the teſtimony of the word of God, concerning the miſery of an unregenerate ſtate, the ſinfulneſs thereof, and the abſolute neceſſity of regeneration. (2.) Receive its teſtimony concerning God, what a holy and juſt one he is. (3.) Examine thy ways by it; namely, the thoughts of thy heart, the expreſſions of thy lips, and the tenor of thy life Look back through the ſeveral periods of thy life, and ſee thy ſins from the precepts of the word; and learn from its threatnings, what thou art liable to, on the account of
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:045042_0161_101F7E945AACD798"/>
theſe ſins. (4.) View the corruption of thy nature, by the help of the ſame word of God; as a glaſs which repreſents our ugly face in a lively manner. Were theſe things deeply rooted in the heart, they might be the ſeed of that fear and ſorrow, on account of thy ſoul's ſtate, which are neceſſary to prepare and ſtir thee up to look after a Saviour. Fix your thoughts upon him offered to thee in the goſpel, as fully ſuited to thy caſe; having, by his obedience to the death, perfectly ſatisfied the juſtice of God, and brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs. This may prove the ſeed of humiliation, deſire, hope and faith; and put thee on to ſtretch out the withered hand unto him, at his own command.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe things ſink deeply into your hearts, and improve them diligently. Remember, whatever ye be, ye MUST be born again; elſe it had been better for you, ye had never been born Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any of you ſhall live and die in an unregenerate ſtate, ye will be inexcuſable, having been fairly warned of your hazard.</p>

                  <q>
                     <bibl>JOHN xv. 5.</bibl>
                     <p>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HAVING ſpoken of the change, made by regeneration on all thoſe that ſhall inherit eternal life, in oppoſition to their natural real ſtate, the ſtate of degeneracy; I proceed to ſpeak of the change made upon them, in their union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in oppoſition to their natural relative ſtate, the ſtate of miſery. The doctrine of the ſaints union with Chriſt is very plainly and fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, from the beginning of the 12th verſe of this chapter; which is a part of our Lord's fare-well ſermon to his diſciples. Sorrow had now filled their hearts; they were apt to ſay,
<q>Alas! What will become of us, when our Maſter is taken trom our head? Who will then inſtruct us? Who will ſolve our doubts? How will we be ſupported under our difficulties and diſcouragements? How will we be able to live without our wonted communications with him?</q>
Wherefore our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſeaſonably teaches them the myſtery of their union with him, comparing himſelf to the vine-ſtock, and them to the branches.</p>
               <p>He compares, I ſay, (1.) Himſelf to a vine ſtock: <hi>I am the Vine:</hi> He had been celebrating, with his diſciples, the Sacrament of his Supper, that ſign and ſeal of his people's union with himſelf; and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:045042_0162_101F7E9BA382AED8"/>
had told them, he would <hi>drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till</hi> he ſhould <hi>drink it new with</hi> them <hi>in</hi> his <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>kingdom:</hi> and now he ſhews himſelf to be the Vine, from whence the wine of their conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhould come. The vine hath leſs beauty than many other trees: but is exceeding fruitful; fitly repreſenting the low condition our Lord was then in, yet bringing many ſons to glory. But that which is chiefly aimed at, in his comparing himſelf to a vine, is to repreſent himſelf as the ſupporter and nouriſher of his people, in whom they live, and bring forth fruit. (2.) He compares them to the branches, <hi>ye are the branches</hi> of that Vine. Ye are the branches knit to, and growing on this ſtock: drawing all your life and ſap from it. It is a beautiful compariſon; as if he had ſaid, <hi>I am as a Vine, ye are as the branche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of that Vine.</hi> Now there are two ſorts of branches: (1.) Natural branches, which at firſt ſpring out of the ſtock: theſe are the branches that are in the tree, and were never out of it. (2) There are ingrafted branches, which are branches broken off from the tree that firſt gave their life; and put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to grow upon it. Thus branches come to be on a tree, which originally were not on it. The branches mentioned in the text, are of the latter ſort; <hi>branches broken off,</hi> (as the word in the original language denotes) namely, from the tree that firſt gave them life. None of the children of men are natural branches of the ſecond <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the true Vine; they are all the natural branches of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that degenerate vine; but the elect are all of them ſooner or later broken off from the natural ſtock, and ingrafted into Chriſt the true Vine.</p>
               <p>DOCT. <hi>They who are in the ſtate of grace, are ingrafted in, and united to, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They are taken out of their natural ſtock, cut off from it; and are now ingrafted into Chriſt as the new ſtock. In handling of this, I ſhall ſpeak to the <hi>Myſtical Union,</hi> (1.) More generally. (2.) More particularly.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>A general View of the Myſtical Union.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, In the general, for underſtanding the union betwixt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his elect, who believe in him, and on him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a ſpiritual union. Man and wife, by their marriage-union, become one fleſh: Chriſt and true believers, by this union, become <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 17. As one ſoul or ſpirit actuates both the head, and the members, in the natural body; ſo the one Spirit of God dwells in Chriſt and the Chriſtian; for, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom viii. 9. Corporal union is made by contract; ſo the ſtones in a building are united: but this is an union of another nature. Were it poſſible we could eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of Chriſt, in a corporal and carnal manner; it would profit nothing, John vi. 63. It was not <hi>Mary</hi>'s bearing him in her womb, but her believing on him, that made her a ſaint, Luke xi. 27, 28.
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:045042_0163_101F7E9ED82C89A0"/>
                     <hi>A certain woman—ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked But he ſaid, Yea, rather, bleſſed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a real union. Such is our weakneſs in our preſent ſtate, ſo much are we immerſed in ſin, that we are prone to form in our fancy an image of every thing propoſed to us; and as to whatſoever is denied us, we are apt to ſuſpect it to be but a fiction, or what has no reality. But nothing is more real, than what is ſpiritual; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching neareſt to the nature of Him who is the fountain of all reality, namely, God himſelf. We do not ſee with our eyes the union betwixt our own ſoul and body; neither can we repreſent it to ourſelves truly, by imagination, as we do ſenſible things: yet the reality of it is not to be doubted. Faith is no fancy, but the ſubſtance of things hoped for, Heb xi. Neither is the union thereby made betwixt Chriſt and believers, imaginary, but moſt real: <hi>for we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Eph v. 30.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a moſt cloſe and intimate union. Believers, regenerate perſons, who fiduciouſly credit him and rely on him, have put on Chriſt, Gal. iii 27. If that be not enough, he is in them, John xvii. 23. formed in them, as the child in the mother's belly, Gal. iv. 19. He is the foundation, 1Cor iii 11. They are the lively ſtones built upon him, 1 Pet ii. 5. He is the Head, and they the body, Eph. i. 22, 23. Nay, he liveth in them, as their very ſouls in their bodies, Gal. ii. 30. And, what is more than all this, they are one in the Father, and the Son, as the Father is in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the Father, John xvii 21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou the Father art in me, and I in thee, they alſo may be one in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though it is not a mere legal union, yet it is an union ſuſtained in law. Chriſt as the cautioner, the Chriſtians as the principal debtors, are one, in the eye of the law. When the elect had run themſelves, with the reſt of mankind, in debt to the juſtice of God; Chriſt became ſurety for them, and paid the debt. When they believe on him, they are united to him in a ſpiritual marriage-union; which takes effect ſo far, that what he did and ſuffered for them, is reckoned in law, as if they had done and ſuffered for themſelves. Hence they are ſaid to be crucified with Jeſus, Gal. ii. 20. Buried with him, Col. ii 12. Yea, raiſed up together, (namely, with Chriſt) <hi>and made to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. ii. 6. In which places, ſaints on earth, of whom the Apoſtle there ſpeaks, cannot be ſaid to be ſitting, but in the way of law-reckoning.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is an indiſſoluble union. Once in Chriſt, ever in him. Having taken up his habitation in the heart, he never removes. None can untie this happy knot. Who will diſſolve this union? Will he himſelf o it? No, he will not; we have his word for it: <hi>I will not turn away from them,</hi> Jer. xxxii. 40. But perhaps the ſinner will do this miſchief for himſelf; no, he ſhall not, <hi>They ſhall not depart from me, ſaith their God,</hi> ibid. Can devils do it? No, unleſs they be ſtronger
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:045042_0164_101F7EA2131F89D0"/>
than Chriſt, and his Father too: <hi>Neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand,</hi> ſaith our Lord, John x. 28. <hi>And none is able to pluck them out of my Father</hi>'s <hi>hand,</hi> ver. 39. But, what ſay you of death, which parts huſband and wife; yea, ſeparates the ſoul from the body? Will not death do it? No; the Apoſtle, Rom. viii. 38 39. is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that neither death, (as terrible is it is) nor life, (as deſirable as it is) nor devils, thoſe evil angels, nor the devil's perſecuting agents, tho' they be principalities or powers on earth; nor evil things preſent, already lying on us, nor evil things to come on us; nor the height of worldly felicity, nor depth of worldly miſery; nor any other creature, good or ill, <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord</hi> As death ſeparated Chriſt's ſoul from his body, but could not ſeparate either his ſoul or body from his divine nature; ſo, tho' the ſaints ſhould be ſeparated from their neareſt relations in the world, and from all their earthly enjoyments; yea, tho' their ſouls ſhould be ſeparate from their bodies, and their bodies ſeparate in a thouſand pieces, their bones ſcattered, as when one cutteth or cleaveth wood: yet ſoul and body, and every piece of the body, the ſmalleſt duſt of it ſhall remain united to the Lord Chriſt: for even in death, <hi>they ſleep in Jeſus,</hi> 1 Theſſ. iv. 14 And, <hi>he keepeth all their bones,</hi> Pſal. xxxiv. 20 Union with Chriſt, is <hi>the grace wherein we ſtand,</hi> firm and ſtable, <hi>as mount Zion, which cannot be removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is a myſterious union. The goſpel is a doctrine of myſteries. It diſcovers to us the ſubſtantial union of the three Perſons in one Godhead, 1 John v 7. <hi>Theſe three are one:</hi> the hypoſtatical union of the divine and human natures, in the perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Tim iii. 16. <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh:</hi> and the myſtical union, betwixt Chriſt and believers; this is a great myſtery alſo, Eph. v. 32. O what myſteries are here! the head in heaven, the members on earth, yet really united! Chriſt in the believer, living in him, walking in him: and the believer dwelling in God, putting on the Lord Jeſus, eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood? this makes the ſaints a myſtery to the world; yea, a myſtery to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY I come now more particularly to ſpeak of this union with, and ingrafting into Jeſus Chriſt. And, (1.) I ſhall conſider the natural ſtock, which the branches are taken out of (2.) The ſupernatural ſtock, they are ingrafted into. (3) What branches are cut off the old ſtock, and put into the new. (4) How it is done. And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The benefits flowing from this union and ingrafting.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of the natural and ſupernatural Stocks, and the Branches, taken out of the former, and ingrafted into the latter.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. Let us take a view of the ſtock, which the branches are taken out of. The two <hi>Adams,</hi> that is <hi>Adam</hi> and CHRIST, are the two ſtocks: for the ſcripture ſpeaks of theſe two, as if there had never been more men in the world than they, 1 Cor. xv. 45. <hi>The firſt man
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:045042_0165_101F7EA6ABA1E818"/>
Adam was made a living ſoul, the laſt Adam was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> Ver. 47. <hi>The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven.</hi> And the reaſon is, there were never any, that were not branches of one of theſe two; all men being either in the one ſtock or in the other; for in theſe two ſorts all mankind ſtands divided: Ver. 48. <hi>As is the earthy, ſuch are they alſo that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> are they alſo that are heavenly.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> then is the natural ſtock: on this ſtock are the branches found growing at firſt; which are afterwards cut off, and ingrafted into Chriſt. As for the fallen angels, as they had no relation to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo they have none to ſecond.</p>
                  <p>There are four things to be remembered here, (1.) That all mankind (the man Chriſt excepted) are naturally branches of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> Rom. v. 12. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin: and ſo death paſſed upon all men.</hi> (2.) The bond which knit us unto the natural ſtock, was the covenant of works. <hi>Adam</hi> being our natural root, was made the moral root alſo; bearing all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as repreſenting them in the covenant of works. For, <hi>by one man</hi>'s <hi>diſobedience many were made ſinners,</hi> Rom. v. 19 Now, there behoved to be a peculiar relation betwixt that one man and the many, as a foundation for imputing his ſin to them. This relation did not ariſe from the mere natural bond betwixt him and us, as a father to his children; for ſo we are related to our immediate parents, whoſe ſins are not thereupon imputed to us as <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin is. It behoved then to ariſe from a moral bond betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and us; the bond of a covenant, which could be no other than the covenant of works, wherein we were united to him as branches to a ſtock. Hence Jeſus Chriſt, though a ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> Luke iii 23, 38. was none of theſe branches; for ſeeing he came not of <hi>Adam,</hi> in virtue of the bleſſing of marriage, which was given before the fall, (Gen. i 28. <hi>Be fruitful and multiply,</hi> &amp;c.) but in virtue of a ſpecial promiſe made after the fall, (Gen. iii. 15. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent</hi>'s <hi>head.) Adam</hi> could not repreſent him in a covenant made before his fall. (3.) As it is impoſſible for a branch to be in two ſtocks at once; ſo no man can be, at one and the ſame time, both in the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> (4) Hence it evidently follows, that all who are not ingrafted in Jeſus Chriſt, are yet branches of the old ſtock; and ſo partake of the nature of the ſame. Now, as to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> our natural ſtock: Conſider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> What a ſtock he was originally. He was a vine of the Lord's planting, a choice vine, a noble vine wholly a right ſeed There was a conſultation of the Trinity, at the planting of this vine, Gen. i. 26. <hi>Let us make man in our own image, often our own likeneſs.</hi> There was no rottenneſs, at the heart of it. There was ſap and juice enough in it, to have nouriſhed all the branches, to bring forth fruit unto God. My meaning is, <hi>Adam</hi> was made able perfectly to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, which would have procured eternal life to himſelf, and
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:045042_0166_101F7EA998152170"/>
to all his poſterity; for ſeeing all die by <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience; all ſhould have had life, by his obedience, if he had ſtood. Conſider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What that ſtock now is: ah! moſt unlike to what it was, when planted by the Author and Fountain of all good. A blaſt from hell, and a bite with the venomous teeth of the old ſerpent, have made it a degenerate ſtock, a dead ſtock; nay, a killing ſtock.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> It is a degenerate naughty ſtock. <hi>Therefore the Lord God ſaid to Adam,</hi> in that diſmal day, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> Gen iii 9. In what condition art thou now? How art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine, unto me? Or, <hi>where waſt thou?</hi> Why not in the place of meeting with me? Why ſo long a-coming? What meaneth this fearful change, this hiding of thyſelf from me? Alas! the ſtock is degenerate, quite ſpoiled, become altogether naught, and brings forth wild grapes. Converſe with the devil is preferred to communion with God Satan is believed; and God, who is truth itſelf, diſbelieved. He who was the friend of God, is now in conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt him. Darkneſs is come into the room of light: ignorance prevails in the mind, where divine knowledge ſhone: the <hi>will,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time righteous or regular, is now turned rebel againſt its Lord: and the whole man is in dreadful diſorder.</p>
                  <p>Before I go further, let me ſtop and obſerve, Here is a mirror both for ſaints and ſinners. Sinners, ſtand here and conſider, what you are: and ſaints learn ye, what on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ye were. Ye, ſinners, are branches of a degenerate ſtock. Fruit you may bear indeed; but now that your vine is the vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> your grapes muſt, of courſe, be grapes of gall, Deut. xxxii. 32. The Scripture ſpeaks of two ſorts of fruit, which grow on the branches upon the natural ſtock: and it is plain enough, they are of the nature of their degenerate ſtock. (1.) The <hi>wild grapes of wickedneſs,</hi> Iſa. v. 2. Theſe grow in abundance by influence from hell. See Gal. v. 19, 20, 21. At their gates are all manner of theſe fruits, both new and old. Storms come from heaven to put them back; but they ſtill grow. They are ſtruck at with the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God: conſcience gives them many a ſecret blow: yet they thrive. (2) <hi>Fruit to themſelves,</hi> Hoſ. x. 1. What elſe are all the unrenewed man's acts of obedience, his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſober deportment, his prayers, and good works? They are all done, chiefly, for himſelf, not for the glory of God. Theſe fruits are like the apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> fair to look at, but fall to aſhes, when handled and tried. Ye think ye have not only the leaves of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but the fruits of a holy practice too; but, if ye be not broken off from the old ſtock, and ingrafted in Chriſt Jeſus, God accepts not, nor regards your fruits.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt take occaſion to tell you, there are five faults will be found in heaven, with your beſt fruits. (1.) Their bitterneſs; <hi>your cluſters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

one word, their fruits are fruits of an ill tree, that cannot be accepted in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Our natural ſtock is a dead ſtock, according to the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Gen. ii. 17 <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Our root now is rottenneſs, no marvel the bloſſom go up as duſt. The ſtroke is gone to the heart; the ſap is let out, and the tree is withered. The curſe of the firſt covenant, like a hot thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt from heaven has lighted on it, and ruined it. It is curſed now as the fig-tree, Matth. xxi. 19. <hi>Let no fruit grow on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, henceforth for ever.</hi> Now it is good for nothing, but to cumber the ground, and furniſh fuel for <hi>Tophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me enlarge a little here alſo. Every unrenewed man is a branch of a dead ſtock. When thou ſeeſt, O ſinner, a dead ſtock of a tree, exhauſted of all its ſap, having branches on it in the ſame condition; look on it as a lively repreſentation of thy ſoul's ſtate. (1.) Where the ſtock is dead, the branches muſt needs be barren. Alas! the barrenneſs of many profeſſors plainly diſcovers on what ſtock they are growing. It is eaſy to pretend to faith, but ſhew me thy faith without thy works, if thou canſt, James ii. 17. (2.) A dead ſtock can convey no ſap to the branches, to make them bring forth fruit. The covenant of works was the bond of our union with the natural ſtock; but now it is become weak through the fleſh; that is, through the degeneracy and depravity of human nature, Rom vii. 3. It is ſtrong enough to command, and to bind heavy burdens on the ſhoulders of thoſe who are not in Chriſt; but it affords no ſtrength to bear them. The ſap that was once in the root, is now gone: and the law, like a mercileſs creditor, apprehends <hi>Adam</hi>'s heirs, ſaying, <hi>Pay what thou oweſt;</hi> when, alas! his effects are riotouſly ſpent (3.) All pains and coſt are loſt on the tree, whoſe life is gone. In vain do men labour to get fruit on the branches, when there is no ſap in the root. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The gardiner's pains are loſt: miniſters loſe their labour on the branches of the old ſtock, while they continue in it. Many ſermons are preached to no purpoſe; becauſe there is no life to give ſenſation. Sleeping men may be awakened; but the dead cannot be raiſed without a miracle: even ſo, the dead ſinner muſt remain ſo, if he be not reſtored to life, by a miracle of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The influences of heaven are loſt on ſuch a tree: in vain doth the rain fall upon it: in vain is it laid open to the winter-cold and froſts. The Lord of the vineyard digs about many a dead ſoul, but it is not bettered. <hi>Bruiſe the fool in a mortar, his folly will not depart.</hi> Tho' he meets with many croſſes, yet he retains his luſts: let him be laid on a ſick-bed, he will there ly like a ſick beaſt, groaning under his pain; but not mourning for, nor turning from his ſin. Let death itſelf ſtare him in the face; he will preſumptuouſly maintain his hope, as if he would look the grim meſſenger out of countenance. Sometimes there are common operations of the divine Spirit performed on him: he is ſent home
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:045042_0169_101F7EAE6E79EF18"/>
with a trembling heart; and with arrows of conviction ſticking in his ſoul; but at length he prevails againſt theſe things, and turns as ſecure as ever. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Summer and winter are alike to the branches of the dead ſtock. When others about them are budding, bloſſoming, and bringing forth fruit; there is no change on them; the dead ſtock has no growing time at all. Perhaps it may be difficult to know, in the winter, what trees are <hi>dead,</hi> and what are <hi>alive</hi>; but the ſpring plainly diſcovers it. There are ſome ſeaſons, wherein there is little life to be perceived, even among ſaints; yet times of reviving come at length. But even when <hi>the vine flouriſheth, and the pomegranates bud forth</hi> (when ſaving grace is diſcovering itſelf, by its lively actings, whereſoever it is) the branches on the old ſtock are ſtill <hi>withered:</hi> when the <hi>dry bones</hi> are coming together, bone to bone, amongſt ſaints; the ſinners bones are ſtill lying about the grave's mouth. They are trees that <hi>cumber the ground,</hi> are near to be cut down: and will be cut down for the fire, if God in mercy prevent it not by cutting them off from that ſtock, and ingrafting them into another.</p>

                     </gap>, Our natural ſtock is a killing ſtock. If the ſtock die, how can the branches live? If the ſap be gone from the root and heart, the branches muſt needs wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the branches come to be infected: <hi>death is in the pot;</hi> and all that taſte of the pulſe, or pottage are killed.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that every natural man is a branch of a <hi>killing</hi> ſtock. Our natural root not only gives us not life, but it has a killing power reaching all the branches thereof. There are four things, which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> conveys to all his branches; and they are abiding in, and lying on, ſuch of them as are not ingrafted to Chriſt. <hi>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And till they be cut off from this ſtock by the pruning knife; the ſword of vengeance hangs over their heads, to cut them down. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This killing ſtock tranſmits the curſe into the branches. The ſtock, as the ſtock, (for I ſpeak not of <hi>Adam</hi> in his perſonal and private capacity) being curſed; ſo are the branches. Gal iii. 10. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe</hi> This curſe affects the whole man, and all that belongs to him, every thing he poſſeſſes; and worketh three ways.

He teareth their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them in his wrath, purſueth them with terrors, rents their ſouls from their bodies, and throws the deadhed branch into the fire. Thus the curſe devours like fire, which none can quench. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This killing ſtock tranſmits death to the branches upon it. <hi>Adam</hi> took the poiſonous cup, and drunk it off: this occaſioned death to himſelf and us. We came into the world ſpiritually dead, thereby obnoxious to eternal death, and abſolutely liable to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death. This root is to us like the <hi>Scythian</hi> river, which, they ſay, brings forth little bladders every day, out of which come certain ſmall flies, which are bred in the morning, winged at noon, and dead at night: a very lively emblem of our mortal ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sirs, is it not abſolutely neceſſary to be <hi>broken off</hi> from this our <hi>natural</hi> ſtock? What will our fair leaves of a profeſſion, or our fruits of duties avail, if we be ſtill <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>degenerate, dead</hi> and <hi>killing</hi> ſtock? But, alas! among the many queſtions toſſed among us, few are taken up about theſe,
<q>Whether am I broken off from the old ſtock, or not? Whether am I ingrafted in Chriſt, or not?</q>
Ah! wherefore all this waſte! Why is there ſo much noiſe about religion amongſt many, who can give no good account of their having laid a good foundation, being mere ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>experimental</hi> religion? I fear, if God do not, in mercy, timeouſly undermine the religion of many of us, and let us ſee we have <hi>none</hi> at all; our root will be found rottenneſs, and our bloſſom go up as duſt, in a dying hour. Therefore, let us look to our <hi>ſtate,</hi> that we be not found <hi>fools</hi> in our latter end.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Let us now view the <hi>ſupernatural</hi> ſtock in which the branches, cut off from the <hi>natural ſtock,</hi> are ingrafted. Jeſus Chriſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>the branch,</hi> Zech. ii. 8. So he is, in reſpect of his human nature; being a branch, and the top branch of the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> Sometimes he is called <hi>a root,</hi> Iſa. xi. 10. we have both together, Rev. xxii. 16. <hi>I am the root, and the off-ſpring of David</hi>: David's <hi>root,</hi> as God; and his <hi>off-ſpring,</hi> as man. The text tells, that he is <hi>the Vine</hi>: he, as Mediator, is the <hi>vine-ſtock,</hi> whereof believers
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:045042_0171_101F7EB48ADA4E18"/>
are the branches. As the ſap comes from the earth into the root and ſtock, and from thence is diffuſed into the branches; ſo by Chriſt, as Mediator, divine life is conveyed from the fountain unto theſe who are united to him by faith, John vi 57 <hi>As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> Now Chriſt is Mediator, not as God only, as ſome have aſſerted: nor yet as man only, as the Papiſts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hold: but he is Mediator as God-man, Acts xx. 28 —<hi>The church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his blood.</hi> Heb. ix 14. <hi>Chriſt, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God.</hi> The divine and human natures have their diſtinct actings, yet a joint operation in this, diſcharging the office of a Mediator. This is illuſtrated by the ſimilitude of a fiery ſword, which at once cuts and burns: cutting it burneth, and burning it cutteth; the ſteel cuts, and the fire burns. Wherefore Chriſt, God-man, is the ſtock, whereof believers are the branches: and they are united to whole Chriſt. They are united to him in his <hi>human nature,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Eph v. 30. and they are united to him in his <hi>divine nature;</hi> for ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks of this union, Col. i. 27. <hi>Chriſt, in you, the hope of glory.</hi> And by him they are united to the Father, and to the Holy Ghoſt, 1 John iv. 15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi> Faith, the bond of this union, receives whole Chriſt, God-man: and ſo unites us to him as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Behold here, O believers, your high privilege Ye were once branches of a <hi>degenerate</hi> ſtock, even as others: but ye are, by grace, become branches of <hi>the true Vine,</hi> John xv. 1. Ye are cut out of a <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>killing</hi> ſtock; and ingrafted <hi>in the laſt Adam, who was made a quickning Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 45. Your loſs by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is made up, with great advantage, by your union with the ſecond. <hi>Adam,</hi> at his beſt eſtate, was but a ſhrub, in compariſon with Chriſt the tree of life. He was but a ſervant, Chriſt is the Son, the Heir, and Lord of all things, <hi>the Lord from heaven.</hi> It cannot be denied, that <hi>grace</hi> was ſhown in the <hi>firſt</hi> covenant: but it is as far exceeded by the grace of the <hi>ſecond</hi> covenant, as the twilight is, by the light of the mid-day.</p>

Thanks to the huſbandman, not to the branch, that it is cut off from its natural ſtock, and ingrafted into a new one. The ſinner, in his coming off from the firſt ſtock, is paſſive; and neither can nor will come off from it of his own accord; but clings to it, till almighty <hi>power</hi> make him to fall off, John vi 44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> And chap. v. 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi> The ingrafted branches are <hi>God's huſbandry,</hi> 1 Cor. iii. 9 <hi>The planting of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. lxi. 3. The ordinary means he makes uſe of in this work, is the miniſtry of the word, 1 Cor. iii 9 <hi>We are labourers together with God.</hi> But the efficacy thereof is wholly from him, whatever the miniſter's part or piety be, ver. 7. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> The Apoſtle preached to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet the body of that people remained in infidelity, Rom. x. 16. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> Yea, Chriſt himſelf, who ſpoke as never man ſpoke, ſaith concerning the ſucceſs of his own miniſtry, <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought,</hi> Iſa xlix. The branches may be hacked by the preaching of the word: but the ſtroke will never go through, till it be carried home on them, by an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent arm.

                  <p>The <hi>cutting off</hi> of the branch from the natural ſtock, is performed by the prunning knife of the <hi>law,</hi> in the hand of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, Gal. ii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They hold by it, like the man who held the ſhip with his hands; and when one hand was cut off, held it with the other; and when both were cut off, held it with his teeth This will appear from a diſtinct view of the Lord's work on men, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off from the old ſtock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I now offer in theſe following particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> When the Spirit of the Lord comes to deal with a perſon, to bring him to Chriſt; he finds him the <hi>Laodlee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> no that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> And therefore he darts in ſome beams of light into the dark ſoul; and lets the man ſee he is a loſt man, if he turn not over a new leaf, and betake himſelf to a new courſe of life. Thus by the Spirit of the Lord, acting as a <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> there is a criminal court erected in the man's breaſt; where he is arraigned, accuſed, and condemned for breaking the law of God, <hi>convinced of ſin and judgment,</hi> John xvi. 8. And now he can no longer ſleep ſecurely in his former courſe of life. This is the firſt ſtroke the branch gets, in order to cutting off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hereupon the man forſake his former profane courſes; his lying, ſwearing, Sabbath-breaking, ſtealing, and ſuch like practices, though they be dear to him as right eyes, he will rather quit them, than ruin his ſoul. The ſhip is like to ſink, and therefore he throweth his goods over-board, that he himſelf may not periſh. And now he begins to bleſs himſelf in his heart, and look joyfully on his evidences for heaven; thinking himſelf a better ſervant to God than many others, Luke xviii. 11. <hi>God, I thank that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. But he ſoon gets another ſtroke with the ax of the law, ſhewing him that it is only he that <hi>doth</hi> what is written in the law, who can be ſaved by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and that his negative holineſs is too ſcanty a cover from the ſtorm of God's wrath. And thus, although his ſins of commiſſion only were heavy on him before: his ſins of <hi>omiſſion</hi> now crowd into his thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, attended with a train of law-curſes and vengeance. And c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon this he turns to a poſitively holy courſe of life. He not only is not profane, but he performs religious duties: he prays, ſeeks the knowledge of the principles of religion, ſtrictly obſerves the Lord's day, and, like <hi>Herod, does away things, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ard converſation, to the letter of both tables of the law. And now there is a mighty change upon the man, that his neighbours cannot miſs to take notice of. Hence he is cheerfully admitted by the godly into their ſociety, as a praying perſon, and can confer with them about religious matters, yea, and about <hi>ſoul-exerciſe,</hi> which ſome are not acquainted with. And their good opinion of him confirms his good
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:045042_0174_101F7EC094655040"/>
opinion of himſelf. This ſtep in religion is fatal to many, who never get beyond it. But here the Lord reacheth the elect-branch a farther ſtroke. Conſcience flies in the man's face, for ſome wrong ſteps in his converſation: the neglect of ſome duty, or commiſſion of ſome ſin, which is a blot in his converſation: and then the flaming ſword of the law appears again over his head: and the curſe rings in his ears, for <hi>curſed is he that continueth not in all things written in the law to do them,</hi> Gal. iii. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> On this account he is obliged to ſeek another ſalve for his ſore. He goes to God, confeſſeth his ſin; ſeeks the pardon of it, promiſing to watch againſt it for the time to come; and ſo finds eaſe, and thinks he may very well take it, ſeeing the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 John i. 9. not conſidering that he graſps at a privilege, which is theirs only who are ingrafted into Chriſt, and under the covenant of grace; and which the branches yet growing on the old ſtock cannot plead. And here ſometimes there are formal and expreſs vows made againſt ſuch and ſuch ſins, and binding to ſuch and ſuch duties. Thus many go on all their days; knowing no other religion but to do duties, and to confeſs, and pray for pardon of that wherein they fail; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing themſelves eternal happineſs, though they are utter ſtrangers to Chriſt. Here many elect ones have been caſt down wounded, and many reprobates have been ſlain; while the wounds of neither of them have been deep enough, to cut them off from their natural ſtock. But the Spirit of the Lord gives yet a deeper ſtroke to the branch which is to be cut off; ſhewing him, that, as yet, he is but an <hi>out-ſide ſaint;</hi> and diſcovering to him the filthy luſts lodged in his heart, which he took no notice of before, Rom vii. 9. <hi>When the commandment came, ſin revived, and I died.</hi> Then he ſees his heart a dung-hill of helliſh luſts; filled with covetouſneſs, pride, malice, filthineſs, and the like. Now, as ſoon as the door of <hi>the chambers of his imagery</hi> is thus opened to him, and he ſees what <hi>they do there in the dark,</hi> his <hi>out-ſide</hi> religion is blown up as inſufficient; and he learns a new leſſon in religion; namely, <hi>That he is not a Jew which is one outwardly,</hi> Rom. ii. 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Upon this he goes further, even to <hi>in ſide</hi> religion; ſets to work more vigorouſly than ever, mourns over the evils of his heart, and ſtrives to bear down the weeds he finds growing in that neglected garden. He labours to curb his pride and paſſion; and to baniſh ſpeculative impurities; prays more fervently, hears attentively, and ſtrives to get his heart affected in every religious duty he performs; and thus he comes to think himſelf not only an outſide, but an <hi>in-ſide</hi> Chriſtian. Wonder not at this: for there is nothing in it beyond the power of nature, or what one may attain to under a vigorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the covenant of works. Therefore another yet deeper ſtroke is reached. The law chargeth home on the man's conſcience, thal he was a <hi>tranſgreſſor from the womb;</hi> that he came into the world a guilty creature: and that, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

even ſince his eyes were opened, he has been guilty of many actual ſins, either altogether overlooked by him, or not ſufficiently mourned over: (For ſpiritual ſores, not healed by the blood of Chriſt, but ſkinned over ſome other way, are eaſily ruffled, and as ſoon break out again.) And therefore the law takes him by the throat, ſaying, <hi>Pay what thou oweſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Then the ſinner ſays in his heart, <hi>Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all:</hi> and ſo falls to work to pacify an offended God, and to atone for theſe ſins. He renews his repentance, ſuch as it is; bears patiently the afflictions laid upon him; yea, he afflicts himſelf, denies himſelf the uſe of his lawful comforts, ſighs deeply, mourns bitterly, cries with tears for a pardon, till he hath wrought up his heart to a conceit of having obtained it; having thus done pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for what is <hi>paſt,</hi> and reſolving to be a good ſervant to God, and to hold on in outward and inward obedience, for the time to <hi>come.</hi> But the ſtroke muſt go nearer the heart yet, ere the branch fall off. The Lord diſcovers to him, in the glaſs of the law, how he ſinneth in all he does, even when he does the beſt he can; and therefore the dreadful ſound returns to his ears, Gal. iii. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When ye faſted and mourned,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Did ye at all faſt unto me, even to me?</hi> Will muddy water make clean clothes? Will you ſatisfy for one ſin with another? Did not your thoughts wander in ſuch a duty? Were not your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions flat in another? Did not your heart give a whoriſh look to ſuch an idol? And did it not riſe in a fit of impatience under ſuch an afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Should I accept this of your hands? Curſed be the deceiver, which ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> Mal. i. 13, 14. And thus he becomes ſo far broke off, that he ſees he is not able to <hi>ſatisfy</hi> the demands of the law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Hence, like a broken man, who finds he is not able to pay all his debts, he goes about to compound with his creditor. And being in purſuit of eaſe and comfort, he does what he can to fulfil the law; and wherein he fails, he looks that God will accept the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed.</hi> Thus doing his duty, and having a will to do better, he cheats himſelf in a perſuaſion of the goodneſs of his ſtate: and hereby thouſands are ruined. But the elect get another ſtroke, which looſeth their hold in this caſe. The doctrine of the law is born in on their conſciences; demonſtrating to them, that exact and perfect obedience is required by it, under pain of the curſe: and that it is <hi>doing,</hi> and not <hi>wiſhing</hi> to do, which will avail. <hi>Wiſhing</hi> to do better will not anſwer the law's demands: and therefore the curſe ſounds again, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not</hi>—to do <hi>them;</hi> that is, actually to <hi>do them.</hi> In vain is wiſhing then.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Being broken off from hopes of compounding with the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w, he falls a <hi>borrowing.</hi> He ſees that all he can <hi>do</hi> to obey the law, and all his deſires to <hi>be,</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> better, will not ſave his ſoul: therefore he goes to Chriſt, intreating, that his righteouſneſs may
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:045042_0176_101F7EC537AA7530"/>
make up what is wanting in his own, and cover all the defects of his doings and ſufferings; that ſo God, for Chriſt's ſake, may accept them, and thereupon be reconciled. Thus doing what he can to fulfil the law, and looking to Chriſt to make up all his <hi>defects,</hi> he comes at length, again to ſleep in a ſound ſkin. Many perſons are ruined this way. This was the error of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> which <hi>Paul,</hi> in his epiſtle to them, diſputes againſt. But the Spirit of God breaks off the ſinner from this hold alſo: by bearing in on his conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ience that great truth, Gal. iii. 12. <hi>The law is not of faith; but the man that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> There is no mixing of the law and faith in this buſineſs; the ſinner muſt hold by one of them, and let the other go: the way of the law, and the way of faith, are ſo far different, that it is not poſſible for a ſinner to walk in the one, but he muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e off from the other: and if he be for <hi>doing,</hi> he muſt <hi>do all alone;</hi> Chriſt will not do a <hi>part</hi> for him, if he do not all. A garment pieced up of ſundry ſorts of righteouſneſs, is not a garment meet for the court of heaven. Thus the man, who was in a dream, and thought he was eating, is awakened by the ſtroke, and behold his ſoul is faint; his heart ſinks in him like a ſtone; while he finds he can neither bear his burden himſelf alone, nor can he get help under it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> What can one do, who muſt needs pay, and yet neither has as much of his own as will bring him out of debt, nor can he get as much to borrow; and <hi>to beg he is aſhamed?</hi> What can ſuch a one do, I ſay, but <hi>ſell himſelf,</hi> as the man under the law, that was <hi>waxen poor?</hi> Lev. xxv. 47. Therefore the ſinner beat off from ſo many holds, goes about to make a bargain with Chriſt, and to <hi>ſell himſelf</hi> to the Son of God, (if I may ſo ſpeak) ſolemnly promiſing and vowing, that he will be a ſervant to Chriſt, as long as he lives, if <hi>he</hi> will ſave his ſoul. And here oft-times the ſinner makes a perſonal covenant with Chriſt, reſigning himſelf to him on theſe terms; yea, and takes the ſacrament, to make the bargain ſure. Hereupon the man's great care is, how to obey Chriſt, keep his commands, and ſo fulfil his bargain. And, in this the ſoul finds a falſe, unfound peace, for a while; till the Spirit of the Lord fetch another ſtroke, to cut off the man from this refuge of lies likewiſe. And that happens in this manner: When he fails of the duties he engaged to, and falls again into the ſin he covenanted againſt; it is powerfully carried home on his conſcience, that his covenant is broken: ſo all his comfort goes, and terrors afreſh ſeize on his ſoul, as one that has broken covenant with Chriſt, and commonly the man, to help himſelf, renews his covenant but breaks again as before. And how is it poſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, ſeeing he is ſtill upon the old ſtock? Thus the work of many, all their days, as to their ſouls, is nothing but a making and breaking ſuch covenants, over and over again.</p>

This is ſad work; and therefore he muſt have a deeper ſtroke yet; elſe he is ruined. This ſtroke is reached him with the ax of the law, in its <hi>irritating</hi> power. Thus the law girding the ſoul with cords of death, and holding it in with the rigorous commands of obedience, under the pain of the curſe; and God, in his holy and wiſe conduct, withdrawing his reſtraining grace; <hi>corruption</hi> is <hi>irritated,</hi> luſts become violent, and the more they are ſtriven againſt, the more they rage, like a furious horſe checked with the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Here oft-times atheiſm, blaſphemy, and, in one word, <hi>horrible things concerning God, terrible thoughts concerning the faith,</hi> ariſe in his breaſt: ſo that his heart is a very hell within him. Thus, while he is ſweeping the houſe of his heart, not yet watered with goſpel-grace, theſe corruptions which lay quiet before in neglected corners, ſly up and down in it like duſt. He is as one who is mending a dam, and while he's repairing breaches in it, and ſtrengthening every part of it, a mighty flood comes down, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns his work, and drives all away before it, as well what was newly laid, as what was laid before. Read, Rom. vii. 8, 9, 10, 13. This
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:045042_0180_101F7ED1B985B928"/>
is a ſtroke which goes to the heart: and, by it, his hope of getting himſelf <hi>nore ſit</hi> to come to Chriſt, is cut off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Now the time is come when the man betwixt hope and deſpair, reſolves to go to Chriſt as he is: and therefore, like a dying man ſtretching himſelf, juſt before his breath goes out, he rallies the broken forces of his ſoul; tries to believe, and in ſome ſort lays hold on Jeſus Chriſt. And now the branch hangs on the old ſtock, by one ſingle tack of a natural faith, produced by the natural vigour of one's own ſpirit, under a moſt preſſing neceſſity, Pſal. lxxxviii. 34, 35.
<q>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned and enquired early after God. And they remembred that God was their rock, and the high God their Redeemer.</q>
Hoſ. viii. 2. <hi>Iſrael ſhall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</hi> But the Lord minding to perfect his work, fetches yet another ſtroke, whereby the branch falls quite off. The Spirit of God convincingly diſcovers to the ſinner, his utter inability to do any thing that is good: and ſo he dieth, Rom. vii. 9. That voice powerfully ſtrikes through his ſoul, <hi>How can ye believe?</hi> John v. 44. Thou canſt no more believe, than thou canſt reach up thine hand to heaven, and bring Chriſt down from thence. And thus at length he ſees, he can neither help himſelf by working, nor by believing: and having no more to hang by on the old ſtock, he therefore falls off. And while he is diſtreſſed thus, ſeeing himſelf like to be ſwept away with the flood of God's wrath; and yet unable ſo much as to ſtretch forth a hand to lay hold of a twig of the tree of life, growing on the banks of the river; he is <hi>taken up, and ingrafted into the true Vine,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt giving him the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of faith.</p>
                  <p>By what has been ſaid upon this head, I deſign not to rack or diſtreſs tender conſciences; for, tho' there are but few ſuch, at the day, yet, God forbid I ſhould offend any of Chriſt's little ones. But, alas! a dead ſleep is fallen upon this generation; they will not be awakened, let us go as near the quick as we will: and therefore, I fear there is another ſort of awakening abiding this ſermon-proof generation, which ſhall make the ears of them that hear it to tingle. However, I would not have this to be looked upon as the ſovereign God's ſtinted method of <hi>breaking off ſinners from the old ſtock:</hi> but this I aſſert as a certain truth, that all who are in Chriſt, have been broken off from all theſe ſeveral confidences; and that they who were never broken off from them, are yet in their natural ſtock. Nevertheleſs, if the houſe be pulled down, and the old foundation razed: it is all a caſe, whether it was taken down ſtone by ſtone, or whether it was undetermined, and all fell down together.</p>
                  <p>Now it is, that the branch is <hi>ingrafted</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt. And, as the <hi>law,</hi> in the hand of the Spirit of God, was the inſtrume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to cut off the branch from the natural ſtock, ſo the <hi>goſpel,</hi> in the hand of the ſame Spirit, is the inſtrument uſed for ingrafting it in the ſupernatural ſtock, 1 John i. 3.
<q>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare

we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
See Iſa. lxi. 1, 2, 3. The goſpel is the ſilver cord let down from heaven, to draw periſhing ſinners to land. And, tho' the preaching of the <hi>law</hi> prepares the way of the Lord; yet it is in the word of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> that Chriſt and a ſinner meet. Now, as in the natural grafting, the branch being <hi>taken up</hi> is <hi>put into</hi> the ſtock; and being put into it, <hi>takes with</hi> it; and ſo they are united: even ſo in the ſpiritual ingrafting, Chriſt <hi>apprehends the ſinner;</hi> and the ſinner being apprehended of Chriſt, <hi>apprehends him;</hi> and ſo they become one, Philip. iii. 12.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt <hi>apprehends</hi> the ſinner by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and draws him to himſelf, 1 Cor. xii 13. <hi>For by one Spirit, we are all baptized into one body.</hi> The ſame Spirit, which is in the Mediator himſelf, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to his elect in due time; never to depart from them, but to abide in them, as a principle of life. Thus, he takes hold of them, by his own Spirit <hi>put</hi> into them; and ſo the withered branch gets <hi>life.</hi> The ſoul is now in the hands of the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> and poſſeſſed by the <hi>Spirit of life:</hi> how then can it but <hi>live?</hi> The man gets a raviſhing light of Chriſt's excellency, in the glaſs of the goſpel: he ſees him a full, ſuitable, and willing Saviour; and gets a heart to take him for, and inſtead of <hi>all.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit of faith</hi> furniſheth him with feet to <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt, and hands to <hi>receive</hi> him. What by nature he could not do, by grace he can; the Holy Spirit working in him <hi>the work of faith with power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Sinner, thus apprehended, <hi>apprehends</hi> Chriſt by <hi>faith,</hi> and ſo <hi>takes with</hi> the bleſſed ſtock, Eph. iii. 17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> The ſoul that before tried many ways of eſcape, but all in vain, doth now <hi>look again,</hi> with the eye of faith, which proves the healing look. As <hi>Aaron's rod,</hi> laid up in <hi>the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, budded, and brought forth buds,</hi> Numb. xvii. 8. So the dead branch <hi>apprehended</hi> by the Lord of life, <hi>put</hi> into, and <hi>bound</hi> up with, the glorious <hi>quickning ſtock,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of life, buds forth in actual <hi>believing on</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, whereby this union is completed. <hi>We having the ſame ſpirit of faith—believe,</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 13. Thus the ſtock and the graft are united, Chriſt and the Chriſtian are <hi>married:</hi> faith being the ſoul's conſent to the ſpiritual marriage covenant, which, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the goſpel to mankind ſinners indefinitely, ſo it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, atteſted, and brought home, to the man in particular, by the Holy Spirit: and ſo be, being <hi>joined to the Lord, is one Spirit</hi> with him.

                  <p>USE From what is ſaid, we may draw theſe following <hi>inferences:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The preaching of the <hi>law</hi> is moſt neceſſary. He that would ingraft, muſt needs uſe the ſnedding knife. Sinners have many ſhifts to keep them from Chriſt; many things by which they keep their hold of the <hi>natural ſtock:</hi> therefore, they have need to be cloſely purſued, and hunted out of their ſculking holes, and refuge of lies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet it is the goſpel that crowns the work: <hi>the law makes nothing perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he law lays open the wound, but it is the goſpel that heals. The law <hi>ſtrips a man, wounds him, and leaves him half-dead:</hi> the goſpel <hi>binds up his wounds, pouring in wine and oil,</hi> to heal them. By the law we are broken off: but, it is by the goſpel we are taken up, and implanted in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. viii 9. We are told of a monſter in nature, having two bodies differently <hi>animated,</hi> as appeared from contrary affections at one and the ſame time; but ſo united, that they were ſerved with the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame legs Even ſo, however men may cleave to Chriſt, <hi>call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the holy city, and ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. xlvii 2. And they may be bound up as <hi>branches in him,</hi> John xv. 2. by the outward ties of ſacraments: yet, if the <hi>Spirit</hi> that dwells in Chriſt, dwell not in them they are not one with him. There is a great difference betwixt <hi>adheſion</hi> and ingrafting.

                  <p n="4">4. The union betwixt Chriſt and his myſtical members, is firm and indiſſoluble Were it ſo that the believer only apprehended Chriſt, but Chriſt apprehended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="186" facs="unknown:045042_0183_101F7EDF34A76A78"/>
ſo, whatever ſinful intermiſſions may happen in the exerciſe of faith, yet the <hi>union</hi> remains ſure, by reaſon of the conſtant <hi>indwelling</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Bleſſed Jeſus! <hi>All his ſaints are in thy hand,</hi> Deut. xxxiii. 3. It is obſerved by ſome, that the word <hi>Abba,</hi> is the ſame, whether you read it forward or backward! whatever the believer's caſe be, the Lord is ſtill to him <hi>Abba, Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They have an unſure hold of Chriſt, whom he has not apprehended by his <hi>Spirit.</hi> There are many half-marriages here, where the ſoul apprehends Chriſt, but is not apprehended of him. Hence many fall away, and never riſe again: they let go their hold of Chriſt; and when that is gone, all is gone. Theſe are <hi>the branches in Chriſt, that bear not fruit, which the huſband-man taketh away,</hi> John xv. 2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can that be? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe branches are ſet in the ſtock, by a profeſſion, or an unſound hypocritical faith; they are bound up with it, in the external uſe of the ſacraments: but the ſtock and they are never knit; therefore they cannot <hi>bear fruit.</hi> And they need not be <hi>cut off,</hi> nor <hi>broken off;</hi> they are by the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man only <hi>taken away,</hi> or, (as the word primarily ſignifies) <hi>lifted up;</hi> and ſo taken away, becauſe there is nothing to hold them: they are indeed bound up with the ſtock; but they have never united with it.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> When Chriſt apprehends a man by his Spirit, he is ſo <hi>drawn,</hi> that he comes away to Chriſt with his <hi>whole heart:</hi> for true believing is <hi>believing with all the heart,</hi> Acts viii. 37. Our Lord's followers are like theſe who followed <hi>Saul</hi> at firſt, <hi>men whoſe hearts God has touched,</hi> 1 Sam. x. 26.

                     </gap>he expreſſion is, he will <hi>ſpeak upon her heart.</hi> The ſinner is firſt <hi>driven,</hi> and then <hi>drawn</hi> to Chriſt. It is with the ſoul, as with <hi>Noah</hi>'s dove; ſhe was forced back again to the <hi>ark,</hi> becauſe ſhe could find nothing elſe to reſt upon: but when ſhe did return, ſhe would have reſted on the out ſide of it, if <hi>Noah</hi> had not <hi>put forth his hand, and pulled her in,</hi> Gen. viii. 9. The Lord ſends the avenger of blood in purſuit of the criminal; and he, with a ſad heart, leaves his own city; and, with tears in his eyes, parts with his old acquaintance, becauſe he dare not ſtay with them: and he frees for his life to the city of refuge. This is not at all his choice, it is forced work; <hi>neceſſity has no law.</hi> But, when he comes to the gates, and ſees the beauty of the place, the excellency and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of it charms him; and then he enters it with heart and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> ſaying, <hi>This is my reſt, and here I will ſtay</hi>; and, as one ſaid in another caſe, <hi>I had periſhed unleſs I had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> When Chriſt <hi>apprehends</hi> a ſoul, the heart is diſengaged from, and turned againſt, <hi>ſin.</hi> As in <hi>cutting off</hi> the branch from the old ſtock, the great idol <hi>ſelf</hi> is brought down, the man is powerfully taught to <hi>deny himſelf:</hi> ſo, in the <hi>apprehending</hi> of the ſinner by his Spirit, that union is diſſolved, which was betwixt the man and his luſts, while he was <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it. Rom. viii. 5. his heart is looſed from them, though formerly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Lord Jeſus comes to a ſoul, in the day of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace; he finds it like <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the day of her nativity, (Ezek. xvi. 4.) with its <hi>navel not cut,</hi> drawing its fulſome nouriſhment and ſatisfaction from its luſts: but, he cuts off thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſinner, out of Chriſt, is bound over to the wrath of God: he is under an obligation in law, to go to the priſon of hell, and there to ly till he has paid the utmoſt farthing. This ariſeth from the terrible ſanction with which the law is fenced, which is no leſs than <hi>death,</hi> Gen. ii. 17.

                  <p>Thus the perſon <hi>united</hi> to Chriſt, is juſtified. You may conceive of the whole proceeding herein, in this manner. The avenger of blood purſuing the criminal, Chriſt, as the Saviour of loſt ſinners, doth by the Spirit apprehend him, and <hi>draw</hi> him to himſelf; and he by <hi>Faith</hi> lays hold on Chriſt: ſo <hi>the Lord our righteousneſs,</hi> and the unrighteous creature <hi>unite.</hi> From this <hi>union</hi> with Chriſt, reſults a <hi>communion</hi> with him, in his <hi>unſearchable riches,</hi> and conſequently, in his righteouſneſs, that <hi>white raiment</hi> which he has for clothing of the <hi>naked,</hi> Rev. iii. 18.

"aſſurance of faith, having his heart ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, Heb. x. 21, 22. But then, what becomes of the body, the weak and weary fleſh? Why,

                  <p>A <hi>Third</hi> benefit flowing from union with Chriſt, is <hi>Adoption.</hi> Believers, being united to Chriſt, become children of God, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the family of heaven. By their union with him, who is the Son of God by nature, they become the ſons of God by grace, John i. 12. As when a branch is cut off from one tree, and grafted in the branch of another; the ingrafted branch, by means of its union with the adopting branch (as ſome not unfitly have called it) is made a branch of the ſame ſtock, with that into which it is ingrafted: ſo ſinners being ingrafted into Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe name is the <hi>Branch,</hi> his Father is their Father, his God their God, John xx. 17. And thus they, who are by nature children of the devil, become the children of God. They have the Spirit of adoption, Rom. viii. 15. namely, <hi>the Spirit of his Son,</hi> which bring them to God, as children to a father; to pour out their complaints in his boſom, and to ſeek neceſſary ſupply, Gal. iv. 6.
<q>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</q>

                  <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> benefit is <hi>Sanctification,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 30.
<q>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification.</q>
Being united to Chriſt, they partake of his Spirit, which is <hi>the Spirit of holineſs.</hi> There is a <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in Chriſt, and it is not like the fulneſs of a veſſel, which only retains what is poured into it; but it is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a fountain for diffuſion and communication, which is always ſending forth its water, and yet is always full. The Spirit of Chriſt, that ſpiritual ſap, which is in the ſtock, and from thence is communicate to the branches, is <hi>the Spirit of grace,</hi> Zec. xii. 10: And where the Spirit of grace dwells, there will be found a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all graces. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is not one grace only, but all the graces of the Spirit: it is a conſtellation of graces; it is all the graces in their ſeed and root. And as the ſap conveyed from the ſtock into the branch, goes thro' it, and thro' every part of it; ſo the Spirit of God ſanctifies the <hi>whole man.</hi> The poiſon of ſin was diffuſed through the <hi>whole ſpirit, ſoul and body of the man;</hi> and ſanctifying grace purſues it into every corner, 1 Theſſ. v. 23. Every <hi>part</hi> of the man is ſanctified, though no part is perfectly ſo. The truth we are ſanctified by, is not <hi>held</hi> in the head, as in a priſon: but runs, with its ſanctifying influences, through <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> There are indeed ſome graces in every believer, which appear as top-branches above the reſt: as meekneſs in <hi>Moſes,</hi> patience in <hi>Job:</hi> but ſeeing there is in every child of God, a holy principle going along with the holy law, in all the parts thereof, loving, liking, and approving of it; as appears from their <hi>univerſal</hi> reſpect to the commands of God: it is evident they are endued with <hi>all</hi> the graces of the Spirit; becauſe there can be no more in the effect, than there was in the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, this ſanctifying Spirit, whereof believers partake, is unto them, (1.) A Spirit of <hi>mortification.</hi>
                     <q>Through the Spirit they mortify the deeds of the body,</q>
Rom. viii. 13. Sin is <hi>crucified</hi> in them, Gal v. 24. They are <hi>planted together</hi> (namely, with <hi>Chriſt) in the likeneſs of his death,</hi> which was a <hi>lingering death,</hi> Rom. vi. 5. Sin in the ſaint, tho' not quite dead, yet is <hi>dying.</hi> If it were dead, it would be taken down from the croſs and buried out of his ſight: but, it hangs there as yet, working and ſtruggling under its mortal wounds. Look, as when a tree has got ſuch a ſtroke as re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="195" facs="unknown:045042_0192_101F7EF9AF9843E0"/>
but he is for <hi>Immanuel</hi>'s land; and is walking in the <hi>high-way</hi> to it, the way, which is called, <hi>The way of holineſs:</hi> though the wind from hell, that was on his back before, blows now full in his face, makes his travelling uneaſy, and often drives him off the high-way. (2.) This Spirit is a ſpirit of vivification to them; for he is <hi>the Spirit of life,</hi> and makes them live unto righteouſneſs, Ezek. xxxvi. 27.
<q>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</q>
Theſe that have been
<q>planted together, with Chriſt, in the likeneſs of his death, ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection,</q>
Rom. vi. 5. At Chriſt's reſurrection, when his ſoul was re-united with his body, every member of that bleſſed body was enabled again to perform the actions of life: ſo, the ſoul being influenced by the ſanctifying Spirit of Chriſt, is enabled more and more to perform all the actions of ſpiritual life. And as the whole of the law, and not ſome ſcraps of it only, is written on the holy heart; ſo believers are enabled to tranſcribe that law in their converſation. And, although they cannot write one line of it without blots; yet God, for Chriſt's ſake, accepts of the performances, in point of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: they being diſciples to his own Son, and led by his own Spirit.</p>
                  <p>This ſanctifying Spirit, communicated by the Lord Jeſus to his members, is the ſpiritual nouriſhment the branches have from the Stock into which they are ingrafted; whereby the life of grace, given them in regeneration, is preſerved, continued and actuated. It is the nouriſhment whereby the new creature liveth, and is <hi>nouriſhed</hi> up towards perfection. Spiritual life needs to be ſed, and muſt have ſupply of nouriſhment: and believers derive the ſame from Chriſt their head, whom the Father has conſtituted the head of influences to all his members, Col ii. 19.
<q>And not holding the head, from which all the body, by joints and hands having nouriſhment miniſtred, <hi>or</hi> ſupplied, &amp;c.</q>
Now, this ſupply is, "the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt," Phil i 19. The ſaints ſeed richly, eating Chriſt's fleſh, and drinking his blood, for their ſpiritual nouriſhment: yet our Lord himſelf teacheth us, that <q>it is the Spirit that quickneth,</q>
even <hi>that</hi> Spirit who dwells in that bleſſed body, John vi 63. The <hi>human nature</hi> is united to the <hi>divine nature</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the perſon of the Son, and ſo (like the <hi>bowl</hi> in <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s candleſtick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Zech. iv.) lies at the <hi>fountain-head,</hi> as the glorious means of conveyance of influences, from the fountain of the Deity; and receives not <hi>the Spirit by meaſure,</hi> but ever hath a fulneſs of the Spirit, by reaſon of that <hi>perſonal union.</hi> Hence, believer being united to the man Chriſt, (as the <hi>ſeven lamps</hi> to <hi>the bowl,</hi> by their <hi>ſeven pipes,</hi> Zech. iv. 2.) his <hi>fleſh</hi> is to them <hi>meat indeed,</hi> and his <hi>blood drink indeed:</hi> for, feeding on that bleſſed <hi>body</hi> (i.e. effectually app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And likeas, if there were a tree, having its root in the earth, and its branches reaching to heaven; the vaſt diſtance betwixt the root and the branches would not interrupt the communication betwixt the root and the top branch: even ſo, the <hi>diſtance</hi> betwixt the man Chriſt, who is in heaven, and his members, who are on earth, cannot hinder the communication betwixt them. What though the parts of myſtical Chriſt (<hi>viz.</hi> the head and the members) are not <hi>contigu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The union is not therefore the leſs <hi>real</hi> and <hi>effectual.</hi> Yea, our Lord himſelf ſhews us, that albeit we ſhould eat his fleſh, in a corporal and carnal manner, yet, it would <hi>profit nothing,</hi> John vi. 63. we would not be one whit holier thereby. But the members of Chriſt on earth, are united to their head in heaven, by the inviſible bond of the ſelf-ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> dwelling in both: in him as the head, and in them as the members, even, as <hi>the wheels,</hi> in <hi>Ezeckiel</hi>'s viſion, were not <hi>contiguous to the living creatures,</hi> yet were united to them, by an inviſible bond of one <hi>ſpirit</hi> in both; ſo that
<q>when the living creatures went, the wheels went by that,; and when the living creatures were lift up from the earth, the wheels were lift up, Ezek. i. 19.</q>
                     <hi>For,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>the ſpirit of the living creatures was in the wheels,</hi> ver. 20.</p>
                  <p>Hence, we may ſee the difference betwixt <hi>true Sanctification,</hi> and that <hi>ſhadow</hi> of it, which is to be found amongſt ſome ſtrict profeſſors of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Having nouriſhment miniſtred, <hi>they</hi> increaſe with the increaſe of God,</q>
Col ii 19.
<q>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the palm-tree, he ſhall grow like a Cedar in Lebanon,</q>
Pſal. xcii. 12. Grace is of a growing nature: in the way to <hi>Zion</hi> they go from ſtrength to ſtrength. Though the holy man be at firſt a <hi>little child</hi> in grace, yet at length he becomes a <hi>young man, a father,</hi> 1 John ii. 13. Though he does not but creep in the way to heaven ſometimes; yet afterwards he <hi>walks,</hi> he <hi>runs,</hi> he <hi>mounts up with wings as eagles,</hi> Iſa. xl. 31. If a branch grafted into a ſtock never grows, it is a plain evidence of its not having knit with the ſtock.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may perhaps ſay, "If all true Chriſtians be growing ones, what ſhall be ſaid of theſe, who inſtead of growing, are going back?" I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a great difference between the Chriſtian's <hi>growing</hi> ſimply, and his growing <hi>at all times.</hi> All true Chriſtians do grow, but I do not ſay, they grow at <hi>all times.</hi> A tree that has life and nouriſhment, <hi>grows</hi> to its perfection, yet it is not always growing; it grows not in the winter. Chriſtians alſo have their winters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the influences of grace, neceſſary for growth, are ceaſed, Cant. v. 2. <hi>I ſleep.</hi> It is by <hi>faith,</hi> the believer derives gracious influence from Jeſus Chriſt; likeas each lamp in the candleſtick received oil from the bowl, by the <hi>pipe</hi> going betwixt them, Zech iv. 2. Now, if that pipe be ſtopt, if the ſaints faithly dormant and unactive; then all the reſt of the graces will become dim, and ſeem ready to be extinguiſhed. In conſequence whereof, depraved nature will gather ſtrength, and become active. What then will become of the ſoul? Why, there is ſtill one ſure ground of hope. The ſaint's faith is not as the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite's, like a pipe laid ſhort of the fountain, whereby there can be no conveyance: it ſtill remains a bond of <hi>union</hi> betwixt Chriſt and the ſoul; and therefore, becauſe <hi>Chriſt lives,</hi> the believer <hi>ſhall live alſo,</hi> John xiv. 19. The Lord Jeſus <hi>puts in his hand by the hole of the door,</hi> and clears the means of conveyance: and their influences for growth flow and the believer's graces look freſh and green again, Hoſ. xiv. 7.

In the worſt of times, the ſaints have a <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>growth</hi> in them, 1 John iii. 9. <hi>His ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him.</hi> And therefore after decays they revive again: namely when the winter is over, and <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> returns to them with his warm influences. Mud thrown into a <hi>pool</hi> may ly there at eaſe; but if it be caſt into a fountain, the ſpring will at length work it out, and run clear as formerly. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſtians may <hi>miſtake</hi> their growth, and that two ways.

In like manner may the Chriſtian know, whether he be in a growing or declining ſtate, by comparing his preſent with his former condition (2) Chriſtians may miſtake their caſe, by meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their growth by the advances of the top only, not of the root. Though a man be not growing taller, he may be growing ſtronger. If a tree be taking with the ground, fixing itſelf in the earth, and ſpreading out its roots; it is certainly growing, although it be nothing taller than formerly. So, albeit a Chriſtian may want the ſweet conſolation and flaſhes of affection, which ſometimes he has had; yet if he be growing in humility, ſelf-denial, and ſenſe of needy depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on Jeſus Chriſt, he is a growing Chriſtian, Hoſ. xiv. 5.
<q>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael, he ſhall caſt forth his roots as Lebanon.</q>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 
                     <q>But do hypocrites grow at all? And if ſo, how ſhall we diſtinguiſh betwixt their growth, and true Chriſtian growth?</q>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the firſt part of the queſtion, hypocrites do grow. The <hi>tares</hi> have their growth, as well as the wheat: and the ſeed that fell among thorns did <hi>ſpring up,</hi> Luke viii. 7. only it did <hi>bring no fruit to perfection,</hi> ver. 14 Yea, a true Chriſtian may have a falſe growth. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſeemed to grow in the <hi>grace of holy zeal,</hi> when their ſpirits grew ſo hot in the cauſe of Chriſt, that they would have fired whole villages, for not receiving their Lord and Maſter, Luke ix. 54
<q>They ſaid, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, to conſume them, even as Elias did?</q>
But it was indeed no ſuch thing; and therefore he turned and rebuked them, ver. 55.
<q>and ſaid, Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of.</q>
To the ſecond part of the queſtion, it is anſwered, that there is a peculiar beauty in <hi>true Chriſtian growth,</hi> diſtinguiſhing it from all falſe growth: it is univerſal, regular, proportionable. It is a
<q>growing up to him in all things, which is the head,</q>
Eph. iv. 15. The growing
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:045042_0196_101F7F0336BE8AA8"/>
Chriſtian grows proportionably in all the parts of the new man. Under the kindly influences of "the Sun of righteouſneſs, believers "grow up as calves in the ſtall, Mal. iv. 2. Ye would think it a monſtruous growth, in theſe creatures, if ye ſaw their heads grow, and not their bodies, or if ye ſaw one leg grow, and another not: if all the parts do not grow proportionably Ay, but ſuch is the growth of many, in religion. They grow like rickety children, who have a big head, but a ſlender body: they get more knowledge into their heads, but no more holineſs into their hearts and lives: They grow very hot outwardly, but very cold inwardly; like men in a fit of the ague. They are more taken up about the <hi>externals</hi> of religion, than formerly; yet as great ſtrangers to the power of godlineſs as ever. If a garden is watered with the hand, ſome of the plants will readily get much ſome little, and ſome no water at all; and therefore ſome wither, while others are coming forward: but after a ſhower from the clouds, <hi>all</hi> come forward together. In like manner all the graces of the Spirit grow proportionably, by the ſpecial influences of divine grace. The branches ingrafted in Chriſt, growing aright, do grow in all the ſeveral ways of growth at once. They grow <hi>inward,</hi> growing <hi>into Chriſt,</hi> (Eph. iv. 15) uniting more cloſely with him; and cleaving more firmly to him, as the head of influences, which is the ſpring of all other true Chriſtian growth. They grow <hi>outward,</hi> in good works in their life and converſation. They not only, with <hi>Naphtali,</hi> give <hi>goodly words;</hi> but, like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they are <hi>fruitful bought.</hi> They grow <hi>upward</hi> in heavenly-mindedneſs, and contempt of the world; for their <hi>converſation is in heaven,</hi> Philip. iii 20. And finally, they grow <hi>downward</hi> in humility and ſelf-lothing. The branches of the largeſt growth in Chriſt, are in their own eyes, <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints,</hi> Eph. iii. 8. <hi>The chief of ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim i 15. <hi>More brutiſh than any man,</hi> Prov. xxx. 2. They ſee, they can do nothing, no not ſo much as <hi>to think any thing, as of themſelves,</hi> 2 Cor iii 5 that they deſerve nothing, being
<q>not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies ſhewed unto them,</q>
Gen. xxxii. 10. and that they <hi>are nothing,</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 2</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> benefit is <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi> The branch ingrafted into Chriſt, is not barren, but brings forth fruit. John xv. 5.
<q>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit.</q>
For that very end are ſouls <hi>married</hi> to Chriſt, that they may

Whoſoever are united to Chriſt, bring forth the fruits of <hi>goſpel-obedience</hi> and true <hi>holineſs. Faith</hi> is always followed with <hi>good works.</hi> The believer is not only come out of the grave of his natural ſtate; but he has <hi>put off</hi> his grave clothes, namely, reigning luſts,
<q>in the which <hi>he</hi> walked ſometime,</q>
like a ghoſt: being

he perſonates him (ſo to ſpeak) as a beggar, in borrowed robes, repreſents a king on the ſtage, "walking as he alſo walked" Now "the fruit of the Spirit in him is in all goodneſs." Eph v 9 The fruits of holineſs will be found in the hearts, lips, and lives of thoſe who are united to Chriſt. The hidden man of the heart, is not only a temple built for God, and conſecrated to him; but uſed and employed for him; where love, fear, truſt, and all the other parts of unſeen religion are exerciſed, Phil iii 3.
<q>For we are of the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit</q>
The heart is no more the devil's <hi>common,</hi> where <hi>thoughts</hi> go free; for there even <hi>vain thoughts</hi> are <hi>hated,</hi> Pſal cxix 123 But it is God's <hi>incloſure,</hi> hedged about as a <hi>garden</hi> from him, Cant. iv. 16. It is true, there are weeds of corruption there, becauſe the ground is not yet perfectly <hi>healed:</hi> but the <hi>man,</hi> in the day of his new creation, is ſet <hi>to dreſs it, and keep it.</hi> A live-coal from the altar has touched his <hi>lips,</hi> and they are purified, Pſal. xv 1, 2, 3.
<q>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy tabernacle? Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? He that ſpeaketh the truth in his heart He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor taketh up a reproach againſt his neighbour</q>
There may be indeed a ſmooth tongue where there is a falſe heart. The voice may be <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, while the hands are <hi>Eſau</hi>'s. But,
<q>If any man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain,</q>
James i. 26. The power of godlineſs will rule over the tongue, though <hi>a world of iniquity.</hi> If one be a <hi>Galilean,</hi> his ſpeech will <hi>bewray</hi> him, he'll not ſpeak the language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> but the language of <hi>Canaan.</hi> He will neither be dumb in religion; nor will his tongue walk at random, ſeeing to the double guard nature hath given the tongue, grace hath added a third: The fruits of holineſs will be found in his outward <hi>converſation,</hi> for he <hi>hath clean hands,</hi> as well as <hi>a pure heart,</hi> Pſal. xxiv. 4. He is a <hi>godly</hi> man, and religiouſly diſcharges the duties of the <hi>firſt</hi> table of the law: he is a <hi>righteous</hi> man, and honeſtly performs the duties of the ſecond table. In his converſation he is a good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a good <hi>neighbour</hi> too. He carries it towards God, as if men's eyes were upon him; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, as believing God's eye to be upon him.

                  <p>If you aſk me, <hi>How your nouriſhment, growth and fruitfulneſs may be forwarded?</hi> I offer theſe few advices (1.) Make ſure work, as to your knitting with the ſtock, by <hi>faith</hi> unfeigned; and beware of hypocriſy: a branch that is not found at the heart, will certainly wither. The trees of the Lord's planting are <hi>trees of righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. lxi. 3. So when others fade, they bring forth fruit. <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> is a diſeaſe in the <hi>vitals</hi> of religion, which will conſume all at length. It is a leak in the ſhip, that will certainly ſink it. <hi>Sincerity</hi> of grace will make it laſting, be it never ſo <hi>weak:</hi> as the ſmalleſt twig, that is found at the heart, will draw nouriſhment from the ſtock, and grow, while the greateſt bough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that is rotten, can never recover, becauſe it receives no nouriſhment. (2.) Labour to be ſtedfaſt in the truths and way of God. An unſettled and wavering judgment is a great enemy to Chriſtian growth and fruitfulneſs, as the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle teaches, Eph. iv. 14, 15.
<q>That we henceforth be no more children, toſſed to and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine. But ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up unto him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt.</q>
A rolling ſtone gathers no fog, and a wavering judgment makes a fruitleſs life. Though a tree be never ſo ſound, yet how can it grow, or be fruitful if ye be ſtill removing it out of one ſoil into another? (3.) Endeavour to cut off the ſuckers, as gardeners do that their trees may thrive. Theſe are unmortified luſts. Therefore
<q>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify your members that are upon the earth,</q>
Col. iii. 5. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> got <hi>meat to their luſts,</hi> they got <hi>leanneſs to their ſouls.</hi> She that has many hungry children about her hand, and muſt be ſtill putting into their mouths, will have much ado to get a bit put into her own. They muſt refuſe the <hi>craving</hi> of <hi>inordinate</hi> affections, who would have their ſouls to proſper. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Improve, for theſe ends, the ordinances of God. <hi>The courts of our God</hi> are the place, where the trees of righteouſneſs <hi>flouriſh,</hi> Pſalm xcii. 13.

And chap. xii. 13.
<q>We have been all made to drink into one ſpirit.</q>
Give yourſelves unto prayer; open your mouths wide, and he will fill them. By theſe means the branches in Chriſt may be further nouriſhed, grow up, and bring forth much fruit.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſeventh</hi> benfit is, The <hi>acceptance</hi> of their fruits of holineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. Though they be very imperfect they are <hi>accepted,</hi> becauſe they ſavour of Chriſt the bleſſed ſtock, which the branches grow upon; while the fruits of others are rejected of God, Gen. ii. 4, 5.
<q>And the Lord had reſpect unto Abel, and to his offering: But unto Cain and his offering he had not reſpect.</q>
Compare Heb. xi. 3.
<q>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice than Cain.</q>
O how <hi>defective</hi> are the ſaints <hi>duties</hi> in the eye of the law! The believer himſelf eſpies many faults in his beſt performances; yet the Lord graciouſly receives them There is no grace planted in the heart, but there is a weed of corruption hard by its ſide, while the ſaints are in this lower world. Their very <hi>ſincerity</hi> is not without mixture of <hi>diſſimulation</hi> or <hi>hypocriſy,</hi> Gal. ii. 13. Hence there are defects in the exerciſe of <hi>every</hi> grace; in the performance of <hi>every</hi> duty: depraved nature always drops ſomething to ſtain their beſt works. There is ſtill a mixture of darkneſs with their cleareſt light. Yet this does not mar their acceptance, Cant. vi. 10.
<q>Who is ſhe that looketh forth as the morning? <hi>or</hi> as the dawning?</q>
Behold how Chriſt's ſpouſe is eſteemed and accepted of her Lord, even when ſhe looks forth as the <hi>morning,</hi> whoſe beauty is mixed with the <hi>blackneſs</hi> of the night! <hi>When the morning was looking out,</hi> as the word is, Judges xix. 26. <hi>i. e. in the dawning of the day,</hi> as we read it. So the very dawning of grace, and good-will to Chriſt, grace peeping out from under a maſs of darkneſs in believers, is pleaſant and acceptable to him, as the break of day is to the weary traveller. Though the remains of unbelief make their hand of <hi>faith</hi> to ſhake and tremble; yet the Lord is ſo well pleaſed with it, that he employs it to carry away pardons and ſupplies of grace, from the throne of grace, and the fountain of grace. His faith was effectual, who
<q>cried out, and ſaid with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief,</q>
Mark ix. 24. Tho' the remains of ſenſual affections make the flame of their love weak and ſmoaky; he turns his eyes from the ſmoak, and beholds the flame, how fair it is, Cant. iv. 10.
<q>How fair is thy love, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe! The ſmell of their <hi>under</hi> garments <hi>of inherent holineſs, as imperfect as it is,</hi> is like the ſmell of Lebanon,</q>
ver. 11. and that becauſe they are covered with their elder brother's clothes, which make the ſons of God to "ſmell as a field which the Lord hath bleſſed." Their <hi>good works</hi> are accepted: their <hi>cups of cold water</hi> given to a diſciple, in the name of a diſciple, ſhall not want a reward. Tho' they cannot offer for the tabernacle, <hi>gold ſilver, and braſs, and onyx-ſtone,</hi> let
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:045042_0200_101F7F0CD5A5C368"/>
them come forward with what they have; if it were but <hi>goats hair,</hi> it ſhall not be rejected; if it were but <hi>rams ſkins,</hi> they ſhall be kindly accepted; for they are <hi>dyed red,</hi> dipt by faith in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator's blood, and ſo preſented unto God. A very ordinary work done <hi>in</hi> faith, and <hi>from</hi> faith, if it were but the building of a wall about the holy city, is <hi>a great work,</hi> Neh. vi. 3. If it were but the beſtowing of a <hi>box of ointment</hi> on Chriſt, it ſhall never be forgotten, Matth. xxvi. 13. Even
<q>a cup of cold water only given to one of Chriſt's little ones, in the name of a diſciple, ſhall be rewarded,</q>
Matth. x. 42. Nay, not a <hi>good word</hi> for Chriſt, ſhall drop from their mouths but it ſhall be regiſtred in God's <hi>book of remembrance,</hi> Mal. iii. 16. Nor ſhall a tear drop from their eyes for him, but he will <hi>put it in his bottle,</hi> Pſal. lvi. 8. Their <hi>will</hi> is accepted for the <hi>deed:</hi> their <hi>ſorrow</hi> for the want of will, for the <hi>will</hi> itſelf, 2 Cor. viii. 12.
<q>For if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</q>
Their <hi>groanings,</hi> when they cannot well word their deſires, are heard in heaven; the meaning of theſe groans is well known there, and they will be returned like <hi>the dove</hi> with an <hi>olive branch</hi> of peace in her mouth. See Rom. viii. 26, 27. Their mites are better than other mens talents. Their liſping and broken ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are more pleaſant to their Father in heaven, than the moſt fluent and flouriſhing ſpeeches of thoſe that are not in Chriſt. Their <hi>voice is ſweet,</hi> even when they are aſhamed it ſhould be heard; their <hi>countenance is comely</hi> even when they bluſh, and draw a vail over it, Cant. ii. 14. The Mediator takes their petitions, blots out ſome parts, rectifies others, and then preſents them to the Father, in conſequence whereof they paſs in the court of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Every true Chriſtian is a temple to God. If ye look for <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> they are not wanting there; they <hi>offer the ſacrifice of praiſe,</hi> and they "do good; with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed," Heb. xiii. 15, 16. Chriſt himſelf is the <hi>altar</hi> that ſanctifies the gift, ver. 10. But what comes of the ſkins and dung of their ſacrifices? They are carried away without the camp. If we look for incenſe, it is there too. The graces of the Spirit are found in their hearts: and the Spirit of a crucified Chriſt, fires them and puts them in exerciſe; likeas the fire was brought from the altar of burnt-offering, to ſet the incenſe on flame: then they mount heaven-ward, <hi>like pillars of ſmoke,</hi> Cant. iii. 6. But the beſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe will leave aſhes behind it: yes indeed; but as the prieſt took away the aſhes of the incenſe in a golden diſh, and threw them out; ſo our great High-prieſt takes away the aſhes and refuſe of all the ſaints ſervices, by his mediation in their behalf.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Eighth</hi> benefit flowing from union with Chriſt is <hi>Eſtabliſhment.</hi> The Chriſtian cannot fall away, but muſt <hi>perſevere</hi> unto the end, John x. 28.
<q>They ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</q>
Indeed if a branch do not knit with the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:045042_0201_101F7F0FCC6E4BF8"/>
ſtock, it will fall away when ſhaking winds ariſe: but the branch knit to the ſtock ſtands faſt, whatever winds blows. Sometimes a ſtormy wind of <hi>temptation</hi> blows from hell, and toſſeth the branches in Chriſt the <hi>true vine:</hi> but their union with him, is their ſecurity; <hi>moved</hi> they may be, but <hi>removed</hi> they never can be. The Lord "will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape," 1 Cor. x. 13. Calms are never of any continuance: there is almoſt always ſome wind blowing; and therefore branches are rarely altogether at reſt. But ſometimes violent winds ariſe, which threaten to rend them from off their ſtock. Even ſo it is with ſaints; they are daily put to it, to keep their ground againſt temptation: but ſometimes the wind from hell riſeth ſo high, and bloweth ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that it makes even top-branches to ſweep the ground; yet being knit to Chriſt their ſtock, they get up again, in ſpite of the moſt violent efforts of the <hi>prince of the power of the air,</hi> Pſal. xciv. 18. "When I ſaid my foot ſlippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up." But the Chriſtian improves by this trial; and is ſo far from being damaged, that he is benefited by it, in ſo far as it diſcovers what hold the ſoul has of Chriſt, and what hold Chriſt has of the ſoul. And lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k as the wind in the billows, which would blow out the candle, blows up the <hi>fire:</hi> even ſo it often comes to paſs that ſuch temptations do enliven the true Chriſtian, awakening the graces of the Spirit in him; and by that means, diſcover both the <hi>reality,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of grace in him. And hence, as <hi>Luther,</hi> that great man of God, ſaith,
<q>One Chriſtian who hath had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of temptation, is worth a thouſand others</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes a ſtormy wind of <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>perſecution</hi> from the men of the world, blows upon <hi>the vine, i. e</hi> myſtical Chriſt: but union with the ſtock is a ſufficient ſecurity to the branches. In a time of the church's peace and outward proſperity, while <hi>the ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Our God's houſe is <hi>a great houſe,</hi> wherein are not only
<q>veſſels of gold, but alſo of earth,</q>
2 Tim. ii. 20. Both theſe are apt to contract filthineſs; and therefore, when God brings trouble upon the church, he hath an eye to both. As for the veſſels of gold, they are not deſtroyed, but purged by a fiery trial in the furnace of affliction, as gold-ſmiths purge their gold, Iſa i. 25.
<q>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy droſs</q>
But <hi>deſtruction</hi> is to the veſſels of earth: they ſhall be <hi>broken in ſhivers,</hi> as a potter's veſſel, ver. 28.
<q>And the deſtruction (<hi>or</hi> breaking) of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and of the ſinners, ſhall be together.</q>
It ſeems to be an allution to that law, for <hi>breaking the veſſels of earth,</hi> when unclean; while veſſels of wood, and conſequently veſſels of gold were only to be rinſed, Lev. xv 12.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Ninth</hi> benefit is <hi>Support.</hi> If thou be a branch ingrafted in Chriſt, <hi>the root beareth thee.</hi> The believer <hi>leans</hi> on Chriſt; as a weak woman in a journey, leaning upon her beloved huſband, Cant. viii. 5. He
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:045042_0203_101F7F1631A8A968"/>
                     <hi>ſtays</hi> himſelf upon him, as a feeble old man ſtays himſelf on his ſtaff, Iſa. l. 10. He <hi>rolls</hi> himſelf on him, as one rolls a burden he is not able to walk under, off his own back, upon another who is able to bear it, Pſal. xxii 8. <hi>Marg.</hi> There are many weights to hang upon, and preſs down the branches in Chriſt the true Vine. But ye know, whatever weights hang on branches, the ſtock bears all; it bears the branch and the weight that is upon it too.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> Chriſt ſupports believers in him, under a <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>outward troubles.</hi> That is a large prrmiſe, Iſa. xliii. 2.
<q>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee: and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee.</q>
See how <hi>David</hi> was ſupported under a heavy load, 1 Sam. xxx. 6. His city <hi>Ziklag</hi> was burnt, his wives were taken captives, his men ſpoke of ſtoning him; nothing was left him but his God and his faith; but by his faith he encouraged himſelf in his God. The Lord comes and lays his croſs on his people's ſhoulders; it preſſeth them down; they are like to ſink under it, and therefore cry, "Maſter, ſave us, we periſh:" but he <hi>ſupports</hi> them under their burden; he bears <hi>them</hi> up, and they bear their <hi>croſs.</hi> Thus the Chriſtian having a weight of outward troubles upon him, goes lightly under his burden, having withal the
<q>everlaſting arms underneath him.</q>
The Chriſtian has a ſpring of comfort, which he cannot loſe; and therefore never wants ſomething to ſupport him. If one have all his riches in money, robbers may take theſe away; and then <hi>what has he more?</hi> But though the landed man be robbed of his <hi>money,</hi> yet his lands remain for his ſupport. They that build their comfort on worldly goods, may quickly be comfortleſs: but they that are united to Chriſt, ſhall find comfort when all the ſtreams of worldly enjoyments are dried up, Job vi. 13.
<q>Is not my help in me? And is wiſdom driven quite from me?</q>
                     <hi>q. d.</hi> Though my ſubſtance is gone; though my ſervants, my children, my health, and ſoundneſs of body, are all gone; yet my grace is not gone too. Tho' the <hi>Sabeans</hi> have driven away my oxen and aſſes, and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> have driven away camels; they have not driven away my faith and my hope too: theſe are yet in me, they are not driven from me; ſo that by them I can fetch comfort from heaven, when I can have none from earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Chriſt ſupports his people under a <hi>weight</hi> of inward troubles and diſcouragements. Many times "heart and fleſh fail them," but then, "God is the ſtrength of their heart," Pſal. lxxiii. 26. They may have <hi>a weight of guilt</hi> preſſing them. This is a load that will make their back to ſtoop, and the ſpirits to ſink: but he takes it off, and puts a pardon in their hand, while they caſt their burden over upon him. Chriſt takes the ſoul, as one marries a widow, under a burden of debt: and ſo when the creditors come to Chriſt's ſpouſe, ſhe carries them to her huſband, confeſſeth the debt, declares ſhe is not able to pay, and lays all over upon him. The Chriſtian ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, through careleſſneſs, loſeth his diſcharge; he cannot find it,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:045042_0204_101F7F1920F56C78"/>
however he ſearch for it. The law takes that opportunity; and bends up a proceſs againſt him for a debt paid already. God hides his face, and the ſoul is diſtreſſed. Many arrows go through the heart now; many long accounts are laid before the man, which he reads and acknowledges. Often does he ſee the officers coming to apprehend him, and the priſon door open to receive him. What elſe keeps him from ſinking utterly under diſcouragements in this caſe, but that the everlaſting arms of a Mediator are underneath him, and that he relies upon the great Cautioner? Further, they may have a weight of ſtrong luſts preſſing them. They have a body of death upon them. Death is a weight that preſſeth the ſoul out of the body. A leg or an arm of death (if I may ſo ſpeak) would be a terrible load. (One lively luſt will ſometimes ly ſo heavy on a child of God, that he can no more remove it, than a child could throw a giant from off him.) How then are they ſupported under a whole body of death? Why, their ſupport is from the root that bears them, from the everlaſting arm that is underneath them. His grace is ſufficient for them, 2 Cor. xiii. 9. The great ſtay of the believer is not the grace of God <hi>within him,</hi> that is a well, whoſe ſtreams ſometimes run dry: but it is the grace of God <hi>without him,</hi> the grace that is in Jeſus Chriſt; which is an ever-flowing fountain, to which the believer can never come amiſs. For the Apoſtle tells us in the ſame verſe, it is the power of Chriſt. "Moſt gladly therefore," ſaith he,
<q>will I rather glory in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me, or taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle above me,</q>
as the cloud of glory did on the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which God ſpread for a covering, or ſhelter to them in the wilderneſs, Pſal. cv. 39. compare Iſa. iv. 5, 6. So that the believer in this combat, like the eagle, firſt flies aloft (by faith) and then comes down on the prey, Pſal. xxxiv. 5.
<q>They looked to him, and were lightened.</q>
And finally, they have <q>a weight of weakneſs and wants upon them,</q>
but they
<q>caſt over that burden on the Lord their ſtrength, and he ſuſtains them,</q>
Pſal. lv. 22. With all their wants and weakneſſes, they are caſt upon him; as the poor, weak and naked babe, coming out of the womb, is caſt into the lap of one appointed to take care of it, Pſal. xxii. 10. Though they be deſtitute (as a ſhrub in the wilderneſs, which the foot of every beaſt may tread down) the Lord will regard them, Pſal. cii. 17. It is no marvel, the weakeſt plant may be ſafe in a garden: but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a hedge for protection to his weak and deſtitute ones, even in a wilderneſs.</p>

                     <q>But if the ſaints be ſupported, how is it that they fall ſo often under temptation and diſcouragements?</q>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> (1.) How long ſoever they fall at any time, they never <hi>fall off;</hi> and that is a great matter. They "are kept by the power of of God through faith unto ſalvation," 1 Pet. i. 5. Hypocrites may ſo fall, ſo as to fall off, and fall into the pit, as a bucket falls into a well when the chain breaks. But though the child of God may fall, and that ſo

low, as <hi>the water goes over his head;</hi> yet there is ſtill a bond of union betwixt Chriſt and him: the cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</q>
(2.) The falls of the ſaints flow from their not improving their union with Chriſt, their not making uſe of him by faith, for ſtaying or bearing them up, Pſal. xxvi. 13. "I had fainted, unleſs I had believed." While the nurſe holds the child in her arms, it cannot fall to the ground: yet if the unwary child hold not by her, it may fall backwards in her arms to its great hurt. Thus <hi>David</hi>'s fall broke his <hi>bones</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 8. but it did not break the bond of union betwixt Chriſt and him: The <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the bond of that union, was <hi>not taken</hi> from him, ver. 11.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Laſt</hi> benefit I ſhall name, is, <hi>The ſpecial care of the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> John xv. 1, 2.
<q>I am the true vine, and my Father is the huſbandman.—Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</q>
Believers, by virtue of their union with Chriſt, are the object of God's ſpecial care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Myſtical Chriſt is God's <hi>vine,</hi> other ſocieties in the world are but <hi>wild olive trees.</hi> The men of the world are but God's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; the ſaints are his <hi>vineyard,</hi> which he has a ſpecial propriety in, and a ſpecial concern for, Cant. viii. 12.
<q>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me.</q>
He that ſlumbers not, nor ſleeps, is the keeper of it, he
<q>does keep it leſt any hurt it, he will keep it night and day:</q>
he in whoſe hand is the dew of heaven,
<q>will water it every moment,</q>
Iſa. xxvii. 3. He dreſſeth and <hi>purgeth it,</hi> in order to further fruitfulneſs, John xv. 2. He cuts off the luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant twigs that mar the fruitfulneſs of the branch. This is done, eſpcially by the <hi>word,</hi> and by the <hi>croſs</hi> of afflictions. The ſaints need the miniſtry of the word, as much as the vineyard needeth one to dreſs and prune the vines, 1 Cor. iii. 9.
<q>We are labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers togethers with God: ye are God's huſbandry, ye are God's building.</q>
And they <hi>need</hi> the croſs too, 1 Pet. i. 6.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, if we ſhould reckon the <hi>croſs</hi> amongſt the <hi>benefits</hi> flowing to believers from their union with Chriſt. I judge, we ſhould not reckon it amiſs. Sure I am. in their ſufferings they <hi>ſuffer with him,</hi> Rom. viii. 17. And the aſſurances they have of the croſs, have rather the nature of a <hi>promiſe,</hi> as of a <hi>threatning,</hi> Pſal. lxxxix. 30.31.32.33.
<q>If his children forſake my law,—then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes. Nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly take from him: nor ſuffer thy faithfulneſs to fail.</q>
This looks like a tutor's engaging to a dying father, to take care of the children left upon him; and to give them both nurture and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, for their good. The covenant of grace does truly beat <hi>the ſpears</hi> of affliction into <hi>pruning hooks,</hi> to them that are in Chriſt,

1 Sam. xxv. 32. Worldly things are often ſuch a load to the Chriſtian, that he moves but very ſlowly heaven-ward God ſends a wind of trouble, that blows the burden off the man's back: and then he walks more ſpeedily on his way; after God hath drawn ſome gilded earth from him, that was drawing his heart away from God Zeph. iii. 12.

It was an obſerve of an heathen moraliſt,
<q>That no hiſtory makes mention of any man, who hath been made better by riches.</q>
I doubt if our modern hiſtories can ſupply the defect of ancient hiſtories in this point. But ſure I am many have been the worſe of riches: thouſands have been hugged to death, in the embraces of a ſmiling world; and many good men have got wounds from outward proſperity, that behoved to be cured by the croſs. I remember to have read of one, who having an impoſthume in his breaſt, had in vain uſed the help of phyſicians: but being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſword, the impoſthume broke; and his life was ſaved by that accident, which threatned immediate death. Often have ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual impoſthumes gathered in the breaſts of God's people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the time of outward proſperity, and been thus broken and diſcuſſed by the croſs.

               <p>I Come now to diſcourſe of man's eternal <hi>ſtate,</hi> into which he enters by <hi>death.</hi> Of this entrance, <hi>Job</hi> takes a ſolemn ſerious view, in the words of the text; which contain a general truth, and a particular application of it. The general truth is ſuppoſed; namely, that all men muſt, by <hi>death,</hi> remove out of this world: they muſt die. But, whither muſt they go? They muſt go <hi>to the houſe appointed for all living:</hi> to the grave, that darkſome, gloomy, ſolitary houſe, in the land of forgetfulneſs. Whereſoever the body is laid up, till the reſurrection; thither, as to a <hi>dwelling-houſe,</hi> death brings us home. While we are in the body, we are but in a <hi>lodging-houſe:</hi> in an inn, on our way home-ward. When we come to our grave, we come to our <hi>home,</hi> our <hi>long-home,</hi> Eccleſ. xii. 5. <hi>All living</hi> muſt be inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this houſe, good and bad, old and young. Man's life is a ſtream, running into death's devouring deeps. They, who now live in palaces, muſt quit them, and go home to this <hi>houſe;</hi> and they, who have not where to lay their heads, ſhall thus have a <hi>houſe</hi> at length. It is <hi>appointed for all</hi> by him, whoſe counſel ſhall ſtand This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment cannot be ſhifted; it is a law, which mortals cannot tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. <hi>Job</hi>'s application of this general truth to himſelf, is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>I know that thou wilt bring me to death,</hi> &amp;c He knew, that he behoved to meet with death; that his ſoul and body behoved to part; that, God, who had ſet the tryſt, would certainly ſee it kept. Sometimes <hi>Job</hi> was inviting death to come to him, and carry him home to his houſe; yea, he was in hazard of <hi>running</hi> to it

before the time, Job vii. 15.
<q>My ſoul chooſeth ſtrangling and death, rather than my life.</q>
But here he conſiders God would <hi>bring</hi> him to it; yea. <hi>bring</hi> him <hi>back</hi> to it as the word imports. Whereby he ſeems to intimate, that we have no life in this world, but as runaways from death, which ſtretcheth out its cold arms, to receive us from the womb; but though we do then narrowly eſcape its clutches, we cannot eſcape long; we will be <hi>brought back again</hi> to it. <hi>Job</hi> knew this, he had laid his account with it, and was looking for it.</p>

ſuſpect afflicted <hi>Job</hi> of partiality in this matter, hear the wiſe and proſperous <hi>Solomon's</hi> character of the days of his life, Eccleſ viii. 15. <hi>All things have I ſeen in the days of my vanity,</hi> i. e. <hi>my vain days. Moſes,</hi> who was a very active man compares our days to <hi>a ſleep,</hi> Pſal. xc. 5 <hi>They are as a ſleep,</hi> which is not noticed, till it be ended. The reſemblance is pat: few men have right apprehenſions of life, until death awaken them; then we begin to know we <hi>were</hi> living. <hi>We ſpend our years as a tale that is told,</hi> ver. 9 When an idle tale is a-telling, it may affect a little; but when it is ended, it is forgot: and ſo is man forgotten, when the fable of his life is ended. It is as <hi>a dream,</hi> or <hi>viſion of the night,</hi> in which there is nothing ſolid: when one awakes, all evaniſheth, Job xx. 8.
<q>He ſhall fly away as a dream, and ſhall not be found; yea he ſhall be chaſed away as a viſion of the night.</q>
It is but a vain ſhow or <hi>image,</hi> Pſal. xxxix. 6 "Surely every man walketh in a vain ſhow," Man in this world, is but, as it were, <hi>a walking ſtatue:</hi> his life is but <hi>an image of life;</hi> there is ſo much of death in it.</p>
                  <p>If we look on our life, in the ſeveral periods of it, we will find it a heap of vanities. <hi>Childhood and youth are vanity,</hi> Eccleſ xi. 10. We come into the world, the moſt helpleſs of all animals: young birds and beaſts can do ſomething for themſelves, but infant man is altogether unable to help himſelf. Our <hi>childhood</hi> is ſpent in piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trifling pleaſures, which become the ſcorn of our own after-thoughts <hi>Youth</hi> is a flower that ſoon withereth; a bloſſom that quickly falls off; it is a ſpace of time in which we are raſh, fooliſh, and inconſiderate, pleaſing ourſelves with a variety of vanities, and ſwimming, as it were, through a flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d of them. But ere we are aware, <hi>it</hi> is <hi>paſt,</hi> and we are in <hi>middle age,</hi> encompaſſed with a thick cloud of cares, through which we muſt grope; and finding ourſelves beſet with pricking thorns of difficulties; through them we muſt force our way, to accompliſh the projects and contrivances of our riper thoughts. And the more we ſolace ourſelves in any earthly enjoyment we attain to, the more bitterneſs do we find in parting with it. Then comes <hi>old age,</hi> attended with its own train of infirmities, <hi>labour and ſorrow,</hi> Pſal xc 10 and ſets us down next door to the grave. In a word, <hi>All fleſh is graſs,</hi> Iſa. xl 6. Every ſtage, or period in life, is <hi>vanity. Man at his beſt ſtate</hi> (middle age, when the heat of youth is ſpent, and the ſorrow old age have not yet overtaken him) <hi>is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſal. xxxix 5 Death carries off ſome in the <hi>bud</hi> of childhood, others in the <hi>bloſſom</hi> of youth, and others when they are come to their <hi>fruit:</hi> few are left ſtanding, till, like <hi>ripe corn,</hi> they forſake the ground: all <hi>die</hi> one time or other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man's life is a ſhort thing: it is not only <hi>a vanity</hi> but <hi>a ſhort-lived vanity.</hi> Conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> How the life of man is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the ſcripture. It was indeed ſometimes reckoned by <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years:</hi> but no man ever arrived at a thouſand, which yet
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:045042_0215_101F44523266C178"/>
bears no proportion to eternity. Now, <hi>hundreds</hi> are brought down to <hi>ſcores, threeſcore and ten,</hi> or <hi>fourſcore</hi> is its utmoſt length, Pſal. xc 10. But few men arrive at that length of life. Death does but rarely wait, till men be bowing down, by reaſon of age, to meet the grave. Yet, as if <hi>years</hi> were too big a word, for ſuch a ſmall thing as the life of man on earth; we find it counted by months, Job xiv 5 "The number of his months are with thee." Our courſe, like that of the moon, is run in a little time; we are always waxing or waneing, till we diſappear. But frequently it is reckoned by days; and theſe but few, Job xiv 1.
<q>Man that is born of a woman is of few days.</q>
Nay, it is but <hi>one day</hi> in ſcripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and that <hi>a hireling's day,</hi> who will preciſely obſerve when his day ends, and give over his work, ver. 6.
<q>Till he ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh as an hireling his day.</q>
Yea, the ſcripture brings it down to the ſhorteſt ſpace of time, and calls it <hi>a moment,</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 17. <hi>Our light afflion</hi> (though it laſt all our life long) <hi>is but for a moment.</hi> But elſewhere it is brought down to yet a lower pitch, farther than which one cannot carry it, Pſal xxxix. 5. <hi>Mine age is nothing before thee.</hi> Agreeable to this, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, Eccleſ. iii. 2. There is <hi>a time to be born, and a time to die</hi>; but makes no mention of <hi>a time to live,</hi> as if our life were but <hi>a ſkip from the womb to the grave. Secondly,</hi> Conſider the various ſimilitudes by which the ſcripture repreſents <hi>the ſhortneſs</hi> of man's life. Hear <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. xxxviii. 12. "Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a ſhepherd's tent; I have cut off, like a weaver, my life." The ſhepherd's tent is ſoon <hi>removed;</hi> for the flocks muſt not feed long in one place: ſuch is a man's life on earth, quickly gone. It is a <hi>web,</hi> he is inceſſantly working; he is not idle ſo much as one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a ſhort time it is <hi>wrought,</hi> and then it is <hi>cut off.</hi> Every breathing is a thread in this <hi>web,</hi> when the laſt breath is drawn, the web is woven out, he expires and then it is <hi>cut off,</hi> he breathes no more. Man is like <hi>graſs</hi> and like a <hi>flower,</hi> Iſa. xl. 6
<q>All fleſh (even the ſtrongeſt and moſt healthy fleſh) is graſs, and all the godlineſs thereof is as the flower of the field.</q>
The graſs is flouriſhing in the morning; but, in the evening, being cut down by the mowers, it is withered: ſo man ſometimes is walking up and down at eaſe in the morning; and in the evening, is lying a corpſe, being knocked down by a ſudden ſtroke, with one or other of death's weapons. <hi>The flower,</hi> at beſt, is but a weak and tender thing, of ſhort continuance, where-ever it growes: but (obſerve) man is not compared to the flower of <hi>the garden;</hi> but to the flower of <hi>the field,</hi> which the foot of every beaſt may tread down at any time. Thus is our life liable to a thouſand accidents, every day; any of which may cut us off. But though we ſhould eſcape all theſe, yet at length this <hi>graſs</hi> withereth, this <hi>flower</hi> fadeth of itſelf. It is carried off, "as the clouds is conſumed and vaniſheth away." Job vii. 9 It looks big as the morning cloud, which promiſeth
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:045042_0216_101F7F3352036788"/>
great things, and raiſeth the expectations of the huſbandman; but the ſun riſeth, and the cloud is ſcattered; death comes, and man evaniſheth. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> propoſeth the queſtion,
<q>What is your life?</q>
chap. iv. 14. Hear his own anſwer,
<q>It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</q>
It is frail, uncertain, and laſteth not. It is <hi>ſmoak,</hi> which goes out of the chimney, as if it would darken the face of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; but quickly is ſcattered, and appears no more: thus goeth man's life, and <hi>where is he?</hi> It is a <hi>wind,</hi> Job vii. 7.
<q>O remember that my life is wind·</q>
It is but a paſſing blaſt, a ſhort puff,
<q>a wind that paſſeth away and cometh not again,</q>
Pſal lxxviii. 39. Our breath is <hi>in our noſtrils,</hi> as it were always upon the wind to depart; ever paſſing and repaſſing like a traveller; until it go away for good and all, not to return, till the heavens be no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Man's life is a <hi>ſwift</hi> thing; not only a paſſing, but a <hi>flying</hi> vanity. Have you not obſerved how ſwiftly <hi>a ſhadow</hi> hath run along the ground, in a cloudy and windy day, ſuddenly darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the places beautified before with the beams of the ſun, but as ſuddenly diſappearing? Such is the life of man on the earth, for "he fleeth as a ſhadow, and continueth not," Job xiv 2. A wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's <hi>ſhuttle</hi> is very ſwift in its motion; in a moment it is thrown from one ſide of the web to the other: yet
<q>our days are ſwifter than a weaver's ſhuttle,</q>
chap. vii 6 How quickly is man toſſed through time into eternity! See how <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes the <hi>ſwiftneſs</hi> of the time of life, chap. ix 25.
<q>Now my days are ſwifter than a poſt: they flee away, they ſee no good.</q>
ver 26
<q>They are haſted away as the ſwift ſhips; as the eagle that haſteth to the prey.</q>
He compares his days with <hi>a poſt,</hi> a foot poſt; <hi>a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> who runs ſpeedily to carry tidings, and will make no ſtay. But, though the poſt were like <hi>Ah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n fleeing for his life, before the purſuing enemy; he runs with his utmoſt vigour, yet our days run as faſt as he. Howbeit, that is not all. Even he who is <hi>fleeing</hi> for his life, cannot run always; he muſt needs ſometimes ſtand ſtill, ly down, or run in ſomewhere, as <hi>Siſera</hi> did into <hi>Jael's</hi> tent, to refreſh himſelf; but our time never halts. Therefore it is compared to <hi>ſhips,</hi> which can ſail night and day without intermiſſion, till they be at their port; and <hi>ſwift ſhips, ſhips of deſire,</hi> in which men quickly arrive at the deſired haven; or, <hi>ſhips of pleaſure,</hi> that ſail more ſwiftly than ſhips of burden. Yet the wind failing, the ſhips courſe is marred: but our time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways runs with a rapid courſe. Therefore it is compared to <hi>the eagle</hi> flying: not with his ordinary flight, for that is not ſufficient to repreſent the ſwiftneſs of our days; but when he flies upon his <hi>prey,</hi> which is with an extraordinary ſwiftneſs. And thus, even thus, our days fly away.</p>

The ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> of our time, and the <hi>certainty of death,</hi> will teach us, that all the advantage we can make by our apoſtacy, in time of trial, is not worth the while; it is not worth going out of the way to get it; and what we refuſe to forego for Chriſt's ſake, may quickly be
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:045042_0222_101F7F52F468C368"/>
taken from us by death. But, we can never loſe it ſo honourably, as for the cauſe of Chriſt and his goſpel: for, <hi>what glory is it</hi> that ye give up what ye have in the world, when God takes it away from you by death, whether you will or not? This conſideration may teach us to undervalue life itſelf, and chuſe to forego it, rather than to ſin. The worſt that men can do, is to take away that life which we cannot long keep, tho' all the world ſhould conſpire to help us to <hi>retain the Spirit.</hi> And if we refuſe to offer it up to God, when he calls for it in defence of his honour, he can take it from us another away; as it fared with him, who could not burn for Chriſt, but was afterwards burnt by an accidental fire in his houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It may ſerve for <hi>a ſpur,</hi> to incite us to prepare for death. Conſider, (1.) Your eternal ſtate will be according to the ſtate in which you die: death will open the doors of heaven, or hell to you. As the tree falls. ſo it ſhall ly thro' eternity. If the infant be dead-born, the whole world will not raiſe it to life again: and if one die out of Chriſt, in an unregenerate ſtate, there is no more hope of him for ever. (2.) Seriouſly conſider, what it is to go into another world; a world of ſpirits, wherewith we are not acquainted. How frightful is converſe with ſpirits to poor mortals in this life! and, how dreadful is the caſe, when men are hurried away into another world, not knowing but devils may be their companions for ever! let us then give all diligence to make, and advance, our acquaintance with the Lord of that world. (3.) It is but a ſhort time ye have to prepare for death, therefore, now or never; ſeeing the time aſſigned for preparation will ſoon be over, Eccleſ. ix. 10.
<q>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave, whither thou goeſt.</q>
How can we be idle, having ſo great a work to do, and ſo little time to do it in? But if the time be ſhort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the work of preparation for death, though hard work, will not laſt long. The ſhadows of the evening make the labourer work chearfully; knowing the time to be at hand, when he ſhall be called in from his labour. (4.) Much of our ſhort time is over already; and the youngeſt of us all cannot aſſure himſelf, that there is as much of his time to come, as is paſt. Our life in the world is but a ſhort preface to long eternity; and much of <hi>the tale</hi> is told. Oh! ſhall we not double our diligence, when ſo much of our time is ſpent, and ſo little of our great work is done? (5.) The <hi>preſent</hi> time is flying away <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have nothing we can call ours, but the preſent moment; and that is flying away: how ſoon our time may be at an end we know not. Die we muſt, but who can tell us, when? If death kept one ſet time for all, we were in no hazard of a ſurpriſe: but daily obſervation ſhews us, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The rivers run ſpeedily into the ſea from whence they came; but not ſo ſpeedily as man to the duſt from whence he came. The ſtream of time is the ſwifteſt current, and quickly runs out to eternity — <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If once death carry us off, there is no coming back again to mend our matters, Job xiv. 14. "If a man die, ſhall he live again?" Dying is a thing we cannot get a trial of; it is what we can do only once, Heb. ix. 27. "It is appointed unto men ONCE to die." And that which can be but <hi>once</hi> done, and yet is of ſo much importance, that our <hi>all</hi> depends on having it done <hi>right;</hi> we have need to uſe the utmoſt diligence, that we may do it well.

He is forcibly thruſt out of his place in this world; <hi>driven away</hi> as chaff before the wind. (2) The <hi>ſtate</hi> he paſſeth away in. He dies in a ſinful and hopeleſs ſtate. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In a <hi>ſinful</hi> ſtate; he is driven away <hi>in his wickedneſs.</hi> He lived in it, and he dies in it: his filthy garments of ſin, in which he wrapt up himſelf in his life, are his priſon-garments, in which he
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:045042_0224_101F7F564D489AB0"/>
ſhall ly wrapt up for ever. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In a hopeleſs ſtate; <hi>but the righteous hath hope in his death:</hi> which plainly imports the <hi>hopeleſneſs</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> in their death. Whereby is not meant, that no wicked man ſhall have any hope at all, when he is a-dying; but ſhall die in deſpair. No: ſometimes it is ſo indeed; but frequently it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: fooliſh virgins may, and often do hope to the laſt breath. But the wicked man has no <hi>ſolid</hi> hope: and as for the <hi>deluſive</hi> hopes he entertains himſelf with, death will root them up, and he ſhall be for ever irretrievably miſerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the death of a <hi>righteous</hi> man; he <hi>hath hope</hi> in his death. This is uſhered in with a <hi>but,</hi> importing a removal of theſe dreadful circumſtances, with which the wicked man is attended, who is driven away in his wickedneſs: but the godly <hi>are not ſo.</hi> Not ſo, (1.) In the <hi>manner</hi> of their paſſing out of the world. The righteous is not <hi>driven away</hi> as chaff before the wind; but led away as a bride to the marriage-chamber, carried <hi>away</hi> by the angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom, Luke xvi. 22. (2.) Not ſo as to their <hi>ſtate,</hi> when paſſing out of this life. The righteous man dies, (1.) Not in a <hi>ſinful,</hi> but in a holy ſtate. He goes not away <hi>in</hi> his ſin, but <hi>out</hi> of it. In his life he was <hi>putting off the old man,</hi> changing his priſon-garments: and now the remaining rags of them are removed, and he is adorned with robes of glory. (2.) Not in a <hi>hopeleſs,</hi> but a <hi>hopeful</hi> ſtate. He <hi>hath hope in his death:</hi> he has the grace of hope, and the well-ſounded expectation of better things, than ever he had in this world: and tho' the ſtream of his hope at death may run ſhallow; yet he has ſtill as much of it, as makes him <hi>venture</hi> his eternal intereſts upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

(3) In what reſpects they may be ſaid, to be driven away <hi>in their wickedneſs.</hi> But, before I proceed let me advertiſe you; that you are miſtaken if you think, that no perſons are to called <hi>wicked,</hi> but they who are avowedly vitious and prophane; as if the devil could dwell in none but thoſe whoſe name is <hi>legion.</hi> In ſcripture account, all who are not <hi>righteous,</hi> in the manner hereafter explained, are reckoned <hi>wicked</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the text divides the whole world into two ſorts, <hi>the righteous,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:045042_0225_101F7F59D18BA748"/>
and the wicked</hi>; and ye will ſee the ſame thing in that other text, Mal. iii. 18.
<q>Then ſhall ye return, and diſcern between the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the wicked</q>
Wherefore, if ye be not <hi>righteous,</hi> ye are <hi>wicked.</hi> If ye have not an <hi>imputed</hi> righteouſneſs, and an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted</hi> righteouſneſs, or <hi>holineſs;</hi> if ye be yet in your <hi>natural ſtate</hi> unregenerated, not united to Chriſt by faith: howſoever <hi>moral,</hi> and <hi>blameleſs</hi> in the eyes of men, your converſation may be; ye are the wicked, who ſhall be driven away in their <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> if death find you in that ſtate. Now,</p>
                  <p>FIRST, As to the meaning of this phraſe <hi>driven away;</hi> there are three things in it: the wicked ſhall be taken away <hi>ſuddenly, violently,</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Unrenewed men ſhall be taken away <hi>ſuddenly</hi> at death. Not that all wicked men die ſuddenly; nor that they are all wicked who die ſo, God forbid! But, (1.) Death commonly comes upon them unexpected, and ſo ſurpriſeth them; as the deluge came ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſingly on the old world, tho' they were forewarned of it long before it came: as <hi>travail cometh on a woman with child,</hi> with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſuddenneſs; although looked for and expected, 1 Theſſ. v. 3. Death <hi>ſeizeth</hi> them, as a creditor doth his debtor, to hale him to priſon, Pſal. lv. 15. And that when they are not aware. Death comes in, as a thief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the window, and finds them full of buſy <hi>thoughts</hi> about this life, which <hi>that very day periſh.</hi> (2.) Death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeizeth them <hi>unprepared</hi> for it: the old houſe falls down about their ears, before they have another provided. When death caſts them to the door, they have not where to lay their heads; unleſs it be on a bed of fire and brimeſtone. The ſoul and body are as it were hugging one another in mutual embraces: when death comes like a whirlwind, and ſepartes them. (3.) Death hurries them away in a moment to deſtruction, and makes a moſt diſmal change: the man, for the moſt part, never knows where he is, till <hi>in hell he lift up his eyes,</hi> Luke xvi. 23. The floods of wrath ſuddenly overwhelm his ſoul; and ere he is aware, he is plunged in the bottomleſs pit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The unrenewed man is taken away out of the world <hi>violently</hi> Driving is a violent action: he is <hi>choſed out of the world,</hi> Job xviii 18. Fain would he ſtay if he could: but death drags him away like a malefactor to the execution He <hi>ſought</hi> no other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the profits and pleaſures of this world; he <hi>hath</hi> no other; he really <hi>deſires</hi> no other: how can he then go away out of it, if he were not driven?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> "But may not a wicked man be willing to die? <hi>Anſ.</hi> He may indeed be willing to die; but (obſerve) it is only in one of three caſes. (1.) In a fit of <hi>paſſion,</hi> by reaſon of ſome trouble that he is impatient to be rid of. Thus many perſons, when their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has got the better of their reaſon, and when, on that account, they are moſt unfit to die, will be ready to cry, <hi>O to be gone!</hi> but ſhould their deſire be granted, and death come at their call, they
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:045042_0226_101F7F5FF6F9BEE8"/>
would quickly ſhew they were not in earneſt; and that if they go, they muſt be <hi>driven</hi> away againſt their wills. (2) When they are brim-full of <hi>deſpair,</hi> they may be willing to die. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf: and <hi>Spira</hi> wiſhed to be in hell, that he might know the uttermoſt of what he believed he was to ſuffer. In this manner men may ſeek after death, while it flies from them. But fearful is the <hi>violence</hi> theſe do undergo, whom the terrors of God do thus <hi>drive.</hi> (3.) When they are dreaming of <hi>happineſs</hi> after death. Fooliſh virgins, under the power of <hi>deluſion,</hi> as to their <hi>ſtate,</hi> may be willing to die, having no fear of lying down in ſorrow. How many are there, who can give no ſcripture ground for their <hi>hope,</hi> who yet have no bands in their death! Many are driven to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſleeping; they go off like lambs, who would rore like lions, did they but know what place they are going to: though the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, in which they are, drive furiouſly to the depths of hell; yet they fear not, becauſe they are faſt aſleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The unregenerate man is taken away <hi>irreſiſtibly.</hi> He muſt go, though ſore againſt his <hi>will.</hi> Death will take no refuſal, nor admit of any delay; tho' the man has not lived half his days, according to his own computation. If he will not <hi>bow,</hi> it will <hi>break</hi> him. If he will not come forth, it will pull the houſe down about his ears; for there he muſt not ſtay Although the phyſician help, friends groan, the wife and children cry, and the man himſelf uſe his utmoſt efforts to retain the Spirit, his ſoul is required of him; yield he muſt, and go where he ſhall never more ſee light.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, Let us conſider, <hi>whence</hi> they are driven, and <hi>whither.</hi> When the wicked die, (1.) They are driven out of <hi>this</hi> world, where they ſinned; into the <hi>other</hi> world, where they muſt be judged, and receive their particular ſentences, Heb ix.
<q>It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.</q>
They ſhall no more return to their beloved earth. Tho' their hearts are wedded to their earthly enjoyments, they muſt leave them; they can carry nothing hence. How ſorrowful muſt their departure be, when they have nothing in view, ſo good as that which they leave behind them! (2) They are driven out of the ſociety of the <hi>ſaints</hi> on earth, into the ſociety of the <hi>damned</hi> in hell, Luke xvi 22. "The rich man alſo died and was buried." ver. 23. "And in hell he lift up his eyes." What a multitude of the devil's <hi>goats</hi> do now take place among Chriſt's <hi>ſheep!</hi> but at death they ſhall be <hi>led forth with the workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. cxxv.5. There is a mixed multitude in this world, but no mixture in the other; each party is there ſet by themſelves. Though hypocrites grow here as <hi>tares</hi> among the <hi>wheat,</hi> death will root them up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they ſhall be bound in bundles for the fire.— (3.) They are driven out of <hi>time</hi> into <hi>eternity.</hi> While time laſts with them, there is hope; but when time goes, all hope goes with it. Precious time is now laviſhly ſpent: it lies ſo heavy upon the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:045042_0227_101F7F61CCF07060"/>
hands of many, that they think themſelves obliged to take ſeveral ways to <hi>drive away time.</hi> But beware of being at a loſs what to do in life: improve time for eternity, whilſt you have it: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re long death will drive it from you, and you from it, ſo as ye ſhall never meet again. (4.) They are driven out of their ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to piety. Death ſtrips them of the ſplended robes of a fair profeſſion, with which ſome of them were adorned; and turns them off the ſtage, in the rags of a wicked heart and life. The word <hi>hypocrite</hi> properly ſignifies a ſtage player, who appears to be what indeed he is not. This world is the ſtage on which theſe children of the devil perſonate the children of God. Their ſhew of religion is the player's coat, <hi>under</hi> which one muſt look, who will <hi>judge</hi> of them aright. Now death turns them out of their coat, and then they appear in their native dreſs: it unveils them, and takes off their maſk. There are none in the other world, who pretend to be better than they really are. Depraved nature acts in the regions of horror, unallayed, and undiſguiſed. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They are driven away from all <hi>means of grace:</hi> and are ſet beyond the line, quite out of all proſpect of mercy. There is no more an opportunity to buy oil for the lamp; it is <hi>gone out</hi> at death, and can never be lighted again. There may be offers of mercy and peace made after they are gone; but they are to <hi>others,</hi> not to <hi>them;</hi> there are no ſuch offers in the place, to which they are driven; theſe offers are only made in that place, <hi>from</hi> which they are driven away.</p>
                  <p>LASTLY, In what reſpect may they be ſaid to be driven away <hi>in their wickedneſs? Anſ.</hi> (1.) In reſpect of their being driven away in their <hi>ſinful unconverted ſtate.</hi> Having <hi>lived</hi> enemies to God, they <hi>die</hi> in a ſtate of enmity to him: for none are brought into the eternal ſtate of conſummate happineſs, but by the way of the ſtate of grace, or begun recovery in this life. The child that is dead in the womb, is born dead, and is caſt out of the womb into the grave: ſo he who is <hi>dead, while he liveth,</hi> or is ſpiritually dead, is caſt forth of the womb of time, in the ſame ſtate of death, into the pit of utter miſery. O miſerable death, to die in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity! it had been incomparably better for ſuch as die thus, that they had never been born. (2.) In regard they die <hi>ſinning,</hi> acting wickedly againſt God. in contradiction to the divine law: for they can do nothing but <hi>ſin</hi> while they live. So death takes them in the very <hi>act</hi> of ſinning; violently draws them from the embraces of their luſts, and drives them away to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal to receive their ſentence. It is a remarkable expreſſion, Job xxxvi. 14. <hi>They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, for the benefit of mankind in this life, are ſo many allays and reſtraints upon the impetuous wickedneſs of human nature. But all hope being cut off, and theſe gifts withdrawn, the wickedneſs of the wicked will then arrive at its perfection. As the ſeeds of grace ſown in the hearts of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, come to their full maturity at death: ſo wicked and helliſh diſpoſitions in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate come then to their higheſt pitch. Their prayers to God will then be turned to horrible curſes; and their praiſes to hideous blaſphemies, Matth. xxii. 13. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> This gives a diſmal but genuine view of the ſtate of the wicked in another world.</p>
                  <p>If, I ſhall diſcover the <hi>hopeleſneſs</hi> of the ſtate of unrenewed men, at death. It appears to be very hopeleſs, if we conſider theſe four things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Death cuts off all their hopes and proſpects of peace and pleaſure in this life, Luke xii. 19.
<q>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry. Ver. 20. But God ſaid unto him. Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, which thou haſt provided?</q>
They look for great matters in this world, they hope to increaſe their wealth, to ſee their families proſper, and to live at eaſe; but death comes like a ſtormy wind, and ſhakes off all their fond hopes, like green fruit from off a tree.
<q>When he is about to fill his belly, God ſhall caſt the fury of his wrath upon him?</q>
Job xx. 23. He may begin a web of contrivances, for advancing his worldly intereſt: but before he gets it wrought out, death comes and cuts it out.
<q>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh,</q>
Pſal. cxlvi. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> When death comes, they have no ſolid grounds to hope for eternal happineſs.
<q>For what is the hope of the hypocrite, tho' he hath gamed, when God taketh away his ſoul?</q>
Job xxvii. 8. Whatever hopes they fondly entertain, they are not founded on God's <hi>word,</hi> which is the only ſure ground of hope: if they knew their own caſe, they would ſee themſelves only happy in a dream. And indeed
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:045042_0229_101F7F6BB1399000"/>
what hope can they have? The law is plain againſt them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them. The curſes of it (theſe cords of death) are about them already. The Saviour, whom they ſlighted, is <hi>now</hi> their Judge; and their Judge is their enemy. How then can they hope? They have bolted the door of mercy againſt themſelves by their unbelief. They have deſpiſed the remedy, and therefore muſt die without mercy. They have no ſaving intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, the only channel of conveyance, in which mercy flows; and therefore they can never taſte of it. The ſword of juſtice guards the door of mercy, ſo as none can enter in, but the members of the myſtical body of Chriſt over whoſe heads is a covert of atoning blood the Mediator's blood. Theſe indeed may paſs without harm, for juſtice has nothing to require of them. But others cannot paſs, ſince they are not <hi>in Chriſt:</hi> death comes to them with the <hi>ſting</hi> in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſting of unpardoned guilt. It is armed againſt them with all the force the ſanction of a holy law can give it, 1 Cor. xv. 56.
<q>The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law.</q>
When that law was given on <hi>Sinai,</hi>
                     <q>the whole mount quaked greatly,</q>
Exod. xix. 18. When the Redeemer was making ſatisfaction for the elect's breaking of it,
<q>the earth did quake, and the rocks rent,</q>
Matth. xxvii. 51. What poſſible ground of hope then is there to the wicked man, when death comes upon him armed with the force of this law? How can he eſcape that fire, which "burnt unto the midſt of heaven?" Deut. iv 11. How ſhall he be able to ſtand in that ſmoke, that "aſcended as the ſmoak of a furnace?' Exod. xix. 18. How will be endure the terrible
<q>thunders and lightnings,</q>
ver. 16. and dwell in
<q>the darkneſs, clouds and thick darkneſs?</q>
Deut. iv. 11. All theſe reſemblances heaped together, do but faintly repreſent the fearful tempeſt of wrath and indignation, which ſhall purſue the wicked to the loweſt hell: and for ever abide on them, who are <hi>driven to darkneſs</hi> at death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Death roots up their <hi>deluſive hopes</hi> of eternal happineſs: then it is their covenant with death, and agreement with hell is broken. They are awakned out of their golden dreams, and at length lift up their eyes: Job viii. 14.
<q>Whoſe hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe truſt ſhall be a ſpider's web.</q>
They truſt all ſhall be well with them after death: but this their <hi>truſt</hi> is but a <hi>web</hi> woven out of their own bowels, with a great deal of art and induſtry. They wrap themſelves up in this their hope, as the ſpider wraps herſelf in her web. But it is but a weak and ſlender defence; for however it may withſtand the threatnings of the word of God; death, that <hi>beſom of deſtruction,</hi> will ſweep <hi>them</hi> and <hi>it</hi> both away, ſo as there ſhall not be the leaſt ſhred of it left them; but he, who this moment will not let his hope go, ſhall next moment be utterly hopeleſs Death overturns the houſe built on the ſand: it leaves no man under the power of deluſion.</p>

(2.) There is no returning to this life, to amend what is amiſs: it is a ſtate of probation and trial, which terminates at death; and therefore we cannot return to it again: it is but once we thus live, and once we die. Death carries the wicked man to <hi>his own place,</hi> Acts i. 25. This life is our working day: death cloſeth our day and our work together. We may readily imagine the wicked might have ſome hope in their death; if, after death has opened their eyes, they could return to life, and have but the trial of one Sabbath, one offer of Chriſt, one day, or but one hour more, to make up their peace with God: but,
<q>man lieth down, and riſeth not till the heavens be no more; they ſhall not awake, nor be raiſed out of their ſleep,</q>
Job xiv. 12. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In the other world, men have no acceſs to get their ruined ſtate and condition retrieved, if they never ſo fain would.
<q>For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave, whither thou goeſt,</q>
Eccleſ. ix. 10. Now, a man may flee from the wrath to come; now he may get into a refuge: but when once death has done its work, the <hi>door is ſhut:</hi> there are no more offers of mercy, no more pardons: where the tree is fallen, there it muſt ly.</p>

I beſeech you to beware, (1.) Of a hope built up, where the ground was never cleared. The wiſe builder <hi>digged deep,</hi> Luke vi. 48.

<q>For every one that doth evil, hatcth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved. Ver. 21. But he that doth the truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that they are wrought in God.</q>
That hope, which cannot abide ſcripture-trial, but ſinks when ſearched into by ſacred truth, is a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not a true hope: for God's word is always a friend to the graces of God's Spirit, and an enemy to deluſion. (3.) Beware of that hope, which ſtands without being ſupported by ſcripture-evidences. Alas! many are big with hopes, who cannot give, becauſe they really have not any ſcripture-grounds for them.

Remember the fatal end of the wicked man, as the text repreſents it.

And others die <hi>ſtupid:</hi> they lived like beaſts, and they die like beaſts, without any concern on their ſpirits about their eternal ſtate. They groan under their bodily diſtreſs, but have no ſenſe of the danger of their ſouls. One may with almoſt as much proſpect of ſucceſs ſpeak to a ſtone, as to ſpeak to them: vain is the attempt to teach them, nothing that can be ſaid moves them. To diſcourſe to them, either of the joys of <hi>heaven,</hi> or the torments of <hi>hell,</hi> is to plow on a rock, or beat the air. Some die like the fooliſh virgins, <hi>dreaming of heaven:</hi> their foreheads are ſteeled againſt the fears of hell, with preſumptuous hopes of heaven.

Though you reckon it pleaſant to <hi>live</hi> in wickedneſs; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but own it is better to die in it.

But alas! do not ye ſee them in hazard of being driven away in their wickedneſs? Is not death approaching them, even the youngeſt of them?

                     <hi>DOCTRINE II.</hi> The State of the Godly in Death, is a hopeful State.</head>
                  <p>We have ſeen the dark ſide of the cloud looking towards ungodly men, paſſing out of the world: let us now take a view of the bright ſide of it, ſhining on the godly, as they are entring upon their eternal ſtate. In diſcourſing this ſubject, I ſhall confirm this doctrine, anſwer an objection againſt it, and then make ſome practical improvement of the whole.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>confirmation,</hi> let it be obſerved, That although the paſſage out of this world by death, have a frightful aſpect to poor mortals; and to miſcarry in it muſt needs be of fatal conſequence; yet the following circumſtances make the ſtate of the godly in their death, <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>hopeful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> They have a truſty good <hi>friend</hi> before them in the other world; Jeſus Chriſt their beſt friend, is Lord of that land to which death carries them. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent for his father to come down to him to <hi>Egypt,</hi> telling him, <hi>God had made him Lord over all Egypt,</hi> Gen. xlv. 9. and <hi>when Jacob ſaw the waggons Joſeph had ſent to carry him, the ſpirit of Jacob revived,</hi> ver. 27. He frankly reſolves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the journey. I think, when the Lord calls a godly man, out of this world, he ſends him ſuch glad tidings, and ſuch a kind invitation into the other world; that if he had faith to believe it, his ſpirit muſt <hi>revive,</hi> when he ſees the waggon of death, which comes to carry him thither. It is true indeed, he has a weighty trial to undergo; <hi>after death the judgment.</hi> But the caſe of the godly is altogether hopeful; for the <hi>Lord of the land</hi> is their <hi>huſband,</hi> and their <hi>huſband</hi> is their <hi>Judge: The Father hath committed all judgment unto the Son,</hi> John v. 22. And ſurely the caſe of the wife is hopeful, when her own huſband is her judge; even ſuch a huſband as hates putting away. No huſband is ſo loving and ſo tender of his ſpouſe, as the Lord Chriſt is of his. One would think, it would be a very bad land, which a wife would not willingly go to, where her <hi>huſband</hi> is the <hi>ruler</hi> and <hi>judge.</hi> Moreover, their <hi>Judge</hi> is the <hi>Advocate,</hi> 1 John ii. 1.
<q>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</q>
And therefore they need not fear their being put back, and falling into condemnation. What can be more favourable? Can they think, that he who pleads their cauſe, will himſelf paſs ſentence againſt them: Yet further, their <hi>Advocate</hi> is the <hi>Redeemer;</hi> they are <q>redeemed with the prcious blood of Chriſt,</q>
1 Pet. i. 18, 19. So when he pleads for them, he is pleading his own cauſe. Though an advocate may be careleſs of the intereſt of one who employs him; ſurely he will do his utmoſt to defend his own right, which he hath purchaſed with his money: and ſhall not their Advocate defend the purchaſe of his own <hi>blood?</hi> But more than all that, their Redeemer is their <hi>head,</hi>
                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:045042_0234_101F7F7948E1D1A8"/>
and they are his <hi>members,</hi> Eph. v. 23, 32. Though one were ſo ſilly as to let his own <hi>purchaſe</hi> go, without ſtanding up to defend his right, yet ſurely he will not quit a <hi>limb</hi> of his own body. Is not their caſe then hopeful in death, who are ſo cloſely linked and allied to the Lord of the other world, who hath <hi>the keys of hell and death.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſhall have a ſafe paſſage to another world. They muſt indeed go through <hi>the valley of the ſhadow of death;</hi> but tho' it be in itſelf a dark and ſhady va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, it ſhall be a valley of hope to them: they ſhall not be driven thro' it, but <hi>walk</hi> thro' it; as men in perfect ſafety, who <hi>fear no evil,</hi> Pſal. xxiii. 4. Why ſhould they fear? They have the Lord of the land's ſafe conduct, his paſs ſealed with his own blood, namely, the bleſſed <hi>covenant,</hi> which is the ſaint's death-bed comfort. 2 Sam. xxiii. 5.
<q>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting COVENANT, ordered in all things and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he cauſe it not to grow.</q>
Who then can harm them? It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſafe riding in Chriſt's chariot (Cant. iii. 9.) both thro' life and death. They have good and honourable attendants, a <hi>guard,</hi> even a guard of angels. Theſe <hi>encamp about them</hi> in the time of their life: and ſurely will not leave them in the day of their death. Theſe happy miniſtering ſpirits are attendants on their Lord's bride, and will doubtleſs convey her ſafe home to his houſe. When friends in mournful mood ſtand by the faint's bed-ſide, waiting to ſee him draw his laſt breath; his ſoul is waited for of holy <hi>angels,</hi> to be carried by them <hi>into Abraham's boſom,</hi> Luke xvi. 22. The captain of the ſaint's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the <hi>captain</hi> of this holy guard: he was their <hi>guide even unto death,</hi> and he will be their guide through it too. Pſal xxiii. 4.
<q>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me.</q>
They may without fear paſs that river, being confident it ſhall not overflow them; and may walk through that fire, being ſure they ſhall not be burnt by it.</p>
                  <p>Death can do them no harm. It cannot even hurt their bodies: for tho' it ſeparate the ſoul from the body, it cannot ſeparate the body from the Lord Chriſt. Even death is to them but <hi>ſleep in Jeſus,</hi> 1 Theſſ. iv. 14. They continue members of Chriſt, though in a grave. Their duſt is precious duſt, laid up in a grave, as in their Lord's cabinet. They lie in a grave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ellowing; as precious fruit laid up to be brought forth to him at the reſurrection. The huſbandman has corn in his barn, and corn lying in the ground: the latter is more precious to him than the former; becauſe he looks to get it returned with increaſe. Even ſo the dead bodies of the ſaints are valued by their Saviour: they are <hi>ſown in corruption,</hi> to he <hi>raiſed in incorruption; ſown in diſhonour, raiſed in glory,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, 43. It cannot hurt their ſouls. It is with the ſouls of the ſaints as death as with <hi>Paul</hi> and his company in their voyage, whereof
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:045042_0235_101F7F7CE95636E0"/>
we have the hiſtory, Acts xxvii. the ſhip was broke in pieces, but the paſſengers got all <hi>ſafe to land.</hi> When the dying ſaint's ſpeech is laid, his eyes ſet, and his laſt breath drawn, the ſoul gets ſafe away into the heavenly paradiſe, leaving the body to return to its earth, but in the joyful hope of a re-union at its glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. How can death <hi>hurt</hi> the godly? It is a foiled enemy: if it caſt them down, it is only that they may riſe up more glorious. <hi>Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt hath aboliſhed</hi> DEATH, 2 Tim. i. 10. The ſoul and life of it is gone: it is but a walking <hi>ſhade</hi> that may <hi>fright,</hi> but cannot <hi>hurt</hi> ſaints; it is only <hi>the ſhadow of death to them;</hi> it is not the thing itſelf: their dying is but <hi>as dying,</hi> or ſomewhat like dying. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>It is Chriſt that died,</hi> Rom. viii. 34. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian martyr, though ſtoned to death, yet but <hi>fell aſleep,</hi> Acts viii. 34. Certainly the nature of death is quite changed with reſpect to the ſaints. It is not to them, what it was to Jeſus Chriſt their head: It is not the invenomed ruinating thing, wrapt up in the ſanction of the firſt covenant, Gen ii. 19. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> It comes to the godly without its ſting: they may meet it with that ſalutation, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?</hi> is this <hi>Mara?</hi> Is this bitter death? It <hi>went out full</hi> into the world, when the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> opened the door to it: but the ſecond <hi>Adam hath brought</hi> it <hi>again empty</hi> to his own people. I feel a ſting, may the dying ſaint ſay; yet it is but a bee-ſting, ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only through the ſkin: but O death, where is thy ſting, thine old ſting, the ſerpent's ſting, that ſtings to the heart and ſoul? <hi>The</hi> ſting of death is <hi>Sin:</hi> but that is taken away. If death arreſt the ſaint, and carry him before the Judge, to anſwer for the debt he contracted, the debt will be ſound paid by the glorious Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and he has the diſcharge to ſhow. The thorn of guilt is pulled out of the man's conſcience; and his name is blotted out of the black roll, and written among the <hi>living in Jeruſalem.</hi> It is true, it is a great journey to go through the valley of the ſhadow of death: but the ſaint's burden is <hi>taken away</hi> from off his back, his iniquity is pardoned, he may walk at caſe; <hi>no lion ſhall be there, nor any ravenous beaſt:</hi> the redeemed may walk at leiſure there, free from all apprehenſions of danger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They ſhall have a <hi>joyful entrance</hi> into the other world. Their arrival in the regions of bliſs, will be celebrated with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous hymns of praiſe to their glorious Redeemer. A dying day is a <hi>good day</hi> to a godly man. Yea, it is his beſt day; it is better to him than his birth-day, or than the moſt joyous day he ever had on earth. <hi>A good name,</hi> ſays the wiſe man, <hi>is better than precious ointment: and the day of death, than the day of one's birth,</hi> Eccl. vii. 1. The notion of the immortality of the ſoul, and of future happineſs, which obtained among ſome Pagan nations, had wonderful effects on them. Some of them when they mourned for the dead, did it in <hi>women's apparel</hi>; that being moved with the indecency of the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:045042_0236_101F7F7EDB1987D0"/>
garb, they might the ſooner lay aſide their mourning. Others bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them <hi>without</hi> any <hi>lamentation</hi> or mourning: but had a ſacrifice, and a feaſt for friends upon that occaſion. Some were wont to <hi>mourn</hi> at births, and <hi>rejoice</hi> at burials. But the practice of ſome <hi>Indian nations</hi> is yet more ſtrange. of whom it is reported, that upon the huſband's deceaſe, his ſeveral wives were it uſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, before the judges, which of them was the beſt beloved wife: and ſhe, in whoſe favours it was determined, with a chearful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, threw herſelf into the flames prepared for her huſband's corpſe, was burned with it, and reckoned happy, while the reſt lived in grief, and were accounted miſerable. But, howſoever lame notions of a future ſtate, aſſiſted by pride, affectation of applauſe, apprehenſions of difficulties in this life, and ſuch like principles, proper to depraved human nature, may influence rude, unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated minds, when ſtrengthned by the arts of hell: O! what ſolid joy and conſolation may they have who are <hi>true</hi> Chriſtians, being <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>hath brought life and immortality to light by the goſpel!</hi> 2 Tim. i. 10. Death is one of theſe <hi>all things,</hi> that <hi>work together for good, to them that love God,</hi> Rom. viii. 28. When the body dies, the ſoul is perfected: the body of death goes off at the death of the body. What harm did the jaylor to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s butler, when he opened the priſon door to him, and let him out? Is the bird in worſe caſe, when at liberty, than when confined in a cage? Thus, and no worſe, are the <hi>ſouls</hi> of the ſaints treated by death. It comes to the godly man, as <hi>Haman</hi> came to <hi>Mordecai</hi> with the royal <hi>apparel</hi> and <hi>the horſe,</hi> Eſther iv. 11. with commiſſion to do them honour; howſoever aukwardly it be performed: I queſtion not but <hi>Haman</hi> performed the ceremony with a very ill mein, a pale face, a down look, and a cloudy contenance, and like one who came to hang him, rather than to honour him. But he, whom the king delighted to honour, behoved to be honoured; and <hi>Haman, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>'s grand enemy, muſt be the man employed to put this honour upon him. Glory, glory, glory, bleſſing and praiſe to our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, our Saviour, our Mediator, by whoſe death, grim devouring death is made to do ſuch a good office to thoſe, whom it might otherwiſe have hurried away in their wickedneſs, to utter and eternal deſtruction! a dying day is, in itſelf, a joyful day to the godly, it is their <hi>redemption-day;</hi> when the captives are delivered, when the priſoners are ſet free. It is the day of the pilgrims <hi>coming home</hi> from their pilgrimage; the day in which the heirs of glory <hi>return</hi> from their travels to their own country, and their Father's houſe; and enter into actual poſſeſſion of the glorious inheritance. It is their <hi>marriage day;</hi> now is the time of eſpouſals; but then the marriage is conſumate, and a marriage feaſt begun, which has no period. If ſo, is not the ſtate of the godly in death a <hi>hopeful</hi> ſtate? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

 are full of fears, and have little hope:</q>
ANSW. It muſt be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſaints do not all die in one and the ſame manner; there is a diverſity among them, as well as among the wicked; yet the worſt caſe of a dying ſaint is indeed a hopeful one. Some die <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly,</hi> in a full aſſurance of faith. 2 Tim. iv. 6.
<q>The time of my departure is at hand. ver. 7. I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith. ver. 8. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs.</q>
They get a taſte of the joys of heaven, while here on earth; and begin the ſongs of <hi>Zion,</hi> while yet in a ſtrange land. Others die in a ſolid <hi>fiducial dependence</hi> on their Lord and Saviour: though they cannot <hi>ſing</hi> triumphantly, yet they can and will <hi>ſay</hi> confidently, <hi>The Lord is their God.</hi> Though they cannot triumph over death, with old <hi>Simeon,</hi> having Chriſt in his arms, and ſaying,
<q>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation,</q>
Luke ii. 29, 30. yet they can ſay with dying <hi>Jacob,</hi> 'I have waited for thy ſalvation, O Lord.' Gen. xlix. 18. His left hand is under their head to ſupport them; though his right hand doth not embrace them: they firmly <hi>believe,</hi> though they are not filled with <hi>joy</hi> in believing. They can plead the <hi>covenant,</hi> and hang by the promiſe, <hi>although their houſe is not ſo with God,</hi> as they could wiſh. But the dying-day of ſome ſaints may be like that day mentioned. Zech. xiv. 7. <hi>Not day, nor night.</hi> They may die under great doubts and fears; ſetting as it were, in a cloud, and going to heaven in a miſt. They may go mourning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſun, and never put off their <hi>ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> till death ſtrip them of it. They may be carried to heaven through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of hell; and may be purſued by the devouring lion, even to the very gates of the new <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and may be compared to a ſhip almoſt wrecked in ſight of the harbour, which yet gets ſafe into her port, 1 Cor. iii. 15.

Pſal. xcvii. 11.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſaints are liable to ſuch perplexity in their death, becauſe, though they be Chriſtians indeed, yet they are <hi>men of alike paſſions</hi> with others; and death is a frightful object in itſelf, whatever dreſs it appear in: the ſtern countenance, with which it looks at mortals, can hardly miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Wherefore, there are three caſes, in which death cannot but be very uncomfortable to a <hi>child of God.</hi> (1.) If it ſeize him at a time when the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſome particular ſin unrepented of, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> lying on his <hi>conſcience;</hi> and death comes on that very account, to take him out of the land of the living; as was the cauſe of many of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> believers, 1 Cor. xi. 30.
<q>For this cauſe (namely, of unworthy communicating) many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</q>
If a perſon is ſurpriſed with the approach of death, while lying under the guilt of ſome unpardoned ſin, it cannot but cauſe a mighty conſternation. (2) When death catches him <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pping.</hi> The mighty cry muſt be frightful to ſleeping virgins. The man who lies in a ruinous houſe, and awakens not till the timber begins to crack, and the ſtones to drop down about his ears, may indeed get out of it ſafely, but not without fears of being cruſhed by its fall. When a Chriſtian has been going on in a courſe of ſecurity and backſliding, and awakens not till death comes to his bed-ſide; it is no marvel if he get a fearful awakening. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> When he has loſt ſight of his ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, and cannot produce evidences of his title to heaven. It is hard to meet death without ſome evidence of a tittle to eternal life at hand: hard to go through the dark valley without the candle of the Lord ſhining upon the head. It is a terrible adventure to lau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h out into eternity, when a man can make no better of it, than a leap in the dark, not knowing where he ſhall light, whether in heaven or hell.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the ſtate of the ſaints, in their death, is always in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hopeful. The preſumptuous hopes of the ungodly, in their death, cannot make their ſtate <hi>hopeful;</hi> neither can the hopeleſneſs of a ſaint make his ſtate <hi>hopeleſs:</hi> for God judgeth according to the truth of the thing, not according to men's opinions about it. Howbeit the ſaints can no more be altogether without hope, than they can be altogether without <hi>faith.</hi> Their faith may be very weak, but it <hi>fails not;</hi> and their hope very low, yet they will; and do, <hi>hope to the end.</hi> Even while the godly ſeem to be carried away with the ſtreams of doubts and fears; there remains ſtill as much <hi>hope</hi> as determines them to lay hold on the tree of life, that grows on the banks of the river. Jonah ii. 4.
<q>Then I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight: yet I will look again towards thy holy temple.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>USE. This ſpeaks comfort to the godly againſt the fear of death. A godly man may be called a <hi>happy</hi> man, <hi>before</hi> his death; becauſe, whatever befal him in life, he ſhall certainly be happy at death. You
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:045042_0239_101F7F8BB2586998"/>
who are in Chriſt, who are true Chriſtians, have hope in your end; and ſuch hope as may comfort you againſt all thoſe fears, which ariſe from the conſideration of a dying hour. This I ſhall branch out, in anſwering ſome caſes briefly.</p>
                  <p>CASE I. <hi>The proſpect of death</hi> (will ſome of the ſaints ſay) <hi>is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy to me, not knowing what ſhall become of my family, when I am gone.</hi> ANSW. The righteous hath hope in his death, as to his <hi>family,</hi> as well as to himſelf. Altho' you have little for the preſent, to live upon; which has been the caſe of many of God's choſen ones, 1 Cor. iv. 11. <hi>We</hi> (namely <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> ver. 9) <hi>both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place:</hi> and tho' you have nothing to leave them, as was the caſe of that ſon of the prophet's, who <hi>did fear the Lord,</hi> and yet died in debt which he was unable to pay; as his poor widow repreſents, 2 Kings iv. 1. yet you have <hi>a good friend</hi> to leave them too; a covenanted God, to whom you may confidently commit them, Jer. xlix. 11.
<q>Leave thy father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children, I will preſerve them alive, and let thy widows truſt in me.</q>
The world can bear witneſs of ſignal ſettlements made upon <hi>the children of providence;</hi> ſuch as by their pious parents have been caſt upon God's providential care. It has been often remarked that they wanted neither <hi>proviſion</hi> nor <hi>education Moſes</hi> is an eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this. He, albeit he was an outcaſt infant, (Exod. ii. 3.) yet was <hi>learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians,</hi> Acts vii. 22. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>king in Jeſhurum,</hi> Deut. xxxiii. 5. O! may we not be aſhamed, that we do not ſecurely truſt him with the concerns of our <hi>families,</hi> to whom, as our Saviour and Redeemer, we have committed our <hi>eternal</hi> intereſts!</p>
                  <p>CASE II.
<q>Death will take us away from our dear friends; yea, we ſhall not ſee the Lord in the land of the living, in the bleſſed ordinances.</q>
ANSW. It will take you to your beſt friend, the Lord Chriſt. And the friends you leave behind you, if they be indeed perſons of worth, you will meet them again, when they come to heaven: and you will never be ſeparated any more. If death take you away from the temple below, it will carry you to the temple above. It will indeed take you from the ſtreams, but it will ſet you down by the fountain. If it put out your candle, it will carry you where there is no night, where there is an eternal day.</p>
                  <p>CASE III.
<q>I have ſo much ado, in time of health, to ſatisfy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to my intereſt in Chriſt, about my being a real Chriſtian, a regenerate man; that I judge, it is almoſt impoſſible I ſhould die comfortably.</q>
ANSW. If it is thus with you, then double your <hi>diligence, to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Endeavour to grow in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and walk cloſely <hi>with God;</hi> be diligent in <hi>ſelf-examination;</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> earneſtly for the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whereby you may know the things freely given you of God.

time, it may be light.</hi> Many weak Chriſtians indulge doubts and fears about their ſpiritual ſtate, as if they placed, at leaſt, ſome part of religion in this impudent practice: but towards the period of life, they are forced to think and act in another manner. The traveller, who reckons he has time to ſpare, may ſtand ſtill debating with himſelf, whether this or the other be the right way; but when the ſun begins to ſet, he is forced to lay aſide his ſcruples, and reſolutely to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the road he judges to be the right one, leſt he ly all night in the open fields. Thus ſome Chriſtians, who perplex themſelves much, throughout the courſe of their lives, with jealous doubts and fears, content themſelves, when they come to die, with ſuch evidences of the ſafety of their ſtate, as they could not be ſatisfied with before; and, by <hi>diſputing</hi> leſs againſt themſelves, and <hi>believing</hi> more, court the peace they formerly rejected, and gain it too.</p>
                  <p>CASE IV.
<q>I am under a ſad decay, in reſpect of my ſpiritual condition.</q>
ANSW. Bodily conſumptions may make death eaſy, but it is not ſo in ſpiritual decays. I will not ſay, that a godly man cannot be in ſuch a caſe, when he dies; but I believe it is rarely ſo. Ordinarily (I ſuppoſe) a cry comes to awaken ſleepy virgins before death come. <hi>Samſon</hi> is ſet to grind in the priſon, until his locks grow again. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> fell under great ſpiritual decays: but, before they died, they recovered their ſpiritual ſtrength and vigour. However, beſtir ye yourſelves without delay, to <hi>ſtrengthen the things that remain:</hi> your fright will be the leſs, that ye awake from ſpiritual ſleep, ere death come to your bed-ſide: and you ought to loſe no time, ſeeing you know not how ſoon death may ſeize you.</p>
                  <p>CASE V.
<q>It is terrible to think of the other world, that world of ſpirits which I have ſo little acquaintance with.</q>
ANSW. Thy beſt friend is Lord of that other world. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>boſom</hi> is kindly, even to theſe who never ſaw his fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> inhabitants of that other world. <hi>The ſpirits of juſt men made perfect</hi> were once ſuch as thy ſpirit now is. And as for the angels, howſoever they be of a ſuperior nature in the rank of beings, yet our nature is dignified above theirs, in the man Chriſt: and they are, all of them, thy Lord's ſervants, and ſo thy fellow-ſervants.</p>
                  <p>CASE VI. "The pangs of death are terrible." ANSW. Yet not ſo terrible as pangs of conſcience, cauſed by a piercing ſenſe of guilt, and apprehenſions of divine wrath, with which, I ſuppoſe thee to be not altogether unacquainted. But who would not endure bodily ſickneſs, that the ſoul may become ſound, and every whit whole? Each pang of death will ſet ſin a ſtep nearer the door; and with the laſt breath, the <hi>body of ſin</hi> will breath out its laſt. The pains of death will not laſt long; and the Lord thy God will not leave, but ſupport thee, under them.</p>
                  <p>CASE VII. "But I am like to be cut off in the midſt of my days." ANSW. Do not complain, you will be the ſooner at home: you have
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:045042_0241_101F7F94B3EA7760"/>
thereby the advantage of your fellow-labourers, who were at work before you in the vineyard. God, in the courſe of his providences, hides ſome of his ſaints early in the grave, that they may be taken away from the evil to come. An early removal out of this world prevents much ſin and miſery: and they have no ground of complaint, who get <hi>the reſidue of their years</hi> in Immanuel's land. Surely thou ſhalt live as long as thou haſt work cut out for thee, by the great Maſter, to be done for him in this world; and when that is at an end, it is high time to be gone.</p>
                  <p>CASE VIII. "I am afraid of ſudden death." ANSW. Thou may indeed die ſo. Good <hi>Eli</hi> died ſuddenly, 1 Sam. iv. 18. Yet death found him watching, ver. 12.
<q>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour the Lord doth come,</q>
Matth. xxiv. 42. But be not afraid, it is an unexpreſſible comfort, that death, come when it will, can never catch thee out of Chriſt; and therefore can never ſeize thee, as a jailor, to hurry thee into the priſon of hell. Sudden death may haſten and facilitate thy paſſage to heaven, but can do thee no prejudice.</p>
                  <p>CASE IX.
<q>I am afraid it may be my lot to die wanting the exerciſe of reaſon.</q>
ANSW. I make no queſtion but a child of God, a true Chriſtian, may die in this caſe. But what harm? There is no hazard in it, as to his eternal ſtate: a diſeaſe, at death, may diveſt him of his reaſon, but not of his religion. When a man going a long voyage, has put his affairs in order, and put all his goods aboard; he himſelf may be carried aboard the ſhip ſleeping: all is ſafe with him, although he knows not where he is, till he awaken in the ſhip. Even ſo the godly man, who dies in this caſe, may die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably but not <hi>unſafely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CASE <hi>laſt.</hi>
                     <q>I am naturally timorous, and the very thoughts of death are terrible to me.</q>
ANSW. The leſs you think on death, the thoughts of it will be the more frightful: but make it familiar to you by frequent meditations upon it, and you may thereby allay your fears. Look at the white and bright ſide of the cloud: take faith's view of the <hi>city that hath foundations:</hi> ſo ſhall you ſee <hi>hope in your death.</hi> Be duly affected with the body of ſin and death, and frequent interruptions of your communion with God, and with the glory which dwells on the other ſide death: this will contribute much to remove ſlaviſh fear.</p>
                  <p>It is pity ſaints ſhould be ſo fond of life as they often are: they ought always to be in good terms with death. When matters are duly conſidered, it might well be expected every child of God, every regenerate man, ſhould generouſly profeſs concerning this life, what <hi>Job</hi> did, chap. vii. 16. <hi>I lothe it, I would not live always.</hi> In order to gain their hearts to this deſirable temper, I offer the following additional conſiderations.</p>

Do not ye ſometimes <hi>infect others,</hi> and others <hi>infect you?</hi> There is no ſociety in the world, in which every member of it doth not ſometimes lay a ſtumbling-block before the reſt. The beſt carry about with them the <hi>tinder</hi> of a corrupt nature, which they cannot be rid of while they live, and which is liable to be <hi>kindled</hi> at all <hi>times,</hi> and in all <hi>places;</hi> yea, they are apt to <hi>inflame</hi> others, and become the <hi>occaſions</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> that attend it. Reſt is deſirable, but it is not to be found on this ſide of the grave. Worldly troubles attend <hi>all</hi> men in this life. This world is a ſea of trouble, where one wave rolls upon another. They, who fancy themſelves beyond the reach of trouble, are miſtaken: no ſtate, no ſtage of life, is exempted from it. The crowned head is ſurrounded with thorny cares. Honour many times paves the way to deep diſgrace: riches, for the moſt part, are kept to the hurt of the owners. The faireſt ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a certain affinity with the preſent life, muſt needs create in the ſaints a deſire to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conſider the great <hi>imperfections</hi> attending this life. While the ſoul is lodged in this cottage of <hi>clay,</hi> the neceſſities of the body are many; it is always craving. The mud-walls muſt be repaired and patched up daily, till the clay-cottage fall down for good and all. Eating, drinking, ſleeping, and the like, are, in themſelves, but mean employments for a rational creature; and will be reputed ſuch by the heaven-born ſoul. They are badges of <hi>imperfection,</hi> and, as ſuch, unpleaſant to the mind, aſpiring unto that life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, which is brought to light through the goſpel: and would be very grievous, if this ſtate of things were of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Doth not the gracious ſoul often find itſelf yoked with the <hi>body,</hi> as with a companion in travel, unable to keep pace with it? When the ſpirit is willing, the fleſh is weak. When the ſoul would mount upward, the body is as a clog upon it, and as a ſtone tied to the foot of a bird attempting to fly. The truth is, O belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver! thy ſoul in this body is, at beſt, but like a diamond in a ring, where much of it is obſcured: it is far ſunk in <hi>the vile clay,</hi> till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by death.</p>
                  <p>I conclude this ſubject with a few <hi>directions</hi> how to <hi>prepare</hi> for death, ſo as we may die <hi>comfortably.</hi> I ſpeak not here of <hi>habitual preparation</hi> for death, which a true Chriſtian, in virtue of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>ſtate,</hi> never wants, from the time he is born again and united to Chriſt; but of <hi>actual preparation</hi> or <hi>readineſs</hi> in reſpect of his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiate caſe, frame, and diſpoſition of mind and ſpirit; the want of which makes even a ſaint very <hi>unfit</hi> to die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let it be your conſtant care to keep a <hi>clean</hi> conſcience, <hi>a conſcience void of offence toward God, and toward man,</hi> Acts xxiv. 17. Beware of a ſtanding controverſy betwixt God and you, on the account of ſome iniquity regarded in the heart. When an honeſt man is about to leave his country, and not to return, he ſettles accompts with thoſe he had dealings with, and lays down methods for paying his debts timeouſly; leſt he be reckoned a bankrupt, and be attacked by an officer, when he is going off. Guilt lying on the conſcience is a fountain of fears; and will readily ſting ſeverely, when death ſtares the criminal in the face. Hence it is, that many, even of God's children, when a dying, are made to wiſh paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and deſire eagerly that they may live to do, what they ought to have done, before that time. Wherefore, walk cloſely with God, be diligent, ſtrict and exact in your courſe; beware of a looſe, careleſs, and irregular converſation: as ye would not lay up for yourſelves, anguiſh and bitterneſs of ſpirit, in a dying hour. And becauſe, through the infirmity cleaving to us, in our preſent ſtate of imperfection, <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> renew your repentance daily, and be ever waſhing in the Redeemer's blood. As long as ye are in the world, ye will need <hi>to waſh your feet,</hi> John xiii. 10.
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:045042_0244_101F7F9972CF0CB0"/>
that is, to make application to the blood of Chriſt, anew, for purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your conſciences from the guilt of daily miſcarriages. Let death find you at the fountain; and if ſo, it will find you ready to anſwer its call.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be always watchful, waiting for your change,
<q>Like unto men that wait for their Lord, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</q>
Luke xxi. 36. Beware of <hi>ſlumbering and ſleeping, while the bridegroom tarries.</hi> To be awakened out of ſpiritual ſlumber, by a ſurprizing call to paſs into a another world, is a very fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bring yourſelves familiarly acquainted with death, by making many viſits to the grave, in ſerious meditations upon it. This was <hi>Job's</hi> practice, chap. xvii. 13, 14. <hi>I have made my bed in the darkneſs.</hi> Go thou, and do likewiſe; and when death comes, thou ſhalt have nothing ado but to ly down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> "I have ſaid to corruption, thou art my father; to the worm, thou art my mother and my ſiſter." Do thou ſay ſo too; and thou wilt be the fitter to go home to their houſe. Be frequently reflecting upon your conduct, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what courſe of life you wiſh to be found in when death arreſts you: and act accordingly. When you do the duties of your ſtation in life, or are employed in acts of worſhip, think with yourſelves, that, it may be, this is the laſt oppertunity: and therefore act as if you was never to do more of that kind. When you ly down at night, compoſe your ſpirits as if you was not to awake till the heavens be no more. And when you awake in the morning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that new day as your laſt, and live accordingly. Surely that night cometh, of which you will never ſee the morning; or that morning, of which you will never ſee the night. But which of your mornings or nights, will be ſuch, you know not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Employ yourſelves much in <hi>weaning</hi> your hearts from the world. The man who is making ready to go abroad, buſies himſelf in taking leave of his friends. Let the mantle of earthly enjoyments hang looſe about you, that it may be eaſily dropt, when death comes to carry you away into another world. Moderate your affections towards your lawful comforts of life: and let not your hearts be too much taken with them. The traveller acts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely, who ſuffers himſelf to be ſo allured with the conveniencies of the inn where he lodgeth, as to make his neceſſary departure from it grievous. Feed with fear, and walk thro' the world as pilgrims and ſtrangers. Likeas, when the corn is forſaking the ground, it is ready for the ſickle: when the fruit is ripe, it falls off the tree eaſily: ſo, when a Chriſtian's heart is truly weaned from the world, he is prepared for death, and it will be the more
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:045042_0245_101F7FA0A561B7A8"/>
eaſy to him. A heart diſengaged from the world is an heavenly one: and then are we ready for heaven, when <hi>our heart is there</hi> before us, Matth. vi. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Be diligent in gathering and laying up <hi>evidences</hi> of your title to heaven, for your ſupport and comfort at the hour of death. The neglect hereof mars the joy and conſolation which ſome Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians might otherwiſe have at their death. Wherefore examine yourſelves frequently, as to your ſpiritual ſtate; that evidences, which ly hid and unobſerved, may be brought to light and taken notice of. And if you would manage this work ſucceſsfully, make ſolemn ſerious work of it. Set apart ſome time for it. And, after earneſt prayer to God, through Jeſus Chriſt, for the enlightning influences of the Holy Spirit, whereby ye may be enabled to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his own <hi>word,</hi> to diſcern his own <hi>work</hi> in your ſouls; ſiſt yourſelves before the tribunal of your conſciences, that ye may judge yourſelves in this weighty matter.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place, Let the marks of a regenerate ſtate be fixed, from the Lord's word: and have recourſe to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar text for that purpoſe; ſuch as Prov. viii. 17. "I love them that love me." Compare Luke xiv. 26. "If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and ſiſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple." Pſal. cxix. 6.
<q>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy commandments. Pſal. xviii. 23. I was alſo upright before him: and I kept myſelf from mine iniquity.</q>
Compare Rom. vii. 22, 23.
<q>For I delight in the law of God, after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardman: but I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, &amp;c. 1 John iii. 3. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure, Matth. v. 3. Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Phil. iii. 3. For we are the circumciſion which worſhip (<hi>or</hi> ſerve) God in the ſpirit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</q>
The ſum of the evidence ariſing from theſe texts, lies here. A real Chriſtian is one who loves God for himſelf, as well as for his benefits: and that with a ſupreme love, above all perſons and all things: he has an awful and impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to God's commands: he oppoſeth and wreſtleth againſt that ſin, which of all others moſt eaſily beſets him: he approveth and loveth the holy law, even in that very point, wherein it ſtrikes againſt his moſt beloved luſt: his hope of heaven engageth him in the ſtudy of univerſal holineſs; in the which he aims at perfection, though he cannot reach it in this life: he ſerves the Lord, not only in acts of worſhip, but in the whole of his converſation; and as to both, is ſpiritual in the principle, motives, aims, and ends of his ſervice: yet he ſees nothing in himſelf to truſt to before the Lord: Chriſt and his fulneſs is the ſtay of his ſoul: and his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is cut off from all that is not Chriſt, or in Chriſt, in point

               <p>THESE words are part of the defence our Lord Jeſus Chriſt makes for himſelf, when perſecuted by the <hi>Jews</hi> for curing the impotent man, and ordering him to carry away his bed on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and for vindicating his conduct, when accuſed by them of having thereby profaned that day. On this occaſion he profeſſeth himſelf not only Lord of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but alſo Lord of life and death; declaring in the words of the text, the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>dead</hi> to be brought to paſs by his power. This he introduceth with theſe words, as with a ſolemn preface: <hi>Marvel not at this: i. e</hi> at this ſtrange diſcourſe of mine: do not wonder to hear me, whoſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is ſo very mean in your eyes, talk at this rate: for the day is coming, in which the <hi>dead</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed</hi> by my power.</p>

O cruel kindneſs! haſt thou thus hugged me to death, thus nouriſhed me to the ſlaughter? Is this the effect of thy tenderneſs for me? Is this what I am to reap of thy pains and concern about me! What do riches and pleaſure avail now, when this fearful reckoning is come, of which thou hadſt fair warning? O cruel grave, why didſt then not cloſe thy mouth upon me for ever? Why didſt thou not hold faſt thy priſoner?
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:045042_0257_101F7FC4AB18DA28"/>
Why haſt thou ſhaken me out, while I lay ſtill, and was at reſt? Curſed Soul wherefore didſt thou not abide in thy place, wrapt up in flames of fire? Wherefore art thou come back to take me alſo down to the bars of the pit? Thou madſt me an inſtrument of unrighteouſneſs; and now I muſt be thrown into the fire. This tongue was by thee employed in mocking at religion, curſing, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, backbiting, and boaſting; and with-held from glorifying God: and now it muſt not have ſo much as a drop of water to cool it in the flames. Thou didſt withdraw mine ears from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſermons which gave warning of this day. Thou foundeſt ways and means to ſtop them from attending to ſeaſonable exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, admonitions and reproofs. But why didſt thou not ſtop them from hearing the ſound of this dreadful trumpet? Why doſt thou not now rove and fly away on the wings of imagination, thereby, as it were, tranſporting me during theſe frightful tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, as thou was wont to do, when I was ſet down at ſermons, communions, prayers, and godly conferences: that I might now have as little ſenſe of the one, as I formerly had of the other?

<q>Wretched and vile carcaſe am I now driven back into thee! O that thou hadſt lain for ever rotting in thy grave! Had I not torment enough before? Muſt I be knit to thee again, that being joined together as two dry ſticks for the fire, the wrath of God may the more keenly burn us up? It was by caring for you, I loſt myſelf. It was your back and your belly, and the gratifying of your ſenſes, which ruined me. How often was I enſnared by your ears? How often betrayed by your eyes? It was to ſpare you, that I neglected opportunities of making peace with God, loitered away ſabbaths, lived in the neglect of prayer, went to the houſe of mirth, rather than to the houſe of mourning; and that I chuſed to deny Chriſt, and forſake his cauſe and intereſts in the world; and ſo am fallen a ſacrifice to your curſed eaſe. When at any time my conſcience began to awake, and I was ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf to think of my ſins, and the miſery I have felt ſince we parted, and now feel; it was you that diverted me from theſe thoughts, and drew me off to make proviſion for thee, O wretched fleſh. By your ſilken cords of fleſhly luſts I was drawn to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, over the belly of my light and conſcience: but now they are turned into iron chains, with which I am to be held under wrath for evermore. Ah! wretched profits! ah! curſed pleaſures! for which I muſt ly for ever in utter darkneſs.</q>

Many of the ſaints now have bodies weaker than others; but "the feeble among them, (to allude to Zech xii. 8.) at that day, ſhall be as David, and the houſe of David ſhall be as God." A grave divine ſays, that <hi>one</hi> ſhall be ſtronger at the reſurrection, than an hundred, yea, than thouſands are now. Certainly great, and vaſtly great, muſt the ſtrength of glorified bodies be, ſeeing they ſhall bear up under an <hi>exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> The <hi>mortal body</hi> is not at all adapted to ſuch a ſtate. Do tranſports of <hi>joy</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion death, as well as exceſſive grief does? And can <hi>it</hi> bear up under a <hi>weight of glory?</hi> Can it ſubſiſt in union with a ſoul filled with heaven's raptures? Surely no. The mortal body would ſink under <hi>that</hi> load, and <hi>ſuch</hi> a fill would make the earthen pitcher to fly all in pieces. The Scripture has plainly told us, that <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> (namely) in their preſent frail ſtate, though it were the fleſh and blood of a giant, <hi>cannot inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 50.

that mortals may not be confounded with the rays of glory, which ſhine forth from it, Job xxvi 9. But then the vail ſhall be removed, and they made able to behold it, to their unſpeakable joy. How <hi>ſtrong</hi> muſt their <hi>bodies</hi> be, who ſhall not reſt night nor day; but be without intermiſſion for ever employed in the heavenly temple, to ſing and proclaim the praiſes of God, without wearineſs, which is a weakneſs incident to the frail mortal, but incompetent to the glorified body!</p>

The body ſhall be, abſolutely, ſubſervient to the ſoul, ſubject to it, and influenced by it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no more a clog to its activity, nor the animal appetites a ſnare to it. There will be no need to <hi>beat it down,</hi> nor to drag it to the ſervice of God. The ſoul, in this life, is ſo much influenced by the body, that in Scripture-ſtyle, it is ſaid to be <hi>carnal:</hi> but then, the body ſhall be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> readily ſerving the ſoul in the buſineſs of heaven; and in that only, as if it had no more relation of earth, than a ſpirit. It will have no further need of the now neceſſary ſupports of life namely, food and raiment, and the like:
<q>They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more. Rev. vii. 16. For in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</q>

                  <p>As to the <hi>qualities</hi> of the bodies of the <hi>wicked,</hi> at the reſurrection, I find the Scripture ſpeaks but little of them. Whatever they may need, they ſhall not get a drop of water to cool their tongues, Luke xvi. 24, 25. Whatever may be ſaid of their weakneſs it is certain they will be continued for ever in life; that they may be ever <hi>dying:</hi> they ſhall bear up howſoever unwillingly, under the load of God's wrath, and ſhall not faint away under it.
<q>The ſmoak of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever. And they have no reſt day nor night.</q>

Their ſhame will be too deep for bluſhes but "all faces ſhall gather black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," at that day, when they ſhall go forth of their graves, as male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors out of their priſons to execution; for their reſurrection is the reſurrection of <hi>damnation.</hi> The greateſt beauties, who now pride themſelves in their comelineſs of body not regarding their deformed ſouls, will then appear with ghaſtly countenances, a grim and death-like viſage. Their looks will be frightful, and they will be horrible ſpectacles, coming forth of their graves like infernal furies out of the pit. They ſhall riſe alſo to <hi>everlaſting contempt.</hi> They ſhall then be the moſt contemptible creatures, filled with contempt from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>veſſels of diſhonour:</hi> whatever honourable uſes they have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to, in this world; and filled alſo with contempt from men. They will be moſt deſpicable in the eyes of the ſaints, even of thoſe ſaints, who gave them honour here; either for their high ſtation, the gifts of God in them or becauſe they were of the ſame human nature with themſelves. But then ſhall their bodies be as ſo many lothſome <hi>carcaſes,</hi> which
<q>they ſhall go forth and look upon with abhorrence: yea, they ſhall be an abhorring unto all fleſh,</q>

at one and the ſame thing, namely, the <hi>lothſomneſs</hi> of the wicked, at the reſurrection. They will be lothſome in the eyes of one another, The unclean wretches were never ſo lovely to each other, as then they will be lothſome: dear companions in ſin will then be an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, each one to his fellow: and the wicked, great and honourable men, ſhall be no more regarded by their wicked ſubjects, their ſervants, their ſlaves; than the mire in the ſtreets.</p>

Do but wait a while, and you ſhall ſee it come forth out of the <hi>furnace of earth,</hi> vying with the ſtars in brightneſs; nay, <hi>as the ſun when he goeth forth in his might.</hi> Have you laid your <hi>infant</hi> children in the grave?

                  <p>USE II. Of <hi>terror</hi> to all unregenerate men. Ye who are yet in your natural ſtate, look at this piece of the eternal ſtate; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what will be your part in it, if ye be not in time brought into the ſtate of grace. Think, O ſinner, on that day, when the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall ſound, at the voice of which, the bars of the pit ſhall be broken aſunder, the doors of the grave ſhall fly open, the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depths of the ſea ſhall throw up their dead, the earth caſt forth hers; and death every where in the exceſs of aſtoniſhment, ſhall let go its priſoners; and thy wretched ſoul and body ſhall be re-united, to be ſiſted before the tribunal of God. Then, if thou hadſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds at thy diſpoſal, thou wouldſt gladly give them all away, upon condition thou mighteſt ly ſtill in thy grave, with the hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redth part of that eaſe, wherewith thou haſt ſometimes lain at home, on the Lord's day: or (if that cannot be obtained) that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be but a ſpectator of the tranſactions of that day; as thou haſt been at ſome ſolemn occaſions, and rich goſpel feaſts: or (if even that is not to be purchaſed) that a mountain or a rock might fall on thee, and cover thee from the face of the Lamb. Ah! how are men bewitched, thus to trifle away the precious time of life, in (almoſt) as little concern about death, as if they were like the beaſts that periſh! ſome will be telling where their corpſe muſt be laid; while yet they have not ſeriouſly conſidered, whether their graves ſhall be their beds, where they ſhall awake with joy in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the reſurrection; or their priſons, out of which they ſhall be brought to receive the fearful ſentence. Remember, now is your ſeed-time; and as ye ſow, ye ſhall reap. God's ſeed-time begins at death; and at the reſurrection, the bodies of the wicked, that were ſown <hi>full of ſins, that ly down with them in the duſt,</hi> (Job xx 11.) ſhall ſpring up again, ſinful, wretched, and vile. Your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are now inſtruments of ſin, the Lord will lay aſide for
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:045042_0263_101F7FD89E7F7AD8"/>
the fire, at death; and bring them forth for the fire, at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. That body, which is not now employed in God's ſervice, but is abuſed by uncleanneſs and laſciviouſneſs, will then be brought forth in all its vileneſs, thenceforth to lodge with unclean ſpirits. The body of the drunkard ſhall then ſtagger by reaſon of the wine of the wrath of God, poured out to him, and poured into him, without mixture. Theſe, who now pleaſe themſelves in their revellings, will reel to and fro at another rate; when, inſtead of their ſongs and muſick, they ſhall hear the ſound of the laſt trumpet. Many toil their bodies for worldly gain, who will be loth to diſtreſs them for the benefit of their ſouls; by labour, unreaſonably hard, they will quite disfit them for the ſervice of God; and, when they have done, will reckon it a very good reaſon for ſhifting duty, that they are already tired out with other buſineſs: but the day cometh, when they will be made to abide a yet greater ſtreſs. They will go ſeveral miles for back and belley, who will not go half the way for the good of their immortal ſouls; they will be ſickly and unable on the Lord's day, who will be tolerably well all the reſt of the week. But when that trumpet ſounds, the dead ſhall find their feet, and none ſhall be miſſing in that great congregation. When the bodies of the ſaints ſhine as the ſun, fearful will the looks of their <hi>perſecutors</hi> be. Fearful will their condition be, who ſometimes ſhut up the ſaints in naſty priſons, ſtigmatized, burned them to aſhes, hanged them, and ſtuck up their heads and hands in publick places, to fright others from the ways of righteouſneſs, which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for. Many faces now fair, will then <hi>gather blackneſs.</hi> They ſhall be no more admired and careſſed for that beauty, which has a worm at the root, that will cauſe it to iſſue in lothſomneſs and deformity. Ah! what is that <hi>beauty,</hi> under which there lurks a monſtruous, deformed, and graceleſs heart? What but a ſorry paint, a ſlight varniſh; which will leave the body ſo much the more ugly, before that <hi>flaming-fire,</hi> in which the Judge ſhall be <hi>revealed from heaven, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel,</hi> 2 Theſſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now is the time to ſecure, for yourſelves, a part in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the juſt. The which if ye would do, unite with Jeſus Chriſt by faith, riſing ſpiritually from ſin, and glorifying God with your bodies He is <hi>the reſurrection and the life,</hi> John xi. 25.

Riſe from your ſins: caſt away theſe grave-clothes, putting off your former luſts.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is evident from plain Scripture-teſtimonies. The world has, in all ages been told of it. <hi>Enoch,</hi> before the flood, taught it in his prophecy, related Jude, ver. 14, 15.
<q>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his ſaints, to execute judgment upon all,</q>
&amp;c. <hi>Daniel</hi> deſcribes it, chap. vii. 9, 10.
<q>I beheld till the thrones were caſt down, and the Ancient of days did ſit, whoſe garments was white as ſnow, and the hair of his head like pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him: thouſand thouſands ſtood before him: the judgment was ſet, and the books were opened.</q>
The Apoſtle is very expreſs, Acts xvii. 31.
<q>He hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained.</q>
See Matth xvi. 27. 2 Cor. v. 10. 2 Theſſ. i 7, 8, 9, 10. Rev. xx. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. God has not only ſaid it, but he has ſworn it, Rom. xiv. 10, 11.
<q>We muſt all ſtand before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt: For it is written, As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God.</q>
So that the truth of God is moſt ſolemnly plighted for it.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The rectoral juſtice and goodneſs of God, the ſovereign Ruler of the world, do neceſſarily require it, inaſmuch as they require its being well with the righteous, and ill with the wicked.

embraceth the way of holineſs, muſt, and doth lay his account with the loſs of all he has, which the world can take away from him. Luke xiv. 26.
<q>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple.</q>
But it is conſiſtent with the juſtice and goodneſs of God, that the affairs of men ſhould always cuntinue in this ſtate, which they appear in, from one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another; but that every man be rewarded according to his works: and ſince that is not done in this life, there muſt be a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come:
<q>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence tribulation to them that trouble you: and to you who are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven,</q>
2 Theſſ. i. 6, 7. There will be a day, in which the tables will be turned; and the wicked ſhall be called to an account for all their ſins, and ſuffer the due puniſhment of them; and the pious ſhall be the proſperous; for, as the Apoſtle argues for the happy reſurrection of the ſaints,
<q>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable,</q>
1 Cor xv. 19. It is true, God ſometimes puniſheth the wicked, in this life; that men may know,
<q>he is a God that judgeth in the earth:</q>
but yet much wickedneſs remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, and undiſcovered; to be a <hi>pledge</hi> of the judgment to come. If <hi>none</hi> of the wicked were puniſhed here, they would conclude that God had utterly forſaken the earth; if all of them were puniſhed in this life, men would be apt to think, there is no after-reckoning. Therefore, in the wiſdom of God, ſome are puniſhed now, and ſome not. Sometimes the Lord ſmites ſinners, in the very act of ſin; to ſhew unto the world, that he is witneſs to all their wickedneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will call him to an account for it. Sometimes he delays long, ere he ſtrike; that he may diſcover to the world, that he forgets not men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ill deeds, though he does not preſently puniſh them. Beſides all this, the ſins of many do <hi>out live</hi> them; and the impure fountain, by them opened, runs long after they are dead and gone. As in the caſe of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the firſt king of the ten tribes; whoſe ſin did run on all along unto the end of that unhappy kingdom, 2 Kings xvii. 22.
<q>The children of Iſrael walked in all the ſins of Jeroboam, which he did; they departed not from them: Ver. 23. Until the Lord removed Iſrael out of his ſight.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The reſurrection of Chriſt is a certain proof, that there ſhall be a day of judgment. This argument <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth, to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>He hath given aſſurance to all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead,</q>

He hath, by raiſing Chriſt from the dead, <hi>exhibited his credentials</hi> as Judge of the world. When, in the days of his humiliation, he was ſifted before a tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

and that he himſelf would be the Judge. Matth xxvi. 64.
<q>Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</q>
And now that he was raiſed from the dead, tho' condemned as a blaſphemer on this very head; is it not an undeniable proof, from heaven, of the truth of what he aſſerted? Moreover, this was one of the great ends of Chriſt's death and reſurrection:
<q>For to this end Chriſt both died and roſe, and revived, that he might be the Lord (i.e. <hi>The Lord Judge,</hi> as is evident from the context) both of the dead and of the living,</q>
Rom. xiv. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Every man bears about with him a witneſs to this within his own breaſt, Rom. ii. 15.
<q>Which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</q>
There is a tribunal erected within every man, where conſcience is accuſer, witneſs, and judge, binding over the ſinner to the judgment of God. This fills the moſt profligate wretches with horror, and inwardly ſtings them, upon the commiſſion of ſome atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime; in effect ſummoning them to anſwer for it, before the the Judge of the quick and dead. And this it doth, even when the crime is <hi>ſecret,</hi> and hid from the eyes of the world It reacheth thoſe whom the laws of men cannot reach, becauſe of their power or craft. When men have fled from the judgment of their fellow-creatures; yet, go where they will, <hi>conſcience,</hi> as the ſupreme Judge's officer, ſtill keeps hold of them, reſerving them in its chains to the judgment of the great day. And whether they eſcape puniſhment from men, or fall by the hand of public juſtice, when they perceive death's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, they hear from within, of this after-reckoning; being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to hearken thereto, in theſe the moſt ſerious minutes of their life. If there be ſome, in whom nothing of this doth appear, we have no more ground thence to conclude againſt it, than we have to conclude, that becauſe ſome men do not groan, therefore they have no pain; or that dying is a mere jeſt, becauſe there have been, who have ſeemed to make little elſe of it. A good face may be put upon an ill conſcience: and the more hopeleſs men's caſe is, they reckon it the more their intereſt to make no reflections on their ſtate and caſe. But every one, who will conſult himſelf ſeriouſly, ſhall find in himſelf the witneſs to the judgment to come. Even the heathens wanted not a notion of it, though mixed with fictions of their own. Hence, though ſome of the <hi>Athenians, when they heard of the reſurrection of the dead, mocked,</hi> Acts xvii. 32. yet there is no account of their mocking, when they heard of the <hi>general judgment,</hi> ver 31.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. For explication, the following particulars may ſerve to give ſome view of the nature and tranſactions of that great day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God ſhall judge the world by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>He will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained,</hi> Acts xvii. 31. The Pſalmiſt tells us, that <hi>God is judge himſelf,</hi> Pſal. I. 6.

<q>As it was in the days of Noah, ſo alſo ſhall it be in days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark: and the flood came and deſtroyed them all. Likewiſe alſo as it was in the days of Lot: they did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded.—Even thus ſhall it be in the day, when the Son of man is revealed.</q>
Luke xvii. 26, 27, 28, 30.

But the Judge cometh! the markets are marred; the buyer throws away what he has bought; the ſeller caſts down his money: they are raiſed from the table, and their mirth is extinguiſhed in a moment; tho' the tree be ſet in the earth, the gardner may not ſtay to caſt the earth about it; the workmen throw away their tools, when the houſe is half built, and the owner regards it no more; the bridegroom, bride, and gueſts muſt leave the wedding-feaſt, and appear before the tribunal: for, <hi>Behold he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels,</hi> Mark viii. 38. When he came in the fleſh, to die for ſinners, he laid aſide the robes of his glory, and was deſpiſed and rejected of men: but when he comes again, to judge the world, ſuch ſhall be his viſible glory and majeſty, that it ſhall caſt an eternal vail over all earthly glory, and fill his greateſt enemies with fear and dread. Never had prince, or poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the world, ſuch a glorious train, as will accompany this Judge: all the holy angels ſhall come with him, for his honour and ſervice. Then he, who was led to the croſs with a band of ſoldiers, will be gloriouſly attended to the place of judgment, by <hi>(not a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the heavenly hoſt,</hi> but) the whole hoſt of angels; <hi>all his holy angels,</hi> ſay the text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> At the coming of the Judge, the <hi>ſummons</hi> are given to the parties, by the ſound of the laſt trumpet; at which the dead are raiſed, and theſe found alive changed; of which before, 1 Theſſ. iv. 16, 17. O loud trumpet, that ſhall be heard at once, in all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth, and of the ſea? O wonderful voice, that will not only diſturb thoſe who ſleep in the duſt; but effectually awaken, rouze them out of their ſleep, and raiſe them from death! Were trumpets ſounding now, drums beating, furious ſoldiers crying and killing men, women and children running and ſhrieking, the wounded groaning and dying; thoſe who are in the graves, would have no more diſturbance, than if the world were in moſt profound peace. Yea, were ſtormy winds caſting down the lofty oaks, the the ſeas roaring and ſwallowing up the ſhips, the moſt dreadful thunders going along the heavens, lightnings every-where flaſhing, the earth quaking, trembling, opening, and ſwallowing up whole cities, and burying multitudes at once; the dead would ſtill enjoy a perfect repoſe, and ſleep ſoundly in the duſt; though their own duſt ſhould be thrown out of its place. But at the ſound of this trumpet they ſhall all awake. The morning is come, they can ſleep no longer; the time of the dead, that they muſt be judged: they muſt get out of their graves, and appear before the Judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Judge ſhall ſit down on the <hi>tribunal;</hi> he <hi>ſhall ſit on the throne of his glory.</hi> Sometime he ſtood before a tribunal on earth, and was condemned as a malefactor: then ſhall he ſit on his own tribunal, and judge the world. Sometime he hung upon the croſs, covered with ſhame: then he ſhall ſit on a throne of glory. What this <hi>throne</hi> ſhall be, whether a bright cloud, or what elſe, I ſhall not inquire. Our eyes will give an anſwer to that queſtion at length. John <hi>ſaw a great white throne,</hi> Rev. xx. 11. <hi>His throne</hi> (ſays <hi>Daniel) was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire,</hi> chap. vii. 9. Whatever it be, doubtleſs it ſhall be a throne <hi>glorious</hi> beyond expreſſion; and, in compariſon with which, the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous throne on the earth is but a ſeat on a dunghill; and the ſight of it will equally ſurpriſe kings, who ſit on thrones in this life, and beggars, who ſat in dunghills.

and glory, ſuited to the quality of him who ſhall ſit on it Never had a judge ſuch a throne, and never had a throne ſuch a judge on it.</p>
                  <p>Leaving the diſcovery of the nature of the throne until <hi>that day,</hi> it concerns us more nearly to conſider what a <hi>Judge</hi> will ſit upon it; a point in which we are not left to uncertain conj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That very body which was crucified without the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> betwixt two thieves, ſhall then be ſeen on the throne, ſhining in glory. We now ſee him ſymbolically in the ſacrament of his ſupper: the ſaints ſee him by the eye of faith: then, all ſhall ſee him with theſe eyes now in their heads. (2) <hi>A Judge having full authority and power,</hi> to render unto every one according to his works. Chriſt, as God, hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of himſelf; and as Mediator, he hath a judicial power and authority, which his Father has inveſted him with, according to the covenant betwixt the Father and the Son, for the redemption of ſinners. And his divine glory will be a light, by which all men ſhall ſee clearly to read his commiſſion for this great and honourable employment. <hi>All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth,</hi> Matth. xxviii 18. He hath <hi>the keys of hell and of death,</hi> Rev. i. 18. There can be no appeal from his tribunal: ſentence once, paſt there, muſt ſtand for ever; there is no reverſing of it. All appeals are from an inferior court to a ſuperior one; but when God gives ſentence againſt a man, where can he find a higher court to bring his proceſs too? This judgment is the Mediator's judgment; and therefore the <hi>laſt</hi> judgment. If the Interceſſor be againſt us, who can be for us? If Chriſt condemn us, who will abſolve us?

the poor; but juſt judgment ſhall go forth in every one's cauſe. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> An <hi>omnipotent Judge,</hi> able to put his ſentence in execution. The united force of devils and wicked men will be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to withſtand him. They cannot retard the execution of the ſentence againſt them, one moment; far leſs can they ſtop it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Thouſand thouſands</hi> (of angels) <hi>miniſter unto him,</hi> Dan. vii. 10. And, by the breath of his mouth, he can drive the curſed herd whither he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The parties ſhall <hi>compear.</hi> Theſe are <hi>men</hi> and <hi>devils.</hi> Although theſe laſt, the fallen angels, were, from the firſt moment of their ſinning, ſubjected to the wrath of God, and were <hi>caſt down to hell;</hi> and whereſoever they go, they carry their hell about with them: yet, it is evident, that they are <hi>reſerved unto judgment,</hi> (2 Pet. ii. 14.) namely, <hi>unto the judgment of the great day,</hi> Jude 6. And then they ſhall be ſolemnly and publickly judged, 1 Cor vi. 3. <hi>Know ye not that we ſhall judge angels?</hi> At that day they ſhall anſwer for their trade of ſinning and tempting to ſin, which they have been carrying on <hi>from the beginning.</hi> Then many a helliſh brat, which Satan has laid down at the ſaints door, but not adopted by them, ſhall be laid at the door of the true father of it, that is, the devil. And he ſhall receive the due reward of all the diſhonour he has done to God, and of all the miſchief he has done to men. Thoſe wicked ſpirits now <hi>in chains</hi> (though not in ſuch ſtrait cuſtody, but that they go about like roaring lions, ſeeking whom they may devour) ſhall then receive their final ſentence, and be ſhut up in their den, namely, in the priſon of hell; where they ſhall be held in extreme and unſpeakable torment through all eternity, Rev.xx. 10.
<q>And the devil that decieved them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe prophet are, and ſhall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</q>
In proſpect of which, the devils ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</hi> Matth. viii. 29.</p>
                  <p>But what we are chiefly concerned to take notice of, is the caſe of <hi>men</hi> at that day. All men muſt compear before this tribunal. All of each ſex, and of every age, quality and condition; the great and ſmall, noble and ignoble; none are excepted. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> with all their ſons and daughters; every one who has had, or, to the end of the world, ſhall have a living ſoul united to a body; will make up this great congregation. Even thoſe, who refuſed to come to the throne of grace, ſhall be forced to the bar of <hi>juſtice:</hi> for there can be no <hi>hiding</hi> from the all-ſeeing Judge, no <hi>flying</hi> from him who is preſent every-where, no <hi>reſiſting</hi> of him who is armed with almighty power. <hi>We muſt all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor v. 10. <hi>Before him ſhall be gathered all nations,</hi> ſays the text. This is to be done by the miniſtry of angels. By them ſhall the elect be gathered, Mark xiii. 27.
<q>Then ſhall he ſend his angels, and ſhall gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his elect from the four winds.</q>
And they alſo ſhall gather the reprobate, Matth. xiii. 40, 41
<q>So ſhall it be in the end of this
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:045042_0272_101F7FF8674A45F8"/>
world, The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.</q>
From all corners of the world ſhall the inhabitants thereof be gathered into the place where he ſhall ſet his throne for judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There ſhall be a <hi>ſeparation</hi> made betwixt the righteous and the wicked; the fair company of the elect ſheep being ſet on Chriſt's right hand, and the reprobate goats on his left. There is no neceſſity to wait for this ſeparation, till the trial be over; ſince the parties do riſe out of their graves, with plain outward marks of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as was cleared before The ſeparation ſeems to be effected by that double gathering before mentioned; the one of the <hi>elect,</hi> Mark xiii. 27. the other of <hi>them that do iniquity,</hi> Matth. xiii. 41. The elect, being <hi>caught up together in the clouds, meet the Lord in the air,</hi> (1 Theſſ iv. 17.) and ſo are ſet on his right hand: and the reprobate <hi>left</hi> on the earth (Matth. xxv. 40) upon the Judge's left hand Here is now a total ſeparation of two parties, who were always oppoſite to each other, in their principles, aims, and manner of life; who, when together, were a burden the one to the other, under which the one groaned, and the other raged: but now they are freely parted, never to come together any more. The <hi>iron</hi> and <hi>clay (allude to Daniel</hi> ii. 41, 43.) which could never <hi>mix,</hi> are quite ſeparated: the one being drawn up into the air, by the attractive virtue of <hi>the ſtone cut out of the mountain,</hi> namely, Jeſus Chriſt: the other left upon its earth, to be trod under foot.</p>
                  <p>Now let us look to the right hand, and there we will ſee a glorious company of ſaints, ſhining as ſo many ſtars in their orbs: and with a chearful countenance beholding him, who ſitteth upon the throne. Here will be two wonderful ſights, which the world uſed not to ſee. (1.) <hi>A great congregation of ſaints, in which not ſo much as one hypocrite,</hi> There was a bloody <hi>Cain</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s family, a curſed <hi>Ham</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi>'s family, in the ark; a treacherous <hi>Judas,</hi> in Chriſt's own family: but in that company ſhall be none but ſealed ones, members of Chriſt, having all one Father. And this is a ſight reſerved for that day. (2.) <hi>All the godly upon one ſide.</hi> Seldom or never do the ſaints on earth make ſuch a harmony, but there are ſome jarring ſtrings among them. It is not to be expected, that men who ſee but in part, though they be all going to one city, will agree as to every ſtep in the way: no, we need not look for it in this ſtate of imperfection. But at that day, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhall meet in peace and unity, though once <hi>the contention was ſo ſharp between them, that they departed aſunder, the one from the other.</hi> Acts xv. 39. There ſhall be no more diviſions, no more ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtanding, amongſt thoſe who belong to Chriſt. All the godly of the different parties ſhall then be upon one ſide; ſeeing, whatever were their differences in leſſer things, while in the world, yet, even then, they met and concentred all in <hi>one Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and lively <hi>faith,</hi> and in the one way of <hi>holineſs or</hi> practical godlineſs.
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:045042_0273_101F7FFE29434B20"/>
And the naughty hypocrites, of whatſoever party, ſhall be <hi>led forth with the workers of iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look to the <hi>left hand,</hi> and there you will ſee the curſed <hi>goats</hi> (all the wicked ones from <hi>Cain</hi> to the laſt ungodly perſon, who ſhall be in the world) gathered together into one moſt miſerable congregation. There are <hi>many</hi> aſſemblies of the wicked now: then there ſhall be but <hi>one.</hi> But all of them ſhall be preſent there, brought together as one herd for the ſlaughter, bellowing and roaring. weeping and howling for the miſeries come, and that are coming to them. (And remember thou ſhalt not be a mere ſpectator, to look at theſe two ſo different companies; but muſt thyſelf take thy place in one of the two, and ſhalt ſhare with the company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatever hand it be upon.) Theſe who now abhor no ſociety ſo much, as that of the ſaints, would then be glad to be allowed to get in among them, though it were but to ly among their feet. But then not one <hi>tare</hi> ſhall be found with the <hi>wheat; he will throughly purge his floor.</hi> Many of the right hand men of this world will be left-hand men in that day. Many, who muſt have the door and the right hand of theſe, who are <hi>better</hi> than they, (if <hi>the righteous</hi> be <hi>more excellent than his neighbour</hi>) ſhall then be turned to the <hi>left hand,</hi> as moſt deſpicable wretches O how terrible will this <hi>ſeparation</hi> be to the ungodly! how dreadful will this <hi>gathering</hi> them together into one company be! what they will not believe, they will then ſee, namely, that but <hi>few are ſaved.</hi> They think it enough now, to be neighbour like, and can ſecurely follow the multitude: but the <hi>multitude</hi> on the left hand will yield them no comfort How will it ſting the ungodly Chriſtian, to ſee himſelf ſet on the ſame hand with Turks and Pagans! how will it gall men to find themſelves ſtanding, profane Proteſtants with idolatrous Papiſts; praying people with their profane neighbours who mocked at religious exerciſes: formal profeſſors ſtrangers to the new-birth and the power of godlineſs, with perſecutors! now there are many oppoſite ſocieties in the world, but then all the ungodly ſhall be in one ſociety. And how dreadful will the faces of companions in ſin be to one another there! what doleful ſhrieks, when the whoremonger and his whore ſhall meet; when the drunkards, who have had many a jovial day together, ſhall ſee one another in the face: when the huſband and wife, the parents and children, the maſter and ſervants and neighbours, who have been ſhares and ſtumbling-blocks to one another, to the ruin of their own ſouls, and theſe of their relatives, ſhall meet again in that miſerable ſociety! Then will there be curſes inſtead of ſalutations; and tearing of themſelves, and raging againſt one another, inſtead of the wonted embraces</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The parties ſhall be <hi>tried.</hi> The <hi>trial</hi> cannot be difficult, in regard the Judge is <hi>omniſcient,</hi> and nothing can be hid from him. But, that his righteous judgment may be made evident to all, he will ſet <hi>the hidden things of darkneſs</hi> in cleareſt light at that trial, 1 Cor iv. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="unknown:045042_0274_101F7FFFAAFDFB40"/>Men ſhall be tried, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon their <hi>works:</hi> for
<q>God ſhall bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil,</q>
Eccleſ. xii 14. The Judge will try every man's converſation, and ſet his deeds, done in the body, with all the circumſtances thereof, in a true light. Then will many actions, commended and applauded of men, as good and juſt, be diſcovered to have been evil and abominable, in the ſight of God: and many works, now condemned by the world, will be approven and commended by the great Judge, as good and juſt. Secret things will be brought to light: and what was hid from the view of the world, ſhall be laid open. Wickedneſs, which hath kept its lurking-place in ſpite of all human ſearch, will then be brought forth to the glory of God, and the confuſion of impenitent ſinners who hid it. The world appears now very vile, in the eyes of thoſe who are exerciſed to godlineſs: but it will then appear a thouſand times more vile, when that, which is <hi>done</hi> of men <hi>in ſecret,</hi> comes to be diſcovered. Every good action ſhall then be remembred; and the hidden religion and good works, moſt induſtriouſly concealed by the ſaints, from the eyes of men, ſhall no more ly hid: for though the Lord will not allow men to <hi>proclaim every man his own goodneſs;</hi> yet he himſelf will do it in due time. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their <hi>words</hi> ſhall be judged, Matth. xii. 37.
<q>For by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</q>
Not a word ſpoken for God, and his cauſe in the world, from love to himſelf, ſhall be forgotten. They are all kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and ſhall be brought forth as evidences of faith, and of an intereſt in Chriſt, Mal. iii. 16.
<q>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkned and heard it: and a book of remembrance was written before him. Ver. 17. And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, in that day when I make up my jewels.</q>
And the tongue, which did run at random, ſhall then confeſs to God: and the ſpeaker ſhall find it to have been followed, and every word noted that dropped from his unſancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied lips.
<q>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of judgment,</q>
Matth. xii. 36. And if they ſhall give account of <hi>idle words,</hi> that is, words ſpoken to no good purpoſe, neither to God's glory, one's own, or one's neighbour's good: how much more ſhall men's <hi>wicked words,</hi> their ſinful oaths, curſes, lies, filthy communications, and bitter words be called over again, that day? The <hi>tongues</hi> of many ſhall then <hi>fall upon themſelves,</hi> and ruin them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Men's <hi>thoughts</hi> ſhall be brought into judgment: the Judge "will make manifeſt the counſel of the hearts," 1 Cor. iv. 5. Thoughts go free from man's judgment, but not from the judgment of the heart-ſearching God, who knows men's thoughts, without the help of ſigns to diſcern them by. The ſecret ſprings of men's actions will then be brought to light; and the ſins, that never came further than the heart, will then be laid open. O what a figure will man's corrupt nature make, when his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If it was in their hearts <hi>to build a houſe to the Lord,</hi> they ſhall hear, that <hi>they did well that it was in their heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This trial will be righteous and impartial, accurate and ſearching, clear and evident. The Judge is <hi>the righteous Judge,</hi> and he will do <hi>right</hi> to every one. He has a juſt balance for good and evil actions, and for honeſt and falſe hearts. The fig-leave cover of hypocriſy will then be <hi>blown</hi> aſide, and the hypocrite's nakedneſs will appear; as when the Lord came to judge <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, in the cool</hi> (or, as the word is, <hi>in the wind</hi>) <hi>of the day,</hi> Gen. iii.8. <hi>The fire</hi> (which tries things moſt exquiſitely) <hi>ſhall try every man's work, of what ſort it is,</hi> 1 Cor. iii 13. Man's judgment is oft-times perplexed and confuſed; but here the whole proceſs ſhall be clear and evident, as written with a ſun-beam. It ſhall be clear to the <hi>Judge,</hi> to whom no caſe can be intricate; to the <hi>parties,</hi> who ſhall be <hi>convinced,</hi> Jude 15. And the multitudes on both ſides, ſhall ſee the judge is clear when he judgeth: for then <hi>the heavens ſhall declare his righteouſneſs,</hi> in the audience of all the world; and ſo it ſhall be univerſally known, Pſal. l. 6.</p>
                  <p>On theſe accounts it is, that this <hi>trial</hi> is held out in the ſcripture under the notion of <hi>opening of books;</hi> and men are ſaid to be <hi>judged out of thoſe things written in the books,</hi> Rev. xx 12. The Judge of the world, who infallibly knoweth all things, hath no need of <hi>books</hi> to be laid before him, to prevent miſtake in any point of law or fact: but the expreſſion points at his proceeding, as moſt nice, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, juſt, and well grounded, in every ſtep of it. Now, there are four <hi>books</hi> that ſhall be opened in that day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The book of God's <hi>remembrance</hi> or omniſcience, Mal. iii. 19. This is an exact record of every man's ſtate, thoughts, words, and deeds, good or evil: it is, as it were, a day-book, in which the Lord puts down all that paſſeth in mens hearts, lips, and lives, and it is a-filling up every day that one lives. In it are recorded mens ſins and good works, ſecret and open, with all their circumſtances. Here are regiſtred all their privileges, mercies temporal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, ſome-time laid to their hand; the checks, admonitions, and rebukes, given by teachers, neighbours, afflictions, and mens own conſciences; every thing in its due order. This book will ſerve only as a libel in reſpect of the ungodly; but it will be for another uſe in reſpect of godly, namely, for a <hi>memorial</hi> of their good. The opening of it is the Judge's bringing to light what is written in it; the reading as it were, of the libel and memorial, reſpectively, in their hearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The book of <hi>conſcience</hi> will be opened, and ſhall be at a thouſand witneſſes to prove the fact, Rom. ii. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Which ſhew the
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:045042_0276_101F800549E23A48"/>
work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs.</hi> Conſcience is a cenſor going with every man whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goes, taking an account of his deeds done in the body, and, as it were noting them in a book; the which being opened, will be found a double of the former, ſo far as it relates to one's own ſtate and caſe Much is written in it, which cannot be read now; the writing of conſcience being in many caſes, like to that which is made with the juice of lemons, not to be read, till it be held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire: but <hi>then</hi> men ſhall read it clearly and diſtinctly: the fire which is to try every man's work, will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke the book of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience legible in every point. Tho' the book be ſealed now (the conſcience blind, dumb and deaf) the ſeals will then be broken, and the book opened. There ſhall be no more a weak or miſinformed conſcience among thoſe on the right hand, or theſe on the left. There ſhall not be a <hi>ſilent</hi> conſcience, and far leſs a <hi>ſcared</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence amongſt all the ungodly crew: but their conſciences ſhall be moſt quick-ſighted, and moſt lively, in that day. None ſhall then call good evil, or evil good. Ignorance of what <hi>ſin</hi> is, and what things are <hi>ſins,</hi> will have no place among them: and the ſubtle reaſonings of men, in favour of their luſts, will then be for ever baffled by their own conſciences. None ſhall have the favour (if I may ſo ſpeak) of lying under the ſoft cover of deluſion: but they ſhall all be <hi>convicted by their conſcience.</hi> Nill they, will they, they ſhall look on this book, read and be confounded, and <hi>ſtand ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> knowing that nothing is charged upon them by miſtake; ſince this is a book, which was always in their own cuſtody. Thus ſhall the Judge make every man ſee himſelf, in the glaſs of his own <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> which will make quick work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The book of <hi>the Law</hi> ſhall be opened. This book is the ſtandard and rule, by which is known what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> right, and what is wrong; as alſo, what ſentence is to be paſſed accordinly, on theſe who are under it. As to the opening of this book, in its <hi>ſtatutory</hi> part, which ſhews what is ſin, and what is duty; it falls in with the opening of the book of conſcience. For conſcience is ſet, by the Sovereign Lawgiver, in every man's breaſt, to be his private teacher, to ſhew him the law, and his private paſtor, to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the ſame; and, at that day, it will be perfectly fit for its office; ſo that the conſcience, which is moſt ſtupid now, ſhall then read to the man, moſt accurate, but dreadful lectures, on the law. But what ſeems (mainly at leaſt) pointed at, by the opening of this book, is the opening of that part of it, which determines the reward of mens works. Now, the law promiſeth life, upon perfect obedience: but none can be found on the right hand, or on the left, who will pretend to that, when once the book of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is opened, it threatneth death upon diſobedience, and will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually bring it upon all under its dominion. And this part of the book of the law, determining the reward of mens works, is
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:045042_0277_101F800B14940548"/>
opened, only to ſhew what muſt be the portion of the ungodly, and that there they may read their ſentence before it be pronounced. But it is not opened for the ſentence of the ſaints; for no ſentence ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving a ſinner could ever be drawn out of it. The law promiſeth life, not as it is a rule of actions, but as a covenant of works: And therefore innocent man could not have demanded life upon his obedience, till the law was reduced into the form of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; as was ſhewn before. But the ſaints having been, in this life, brought under a new covenant, namely, the covenant of grace, were <hi>dead to the law,</hi> as a covenant of works, and it was dead to them. Wherefore, as they ſhall not have any fears of death from it, ſo they can have no hopes of life from it, ſince <hi>they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. vi. 14 But, for their ſentence, <hi>another book is opened;</hi> of which in the next place.</p>
                  <p>Thus the book of the law is opened, for the ſentence againſt all thoſe on the left hand: and by it they will clearly ſee the juſtice of the judgment againſt them, and how the Judge proceeds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in according to <hi>law.</hi> Nevertheleſs, there will be this difference, namely, that theſe who had only the <hi>natural law,</hi> and lived not under any ſpecial revelation, ſhall be judged by that law of nature they had in their hearts: which law bears, <hi>that they who commit ſuch things</hi> (as they will ſtand convicted of) <hi>are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. i. 32. But theſe, who had the <hi>written law,</hi> to whom the word of God came, as it has ſounded in the viſible church, ſhall be judged by that written law. So ſays the Apoſtle, Rom. ii. 12. <hi>For as many as have ſinned without</hi> (the written) <hi>law, ſhall periſh without</hi> (the written) <hi>law: and as many as have ſinned in the law (i e.</hi> under the written law) <hi>ſhall be judged by the</hi> (written) <hi>law.</hi>

                     <hi>Laſtly, Another book</hi> ſhall be <hi>opened, which is the book of life,</hi> Rev. xx. 12. In this, the names of all the elect are written, as Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, Luke x. 20 <hi>Your names are written in heaven.</hi> This book contains God's gracious and unchangeable purpoſe, to bring all the elect to eteral life; and that, in order thereto, they be redeemed by the blood of his Son, effectually called, juſtified, adopted, ſanctified, and raiſed up by him at the laſt day without ſin. It is now lodged in the Mediator's hand, as the book of <hi>the manner of the kingdom;</hi> and having perfected the work the Father gave them to do; he ſhall, on the great day produce, and open the book, and <hi>preſent</hi> the perſons therein named, <hi>faultleſs before the preſence of his glory,</hi> Jude 24. <hi>Not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> Eph. v. 27. None of them all, who are named in the book, ſhall be miſſing. They ſhall be found qualified, according to the order of the book, redeemed, called, juſtified, ſanctified, raiſed up without ſpot: what remains then, but that, according to the ſame book, they obtain the great end, namely, everlaſting life. This may be gathered from that precious promiſe, Rev. iii. 5.
<q>He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be clothed in white raiment,
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:045042_0278_101F800CBB04BFD8"/>
(being raiſed in glory) and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life. But I will confeſs his name (it ſhall be, as it were, read out among the reſt of God's elect) before my Father, and before his angels.</q>
Here is now the ground of the ſaints' abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viture, the ground of the bleſſed ſentence they ſhall receive The book of life being opened, it will be known to all, who are elected, and who are not. Thus far of the <hi>trial</hi> of the parties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eightly,</hi> Then ſhall the Judge pronounce that bleſſed <hi>ſentence</hi> on the ſaints,
<q>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</q>
Matth xxv 34. It is moſt probable, the Man CHRIST will pronounce it with an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voice; which not only all the ſaints, but all the wicked likewiſe, ſhall hear and underſtand. Who can conceive the inexpreſſible joy, with which theſe happy ones ſhall hear theſe words? Who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that fulneſs of joy, which ſhall be poured into their hearts, with theſe words reaching their ears? And who can conceive how much of hell ſhall break into the hearts of all the ungodly crew, by theſe words of heaven? It is certain this ſentence ſhall be pronounced before the ſentence of damnation, Matth. xxv. 34.
<q>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Ver 41. Then ſhall he ſay alſo to them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, &amp;c.</q>
There is no need of this order, that the ſaints may, without fear or aſtoniſhment, hear the other ſentence on the reprobate: they who are raiſed in glory, caught up to meet the Lord in the air, preſented without ſpot, and whoſe ſouls (for the far greater part of them) have been ſo long in heaven before, ſhall not be capable of any ſuch <hi>fear.</hi> But hereby they will be orderly brought in, to ſit in judgment, as Chriſt's <hi>aſſeſſors,</hi> againſt the ungodly: whoſe torment will be aggravated by it. It will be a hell to them, to be kept out of hell, till they ſee the doors of heaven opened to receive the ſaints, who once dwelt in the ſame world with them; and perhaps in the ſame country, pariſh, or town, and ſat under the ſame miniſtry with themſelves. Thus will they ſee heaven afar off, to make their hell the hotter. Like that unbelieving lord, 2 Kings vii. 19, 20. They "ſhall ſee the plenty with their eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhall not eat thereof." Every word of the bleſſed ſentence ſhall be like an envenomed arrow ſhot into their hearts, while they ſee what they have loſt, and from thence gather what they are to expect</p>
                  <p>This ſentence paſſeth on the ſaints <hi>according to their works,</hi> Rev xx 12 But not <hi>for</hi> their <hi>works,</hi> nor <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The kingdom they are called to, was "prepared for them, from the foundation of the world;" not left to be merited by themſelves, who were but <hi>of yeſterday.</hi> They <hi>inherit</hi> it as <hi>ſons,</hi> but procure it not to themſelves, as <hi>ſervants</hi> do the reward of their work. They were redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, and clothed with his ſpotleſs righteouſneſs, which is the proper cauſe of the ſentence.
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:045042_0279_101F800FB2B78158"/>
They were alſo qualified for heaven, by the ſanctification of his Spirit; and hence it is <hi>according to their works;</hi> ſo that the ungodly world ſhall ſee now, that the Judge of the quick and dead does <hi>good</hi> to them who were <hi>good.</hi> Therefore it is added to the ſentence,
<q>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat, &amp;c.</q>
Ver. 35, 36. which doth not denote the <hi>ground,</hi> but the <hi>evidence</hi> of their right to heaven; as if a judge ſhould ſay, he abſolves a man purſued for debt; <hi>for the witneſſes depone. that it is paid already.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſays, 1 Cor x. 5. "But with many of them God was not well pleaſed, for they were overthrown in the wilderneſs." Their overthrow in the wilderneſs was not the ground of God's diſpleaſure with them, but it was an evidence of it. And thus our Lord teacheth us the neceſſary <hi>connexion</hi> betwixt <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>good works,</hi> namely, works <hi>evangelically</hi> good; works having a reſpect to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and done out of <hi>faith</hi> in him, and <hi>love</hi> to him, without which they will not be regarded in that day And the ſaints will ſo far be judged <hi>according</hi> to <hi>ſuch</hi> works, that the degrees of glory amongſt them ſhall be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe works: for it is an eternal truth,
<q>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly,</q>
2 Cor. ix. 6.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſhall the <hi>good works</hi> of the godly have a glorious, not a gratuitous reward; a reward of grace, not of debt, which will fill them with wonder at the riches of free grace, and the Lord's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to take any notice, eſpecially ſuch public notice, of their poor worthleſs works.

And may they not juſtly wonder to ſee themſelves ſet down to the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb, in conſequence of a dinner or ſupper, a little meat or drink (ſuch as they had) which they gave to an hungry or thirſty member of Chriſt, for his ſake?

But it is Chriſt's ſtamp on good works, that puts a value on them, in the eye of a gracious God; which ſeems to be the import of our Lord's reply, ver. 40.

This was not fulfilled, when the empire became Chriſtian, and Chriſtians were made magiſtrates. No, the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>This hooour have all the ſaints,</hi> Pſal cxlix. 9. And the Apoſtle in the forecited place, adds,
<q>And if the world ſhall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the ſmalleſt matters? Ver. 3. Know ye not that we ſhall judge angels?</q>
Being called, they <hi>come</hi> to receive their kingdom, in the view of angels and men: they go, as it were, from the bar to the throne,
<q>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, will I grant to ſit with me on my throne,</q>
Rev iii 21. They ſhall not only judge the world, in Chriſt their head, by way of <hi>communion</hi> with him; by their works <hi>compared</hi> with theſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; or, by way of <hi>teſtimony</hi> againſt them: but they ſhall be <hi>aſſeſſors</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt the Judge, giving their voice againſt them, conſenting to his judgment as juſt, and ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> to the doom pronounced againſt all the ungodly: as is ſaid of the ſaints, upon the judgment of the great whore, Rev. xix. 1, 2.
<q>Hallelujah, for true and righteous are his judgments.</q>
Thus
<q>the upright ſhall have dominion over them, in the morning,</q>
of the reſurrection Pſal. xlix. 14. Then, and not till then, ſhall that fully be accompliſhed, which ye may read, Pſal. cxlix. 6, 7, 8, 9.
<q>Let the high praiſes of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged ſword in their hand, to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and puniſhments upon the people,—this honour have all his ſaints.</q>
O! what a ſtrange turn of affairs, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear here. what an aſtoniſhing ſight will it be, to ſee wicked church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſtateſmen ſtanding as criminals before the ſaints, whom ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they condemned as hereticks, rebels and traitors! to ſee men of riches and power ſtand pale-faced before theſe whom they oppreſſed! to ſee the mocker ſtand trembling before theſe he mocked: the worldly-wiſe man before theſe whom he accounted fools! then ſhall the deſpiſed faces of the ſaints be dreadful faces to the wicked: and thoſe who ſometimes were <hi>the ſong of the drunkards,</hi> ſhall then be a terror to them All wrongs muſt be righted at length, and every one ſet in his proper place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tenthly,</hi> The Judge ſhall pronounce the ſentence of <hi>damnation</hi> on all the ungodly multitude.
<q>Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,</q>
ver. 41. Fearful doom! and that from the ſame mouth, from whence proceeded the ſentence of abſolution before.

And this ſentence alſo, we ſuppoſe, ſhall be pronounced with an audible voice, by the man Chriſt. And all the ſaints ſhall ſay,
<q>Hallelujah, true and righteous are his judgments.</q>
None were ſo compaſſionate as the ſaints, when on earth, during the time of God's patience. But now that time is at an end; their compaſſion on the ungodly is ſwallowed up in joy, in the Mediator's glory, and his executing of juſt judgment, by which his enemies are made his footſtool. Though ſometimes the righteous man did weep in ſecret places for their pride, and becauſe they would not hear; yet then he

Ver. 45. O meat and drink unhappily ſpared, when a member of Chriſt was in need of it! O wretched neglect, that the ſtranger ſaint was not taken in! it had been better for them, they had quitted their own room, and their own bed, than he had wanted lodging. O curſed cloathing, may the wicked ſay, that was in my houſe, locked up in my cheſt, or hanging in my wardrobe, and was not brought out to clothe ſuch a one! O that I had ſtripped myſelf, rather than he had gone away without cloathing? Curſed buſineſs, that diverted me from <hi>viſiting</hi> ſuch a ſick ſaint? O that I had rather watched whole nights with him. Wretch that I was! why did I ſit at eaſe in my houſe, when he was in <hi>priſon,</hi> and did not viſit him? But now the tables are turned: Chriſt's ſervants <hi>ſhall eat,</hi> but I ſhall be hungry; his ſervants <hi>ſhall drink,</hi> but I ſhall be thirſty; they <hi>rejoice,</hi> but I am aſhamed, Iſa. lxv 13.

                  <p>But if our Lord thus reſents men's neglecting to help his people under theſe, and the like diſtreſſes; what may they expect, who are the authors and inſtruments of them? If they ſhall be fed with wrath, who fed them not, when they were hungry; what ſhall become of thoſe, who <hi>robbed</hi> and <hi>ſpoiled</hi> them, and took their own bread away from them? What a full cup of wrath ſhall be the portion of thoſe who were ſo far from <hi>giving</hi> them meat or drink, when hungry or thirſty, that they made it a <hi>crime</hi> for others to entertain them, and made themſelves <hi>drunken with their blood!</hi> they muſt lodge with devils for ever-more, who took not in the Lord's people, when ſtrangers: then, what a lodging ſhall thoſe have, who drave them out of their own houſes, out of their native land, and <hi>mad</hi> them ſtrangers? Men will be condemned for not cloathing them, when naked: then, how heavy muſt the ſentence of thoſe be, who have ſtript them, and made them go without cloathing? Surely, if not viſiting of them in ſickneſs, or in a priſon, ſhall be ſo ſeverely puniſhed; they ſhall not eſcape a moſt heavy doom who have caſt them into priſons, and have put them under ſuch hardſhips, as have impaired their health, brought ſickneſs on them, and cut their days in priſon, or out of priſon.</p>
                  <p>To put a face upon ſuch wicked practices, men will pretend to retain an honour for Chriſt and religion, while they thus treat his members, walking in his ways, and keeping the truth. They are here repreſented to ſay,

The original word is the ſame in both texts, the which, being compared, ſeem to ſay, that theſe creatures abuſed by the wicked, being left to ſtand, as witneſſes againſt them in the judgment, are, after ſentence paſt on their abuſers, made to paſs away with them <hi>from the face</hi> of the Judge. It is true, <hi>the fleeing away</hi> of the earth and heaven is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated (Rev. xx. 11.) before the judgment: but that will not prove its going before the judgment, ver. 12. before the reſurrection, ver. 13. will prove the judgment to be <hi>before</hi> it. Further, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in the execution of the ſentence Rev. xx. 14, 15. that not only the reprobate are <hi>caſt into the lake,</hi> but <hi>death and hell</hi> are caſt into it likewiſe: all effects of ſin, and of the curſe, are removed out of the world, (for which very cauſe ſhall the conflagration be) and they are confined to the place of the damned Beſides all this, it is evident the end of the world is by the conflagration: and the Apoſtle tells us, (1 Cor. xv. 24, 25.) that
<q>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father: when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For he muſt reign, till he hath put all enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.</q>
The which laſt, as it muſt be done before the end: ſo it ſeems not to be done, but by putting the ſentence in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, paſt in the day of judgment, againſt the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Now if the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gommorrah,</hi> that are <hi>ſet forth for an example,</hi> (Jude 7.) was ſo dreadful: how terrible will that day, be, when the whole world ſhall be at once in flames! how will wretched worldlings look, when their darling world ſhall be all on fire? Then ſhall ſtrong caſtles, and towering palaces, with all their rich furniture, go up together in one flame with the loweſt cottages. What heart can fully conceive the terror of that day to the wicked, when the whole fabric of heaven and earth ſhall at once be diſſolved by that fire! when that miſerable company ſhall be driven from the tribunal to the pit, with fire within them, and fire without them; and fire behind them, and on every hand of them; and fire before them, awaiting them in the lake: whither this fire (for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) may follow them!</p>
                  <p>As for the particular <hi>place</hi> of this judgment, though ſome point as to the valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> for it, yet our Lord, who infallibly
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:045042_0285_101F8026246492F8"/>
knew it, being aſked the queſtion by his diſciples, <hi>where Lord?</hi> told them only,
<q>Whereſoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together,</q>
Luke xvii. 37. After which anſwer, it is too much for men to renew the queſtion. As for the time when it ſhall be; in vain do men ſearch for what the Lord has purpoſely kept ſecret, Acts i. 8.
<q>It is not for you to know the times or the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which the Father has put in his own power.</q>
The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after having very plainly deſcribed the ſecond coming of Chriſt, 1 Theſſ. iv. 16, 17. adds, (chap. v. 1, 2.)
<q>But of the times and ſeaſons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourſelves know perfectly, that the day of Lord ſo cometh, as a thief in the night.</q>
Nevertheleſs, ſome in ſeveral ages, have made very bold with the time; and ſeveral particular years, which are now paſt, have been given out to the world, for the time of the end, by men who have pried into the ſecrets of God. Time has proclaimed to the world their raſhneſs and folly: and it is likely they will be no more happy in their conjectures, whoſe determinate time is yet to come. Let us reſt in that <hi>he cometh.</hi> God hath kept the day hid from us, that we may be every day <hi>ready</hi> for it, Matth. xxv. 13.
<q>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour, wherein the Son of man cometh.</q>
And let us remember, that the laſt day of our life will determine our ſtate in the laſt day of the world: and as we die ſo ſhall we be judged.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now ſhut up this ſubject, with ſome <hi>application</hi> of what has been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>USE I. Of <hi>comfort</hi> to all the ſaints. Here is abundance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to all who are in the ſtate of grace. Whatever be your <hi>afflictions</hi> in the world, this day will make up all your loſſes. "Though you have lain among the pots, yet ſhall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with ſilver, and her feathers with yellow gold," Pſal. lxviii. 13. Though the world <hi>reproach,</hi> judge and condemn you; the Judge will, at that day, abſolve you, and <hi>bring forth your righteouſneſs as the light.</hi> The world's fools will then appear to have been the only wiſe men who were in it. Though the <hi>croſs</hi> be heavy, you may well bear it in expectation of the crown of righteouſneſs, which the righteous Judge will then give you. If the world do deſpiſe you, and treat you with the utmoſt <hi>contempt,</hi> regard it not: the day cometh wherein you ſhall ſit with Chriſt in his throne. Be not diſcouraged, by reaſon of manifold temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; but reſiſt the devil, in confidence of a full and compleat victory; for you ſhall judge the tempter at laſt. Tho' you have had wreſtling now with the body of ſin and death; yet ye ſhall get all your enemies under your feet, at length, and be <hi>preſenced faultleſs before the preſence of his glory.</hi> Let not the <hi>terror</hi> of that day diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit you, when you think upon it: let theſe who have ſlighted the

                  </p>
                  <p>USE II. Of <hi>terror</hi> to all unbelievers. This may ſerve to awaken a ſecure generation, a world lying in wickedneſs, as if they were never to be called to an account for it; and ſlighting the Mediator, as if he were not to judge them. Ah! how few have the lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the judgment to come! moſt men live, as if what is ſaid of it, from the word, were but idle tales. The <hi>profane</hi> lives of many, ſpeak the thoughts of it to be far from their hearts, and in very deed make a mock of it before the world, ſaying, in effect, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> The <hi>hypocriſy</hi> of others, who blind the eyes of the world with a ſplendid profeſſion, being in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance Chriſt's ſheep, while they are indeed the devil's goats, is an evidence, that the great <hi>ſeparation</hi> of the ſheep from the goats is very little laid to heart. How do many indulge themſelves in <hi>ſecret</hi> wickedneſs, of which they would be aſhamed before witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: not conſidering that their moſt ſecret thoughts and actions will, at that day, be diſcovered, before the great congregation! how eagerly are mens hearts ſet on the <hi>world,</hi> as if it were to be their everlaſting habitation! the ſolemn aſſemblies, and public or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, wherein the Judge is upon a tranſaction of peace with the criminals, are undervalued: mens heart, will ſwim like feathers in the waters of the ſanctuary, that will ſink, like ſtones, to the bottom, in cares of this life: they will be very ſerious in trifles of this world, and trifle in the moſt ſerious and weighty things of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world. But O! conſider the day that is approaching, in which Chriſt ſhall come to judgment; the world ſhall be ſummoned, by the ſound of the laſt trumpet, to compear before his tribunal.

                  <p>Sinner, that ſame Lord Chriſt, whom thou now deſpiſeſt, whom thou woundeſt through the ſides of his meſſengers, and before whom thou doſt prefer thy luſts, will be thy Judge.

Thou haſt now a rock within thee, a heart of adamant, ſo that thou canſt count the darts of the word as ſtubble, and laugh at the ſhaking of the ſpear: but that rock will rent, at the ſight of the Judge; that hard heart will then break, and thou ſhalt weep and wail, when weeping and wailing will be to no purpoſe. Death's bands will fall off; the grave will vomit thee out; and the mountains ſhall ſkip from thee; and the rocks refuſe to grind thee to powder.

xxx. 4: What kingdom is like unto this? Death makes its way now into a palace, as eaſily as into a cottage: <hi>ſorrow</hi> fills the heart of one who wears a crown on his <hi>head,</hi> royal robes are no fence againſt <hi>pain,</hi> and <hi>crying</hi> by reaſon of pain. But in this kingdom no miſery can have place. All reproaches ſhall be wiped off; and never ſhall a <hi>tear</hi> drop any more from their eyes They ſhall not complain of <hi>deſertions</hi> again; the Lord will never hide his face from them: but the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhining upon them in his meridian-brightneſs, will diſpel all clouds, and give them an everlaſting day, without the leaſt mixture of darkneſs. A deluge of wrath, after a fearful thunder-clap from the throne, will ſweep away the wicked from before the judgment-ſeat, into the lake of fire: but they are, in the firſt place, like <hi>Noah</hi> brought into the ark, and out of harm's way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> White raiment hath been a token of <hi>purity,</hi> Therefore <hi>the Lamb's wiſe</hi> is <hi>arrayed in fine linen, clean and white,</hi> Rev xix. 8. And thoſe who ſtood before the throne <hi>waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> chap. vii. 14. The ſaints ſhall then put on the robes of <hi>perfect purity,</hi> and ſhine in ſpotleſs holineſs, like the ſun in his ſtrength, without the leaſt cloud to intercept his light. Abſolute innocence ſhall then be reſtored, and every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſin baniſhed far from his kingdom The <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin, and <hi>reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> power of it, are now taken away in the ſaints; nevertheleſs ſin dwelleth in them, Rom. vii. 20. But then it ſhall be no more in them: the corrupt nature will be quite removed, that root of bitterneſs will be plucked up, and no veſtiges of it left in their ſouls: their <hi>nature</hi> ſhall be altogether pure and ſinleſs. There ſhall be no darkneſs in their minds; but the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of every ſaint, when he is come to his kingdom, will be as a globe of pure and unmixed light. There ſhall not be the leaſt averſion to good, or inclination to evil, in their <hi>wills:</hi> but they will be brought to a perfect conformity to the will of God; bleſt with angelical purity, and ſixed therein Their <hi>affections</hi> ſhall not be liable to the leaſt diſorder or irregularity: it will coſt them no trouble to keep them right: they will get ſuch a ſet of purity, as they can never loſe. They will be ſo refined from all earthly droſs, as never to ſavour more of any thing but heaven. Were it poſſible they ſhould be ſet again amidſt the enſnaring objects of an evil world, they ſhould walk among them without the leaſt defilement; as the ſun ſhines on the dunghill, yet untainted, and as the angels preſerved their purity in the midſt of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Their <hi>graces</hi> ſhall then be perfected; and all the imperfections now cleaving to them, done away.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Among the Jews, theſe who deſired to be admitted into the prieſtly office, being tried, and found to be of the prieſt's line, and without blemiſh, were clothed in <hi>white,</hi> and enrolled among the

prieſts. This ſeems to be alluded to, Rev. iii. 5.
<q>He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh—the ſaints ſhall be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life.</q>
So the ſaints ſhall not be kings only, but prieſts withal; for they are <hi>a Royal Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 9. They will be <hi>prieſts</hi> upon their thrones. They are judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially found deſcended from the great High-Prieſt of their profeſſion, begotten of him by his Spirit, of the incorruptible ſeed of the word, and without blemiſh: ſo the trial being over, they are admitted to be <hi>prieſts</hi> in the <hi>temple</hi> above, that they may dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever. There is nothing upon earth more glorious than a <hi>kingdom,</hi> nothing more venerable than the <hi>prieſthood:</hi> and both meet together in the glorified ſtate of the ſaints. <hi>The general aſſembly of the firſt-born,</hi> (Heb. xii. 23.) whoſe is the <hi>prieſthood</hi> the <hi>double portion,</hi> appearing in their <hi>white robes</hi> of glory, will be a reverend and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous company. That day will ſhew them to be the perſons, whom the Lord has choſen out of all the tribes of the earth, to be near unto him, and to enter into his temple, even into his holy place. Their <hi>prieſthood,</hi> begun on earth, ſhall be brought to its perfection, while they ſhall be employed in offering the ſacrifice of praiſe to God and the Lamb, for ever and ever. They got not their portion, in the earth, with the reſt of the tribes: but the Lord himſelf was their portion, and will be their double portion, through the ages of eternity.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They were wont to wear white raiment, in a time of <hi>triumph;</hi> to the which alſo there ſeems to be an alluſion, Rev. iii. 5. "He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be clothed in white raiment." And what is heaven but an everlaſting triumph! None get thither, but ſuch as fight, and overcome too. Though <hi>Canaan</hi> was given to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> an <hi>inheritance:</hi> they behoved to conquer it, ere they could be poſſeſſors of it. The ſaints, in this world, are in the field of battle; often in <hi>red garments,</hi> garments rolled in blood: but the day approacheth, in which they ſhall <hi>ſtand before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands,</hi> (Rev. vii. 9.) having obtained a compleat victory over all their enemies. The <hi>palm</hi> was uſed as a ſign of victory; becauſe that tree, oppreſſed with weights, yieldeth not, but rather ſhooteth upwards. And palm-trees were carved on the doors of the moſt holy place, (1 Kings vi. 32.) which was a ſpecial type of heaven; for heaven is the place, which the ſaints are received into, as <hi>conquerors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold the <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of the ſaints in their white robes. The joys ariſing from the view of paſt dangers, and of riches and honours gained at the very door of death, do moſt ſenſibly touch one's heart: and this will be an ingredient in the everlaſting happineſs of the ſaints, which could have had no place, in the heaven of innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> and his ſinleſs offspring, ſuppoſing him to have ſtood Surely the glorified ſaints will not forget the entertainment they met with in the world: it will be for the glory of God to remember it, and alſo for the height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of their joy. The <hi>Sicilian</hi> king, by birth the ſon of a <hi>potter,</hi>
                     <pb n="298" facs="unknown:045042_0295_101F80470A94B998"/>
acted a wiſe part, in that he would be ſerved at his table, with <hi>earthen</hi> veſſels: the which could not but put an additional ſweetneſs in his meals, not to be reliſhed by one born heir to the crown. Can ever meat be ſo ſweet to any, as to the hungry man! Or can any have ſuch a reliſh of plenty, as he who has been under pinching ſtraits: The more difficulties the ſaints have paſſed through, in their way to heaven, the place will be the ſweeter to them, when they come at it. Every happy ſtroke, ſtruck in the ſpiritual warfare, will be a jewel in their crown of glory. Each victory obtained againſt ſin, Satan and the world, will raiſe their triumphant joy the higher. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the croſs will ſweeten the crown: and the memory of their travel through the wilderneſs, will put an additional verdure on the fields of glory; while they walk through them, minding the day, when they went <hi>mourning without the ſun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now that they appear <hi>triumphing</hi> in <hi>white robes,</hi> it is a ſign they have obtained an honourable <hi>place;</hi> ſuch a peace as their enemies can diſturb no more. So every thing peculiarly adapted to their <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> condition is laid aſide. The ſword is laid down; and they betake themſelves to <hi>the pen of a ready writer,</hi> to commemorate the praiſes of him, by whom they overcame. Public ordinances, preaching, ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall be honourably laid aſide; there is <hi>no temple there,</hi> Rev. xxi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. Sometimes theſe were ſweet to them: but the travellers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all got home, the inns, appointed for their entertainment by the way, are ſhut up; the candles are put out, when the ſun is riſen; and the tabernacle uſed in the wilderneſs is folded up, when the temple of glory is come in its room. Many of the ſaints duties will then be laid aſide; as one gives his ſtaff out of his hand, when he is come to the end of his journey. <hi>Praying</hi> ſhall then be turned to praiſing: and, there being no ſin to confeſs, no wants to ſeek the ſupply of; <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and <hi>petition</hi> ſhall be ſwallowed up in everlaſting <hi>thankſgiving.</hi> There will be no <hi>mourning,</hi> in heaven: they have ſown in tears, the reaping time of joy is come, <hi>and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</hi> Rev. xxi. 4. No need of <hi>mortification</hi> there; and <hi>ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination</hi> is then at an end. They will not need to <hi>watch</hi> any more; the danger is over. <hi>Patience</hi> has had its perfect work, and there is no uſe for it there. <hi>Faith</hi> is turned into ſight, and <hi>hope</hi> is ſwallowed up in the ocean of ſenſible and full enjoyment. All the rebels are ſubdued, the ſaints quietly ſet on their throne: and ſo the forces, needful in the time of the ſpiritual warfare, are diſbanded; and they carry on their triumph in profoundeſt peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> White garments were worn, on <hi>feſtival days,</hi> in token of <hi>joy.</hi> And ſo ſhall the ſaints be clothed in white raiment; for they ſhall keep an everlaſting ſabbath to the Lord, Heb. iv. 9. <hi>There remaineth therefore a reſt</hi> (or <hi>keeping of a ſabbath) to the people of God.</hi> The ſabbath, in the eſteem of ſaints, is the queen of days: and they ſhall have an endleſs <hi>sabbatiſm</hi> in the kingdom of heaven; ſo ſhall their garments be always white. They will have an eternal <hi>reſt,</hi> with an uninterrupted joy:
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:045042_0296_101F804A2598F060"/>
for heaven is not a reſting place, where men may ſleep out an eternity; (there they reſt not day nor night) but their work is their reſt and continual recreation, and toil and wearineſs have no place there. They reſt there in God, who is the centre of their ſouls. Here they find the complement, or ſatisfaction of all their deſires; having the full enjoyment of God, and uninterrupted communion with him. This is the point, unto the which till the ſoul come, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be reſtleſs: but, that point reached, it reſts; for he is the laſt end, and the ſoul can go no farther. It cannot underſtand, will, nor deſire more; but in him it has what is commenſurable to its boundleſs deſires. This is the happy end of all the labours of the ſaints; their toil and ſorrows iſſue in a joyful reſt. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> meaſuring the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural day, put the day firſt, and the night laſt: but the Jews counted the night firſt, and the day laſt. Even ſo, the wicked begin with a day of reſt and pleaſure, but end with a night of everlaſting toil and ſorrow: but God's people have their gloomy night firſt, and then comes their day of eternal reſt. The which <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the parable, obſerved to the rich man in hell, Luke xvi. 25.
<q>Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</q>

                  <p n="3">III. If one enquires <hi>where</hi> the kingdom of the ſaints lies? It is not in this world; it lies in a <hi>better country, that is, an heavenly,</hi> (Heb. xi. 16.) a country better than the beſt of this world; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the heavenly <hi>Canaan, Immanuel</hi>'s land, where nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to complete the happineſs of the inhabitants. This is the happy <hi>country,</hi> bleſt with a perpetual ſpring, and which yieldeth all things for neceſſity, conveniency, and delight. There men ſhall cat angels food; they ſhall be entertained with <hi>the hidden manna,</hi> (Rev. ii. 17) without being ſet to the painful gathering of it: they will be fed to the full, with the product of the land falling into their mouths, without the leaſt toil to them. That land enjoys an everlaſting day, for there is <hi>no night there,</hi> Rev. xxi. 25. An eternal ſun-ſhine beautifies this <hi>better country,</hi> but there is no ſcorching heat there: No clouds ſhall be ſeen there for ever: yet it is not a land of drought; the trees of the Lord's planting are ſet by the rivers of water, and ſhall never want moiſture, for they will have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſupply of the Spirit, by Jeſus Chriſt, from his Father. This is the country from whence our Lord came, and whither he is gone again: the country which all the holy patriarchs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had their eye upon, while on earth; and which all the ſaints, who have gone before us, have fought their way to; and unto which, the martyrs have joyfully ſwimmed, through a ſea of blood. This earth is the place of the ſaints pilgrimage: that is, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they find their everlaſting reſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>royal city is that great city, the holy Jeruſalem,</hi> deſcribed, at large, Rev. xxi. 10 to the end of the chapter. (It is true, ſome learned divines place this city in the earth: but the particulars of
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:045042_0297_101F80C9793AFC58"/>
the deſcription ſeem to me to favour thoſe moſt, who point us to the other world for it.) The ſaints ſhall reign in that city, whoſe <hi>wall</hi> is of <hi>jaſper,</hi> (ver. 16) and <hi>the foundations of the wall garniſhed with all manner of precious ſtones,</hi> (ver. 19.) and <hi>the ſtreets of pure gold,</hi> (ver. 20) ſo that their feet ſhall be ſet on that, which the men of this world ſet their hearts upon. This is the <hi>city God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them,</hi> Heb. xi. 16. <hi>A city that hath foundations,</hi> (ver. 10.) <hi>A continuing city,</hi> (chap xiii. 14.) which ſhall ſtand and flouriſh, when all the cities of the world are laid in aſhes; and which ſhall not be moved, when the foundations of the world are overturned. It is a city that never changeth its inhabitants: none of them ſhall ever be removed out of it: for life and immortality reign there, and no death can enter into it. It is bleſſed with a perfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual peace, and can never be in the leaſt diſturbed. Nothing from without can annoy it; <hi>the gates</hi> therefore are <hi>not ſhut at all by day,</hi> and there is no night there, Rev. xxi. 25. There can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from within trouble it. No want of proviſion there; no ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; no diſcord amongſt the inhabitants. Whatever contentions are amongſt the ſaints now; no veſtige of their former jarrings ſhall remain there. Love to God, and to one another, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: and theſe of them, who ſtood at greater diſtance here, will joyfully embrace and delight in one another there.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The <hi>royal palace</hi> is Chriſt's <hi>Father's houſe,</hi> in which <hi>are many manſions,</hi> John xiv. 2. There ſhall the ſaints dwell for ever. That is the houſe prepared for all the heirs of glory, even theſe of them who dwell in the meaneſt cottage now, or have not where to lay their heads. As our Lord calls his ſaints to a <hi>kingdom</hi>; he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them a houſe ſuitable to the dignity he puts upon them. Heaven will be a convenient, ſpacious, and glorious houſe, for thoſe whom the King delighteth to honour. Never was a houſe purchaſed, at ſo dear a rate as this, being the purchaſe of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator's blood; and no leſs could it be afforded for to them: never was there ſo much ado, to fit inhabitants for a houſe. The ſaints were, by nature, utterly unfit for this houſe, and human art and induſtry could not make them <hi>meet</hi> for it. But the Father gives the deſigned inhabitants to his Son, to be by him redeemed: the Son pays the price of their redemption, even his own precious blood; that, with the allowance of juſtice, they may have acceſs to <hi>the houſe:</hi> and the holy Spirit ſanctifies them by his grace; that they may be <hi>meet</hi> to come in thither, where no unclean thing can enter. And no marvel, for it is <hi>the King's palace, they enter</hi> into, (Pſal. xlv. 15.) The houſe of the kingdom, where the great King keeps his court, where he has his throne, and ſhews forth his glory, in a ſingular manner beyond what mortals can conceive.</p>

What would royal power and authority, enſigns of royalty, richeſt treaſures, and all other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a kingdom, avail without comfortable <hi>ſociety?</hi> Some crowned heads have had but a ſorry life through the want of it: their palaces have been but unto them as priſons, and their badges of honour as chains on a priſoner: while hated of all, they had none they could truſt in, or whom they could have comfortable fellowſhip with. But the chief part of heaven's happineſs lies in the bleſſed <hi>ſociety</hi> the ſaints ſhall have there. For clearing of which, conſider theſe few things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſociety of the <hi>ſaints,</hi> among themſelves, will be no ſmall part of heaven's happineſs. The <hi>communion of ſaints</hi> on earth is highly prized by all theſe who are travelling through the world unto <hi>Zion</hi>; and companions in ſin can never have ſuch true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight in one another, as ſometime the Lord's people have in praying together, and converſing about theſe things which the world is a ſtranger to. Here the ſaints are but few in company, at beſt: and ſome of them are ſo poſted, as they ſeem to themſelves to <hi>dwell alone:</hi> having no acceſs to ſuch, as they could freely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom themſelves to, in the matter of their ſpiritual caſe. They ſigh and ſay,
<q>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered the ſummer fruits—there is no cluſter to eat—the good man is peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of the earth,</q>
Mic. vii 1, 2. But in <hi>the general aſſembly of the firſt-born</hi> in heaven, none of all the ſaints, who ever were, or will be on the earth, ſhall be miſſing. They will be all of them together in one place, all poſſeſs one kingdom, and all ſit down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb. Here the beſt of the ſaints want not their ſinful imperfections, making their ſociety leſs comfortable: but there they ſhall be perfect, without <hi>ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> Eph. v. 27.

perfections are then done away; they

Dan. xii. 3</p>
                  <p>There we will ſee <hi>Adam and Eve</hi> in the heavenly paradiſe, freely eating of the tree of life; <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the holy patriarchs, no more wandering from land to land, but come to their everlaſting reſt; all the prophets feeding their eyes on the glory of him, of whoſe coming they propheſied; the twelve Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the Lamb, ſitting on their twelve thrones; all the holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in their long white robes, with their crowns on their heads the godly kings advanced to a kingdom which cannot be moved; and them <hi>that turn many to righteouſneſs,</hi> ſhining <hi>as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> There will we ſee our godly friends, relations and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, <hi>pillars in the temple of temple of God,</hi> to <hi>go no more out</hi> from us. And it is more than probable, that the ſaints will know one another in heaven: that, at leaſt, they will know their friends, relatives, and theſe they were acquainted with on earth, and ſuch as have been moſt eminent in the church: howbeit that knowledge will be purged from all earthly thoughts and affections. This ſeems to be included in that perfection of happineſs to which the ſaints ſhall be advanced there. If <hi>Adam</hi> knew who and what <hi>Eve</hi> was at firſt ſight, when the Lord God brought her to him, (Gen. ii. 23, 24) why ſhould one queſtion, but huſbands and wives, parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will know each other in glory? if the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Paul</hi>'s miniſtry, ſhall be his <hi>crown of rejoicing, in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his coming,</hi> (1 Theſſ. ii 19.) Why may not one conclude, that miniſters ſhall know their people, and people their miniſters in heaven? And if the diſciples, on the mount of transfiguration, knew <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they had never ſeen before, (Matth. ii. 19) we have ground to think, we ſhall know them too, and ſuch as they, when we come to heaven. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſaints ſhall be moſt intimate there; <hi>they ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Matth. viii. 11. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried by the angels into <hi>Abraham's boſom,</hi> (Luke xvi. 23) which denotes moſt intimate and familiar ſociety. And though diverſity of <hi>tongues ſhall ceaſe,</hi> (1 Cor. xiii. 8.) I make no queſtion, but there will be an uſe of ſpeech in heaven; and that the ſaints will glorify God in their bodies there, as well as in their ſpirits, ſpeaking forth his praiſes with an audible voice. (As for the language, we ſhall underſtand, what it is, when we come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) When <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up to the third heaven, the ſeat of the bleſſed, he <hi>heard</hi> there <hi>unſpeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter,</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 4. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> on the mount with Chriſt, <hi>talked with him,</hi> Matth. xvii. 3. and <hi>ſpake of his diſeaſe which he ſhould accompliſh at Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke ix. 31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſaints will have the ſociety of all the holy angels there. <hi>And aumerable company of angels</hi> ſhall be companions to them in their glorified ſtate. Happy were the ſhepherds, who heard the
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:045042_0301_101F8050246EC458"/>
ſong of the heavenly hoſt, when Chriſt was born, but thrice happy they, who ſhall join their voices with theirs, in the choir of ſaints and angels in heaven, when he ſhall be glorified in all, who ſhall be about him there. Then ſhall we be brought acquainted with the bleſſed ſpirits, who never ſinned. How bright will theſe morning-ſtars ſhine in the holy place! they were miniſtring ſpirits to the heirs of ſalvation, loved them for their Lord and Maſter's ſake; encamped round about them, to preſerve them from danger; how joyfully will they welcome them to their everlaſting habitations; and rejoice to ſee them come at length to their kingdom, as the tutor doth in the proſperity of his pupils! The ſaints ſhall be no more afraid of them, as ſometime they were wont to be: they ſhall then have put off mortality, and infirmities of the fleſh, and be themſelves, <hi>as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God,</hi> fit to entertain communion and fellowſhip with theſe ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones. And both being brought under one head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; they ſhall join in the praiſes of God, and of the Lamb, <hi>ſaying, with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. v. 11, 12. Whether the angels ſha]l (as ſome think) aſſume airy bodies, that they may be ſeen by the bodily eyes of the ſaints, and be in nearer capacity to converſe with them, I know not: but as they want not ways of converſe amongſt themſelves, we have reaſon to think, that converſation, betwixt them and the ſaints, ſhall not be for ever block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They ſhall have ſociety with the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf in heaven, glorious communion with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the perfection of happineſs. I chuſe to ſpeak of communion with God, and the man Chriſt together; becauſe as we derive our grace from the Lamb, ſo we will derive our glory from him too; the man Chriſt being (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) the centre of the divine glory in heaven, from whence it is diffuſed unto all the ſaints. This ſeems to be taught us by theſe ſcriptures, which expreſs heaven's happineſs by <hi>being with Chriſt,</hi> Luke xxiii. 43. <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe,</hi> John xxvii. 24. <hi>Father I will that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This alſo ſeems to be the import of theſe ſcriptures, wherein <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> the ſlain Saviour, are jointly ſpoken of, in the point of the happineſs of the ſaints in heaven, Rev. vii. 17.
<q>For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the throne, ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of waters: and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</q>
Chap. xxi. 3.
<q>Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,</q>
to wit, as in a tabernacle, (ſo the word ſignifies) that is, in the fleſh of Chriſt, (compare John i. 14. and ver. 22.) "The Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the temple of it." Here lies the chief happineſs of the ſaints in heaven, that without which they could never be happy, though lodged in that glorious

place, and bleſſed with the ſociety of angels there. What I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay of it, ſhall be compriſed in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> The ſaints in heaven ſhall have the glorious <hi>preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> of God, and of the Lamb: <hi>God himſelf ſhall be with them,</hi> Rev. xxi 3. And they ſhall <hi>ever be with the Lord.</hi> God is every-where preſent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his eſſence; the ſaints militant have his ſpecial glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: but in heaven they have his glorious preſence. There they are brought near to the throne of the great King, and ſtand before him, where he ſhews his inconceivable glory. There they have <hi>the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of God,</hi> on which the cloud of glory reſts, the all glorious human nature of Chriſt, wherein the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells, not vailed as in the days of his humiliation, but ſhining through that bleſſed fleſh, (that all the ſaints may behold <hi>his glory</hi>) and making that body more glorious than a thouſand ſons: ſo that the city has no need of the ſun, nor of the moon, but <hi>the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof,</hi> (properly, <hi>the candle thereof</hi>) Rev xxi 23. <hi>i. e.</hi> The Lamb is the <hi>luminary,</hi> or luminous body, which gives light to the city; as the ſun and moon now give light to the world, or as a candle lightens a dark room: and the <hi>light</hi> proceeding from that glorious luminary, for the city is the <hi>glory</hi> of God. Sometime that <hi>candle</hi> burnt very dim, it was hid under a buſhel, in the time of his humiliati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>; but that, now and then, it darted out ſome rays of this light, which dazzled the eyes of the ſpectators: but now it is ſet on high, in the city of God, where it ſhines, and ſhall ſhine for ever, in perfection of glory. It was ſometimes laid aſide, as a ſtone diſallowed of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: but now it is, and for ever will be, the <hi>light</hi> or luminary of that city; and that, <hi>like unto a ſtone moſt precious, even like a jaſper ſtone clear as cryſtal,</hi> ver. 11.</p>
                  <p>Who can conceive the happineſs of the ſaints, in the preſence-chamber of the great King, where he ſits in his chair of ſtate, making his glory eminently to appear in the <hi>man Chriſt?</hi> His gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence makes a mighty change upon the ſaints in this world: his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence in heaven then muſt needs ſcrew up their graces to their perfection, and elevate their capacities. The ſaints do experience, that the preſence of God now with them in his <hi>grace,</hi> can make a little heaven of a ſort of hell: how great then muſt the glory of heaven be, by his preſence there in his <hi>glory!</hi> If a candle, in ſome ſort, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a cottage or priſon, how will the ſhining ſun beautify a palace or paradiſe! The gracious preſence of God made a wilderneſs lightſom to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the valley of the ſhadow of death to <hi>David,</hi> a fiery furnace to the three children: what a raviſhing beauty ſhall then ariſe from <hi>the ſun of righteouſneſs,</hi> ſhining in his meridian brightneſs on the ſtreet of the city laid with pure gold? This glorious preſence of God in heaven will put a glory on the ſaints themſelves. The pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hath no beauty, when the-darkneſs of the night ſits down on it; but the ſhining ſun puts a glory on the blackeſt mountains: ſo theſe

who are now as bottles in the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ak, when ſet in the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, will be glorious both in ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The ſaints in heaven ſhall have the full <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God and of the Lamb. This is it that perfectly <hi>ſatisfies</hi> the rational creature; and here is the ſaints everlaſting reſt. This will make up all their wants, and fill the deſires of their ſouls, which after all here obtained, ſtill cry, <hi>Give give,</hi> not without ſome anxiety; becauſe though they do enjoy God, yet they do not enjoy him fully. As to the way and manner of this enjoyment, our Lord tells us, John xvii. 3.
<q>This is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</q>
Now there are two ways, how a deſirable object is known moſt perfectly and ſatisfyingly; the one is by <hi>ſight,</hi> the other by <hi>experience:</hi> ſight ſatisfies the underſtanding, and experience ſatisfies the will. Accordingly one may ſay, that the ſaints enjoy God and the Lamb in heaven, (1.) By an intuitive knowledge. (2.) By an experimental knowledge, both of them perfect, I mean, in reſpect of the capacity of the creature; for otherwiſe a creature's perfect knowledge of an infinite Being is impoſſible. The ſaints below enjoy God, in that knowledge they have of him by <hi>report,</hi> from his his holy word which they believe; they ſee him likewiſe darkly <hi>in the glaſs</hi> of ordinances, which do, as it were, repreſent the bridegroom's picture, or ſhadow, while he is abſent: they have alſo ſome experimental knowledge of him, they <hi>taſte that God is good,</hi> and <hi>that the Lord is gracious.</hi> But the ſaints above ſhall not need a good report of the King, they ſhall ſee himſelf; therefore faith ceaſeth: they will behold his own face; therefore ordinances are no more; there is no need of a glaſs: they ſhall drink, and drink abundantly of that whereof they have taſted; and ſo hope ceaſeth, for they are at the utmoſt bounds of their deſires.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſaints in heaven ſhall <hi>enjoy</hi> God and the Lamb, by <hi>ſight,</hi> and that in a moſt perfect manner, 1 Cor. xiii. 12. <hi>For now we ſee through a glaſs darkly; but then face to face.</hi> Here our ſight is but mediate, as by a glaſs, in which we ſee not things themſelves, but the images of things: but there we ſhall have an immediate view of God and the Lamb. Here our knowledge is but obſcure; there it ſhall be clear without the leaſt mixture of darkneſs. The Lord doth now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with his ſaints, through the latteſſes of ordinances: but then ſhall they be in the preſence-chamber with him. There is a vail now on the glorious face as to us: but when we come to the upper houſe, that vail, through which ſome rays of beauty are now darted, will be found entirely taken off; and then ſhall glorious excellencies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, not ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The phraſe ſeems to be borrowed from the honour put on ſome in the courts of monarchs, to be attendants on the king's perſon. We read, Jer. liii. 25. of <hi>ſeven men of them that were</hi> (Heb. <hi>Seers of the king's face, i. e.</hi> as we read it) <hi>near the king's perſon.</hi> O unſpeakable glory! the great King keeps his court in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:045042_0304_101F805AAAAD1838"/>
and the ſaints ſhall all be his courtiers, ever near the King's perſon, ſeeing his face. <hi>The throne of God and of the Lamb ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face,</hi> Rev. xxii. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) They ſhall ſee Jeſus Chriſt with their bodily <hi>eyes,</hi> ſince he will never lay aſide the human nature. They will always behold that glorious bleſſed body, which is perſonally united to the divine nature, and exalted far above principalities and powers, and every name that is named. There we will ſee, with our eyes, that very <hi>body,</hi> which was born of <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> betwixt two thieves; that bleſſed <hi>head</hi> that was crowned with thorns; the <hi>face</hi> that was ſpit upon; the <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> that were nailed to the croſs; all ſhining with unconceivable glory. The glory of the man Chriſt will attract the eyes of all the ſaints, and he will be for ever <hi>admired in all them that believe,</hi> 2 Theſſ. i. 10. Were each ſtar, in the heavens, ſhining as the ſun in its meridian brightneſs, and the light of the ſun ſo increaſed, as the ſtars, in that caſe, ſhould bear the ſame proportion to the ſun, in point of light, that they do now; it might poſſibly be ſome faint reſemblance of the glory of the man Chriſt, in compariſon with that of the ſaints; for though the ſaints <hi>ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet not they, but the Lamb ſhall be <hi>the light</hi> of the city. The wiſe men fell down, and worſhipped him, when they ſaw him a <hi>young child, with Mary his mother, in the houſe.</hi> But O! what a raviſhing, ſight will it be to ſee him in his kingdom on his throne, at the Father's right hand! <hi>The Word was made fleſh,</hi> (John i. 14.) and the glory of God ſhall ſhine through that fleſh, and the joys of heaven, ſpring out from it, unto the ſaints, who ſhall ſee and enjoy God, in Chriſt. For ſince the union betwixt Chriſt and the ſaints is never diſſolved but they continue his members for ever; and the members cannot draw their life, but from their Head; ſeeing that which is dependent on the head, as to the vital influence, is no member: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt will remain the everlaſting <hi>bond</hi> of <hi>union</hi> betwixt God and the ſaints; from whence their eternal life ſhall ſpring, John xvii. 2, 3.
<q>Thou haſt given him power overall fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. And this is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that they might know thee the only true God, &amp;c. Ver. 22, 23. And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</q>
Wherefore the <hi>immediate</hi> enjoyment of God in heaven is to be underſtood, in reſpect of the laying aſide of word and ſacraments, and ſuch external means, as we enjoy God by in this world; but not, as if the ſaints ſhould then caſt off their dependence on their Head for vital influences: nay,
<q>the Lamb which is in the midſt of the throne, ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters,</q>
Rev. vii. 17.</p>
                  <p>Now when we ſhall behold him, who died for us, that we might live for evermore, whoſe matchleſs love made him ſwim through the

Red-ſea, of God's wrath, to make a path in the midſt of it for us, by which we might paſs ſafely to <hi>Canaan's</hi> land: then we will ſee what a glorious One he was, who ſuffered all this for us; what entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had in the upper-houſe; what hallelujahs of angels could not hinder him to hear the groans of a perſhing multitude on earth, and to come down for their help: and what a glory he laid aſide for us. Then will we be more
<q>able to comprehend with all ſaints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth: and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge,</q>
Eph. iii. 19 When the ſaints ſhall remember, that the waters of wrath he was plunged into, are the wells of ſalvation from whence they draw all their joy; that they have got the cup of ſalvation, in exchange of the cup of wrath his Father gave him to drink, which his ſinleſs human nature ſhivered at: how will their hearts leap within them, burn with ſeraphick love, like coals of juniper, and the arch of heaven ring with their ſongs of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? The <hi>Jews</hi> celebrating the feaſt of tabernacles, (which was the moſt joyful of all their feaſts, and laſted ſeven days) went once every day about the altar, ſinging hoſanna, with their myrtle, palm and willow-branches in their hand, (the two former ſigns of victory, the laſt of chaſtity) in the mean time bending their boughs towards the altar. When the ſaints are preſented <hi>as a chaſte virgin to Chriſt,</hi> and as conquerors have got their <hi>palms in their hands,</hi> how joyfully will they compaſs the altar evermore; and ſing their hoſannas, (or rather their hallelujahs) about it, bending their palms towards it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging themſelves to owe all unto the Lamb that was ſlain, and redeemed them with his blood! and to this agrees what <hi>John</hi> ſaw, Rev. vii 9, 10.
<q>A great multitude—ſtood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands: and cried with a loud voice, ſaying, Salvation to our God which ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) They ſhall <hi>ſee God,</hi> Matth. v. 8. They will be happy in ſeeing the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt (not with their bodily eyes, in reſpect of which God is <hi>inviſible</hi> 1 Tim i 17. but) with the eyes of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; being bleſt with the moſt perfect, full, and clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and divine things, which the creature is capable of. This is called <hi>the beatifick viſion,</hi> and is the perfection of the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> the utmoſt term thereof. It is but an obſcure delineation of the glory of God, that mortals can have on earth; a ſight, as it were of his <hi>back part,</hi> Exod. xxxiii. 23. But there they will ſee his <hi>face,</hi> Rev. xxii. 4. They ſhall ſee him in the fulneſs of his glory, and behold him <hi>fixedly;</hi> whereas it is but a <hi>paſſing</hi> view they can have of him here, Exod. xxxiv. 6. There is a vaſt difference betwixt the ſight of a king in his night-clothes, quickly paſſing by us; and a fixed leiſure view of him ſitting on his throne in his royal robes, his crown on his head, and his ſeptre in his hand: ſuch a difference will there be, between the greateſt manifeſtation of God that ever a ſaint had on earth; and the diſplay of his glory that ſhall be ſeen in heaven. There the ſaints
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:045042_0306_101F806159A5CBC0"/>
ſhall eternally, without interruption, feed their eyes upon him, and be ever viewing his glorious perfections. And as their bodily eyes ſhall be ſtrengthened and fitted, to behold the glorious majeſty of the man Chriſt; as eagles gaze on the ſun, without being blinded thereby: ſo their <hi>minds</hi> ſhall have ſuch an elevation, as will fit them to ſee God in his glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> capacities ſhall be enlarged, according to the meaſure in which he ſhall be pleaſed to communicate himſelf unto them for their compleat happineſs.</p>
                  <p>This bliſsful ſight of God, being quite above our preſent capacities, we muſt needs be much in the dark about it. But it ſeems to be ſomething elſe, than the fight of that <hi>glory,</hi> which we will ſee with our bodily eyes, in the ſaints and in the man Chriſt, or any other ſplendor or refulgence from the Godhead whatſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for no created thing can be our chief good and happineſs, nor fully ſatisfy our ſouls; and it is plain, that theſe things are ſomewhat different from God himſelf. Therefore I conceive, that the ſouls of the ſaints ſhall ſee God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſo the ſcriptures teach us, that we ſhall <hi>ſee face to face, and know even as we are known,</hi> 1 Cor xiii 12. And that <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 John iii. 12. Howbeit the ſaints can never have an adequate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of God; they cannot comprehend that which is infinite. They may touch the mountain, but cannot graſp it in their arms They cannot with one glance of their eye, behold what grows on every ſide: but the divine perfections will be an unbounded field, in which the glorified ſhall walk eternally, ſeeing more and more of <hi>God:</hi> ſince they can never come to the end of that which is infinite. They may bring their veſſels to this ocean every moment, and fill them with new waters. What a raviſhing ſight would it be, to ſee all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and lovely qualities, that are ſcattered here and there among the creatures, gathered together into one! but even ſuch a ſight would be infinitely below this bliſsful ſight the ſaints ſhall have in heaven. For they ſhall ſee God, in whom all theſe perfections ſhall eminently appear, with infinitely more; whereof there is no veſtige to be found in the creature. In him ſhall they ſee every thing deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and nothing but what is deſirable.</p>
                  <p>Then ſhall they be perfectly ſatisfied, as to the love of God towards them, which they are now ready to queſtion on every turn. They will be no more ſet to perſuade themſelves of it, by marks, ſigns, and teſtimonies: they will have an <hi>intuitive</hi> knowledge of it. They ſhall (with the profoundeſt reverence be it ſpoken) look into the heart of God, and there ſee the love he bore to them from all eternity, and the love and good-will he will bear to them for evermore. The glorified ſhall have a moſt clear and diſtinct underſtanding of <hi>divine truths,</hi> for <hi>in his light we ſhall ſee light,</hi> Pſal. xxxvi. 9. The light of glory will be a compleat commentary on the <hi>Bible,</hi> and looſe all the hard and knotty queſtions in divinity. There is no joy on earth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that which ariſeth from the diſcovery of truth; no diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of truth comparable to the diſcovery of <hi>ſcripture-truth,</hi> made by

the Spirit of the Lord unto the ſoul. <hi>I rejoice at thy word,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>as one that findeth great ſpoil,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 162. Yet it is but an imperfect diſcovery we have of it while here. How raviſhing then will it be, to ſee the opening of the whole treaſure, hid in that field! they ſhall alſo be let into the underſtanding of <hi>the works of God.</hi> The beauty in the works of creation and providence will then be ſet in a due light. Natural knowledge will be brought to perfection by the light of glory. The web of providence concerning the church, and all men whatſoever, will then be cut out, and laid before the eyes of the ſaints, and it will appear a moſt beautiful mixture; ſo as they ſhall ſay together, on the view of it, <hi>he hath done all things well.</hi> But, in a ſpecial manner, the work of redemption ſhall be the eternal won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſaints, and they will admire and praiſe the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance for ever. Then ſhall they get a full view of its ſuitableneſs to the divine perfections, and to the caſe of ſinners: and clearly read the covenant, that paſt betwixt the Father and the Son, from all eternity, touching their ſalvation. They ſhall for ever wonder and praiſe, and praiſe and wonder at the myſteries of wiſdom and love, goodneſs and holineſs, mercy and juſtice, appearing in the glorious device. Their ſouls ſhall be eternally ſatisfied with the <hi>fight</hi> of God himſelf, and of their <hi>election</hi> by the Father, their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> by the Son, and <hi>application</hi> thereof to them by the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſaints in heaven ſhall enjoy God in Chriſt by <hi>experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge,</hi> which is, when the object itſelf is given and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. This is the participation of the divine <hi>goodneſs</hi> in full meaſure; which is the perfection of the <hi>will,</hi> and utmoſt term thereof. <hi>The Lamb ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters,</hi> Rev. vii. 17. Theſe are no other but God himſelf, <hi>the fountain of living waters,</hi> who will fully and freely communicate himſelf unto them. He will pour out of his goodneſs eternally into their ſouls: and then ſhall they have a moſt lively ſenſation, in the innermoſt part of their ſouls, of all that goodneſs they heard of, and believed to be in him; and of what they ſee in him by the light of glory. This will be an everlaſting practical expoſition of that word, which men and angels cannot ſufficiently unfold, to wit, God himſelf ſhall—<hi>be their God,</hi> Rev. xi. 3. God will communicate himſelf unto them <hi>fully:</hi> they will no more be ſet to taſte of the <hi>ſtreams</hi> of divine goodneſs in ordinances, as they were wont, but ſhall drink at the <hi>fountain-head.</hi> They will be no more entertained with ſips and drops, but filled with all the fulneſs of God. And this will be the entertainment of <hi>every</hi> ſaint: for though in created things, what is given to one, is withheld from another; yet an infinite good can fully communicate itſelf to all, and fill all. Theſe who are <hi>heirs of God,</hi> the great heritage, ſhall then enter into a full poſſeſſion of their inheritances: and the Lord will open his treaſures of <hi>goodneſs</hi> unto them, that their enjoyment may be full. They ſhall not be ſtinted to any
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:045042_0308_101F8065D9D85158"/>
meaſure: but the enjoyment ſhall go as far as their enlarged capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities can reach. As a narrow veſſel cannot contain the ocean, to neither can the finite creature comprehend an infinite good: but no meaſure ſhall be ſet to the enjoyment, but what ariſeth from the capacity of the creature. So that, although there be degrees of glory, yet all ſhall be filled, and have what they can <hi>hold;</hi> tho' ſome would be capable to hold <hi>more</hi> than others, there will be no <hi>want</hi> to any of them, all ſhall be fully ſatisfied, and perfectly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the full enjoyment of divine goodneſs, according to their enlarged capacities. As when bottles of different ſizes are filled, ſome contain more, others leſs; yet all of them have what they can contain. The glorified ſhall have <hi>all,</hi> in God, for the ſatisfaction of all their deſires. No created thing can afford ſatisfaction to <hi>all</hi> our deſires: clothes may warm us, but they cannot feed us; the light is comfortable, but cannot nouriſh us. But in God we ſhall have all our deſires, and we ſhall deſire nothing <hi>without</hi> him. They ſhall be the happy ones, that deſire nothing but what is truly deſirable; and withal have all they deſire. God will be <hi>all in all</hi> to the ſaints; he will be their life, health, riches, honour, peace, and all good things. He will communicate himſelf <hi>freely</hi> to them: the door of acceſs to him ſhall never be ſhut again, for one moment. They may, when they will, take of the fruits of the tree of life, for they will find it on each ſide the river, Rev. xxii. 2. There will be no vail betwixt God and them, to be drawn aſide; but his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall ever ſtand open to them. No door to knock at, in heaven; no aſking to go before receiving; the Lord will allow his people an unreſtrained familiarity with himſelf there.</p>
                  <p>Now they are in part made <hi>partakers of the divine nature:</hi> but then they ſhall perfectly partake of it; that is to ſay, God will communicate to them his own image, make all his goodneſs not only <hi>paſs before them,</hi> but paſs into them, and ſtamp the image of all his own perfections upon them, ſo far as the creature is capable to receive the ſame; from whence ſhall reſult a perfect <hi>likeneſs</hi> to him, in all things in or about them, which completes the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the creature. And this is what the Pſalmiſt ſeems to have had in view, Pſal. xvii. 15. <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake, with thy likeneſs</hi>; the perfection of God's image, following upon the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick viſion. And ſo ſays <hi>John,</hi> 1 John iii 2 <hi>We ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Hence there ſhall be a moſt cloſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate union betwixt God and the ſaints: God ſhall be in them, and they in God, in the way of a moſt glorious and perfect union; for then ſhall they dwell in love made perfect. <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 John iv. 16. How will the ſaints knit with God, and he with them; when he ſhall ſee nothing in them but his own image; when their love ſhall arrive at its perfection, no nature, but the divine nature, being left in them, and all imperfection ſwallowed up in that glorious tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

into the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of God! their love to the Lord being purged from the droſs of ſelf-love, ſhall be moſt pure; ſo as they will love nothing but <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>in God.</hi> It ſhall be no more ſaint and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, but burn like coals of juniper. It will be a light without darkneſs, a flaming fire without ſmoak. As the live coal, when all the moiſture is gone out of it, is all fire; ſo will the ſaints be all love, when they come to the full <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God in heaven, by intuitive and experimental knowledge of him, by ſight and full participation of the divine goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> From this glorious <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>enjoyment</hi> ſhall ariſe an unſpeakable <hi>joy,</hi> which the ſaints ſhall be filled with. <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſs of joy,</hi> Pſal. xvi. 11. The ſaints ſometimes enjoy God in the world, when their eyes being held, that they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, they have not the comfort of the enjoyment; but then, all miſtakes being removed, they ſhall not only enjoy God, but reſt in the enjoyment with inexpreſſible <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> The deſire of earthly things breeds torment, and the enjoyment of them often ends in loathing. But though the glorified ſaints ſhall ever deſire more and more of God, their <hi>deſires</hi> ſhall not be mixt with the leaſt anxiety, ſince the fulneſs of the Godhead ſtands always open to them; therefore <hi>they ſhall hunger no more,</hi> they ſhall not have the leaſt uneaſineſs, in their eternal appetite after the hidden manna: neither ſhall continued <hi>enjoyment</hi> breed loathing; they ſhall never think they have too much; therefore it is added, <hi>neither ſhall the ſun light on them, nor any heat,</hi> Rev. vii. 16. The enjoyment of God and the Lamb will be ever freſh and new to them, through the ages of eternity: for they ſhall drink of <hi>living fountains of waters,</hi> where new waters are continually ſpringing up in abundance, ver. 17. They ſhall eat of the tree of life, which, for variety, affords <hi>twelve manner of fruits,</hi> and theſe always new and freſh, for it yields, <hi>every month,</hi> Rev. xxii. 2. Their joy ſhall be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unmixed,</hi> without any dregs of ſorrow: not ſlight and momentary, but ſolid and everlaſting, without interruption. They will <hi>enter into joy,</hi> Matth. xxv. 21. <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> The expreſſion is ſomewhat unuſual, and brings me in mind of that word of our ſuffering Redeemer, Mark xiv. 34. <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful unto death.</hi> His ſoul was <hi>beſet with ſorrows,</hi> as the word, there uſed, will bear, the floods of ſorrow went <hi>round about</hi> him, encompaſſing him on every hand; whitherſoever he turned his eyes, ſorrow was before him; it ſprang in upon them from heaven, earth, and hell, all at once: thus was he entered into ſorrow, and therefore ſaith, Pſal. lxix. 2. <hi>I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</hi> Now wherefore all this, but that his own <hi>might enter into joy?</hi> Joy ſometimes enters into <hi>us</hi> now, with much ado to get acceſs, while we are compaſſed with ſorrows: but then joy ſhall not only enter into us, but we ſhall enter into <hi>it,</hi> and ſwim for ever in an ocean of joy: where we will ſee nothing but <hi>joy,</hi> whitherſoever we turn

our eyes. The preſence and enjoyment of God and the Lamb will ſatisfy us with <hi>pleaſures for evermore:</hi> and the glory of our ſouls and bodies, ariſing from thence, will afford us everlaſting delight. The ſpirit of heavineſs, how cloſely ſoever it cleaves to any of the ſaints now, ſhall drop off then: their weeping ſhall be turned into ſongs of joy, and bottles of tears ſhall iſſue in rivers of pleaſures. Happy they who now <hi>ſow in tears,</hi> which ſhall ſpring up in joy, in heaven, and bow their heads there with a weight of glory upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of the <hi>ſociety</hi> in this kingdom of the ſaints.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. In the <hi>laſt</hi> place, The kingdom ſhall <hi>endure for ever.</hi> As every thing in it is <hi>eternal,</hi> ſo the ſaints ſhall have an undoubted certainty and full <hi>aſſurance</hi> of the eternal duration of the ſame. This is a neceſſary ingredient in perfect <hi>happineſs:</hi> for the leaſt uncertainty, as to the continuance of any good with one, is not without ſome fear, anxiety and torment; and therefore is utterly inconſiſtent with perfect happineſs. But the glorified ſhall never have fear, nor cauſe of fear, of any loſs: they ſhall be <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſſ. iv. 17. They ſhall all attain the full perſwaſion, that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate them from the love of God; nor from the full enjoyment of him, for ever. The inheritance <hi>reſerved in heaven</hi> is <hi>incorruptible;</hi> it hath no principle of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in itſelf, to make it liable to decay, but endures for evermore: It is <hi>undefiled:</hi> nothing from without can mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hitherto of the <hi>nature</hi> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, Proceed we now to ſpeak of the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of the ſaints into this their kingdom; where I ſhall briefly touch upon two things, (1) The formal <hi>admiſſion,</hi> in the call unto them from the Judge, to <hi>come</hi> to their kingdom (2.) The <hi>quality</hi> in which they are admitted and introduced to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Their <hi>admiſſion,</hi> the text ſhews to be by a voice from the throne; the King calling to them from the throne, before angels and men, to <hi>come</hi> to their kingdom. <hi>Come</hi> and <hi>go</hi> are but ſhort words: but they will be ſuch as will afford matter of thought to all mankind, through the ages of eternity; ſince upon the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends everlaſting happineſs, and upon the other everlaſting miſery. Now our Lord bids the worſt of ſinners, who hear the goſpel, <hi>Come:</hi> but the moſt part <hi>will not come</hi> unto him. Some few, whoſe hearts are touched by his Spirit, do embrace the call, and their ſouls within them ſay, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee:</hi> they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Lord, forſake the world and their luſts for him; they bear his yoke, and caſt it not off, no not in the heat of the day, when the weight of it (perhaps) makes them ſweat the blood out of their bodies. Behold the fools! ſaith the carnal world, whither
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:045042_0311_101F806E74510160"/>
are they going? But ſtay a little. O fooliſh world! From the ſame mouth, whence they had the call they are now following, another call ſhall come which will make amends for all, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſaints ſhall find an expreſſible ſweetneſs in this call, to <hi>come.</hi> (1.) Hereby Jeſus Chriſt ſhews his <hi>deſire</hi> of their <hi>ſociety</hi> in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per houſe, that they may be ever with him there. Thus he will open his heart unto them, as ſometimes he did to his Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, ſaying, <hi>Father, I will that they—be with me, where I am,</hi> John xvii. 24. Now <hi>the travel of his ſoul</hi> ſtands before the throne, not only the ſouls, but the bodies he has redeemed: and they muſt <hi>come,</hi> for he muſt be compleatly ſatisfied. (2.) Hereby they are ſolemnly <hi>invited</hi> to the marriage ſupper of the Lamb. They were invited to the lower table, by the voice of the ſervants, and the ſecret workings of the Spirit within them; and they came, and did partake of the feaſt of divine communications in the lower houſe: but Jeſus Chriſt in perſon ſhall invite them, before all the world, to the higher table. (3.) By this he <hi>admits</hi> them into the <hi>manſions</hi> of glory. The keys of heaven hang at the girdle of our royal Mediator: <hi>All power in heaven</hi> is given to him, (Mat. xxvii. 18.) and none get in thither, but whom he admits. When they were living on earth, with the reſt of the world, he opened the everlaſting doors of their hearts, entred into them himſelf, and ſhut them again; ſo as ſin could never re-enter, to reign there as formerly: and now he opens heaven's doors to them, draws his doves into the ark, and ſhuts them in there; ſo as the law, death and hell, can never get them out again. The ſaints in this life were ſtill <hi>labouring to enter into that reſt:</hi> but Satan was always pulling them back, their corruption always drawing them down; in ſo much that they have ſometimes been left to hang by a hair of a promiſe, (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) not without fears of falling into the lake of fire: but now Chriſt gives the word for their admiſſion; they are brought in, and put beyond all hazard. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Thus he ſpeaks to them, as the perſon <hi>introducing</hi> them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom, into the preſence-chamber of the Great King, and unto the throne. JESUS CHRIST is the Great Secretary of heaven, whoſe it is to bring the ſaints into the gracious preſence of God: and to whom alone it belongs to bring them into the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in heaven. Truly heaven would be a ſtrange place to them, if Jeſus was not there: but the Son will introduce his brethren into his Father's kingdom; they ſhall go in <hi>with him to the marriage,</hi> Matth. xxv. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Let us conſider in what <hi>quality</hi> they are introduced by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> He brings them in as <hi>the bleſſed of his Father:</hi> ſo runs the call from the throne, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. It is <hi>Chriſt's Father's houſe</hi> they are to <hi>come</hi> into: therefore he puts them in mind, that they are bleſſed of his Father; dear to the Father, as
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:045042_0312_101F807090F5CFE8"/>
well as to himſelf. This is it that makes heaven <hi>home</hi> to them; namely, that it is Chriſt's Father's houſe, where we may be aſſured of welcome, being married to the Son, and being his Father's choice for that very end. He brings them in for <hi>his Father's ſake,</hi> as well as for his own: they are the bleſſed of his Father; who, as he is the fountain of the Deity, is alſo the fountain of all bleſſings conferred on the children of men. They are theſe to whom God <hi>deſigned well</hi> from eternity. They were bleſſed in the eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, being elected to everlaſting life: at the opening of the book of life, their names are found written therein. So that, bringing them to the kingdom, he doth but bring them to what the Father, from all eternity, deſigned for them; being ſaved by the Son, they are <hi>ſaved according to his (i. e.</hi> the Father's) <hi>purpoſe,</hi> 2 Tim. i. 9. They are theſe to whom the Father has <hi>ſpoken well.</hi> He ſpake well to them in his word, which muſt now receive its full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They had his promiſe of the kingdom, lived and died in the faith of it: and now they come to receive the thing promiſed, Unto them he has <hi>done well.</hi> A gift is often in ſcripture called <hi>a bleſſing:</hi> and God's bleſſing is ever real, like <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s bleſſing, by which <hi>Jacob</hi> became his heir: they were all by grace juſtified, ſanctified, and made to perſevere unto the end; now they are raiſed up in glory, and being tried, ſtand in the judgment: what remains then, but that God crown his own work of grace in them, in giving them their kingdom, in the full <hi>enjoyment</hi> of himſelf for ever? <hi>Finally,</hi> They are theſe whom God has <hi>conſecrated:</hi> the which alſo is a ſcripture notion of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> 1 Cor. x. 16. God ſet them apart for himſelf, to be kings and prieſts unto him; and the Mediator intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them as ſuch to their kingdom and prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>

Now is the general aſſembly of the firſt-born before the throne: their minority is overpaſt, and the time appointed of the Father for their receiving of their inheritance is come. The Mediator <hi>purchaſed</hi> the inheritance for them with his own blood; their rights and evidences were drawn long ago, and regiſtred in the Bible; nay, they had <hi>inſoftment</hi> of their inheritance in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Jeſus Chriſt, as their proxy, when he aſcended into heaven, <hi>whither the forerunner is, for us, entered,</hi> Heb. vi. 20.

                  <p>USE. I ſhall ſhut up my diſcourſe on this ſubject, with a word of <hi>application,</hi> (1.) To all who claim a right to this kingdom, (2.) To theſe who have indeed a right to it. (3.) To theſe who have not a right thereto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Since it is evident, there is no promiſcuous <hi>admiſſion</hi> into the kingdom of heaven, and none do obtain it, but theſe whoſe <hi>claim</hi> to it is ſolemnly tried by the great Judge, and, after trial, ſuſtained as good and valid; it is neceſſary that all of us impartially <hi>try</hi> and examine, whether, according to the laws of the kingdom, contained in the holy ſcriptures, we can verify and make good our <hi>claim</hi> to this <hi>kingdom?</hi> The hopes of heaven, which moſt men have, are built on ſuch ſandy foundations, as can never abide the trial; having no ground in the word, but in their own deluded fancy: ſuch hopes will leave thoſe who entertain them, miſerably diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at laſt. Wherefore it is not only our duty, but our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to put the matter to a fair trail, in time. If we find, we have no right to heaven indeed, we are yet in the way; and what we have not, we may obtain: but if we find we have a right to it, we will then have the comfort of a happy proſpect into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; which is the greateſt comfort one is capable of in the world. If ye enquire, <hi>How ye may know whither ye have a right to heaven, or not?</hi> I anſwer, ye muſt know that by the <hi>ſtate</hi> ye are now in. If ye are yet in your natural ſtate, ye are children of wrath, and not children of this kingdom: for that ſtate, to them who live and die in it, iſſues in eternal miſery. If you be brought into the <hi>ſtate of grace,</hi> you have a juſt claim to the ſtate of glory; for grace will certainly iſſue in glory at length. This kingdom is an <hi>inheritance,</hi> which none but the <hi>children</hi> of God can juſtly claim: now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the children of God, by <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>union with Chriſt</hi> his Son; <hi>and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom viii. 17. Theſe then are the great points, upon which one's evidences for the ſtate of glory do depend. And therefore I refer you to what is ſaid on the ſtate of grace, for clearing of you as to your right to glory.</p>
                  <p>If you be heirs of glory, <hi>the kingdom of God is within you,</hi> by virtue of your regeneration and union with Chriſt. (1.) <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

of heaven</hi> has the throne in thy heart, if thou haſt a right to that kingdom: Chriſt is <hi>in</hi> thee: and God is <hi>in</hi> thee; and having choſen him for thy portion, thy ſoul has taken up its everlaſting reſt in him, and gets no kindly reſt but in him; as the dove, until ſhe came into the ark. To him the ſoul habitually inclines, by virtue of the new nature, the divine nature, which the heirs of glory are partakers of, Pſal lxxiii. 25.

<q>I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.</q>
Thy <hi>mind</hi> is <hi>enlightened</hi> in the knowledge of the laws of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the Spirit of the Lord, the inſtructor of all the heirs of glory: for whoever may want inſtruction, ſure an heir to a crown ſhall not want it.
<q>It is written in the prophets; and they ſhall all be taught of God.</q>
John vi. 45. Therefore though father and mother leave them early, or be in no concern about their Chriſtian education, and they be ſoon put to work for their daily bread; yet they ſhall not lack teaching. Withal thy <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>charged,</hi> and thou beareſt God's image, which conſiſts in <hi>righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. iv. 24. Thy ſoul is reconciled to the whole <hi>law</hi> of God, and at war with all known ſin. In vain do they pretend to the holy kindgom, who are not holy in heart and life; for <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii. 14. If heaven is a reſt, it is for ſpiritual labourers, and not for loiterers. If it is an eternal triumph, they are not in the way to it, who avoid the ſpiritual warfare, and are in no care to ſubdue corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſiſt temptation, and to cut their way to it, through the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the devil, the world, and the fleſh.

If it is not the things that are ſeen, but the things that are not ſeen, which thy heart is in greateſt care and concern to abtain; if thou art driving a trade with heaven, and thy chief buſineſs lies there; it is a ſign thy treaſure is there, for thy heart is there. But if thou art of theſe, who wonder why ſo much ado about heaven and eternal life, as if leſs might ſerve the turn: thou art like to have nothing ado with it at all. Carnal men value themſelves moſt on their <hi>treaſures upon earth;</hi> with them, the things that are not ſeen, are weighed down by the things that are ſeen, and no loſſes do ſo much affect them as earthly loſſes: but the heirs of the crown of glory will value themſelves moſt on their <hi>treaſures in heaven,</hi> and will not put their private eſtate in the balance with their kingdom: nor will the loſs of the former go ſo near their hearts, as the thoughts of the loſs of the latter. Where theſe firſt-fruits of heaven are to be found, the eternal weight of glory will ſurely follow after; while the want of them muſt be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the word, to be an unconteſtible evidence of an heir of wrath.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let the heirs of the kingdom behave themſelves ſuitable to their character and dignity. Live as having the faith and hope of this glorious kingdom: let your <hi>converſation</hi> be <hi>in heaven,</hi> Philip. iii. 20. Let your ſouls delight in communion with God while ye are on earth, ſince ye look for your happineſs in communion with him in heaven. Let your ſpeech and actions ſavour of heaven: and, in your manner of life, look like the country to which ye are going; that it may be ſaid of you, as of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s brethren, Judges viii. 18. Each one <hi>reſembled the children of a king.</hi> Maintain a holy contempt of the world, and of the things of the world. Although others, whoſe earthly things are their beſt things, do ſet their hearts upon them; yet it becomes you to ſet your feet on them, ſince your beſt things are above. This world is but the country, through which lies your road to <hi>Immanuel</hi>'s land; therefore paſs through it as pilgrims and ſtrangers; and dip not into the incumbrances of it, ſo as to retard you in your journey. It is unworthy of one born to a palace, to ſet his heart on a cottage, to dwell there: and of one running for a prize of gold, to go off his way, to gather the ſtones of the brook: but much more is it unworthy of an heir of the kingdom of heaven, to be hid among the ſtuff of this world, when he ſhould be going on to rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> his crown. The prize ſet before you, challengeth your outmoſt zeal activity and diligence; and holy courage, reſolution, and magnanimity, become thoſe who are to inherit the crown. Ye cannot come at it, without ſighting your way to it, through difficulties from without, and from within: but the <hi>kingdom</hi> before you is ſufficient to balance them all, tho' ye ſhould be called to reſiſt even unto blood. Prefer Chriſt's <hi>croſs</hi> before the world's <hi>crown;</hi> and <hi>wants</hi> in the way of duty before <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>wealth</hi> in the way of ſin; <hi>Chooſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. xi. 25. In a common inn, ſtrangers (perhaps) fare better than the children: but here lies the difference, the children are to pay nothing for what they have got; but the ſtrangers get their bill and muſt pay compleatly for all they have had. Did we conſider the wicked's after-reckoning for all the ſmiles of common providence they meet with in the world, we would not grudge them <hi>their good things</hi> here; nor take it amiſs that God keeps our beſt things laſt. Heaven will make up all the ſaints loſſes, and all tears ſhall be wiped away from their eyes there.</p>
                  <p>It is worth obſerving, that there is ſuch a variety of ſcripture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of heaven's happineſs, as may ſuit every afflicted caſe of the ſaints.

A throne</hi> to ſit upon, a <hi>crown</hi> on their head, and a <hi>ſceptre</hi> in their hand, will raiſe it up again. Are they reduced to <hi>poverty?</hi> Heaven is a <hi>treaſure.</hi> If they be forced to <hi>to quit their own habitations,</hi> yet <hi>Chriſt's Father</hi>'s <hi>houſe</hi> is ready for them.

ordinances,</hi> the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are <hi>the temple</hi> there, whither they are going; a temple, the doors of which none can ſhut: if their life be full of bitterneſs, heaven is a <hi>paradiſe</hi> for <hi>pleaſure.</hi> If they groan under the remains of ſpiritual bondage, there is <hi>a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty</hi> abiding them. Do their <hi>defiled garments</hi> make them aſhamed? The day cometh, in which their <hi>robes</hi> ſhall be <hi>white,</hi> pure and ſpotleſs.

Are they <hi>judged unworthy of ſociety</hi> in the world? they ſhall be <hi>admitted into the ſociety of angels</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

If they are in darkneſs here, eternal <hi>light</hi> is there. If they grapple with <hi>death,</hi> there they ſhall have <hi>everlaſting life.</hi> And to ſum up all in one word, <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things,</hi> Rev. xxi. 7. He ſhall have peace and plenty, profit and pleaſue, every thing deſirable; full ſatisfaction to his moſt enlarged deſires Let the expectants of heaven, then, lift up their heads with joy, gird up their loins, and ſo run, as they may obtain; trampling on every thing that may hinder them in the way to the <hi>kingdom.</hi> Let them never account any duty too hard, nor any croſs too heavy, nor any pains too much, ſo as they may obtain the crown of glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let thoſe who have no <hi>right</hi> to the kingdom of heaven, be ſtirred up to <hi>ſeek</hi> it with all diligence. Now is the time, wherein the children of wrath may become heirs of glory: and when the way to everlaſting happineſs is opened, it is no time to ſit ſtill and loiter. Raiſe up your hearts towards the glory that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; and do not always ly along on this periſhing earth. What can all your worldly enjoyments avail you, while you have no ſolid ground to expect heaven, after this life is gone? Theſe riches and honours, profits and pleaſures, that muſt be buried with us, and cannot accompany us into another world, are but a wretched portion, and will leave men comfortleſs at long run. Ah! why are men ſo fond, <hi>in their life-time to receive their good things!</hi> why are they not rather in care, to ſecure an intereſt in the kingdom of heaven, which would never be taken from them, but afford them a portion, to make them happy through the ages of eternity! if you deſire <hi>honour,</hi> there you may have the higheſt honour, and which will laſt, when the world's honours are laid in the duſt; if <hi>riches,</hi> heaven will yield you a treaſure; and, there are <hi>pleaſures</hi> for evermore. O! be not deſpiſers of the pleaſant land, neither judge yourſelves unworthy of eternal life: but marry the heir, and heaven ſhall be your dowry; cloſe with Chriſt, as he is offered to you in the goſpel, and ye ſhall inherit all things. Walk in the way of holineſs, and it will lead you to the kingdom. Fight againſt ſin and Satan, and ye ſhall receive the crown. Forſake the world, and the doors of heaven will be open to receive you.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The laſt thing our Lord did, before he left the earth, was, he <hi>lift up his hands, and bleſſed</hi> his diſciples, Luke xxiv. 50, 51. But the laſt thing he will do, before he leave the throne, is to <hi>curſe and condemn</hi> his enemies; as we learn from the text, which contains the dreadful <hi>ſentence,</hi> wherein the everlaſting miſery of the wicked is wrapt up. In which three things may be taken notice of <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>quality</hi> of the condemned, <hi>ye curſed.</hi> The Judge finds the curſe of the law upon them as tranſgreſſors, and ſends them away with it, from his preſence, into hell, there to be fully execute upon them, 2<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>puniſhment</hi> which they are adjudged to; and to which they were always bound over, by virtue of the curſe. And it is twofold, the puniſhment <hi>loſs,</hi> in ſeparation from God and Chriſt, <hi>Depart from me:</hi> and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> in moſt exquiſite and extreme torments, <hi>Depart from me into fire.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> The aggravation of their torments. (1.) They are <hi>ready</hi> for them, they are not to expect a moment's reſpite. The fire is <hi>prepared,</hi> and ready to catch hold of thoſe who are thrown into it. (2.) They will have the ſociety of <hi>devils</hi> in their torments, being ſhut up with them in hell. They muſt depart into the ſame <hi>fire prepared for</hi> Beelzebub the prince of devils, <hi>and his angels;</hi> namely, other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate angels who fell with him, and became devils. It is ſaid to be prepared <hi>for them;</hi> becauſe they ſinned, and were condemned to hell, before man ſinned. This ſpeaks further terror to the damned, that they muſt go into the ſame torments, and place of torment with the

They hearkned to his temptations, and they muſt partake in his torments: <hi>his works</hi> they would do, and they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>the wages,</hi> which is death.

As to the <hi>curſe</hi> under which the damned ſhall be ſhut up in hell; it is the terrible ſentence of the law, by which they are bound over to the wrath of God, as tranſgreſſors. This curſe does not firſt ſeize them, when, ſtanding before the tribunal, they receive their ſentence: but they were born under it, they led their life under it in this world, they died under it, roſe with it out of their graves; and the Judge finding it upon them, ſends them away with it, into the pit; where it ſhall ly on them through all the ages of eternity. By nature all men are under the curſe; but it is removed from the elect, by virtue of their union with Chriſt. It abides on the reſt of ſinful mankind, and by it they are devoted to deſtruction, <hi>ſeparated to evil,</hi> as one may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>curſe</hi> from Deut. xxix. 21. <hi>And the Lord ſhall ſeparate him unto evil.</hi> Thus ſhall the damned, for ever, be perſons <hi>devoted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</hi> ſeparate and ſet apart from among the reſt of mankind, unto evil, as veſſels of wrath, ſet up for marks to the arrows of divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Sometimes they are given up to their <hi>vile affections,</hi> that they have no more command over them, Rom. i. 26. So their luſts grow up more and more towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I may ſo ſpeak. As in heaven grace comes to its perfection, ſo in hell ſin arrives at its higeſt pitch; and as ſin is thus advancing upon the man, he is the nearer and the liker to hell. There are three things that have a fearful aſpect here. <hi>Firſt,</hi> When every thing that might do good to mens ſouls, is blaſted to them; ſo that their <hi>bleſſings</hi> are <hi>curſed,</hi> (Mal. ii. 2) ſermons, prayers, admonitions, and reproofs, which are powerful towards others, are quite inefficacious to them. 2<hi>dly,</hi> When men go on ſinning ſtill, in the face of plain rebukes from the Lord, in ordinances and providences: God meets them with rods in the way of their ſin, as it were ſtriking them back; yet they ruſh forward. What can be more like hell, where the Lord is always ſmiting, and the damned always ſinning againſt him? <hi>Laſtly,</hi> When every thing in one's lot is turned into fuel to one's luſts. Thus adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and proſperity, poverty and wealth, the want of ordinances and the enjoyment of them, do all but nouriſh the corruptions of many. Their vicious ſtomachs corrupt whatſoever they receive, and all does but increaſe noxious humours.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, The puniſhment of loſs,</hi> which the damned ſhall undergo, is <hi>ſeparation from the Lord,</hi> as we learn from the text, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed.</hi> This will be a ſtone upon their grave's mouth, as <hi>the talent of lead,</hi> Zech. v. 7, 8. that will hold them down for ever. The, ſhall be eternally <hi>ſeparated</hi> from God and Chriſt.

They will be <hi>locally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from the Man Chriſt, and ſhall never come into the ſeat of the bleſſed, where he appears in his glory, but be caſt out into <hi>utter darkneſs,</hi> Matth. xxii. 13. They cannot indeed be <hi>locally ſeparated</hi> from God, they cannot be in a place where he is not, ſince he is, and will be preſent every-where:
<q>If I make my bed in hell,</q>
ſays the Pſalmiſt, "behold thou art there," Pſal. cxxxix 8. But they ſhall be miſerable beyond expreſſion, in a <hi>relative ſeparation</hi> from God. Though he will be preſent in the very center of their ſouls, (if I may ſo expreſs it) while they are wrapt up in fiery flames, in <hi>utter darkneſs,</hi> it ſhall not only be to feed them with the vinegar of his wrath, to entertain them with the emanations of his revenging juſtice; but they ſhall never taſte more of his goodneſs and bounty, nor have the leaſt glimpſe of hope from him. They will ſee his heart to be abſolutely alienated from them, and that it cannot be towards them; but that they are the party againſt whom the Lord will have an indignation for ever. They ſhall be deprived of the glorious preſence and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: they ſhall have no part in the beatiſick viſion, nor ſee any thing in God towards them, but one wave of wrath roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the back of another. This will bring upon them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming floods of ſorrows for evermore. They ſhall never taſte of the rivers of pleaſures the ſaints in heaven enjoy; but ſhall have an everlaſting winter, and a perpetual night, becauſe the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> has departed from them, and ſo they are left in utter darkneſs. So great as heaven's happineſs is, ſo great will their loſs be; for they can have none of it for ever.</p>
                  <p>This ſeparation of the wicked from God will be, (1.) an <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſeparation.</hi> Now they depart from him, they will not come to him, though they are called, intreated, and obteſted to
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:045042_0322_101F80956C691078"/>
come: but then they ſhall be driven away from him, when they would gladly abide with him. Although the queſtion,
<q>What is thy beloved more than another beloved?</q>
is frequent now amongſt the deſpiſers of the goſpel, there will be no ſuch queſtion among all the damned crew; for then they will ſee that man's happineſs is only to be found in the <hi>enjoyment of God,</hi> and that the loſs of him is a loſs that can never be balanced. (2) It will alſo be a <hi>total</hi> and <hi>utter ſeparation.</hi> Albeit the wicked are in this life ſeparated from God, yet there is a kind of intercourſe betwixt them: he gives them many good gifts, and they give him, at leaſt, ſome good words: ſo that the peace is not altogether hopeleſs. But then there ſhall be a <hi>total ſeparation,</hi> the damned being <hi>caſt into utter darkneſs,</hi> where there will not be the leaſt gleam of light or favour from the Lord; the which will put an end unto all their fair words to him. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It ſhall be <hi>a final ſeparation:</hi> they will part with him, never more to meet, being ſhut up under everlaſting horror and deſpair. The match betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and unbelievers, which has ſo often been carried forward, and put back again, ſhall then be broken up for ever: and never ſhall one meſſage of favour or good-will go betwixt the parties any more.</p>
                  <p>This puniſhment of <hi>loſs,</hi> in a <hi>total</hi> and <hi>final</hi> ſeparation from God, is a miſery beyond what mortals can conceive, and which the dreadful experience of the damned can only ſufficiently unfold. But that we may have ſome conception of the <hi>horror</hi> of it, let the following things be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> God is the chief good, and therefore to be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> muſt be the <hi>chief evil.</hi> Our native country, our relations, and our life, are good: and therefore, to be deprived of them, we reckon a great evil: and the better any thing is, ſo much the greater evil is the loſs of it: wherefore God being the chief good, and no good comparable to him, there can be no loſs ſo great as the loſs of <hi>God.</hi> The full enjoyment of him is the higheſt pinacle of happineſs the creature is capable of arriving at: to be fully and finally ſeparated from him muſt then be the loweſt ſtep of miſery which the rational creature muſt be reduced to. To be caſt off by men, by good men, by the beſt of men, is heavy: what muſt it then be, to be rejected of God, of goodneſs itſelf!</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> God is the fountain of all goodneſs, from which all goodneſs flows unto the creatures, and by which it is continued in them, and to them. Whatever goodneſs or perfection, natural as well as moral, is in any creature, it is from God, and depends upon him, as the light is from, and depends on the ſun: for every created being, as ſuch, is a dependent one. Wherefore a total ſeparation from God, wherein all comfortable communication betwixt God and a rational creature is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely blocked up, muſt of neceſſity bring along with it a <hi>total eclipſe</hi> of all light of comfort and eaſe whatſoever. If there is but one win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or open place, in a houſe, and that be quite ſhut up; it is evident

All the rivulets of comfort we drink of, within or without ourſelves, come from God as their ſpring head: the courſe of which toward us being ſtopt, of neceſſity they muſt all dry up.

Tremble at the thoughts of rejection and <hi>ſeparation from God:</hi> By whomſoever men are rejected on the earth, they ordinarily find ſome pity to them; but if ye be thus ſeparated from God, ye will find all doors ſhut againſt you. Ye will find no pity from any in heaven: neither ſaints nor angels will pity them whom God has utterly caſt off: none will pity you in hell, where there is no love but lothing; all being lothed of God, lothing him, and lothing one another. This is a day of loſſes and fears. I ſhew you a loſs, ye would do well to fear in time; be afraid leſt you loſe God; if ye do, a long eternity will be ſpent in roring out lamentations for this loſs. O horrid ſtupidity! men are in a mighty care and concern to prevent worldly loſſes: but they are in hazard of loſing the enjoyment of God for ever and ever, in hazard of loſing heaven, the communion of the bleſſed, and all good things for ſoul and body in another world: yet as careleſs in that matter, as if they were uncapable of thought. O! compare this day with the day our text aims at. This day is heaven opened to them, who hitherto have rejected Chriſt, and <hi>yet there is room,</hi> if they will come: but that day the doors ſhall be ſhut. Now Chriſt is ſaying unto you, <hi>Come:</hi> then he will ſay, <hi>Depart:</hi> ſeeing ye would not come, when ye were bidden. Now pity is ſhown: the Lord pities you, his ſervants pity you, and tell you, that the pit is before you, and cry to you, that ye do yourſelves no harm; but then ye ſhall have no pity from God nor man.</p>

All imaginary pleaſures on earth would never prevail with the moſt voluptuous man, to venture to lodge but one half hour in a burning fiery furnace; nor would all the wealth in the world prevail with the moſt covetous to do it. Yet, on much lower terms, do moſt men, in effect, expoſe themſelves to <hi>everlaſting fire</hi> in hell, which is more vehement and terrible
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:045042_0327_101F80A593884E20"/>
than any fire we on earth are acquainted with; as will appear by the following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As in heaven grace being brought to its perfection, profit and pleaſure do alſo arrive at their height there; ſo ſin being come to its height in hell, the evil of puniſhment doth alſo arrive at its <hi>perfection</hi> there. Wherefore, as the joys in heaven are far greater than any joys which the ſaints obtain on earth, ſo the puniſhments of hell muſt be greater than any earthly torments whatſoever; not only in reſpect of the continuance of them, but alſo in reſpect of <hi>vehemency and exquiſiteneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why are the things of the other world repreſented to us, in an earthly dreſs, in the word; but that the weakneſs of our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities in ſuch matters (which the Lord is pleaſed to condeſcend unto) does require it; it being always ſuppoſed, that theſe things of the other world are in their kind more perfect, than that by which they are repreſented? When heaven is repreſented to us under the notion of a city, with gates of pearl, and the ſtreet of gold; we look not to find gold and pearls there, which are ſo mightily prized on earth, but ſomething more excellent than theſe fineſt and moſt precious things in the world: when therefore we hear of <hi>hell-fire,</hi> it is neceſſary we underſtand by it ſomething more vehement, piercing, and tormenting, than any fire ever ſeen by our eyes, And here it is worth conſidering, that the torments of hell are held forth under ſeveral other notions than that of <hi>fire</hi> ſimply: and the reaſon of it is plain; namely, that hereby, what of <hi>horror</hi> is wanting in one notion of hell, is ſupplied by another. Why is heaven's happineſs repreſented under the various notions of <hi>a treaſure, a paradiſe, a feaſt, a reſt,</hi> &amp;c. but that there is not one of theſe things ſufficient to expreſs it? Even ſo hell-torments are repreſented under the notion of fire: which the damned are caſt into. A dreadful repreſentation indeed! yet not ſufficient to expreſs the miſery of the ſtate of ſinners in them. Wherefore we hear alſo of <hi>the ſecond death,</hi> (Rev. xx. 6.) for the damned in hell ſhall be ever dying: of "the wine-preſs of the wrath of God," (chap. xiv. 19.) wherein they will be
<q>trodden in anger, trampled in the Lord's fury,</q>
(Iſa. lxiii. 3.) preſſed, broken, and bruiſed, without end: <hi>the worm that dieth not,</hi> (Mark ix. 44.) which ſhall eternally gnaw them: <hi>a bottomleſs pit,</hi> where they will be ever ſinking, Rev. xx. 3. It is not ſimply called <hi>a fire,</hi> but
<q>the lake of fire and brimſtone,</q>
(ver. 19)
<q>a lake of fire burning with brimſtone,</q>
(chap xix 20) than which, one can imagine nothing more dreadful. Yet, becauſe fire gives light, and <hi>light</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, Eccleſ. xi. 7) <hi>is ſweet,</hi> there is no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our fire cannot affect a ſpirit, but by way of ſympathy with the body, to which it is united; but hell fire will not only pierce into the bodies, but directly into the <hi>ſouls</hi> of the damned; for it is <hi>prepared for the devil and his angels,</hi> theſe wicked ſpirits, whom no fire on earth can hurt. <hi>Job</hi> complains heavily under the chaſtiſe-men: of God's <hi>fatherly</hi> hand, ſaying, <q>The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poiſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirit,</q>
Job vi. 4. But how will the ſpirits of the damned be pierced with the arrows of <hi>revenging</hi> juſtice! how will they be drunk up with the poiſon of the <hi>curſe</hi> on theſe arrows! how vehement muſt that fire be that pierceth directly into the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and makes an everlaſting burning in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the moſt lively and tender part of a man, wherein wounds or pain are moſt intolerable!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>preparation</hi> of this fire evinceth the inexpreſſible vehemency and dreadfulneſs of it. The text calls it <hi>prepared fire,</hi> yea, <hi>the</hi> prepared fire, by way of eminency. As <hi>the three children</hi> were not caſt into an ordinary fire, but a fire prepared on a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſign, which therefore was <hi>exceeding hot,</hi> the furnace being heated ſeven times more than ordinary, Dan. ii. 19, 22. So the damned ſhall find in hell a prepared fire, the like to which was never prepared by human art; it is a fire of God's own preparing, the product of infinite wiſdom on a particular deſign, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the moſt ſtrict and ſevere <hi>divine juſtice</hi> againſt ſin; which may ſufficiently evidence to us the unconceivable exquiſiteneſs thereof. God always acts in a peculiar way becoming his own infinite greatneſs, whether for, or againſt the creature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the things he hath <hi>prepared for</hi> them that love him, are great and good beyond expreſſion or conception; ſo one may conclude, that the things <hi>he hath prepared againſt</hi> thoſe who hate him, are great and terrible beyond what men can either ſay, or think of them. The pile of <hi>Tophet</hi> is <hi>fire and much wood,</hi> (the coals of that fire are <hi>coals of juniper,</hi> a kind of wood, which ſet on fire burns moſt fiercely, Pſal cxx. 4.) <hi>and the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone, doth kindle it,</hi> Iſa. xxx. 33. Fire is more or leſs violent, according to the <hi>matter</hi> of it, and the <hi>breath</hi> by which it is blown: what heart then can fully conceive the horror of <hi>coals of juniper,</hi> blown up with <hi>the breath of the Lord?</hi> Nay, God himſelf will be <hi>a conſuming fire</hi> (Deut. iv. 24) to the damned; intimately preſent, as <hi>a devouring fire,</hi> in their ſouls and bodies. It is a fearful thing to fall into a fire, or to be ſhut up in a fiery furnace, on earth: but the terror of theſe evaniſheth, when one conſiders, how
<q>fearful it is to fall into the hands of the living God,</q>
which is the lot of the damned; for
<q>who ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? Who ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</q>

But (2.) <hi>It ſhall never have an end.</hi> The firſt who entered into the eternity of woe, is as far from the end of it, as the laſt, who ſhall go thither, will be at his entry. They who have laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out furtheſt into that occean, are as far from land, as they were the firſt moment they went into it: and thouſands of ages after this, they will be as far from it as ever: Wherefore, <hi>eternity,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is a duration that hath a beginning, but no end. It is a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without a middle, a beginning without an end. After millions of years paſt in it, ſtill it is <hi>a beginning.</hi> God's wrath in hell, will ever be <hi>the wrath to come.</hi> But there is <hi>no middle</hi> in eternity. When millions of ages are paſt in eternity, what is paſt bears no proportion of what is to come; no not ſo much as one drop of water, falling from the tip of one's finger, bears to all the waters of the occean. There is <hi>no end</hi> of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while God is, it ſhall be. It is an entry without an out-gate, a continual ſucceſſion of ages, a glaſs always running, which ſhall never run out.</p>

                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> The <hi>damned</hi> themſelves ſhall be eternal: they will have a being for ever, and will never be ſubſtantially deſtroyed, or annihilated. To what end is the fire eternal; if theſe who are caſt into it, be not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in it! It is plain, the everlaſting continuance of the fire, is an aggravation of the miſery of the damned: but ſurely, if they be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, or ſubſtantially deſtroyed, it is all a caſe to them, whether the fire be everlaſting, or not. Nay, but they depart into everlaſting fire, to be everlaſtingly puniſhed in it; Matth xxv. 46. <hi>They ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</hi> Thus the execution of the ſentence, is a certain diſcovery of the meaning of it. <hi>The worm,</hi> that <hi>dieth not,</hi> muſt have a ſubject to live in: they, who ſhall have <hi>no reſt, day nor night,</hi> (Rev. xiv. 11.) but ſhall be <hi>tormented day and night for ever and ever,</hi> (chap. xx. 10) will certainly have a <hi>being</hi> for ever and ever, and not be brought into a ſtate of eternal reſt in annihilation Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed they ſhall be: but their deſtruction will be an <hi>everlaſting deſtruction,</hi> (2 Theſſ. i 9.) a deſtruction of their <hi>well-being,</hi> but not of their <hi>being.</hi> What is deſtroyed, is not therefore annihilated; <hi>Art thou come to deſtroy us?</hi> ſaid the devil unto Jeſus Chriſt, Luke iv. 34. Howbeit the devils are afraid of <hi>torment,</hi> not of annihilation, Matth. viii. 29. <hi>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</hi> The ſtate of the damned is indeed a ſtate of <hi>death:</hi> but ſuch a death it is, as is oppoſite only to a <hi>happy life;</hi> as is clear from other notions of their ſtate, which neceſſarily include an <hi>eternal exiſtence,</hi> of which before. As they, who are dead in ſin, are dead to God and holineſs, yet live to ſin: ſo dying in hell, they live, but ſeparated from God, and his <hi>favour,</hi> in which <hi>life</hi> lies, Pſal. xxx 5. They ſhall ever be under the pang of death; ever dying, but never dead, or abſolutely void of life. How deſirable would ſuch a death be to them! but it will fly from them for ever. Could each one kill another there or could they, with their own hands, rent themſelves into lifeleſs pieces their miſery would quickly be at an end: but there they muſt live, who choſed death and refuſed life; for there death lives, and the end ever begins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>curſe</hi> ſhall fly upon them eternally, as the everlaſting chain, to hold them in the everlaſting fire; a chain that ſhall never be looſed, being fixed for ever about them, by the dreadful ſentence of the <hi>eternal judgment.</hi> This chain, which ſpurns the united force of devils held faſt by it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There will be no change of company for evermore, in that region of darkneſs Their torment in the fire will be everlaſting: they muſt live for ever in it. Several authors both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern, tell us of earthen flax, or <hi>Salamander</hi>'s hair; that cloth made of it, being caſt into the fire, is ſo far from being burnt or conſumed, that it is only made clean thereby, as other things are by waſhing But, however that is, it is certain, the damned ſhall be <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for ever and ever</hi> in hell fire, and not ſubſtantially deſtroyed, Rev xx. 10.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Their <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of their miſery ſhall be eternal, and they ſhall aſſuredly know that it will be eternal. How deſirable would it be in them, to have their ſenſes for ever locked up, and to loſe the conſciouſneſs of their own miſery; as one may rationally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to fare at length with ſome, in the puniſhment of death inflicted on them on earth, and as it is with ſome mad people in their miſerable caſe! but that agrees not with the notion of <hi>torment for ever and ever,</hi> nor <hi>the worm that dieth not.</hi> Nay, they will ever have a lively feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their miſery, and ſtrongeſt impreſſions of the wrath of God againſt them. And that dreadful intimation of the eternity of their puniſhment, made to them, by the Judge, in their ſentence, will fix ſuch impreſſions of the <hi>eternity</hi> of their miſerable ſtate upon their minds, as they will never be able to lay aſide, but will continue with them evermore, to complete their miſery. This will fill them with <hi>everlaſting deſpair,</hi> a moſt tormenting paſſion, which will continually rent their hearts, as it were in a thouſand pieces. To ſee floods of wrath <hi>ever</hi> coming, and <hi>never</hi> to ceaſe; to be ever in torment, and withal to know there ſhall <hi>never, never,</hi> be a releaſe, will be the cape-ſtone put on the miſery of the damned, If <hi>hope deferred, maketh the heart ſick,</hi> (Prov xiii. 12.) how killing will be, hope rooted up, ſlain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and buried for ever out of the creature's ſight! this will fill them with hatred and rage againſt God, their known irreconcileable enemy; and under it, they will roar for ever like wild bulls in a net, and fill the pit with blaſphemies evermore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I might here ſhew the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of the <hi>eternity</hi> of the puniſhment of the damned; but having already ſpoke of it in vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juſtice of God, in his ſubjecting men in their natural ſtate to eternal wrath, I only remind you of three things, (1.) The infinite <hi>dignity</hi> of the party offended by ſin, requires an infinite <hi>puniſhment</hi> to be inflicted for the vindication of his honour: ſince the demerit of ſin riſeth according to the dignity and excellency of the perſon againſt whom it is committed. The party offended is the great God, the chief
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:045042_0338_101F80CB41AF1B48"/>
good: the offender, a vile worm; in reſpect of perfection infinitely diſtant from God, to whom he is indebted for all that ever he had, implying any good, or perfection whatſoever. This then requires an infinite puniſhment to be inflicted on the ſinner, the which, ſince it cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in him, be infinite in <hi>value,</hi> muſt needs be infinite in <hi>duration,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>eternal.</hi> Sin is a kind of infinite evil, as it wrongs an infinite God; and the gult and defilement thereof is <hi>never</hi> taken away, but endures for ever, unleſs the Lord himſelf in mercy do remove it God, who is offended, is <hi>eternal,</hi> his being never comes to an end, the ſinful ſoul is <hi>immortal,</hi> and the man ſhall live for ever: the ſinner being <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> (Rom. v 6.) to expiate his gult, can never put away the offence; therefore it ever remains, unleſs the Lord do put it away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as in the elect, by his Son's blood. Wherefore the party offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the offender, and the offence, ever remaining, the puniſhment cannot but be eternal (2.) The ſinner <hi>would</hi> have continued the courſe of his provocations againſt God, for ever without end, if God had not put a check to it by death As long as they were capable to act againſt him, in this world, they did it; and therefore juſtly he will act againſt them, while he is; that is, for ever. God who judgeth of the will, intents, and inclinations of the heart may juſtly do againſt ſinners, in puniſhing, as they <hi>would</hi> have done againſt him, in ſinning. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> (though I put not the ſtreſs of the matter here, yet) it is juſt and reaſonable the damned ſuffer eternally, ſince they will ſin eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in hell, <hi>gnaſhing their teeth</hi> (Matth viii. 12.) under their pain, in rage, envy, and grudge, (compare Acts vii. 54. Pſal. cxii. 10. Luke xiii. 28.) and <hi>blaſpheming God</hi> there, (Rev. xvi. 21.) whither they are <hi>driven away in their wickedneſs,</hi> Prov. xiv. 42. That the wicked be puniſhed for their wickedneſs, is juſt: and it is noways inconſiſtent with juſtice, that the being of the creature be continued for ever: wherefore, it is juſt, that the damned, continuing wicked eternally, do ſuffer eternally for their wickedneſs. The miſery, under which they ſin, can neither free them from the debt of obedience, nor excuſe their ſinning, and make it blameleſs. The creature, as a creature, is bound unto obedience to his Creator, and no puniſhment, inflicted on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can free him from it, more than the malefactor's priſons, irons, whipping, and the like, do ſet him at liberty, to commit anew the crimes for which he is impriſoned, or whipt. Neither can the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned excuſe or make blameleſs their horrible ſinning under them, more than exquiſite pains, inflicted upon men on earth, can excuſe their murmuring, fretting, and blaſpheming againſt God under them: for it is not the wrath of God, but their own wicked nature, that is the true cauſe of their ſinning under it: and ſo the holy Jeſus bore the wrath of God, without ſo much as one unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought of God, and far leſs any one unbecoming word.</p>
                  <p>USE I. Here is <hi>a meaſuring reed:</hi> O! that men would apply it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Apply it to your <hi>time</hi> in this world, and you will find your time to be <hi>very ſhort.</hi> A proſpect of much time to come, proves the ruin of

many ſouls. Men will be reckoning their time by years, (like that rich man, Luke xii. 19, 20) when it may be, there are not many hours of it to run But reckon as you will, laying your time to the meaſuring reed of eternity, you will ſee your age is as nothing. What a ſmall and inconſiderable point is ſixty, eighty, or a hundred years, in reſpect of eternity? Compared with eternity, there is a greater diſproportion, than between a hair's breadth and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the whole earth. Why do we ſleep then in ſuch a ſhort day, while we are in hazard of loſing reſt through the long night of eternity? 2dly, Apply it to your endeavours for ſalvation, and they will be found very ſcanty. When men are preſſed to diligence in their ſalvation-work, they are ready to ſay, "To what purpoſe is this waſte?" Alas! if it were to be judged by our diligence, what is it that we have in view, as to the moſt part of us, no man could thereby conjecture, that we have eternity in view. If we duly conſidered eternity, we could not but conclude, that, to leave no means appointed of God uneſſayed, till we get our ſalvation ſecured; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe reſt or comfort in any thing, till we are ſheltered under the wings of the Mediator; to purſue our great intereſt with the utmoſt vigour, to cut off luſts dear as right hands and right eyes, to ſet our faces reſolutely againſt all difficulties, and fight our way through all the oppoſition made by the devil, the world, and the fleſh; are, all of them together, little enough for eternity.</p>
                  <p>USE II. Here is a balance of the ſanctuary, by which one may underſtand the lightneſs of what is falſly thought weighty; and the weight of ſome things, by many reckoned to be very light.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, Some things ſeem very weighty, which weighed in this balance, will be found very light. (1.) Weigh the
<q>world, and all that is in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</q>
and the whole will be found light in the balance of eternity. Weigh herein all worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, gains and advantages; and you will quickly ſee, that a thouſand worlds will not quit the coſt of the eternity of woe.
<q>For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</q>
Matth. xvi. 26. Weigh the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon, with the fire that is everlaſting, and you muſt account yourſelves fools and madmen, to run the hazard of the one for the other. (2.) Weigh your afflictions in this balance, and you will find the heavieſt of them very right, in reſpect of the weight of eternal anguiſh. Impatience under affliction, eſpecially when worldly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles do ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As a ſmall and inconſiderable loſs will be very little at heart with him, who ſees himſelf in hazard of loſing his whole eſtate ſo troubles in the world will appear but light to him, who has a lively view of eternity. Such a one will ſtoop, and take up his croſs, whatever it be, thinking it enough to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Repentance and bitter mourning for ſin on earth, are very light in compariſon of eternal weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth in hell. To wreſtle with God in prayer, weeping and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupplication for the bleſſing in time is far eaſier than to ly under the curſe through all eternity.

Weigh ſin in this balance; and, though now it ſeems but a light thing to you, ye will find it a weight ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to turn up an eternal weight of wrath upon you. Even idle words, vain thoughts, and unprofitable actions, weighed in this ballance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as following the ſinner into eternity, will each of them be heavier than the ſand of the ſea: time idly ſpent will make a weary eternity. Now is your ſeed-time; thoughts, words and actions are the ſeed ſown; eternity is the harveſt: though the ſeed now lies under the clod, unregarded by moſt men, even the leaſt grain ſhall ſpring up at length; and the fruit will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeed, Gal. vi. 8
<q>For he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption (i. e. deſtruction;) but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting.</q>
(2.) Weigh in this balance your time, and opportunities of grace and ſalvation, and you will find them very weighty. Precious time and ſeaſons of grace, ſabbaths, communions, prayers, ſermons, and the like, are by many now a-days made light of: but the day is coming, when one of theſe will be reckoned more valuable than a thouſand worlds, by thoſe who now have the leaſt value for them. When they are gone for ever, and the loſs cannot be retrieved; theſe will ſee the worth of them, who will not now ſee it.</p>
                  <p>USE III. and LAST, Be warned and ſtirred up to flee from the wrath to come. Mind eternity, and cloſely ply the work of your ſalvation. What are you doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while you are not ſo doing? Is heaven a fable, or hell a mere ſcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow? Muſt we live eternally, and will we be at no more pains to eſcape ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery? Will faint wiſhes take the kingdom of heaven by force? And will ſuch drowſy endeavours, as moſt men ſatiſfy themſelves with, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted flying from the wrath to come? Ye who have already fled to Chriſt, up, and be doing: ye have begun the work; go on, loiter not, but
<q>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling,</q>
Philip. ii 12.
<q>Fear him which is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell,</q>
Matth. x. 28. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ye are not yet aſcended into heaven: ye are but in your middle ſtate: The everlaſting arms have drawn you out of the gulf of wrath ye were plunged into, in your natural ſtate; they are ſtill underneath you, that ye can never fall down into it again: nevertheleſs, ye have not yet got up to the top of the rock; the deep below you is frightful; look at it, and haſten your aſcent. Ye who are yet in your natural ſtate, lift up your eyes, and take a view of the eternal ſtate. Ariſe, ye profane perſons, ye ignorant ones, ye formal hypocrites, ſtrangers to the power of godlineſs, flee from the wrath to come. Let not the young adventure to delay a moment longer, nor the old put off this work any more.
<q>To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;</q>
leſt he ſwear in his wrath, that ye ſhall never enter into his reſt. It is no time to linger in a ſtate of ſin, as in Sodom, when fire and brimſtone are coming down on it from the Lord. Take warning in time: they who are in hell, are not troubled with ſuch warnings; but are inraged againſt themſelves for that they ſlighted the warning, when they had it.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, I pray you, (1.) How uneaſy it is to ly one whole night or a ſoft bed, in perfect health, when one very fain would have ſleep, but cannot get it; ſleep being departed from him How often will one in that caſe wiſh for reſt! How full of toſſings to and fro! But ah! how dreadful muſt it then be to ly in ſorrow, wrapt up in ſcorching flames through long eternity, in
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:045042_0341_101F80D4E6EB8FE0"/>
that place where they have no reſt day nor night! (2.) How terrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> would it be to live under violent pains of the cholic or gravel, for forty or ſixty years together, without any intermiſſion! Yet that is but a very ſmall thing in compariſon of eternal ſeparation from God, the worm that never d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and the fire that is never quenched. (3.) Eternity is an awful thought; O long, long, endleſs eternity! But will not every moment, in eternity of woe, ſeem a month, and every hour a year, in that moſt wretched and deſperate condition? Hence ever and ever, as it were a double eternity. The ſick man in the night, toſſing to and fro on his bed, ſays, it will never be day, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that his pain ever continues, never, never abates. Are theſe petty time-eternities, which men form to themſelves, in their own imaginations, ſo very grievous? Alas! then how grievous, how utterly unſupportable muſt real eternity of woe, and all manner of miſeries be! LASTLY, There will be ſpace enough there, to reflect on all the ills of one's heart and life, which one cannot get time to think of now; and to ſee that all that was ſaid of the impenitent ſinner's hazard, was true, and that the half was not told. There will be ſpace enough in eternity to think on delayed repentance, to rue one's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, when it is too late; and in a ſtate paſt remedy, to ſpeak forth their fruitleſs wiſhes:
<q>O that I had never been born! That the womb had been my grave, and I had never ſeen the ſun! O that I had taken warning in time, and fled from his wrath, while the door of mercy was ſtanding open to me! O that I had never heard the goſpel, that I had lived in ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, where a Saviour and the great ſalvation were not once named!</q>
But all in vain. What is done cannot be undone; the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is loſt, and can never be retrieved; time is gone, and cannot be recalled. Wherefore improve time, while you have it, and do not wilfully ruin your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſtopping your ear to the goſpel-call.</p>
                  <p>And now if ye would be ſaved from the wrath to come, and never go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this place of torment, take no reſt in your natural ſtate; believe the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and miſery of it, and labour to get it out quickly, fleeing unto Jeſus Chriſt by faith. Sin in you is the ſeed of hell: and, if the guilt and reigning power of it be not removed in time, they will bring you to the ſecond death in eternity. There is no way to get them removed, but by receiving of Chriſt, as he is offered in the goſpel, for juſtification and ſanctification: and he is now offered to you with all his ſalvation, Rev. xxii. 12.17.
<q>And behold. I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work ſhall be. And the Spirit and the bride ſay, Come. And let him that heareth, ſay, Come. And let him that is a-thriſt. Come. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</q>
Jeſus Chriſt is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of peace, and the Fountain of holineſs: he it is who
<q>delivereth us from the wrath to come.</q>
                     <q>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit,</q>
Rom. viii 1. And the terrors of hell, as well as the joys of heaven, are ſet before you, to ſtirr you up to a cordial receiving of him with all his ſalvation; and to determine you unto the way of faith and holineſs, in which alone you can eſcape the everlaſting fire. May the Lord himſelf make them effectual to that end.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of Man's ETERNAL STATE; the which, becauſe it is eternal, admits no ſucceeding one for ever.</p>
