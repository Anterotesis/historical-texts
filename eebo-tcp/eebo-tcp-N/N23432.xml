            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>A ſhort account of the ravages of the Yellow Fever, at Newburyport in the year <hi>1796.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH the execution done by this diſorder in that town is, through the kindneſs of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſmall compared to its baneful effects in ſome of our ſouthern cities. it yet ſeems by no means improper to publiſh a brief and impartial account of the matter— Every circumſtance relating to this diſeaſe ought to be recorded and remembered on account of its being very likely that all the experience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in it, will be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enable us to withſtand future attacks from this mortal foe.</p>
               <p>Many of our country brethren, who have heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming news of 30, 40 or 50 perſons dying of the yellow fever in a night in Newburyport, will be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, when they read here that leſs than 40 h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e died there with it in the whole; but they muſt reſt aſſured that 'tis a fact; and one I hope that will make them more cautions for the future about believing falſhoods. They ought to remember that people in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaports were intereſted in deceiving them about this matter, and that ſome of them have actually much miſrepreſented the affair. We muſt however acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that many others have done us the juſtice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate true accounts from time to time of the ſickneſs, and our thanks are due to moſt or all the editors of newſpapers in the States for publiſhing the authentic reports of our committee of health.</p>
               <p>Whenever a malignant diſorder has eſtabliſhed itſelf in a populous place, the people will find it to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage immediately to organize a committee of health, and to make it the duty of the committee to publiſh au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic accounts of the diſtemper. By this mode of conduct, men of ſenſe in the country, who read the public news learn the truth, deal in out to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and are enabled to contradict the extravagant and exaggerated ſtories of their more ignorant and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious townſmen—'Tis ten times as well to have the truth told in ſuch caſes, by Tom Wiſeman, Eſq. or Doctor Knowall, as it is to have the alarming reports of Deacon Longface or Dick Kickſtraw ſpread abroad. The Papers in Newburyport were too long ſilent about the fever, and the town was too long without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Health.</p>
               <p>This Fever in Newburyport was attended by ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms nearly ſimilar to thoſe which attended it in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia: it was however more acute here than there in general. There the ſick commonly lived from 5 to 8 days, but here their career was often finiſhed ſooner.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe was new to all our Phyſicians, and at firſt their endeavours were crowned with ſmall ſucceſs; nor were they at any time very able to beat the enemy eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when not ſent for at the beginning of the battle.</p>
               <p>Dr. Swett who fell a victim, was ſeized with vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and immediately pronounced his fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. "I (ſaid he to his amiable conſort) am ſeized now with a diſorder that I have been trying to check in others—I can do nothing for it: nobody in this place can, and I muſt fall by it!" The Doctor's mind at this time muſt have been awfully agitated! An hour before perhaps in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, with a ſhining proſpect of thirty happy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly happy years, and now as certain of dying in a few days, as if his neck had been under a French guilo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ne! No language could expreſs his feelings! No pen is adequate to the taſk of doing juſtice to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, the melancholy ſubject! Drop, courteous read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, drop with me a tear to his memory, and let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be ready to travel after him, through the dark and awful valley, and to hail him triumphantly in the realms of light, by the aſſiſtance of him who is able to ſave. Oh! may his firſt addreſs to us, when we quit this tranſitory world, be as follows, viz,
<q>
                     <l>You're welcome to the bliſsful ſhore,</l>
                     <l>Where racking death can kill no more!</l>
                     <l>Where not a ſingle ill can harm you,</l>
                     <l>And where ten thouſand raptures charm you.</l>
                     <l>You're welcome from the painful ſtrife,</l>
                     <l>And all the ills of mortal life.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is uncertain whether the fever was imported or took its origin in the town; but 'tis certain that it was ſeldom or never caught any where only in a ſmall part of a ſtreet that I ſhall preſently ſpeak of, and it ſeems likely that it originated there.</p>
               <p>By the beſt accounts I can get of the matter it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that one Miſs Flood, a ſervant girl who lived with Mrs. Sally Woodhouſe, in Water ſtreet, was the firſt victim among us to this diſorder. She was ſeized towards the laſt of June, and repairing to her father's houſe in Newbury, died there ſoon after.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of July Mr. Davis Lambert, who lived in the ſame houſe that Miſs Flood was ſeized in, died of the ſame diſorder and on the 5th Miſs Silley in the ſame houſe alſo died. The diſorder now began to be conſidered as a little alarming, and Miſs Silley was prudently buried without the cuſtomary ceremonies, the ſame morning ſhe died.</p>
               <p>The ſcourge thus got footing in a place rendered by ſeveral circumſtances very capable of ſupporting it. That part of Water-ſtreet of which I am ſpeaking is ſituated low, by the Merrimack, while a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the town is built on higher ground, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long at the S. W. of it, which is the point from which the Summer breezes generally come. Thus ſituated, it muſt be expected that the air in that part of the town will ſometimes in the hotteſt part of the year, ſtagnate, and become extremely unwholeſome; the effluvia from all the filth in the city, S. W. of this ſpot is naturally waſted over and hovers there. But beſides theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſadvantages, the people in Water-ſtreet labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under a very formidable one, hatched by an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant who paid his life for his inattention. A very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of the heads and entrails of a kind of fiſh were ſuffered to lie and putrify on a wharf. So inſupportable was the ſtench ariſing from this nuiſance that when an officer of Police was appointed, he was not able for love nor money to hire any man to remove it, and was actually obliged to cover it over with earth where ever he found it.</p>
               <p>It was yet early in July; full four months longer the fever might naturally be expected to rage with encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fury! Conſidering this that 30 or 40 perſons have died with it is not the wonder; but that at leaſt four times as many have not died.</p>
               <p>About a week after the death of Miſs Silley, maſter Arnold died in the ſame houſe.</p>
               <p>On the 16th of July Mr. Jonathan Gage was ſeized —he recovered; but his wife and a daughter died ſoon after, and his parents from Bradford having viſited him during his illneſs were infected and died at home, one on the 28th and the other on the 29th of July. On the 19th Mr. Z. Atwood died.</p>
               <p>The town now began to be a little more alarmed, and appointed an officer of Police. Many groundleſs fears were entertained by many, while others did not take the neceſſary precautions.</p>
               <p>A girl at Mrs. Atwoods and another at Mr. Gages were the next victims. It ſeemed now to be time for the ſurviving part of theſe bereaved families to fly from their infected abodes; but they had the hardineſs to ſtay: and what is more ſurprizing, the lovely Miſs Long now or a little before, flew right to the jaws of death, by going to keep Mr. Gages houſe. On the 15th of Auguſt Mrs. Hill died, and on the 16th Dr. Swett took his departure.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of Auguſt four perſons died of the fev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, one of which was Miſs Long and another Mr. P. Atwood, who had been only two or three days out of his deceaſed brother's houſe. I was ſurpriſed at the hardineſs of thoſe people who ſtill continued at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected houſes in Water ſtreet, and thought it high time to try to alarm them; fearing among the reſt that the lovely Mrs. Atwood would loſe her life 40 or 50 years too ſoon, and hoping that what I ſaid to her might have ſome effect on others who were in danger, I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hove the following note into her houſe, viz.</p>

               <p>This lady having took conderable pains to cleanſe her houſe, thought herſelf pretty ſecure; but about a week after another of her family, Mr. Stone, was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the iron hands of the fever, and ſhe wiſely fled from his fatal dart. Nothing however could give Mrs. Woodhouſe a proper idea of her danger, till it was too late for her to retreat.</p>
               <p>Many before the death of Mrs. Woodhouſe and many afterwards fled, ſome from danger &amp; others from where there was none—'Tis good however to be careful.</p>
               <p>The fever continued with unabating fury through the firſt week of September, it then began to decreaſe. Five perſons, of whom we had but little hopes, recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered. There were few new caſes, and on the 5th of October not one perſon in the town remained ſick with it.</p>
               <p>The narrow circle in which the adverſary moved, and its very ſeaſonable end are pretty evident marks of the friendly interpoſition of him who lives forever. During nearly the whole ſeaſon he ſent us very healthy favourable weather. In July he ſent us two ſhowers, in which the rain fell very plentifully, and twice as faſt perhaps as the oldeſt perſon living ever ſaw it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orne before. Theſe were probably the ſame rains which entirely ſtopped the courſe of the Yellow-Fever in New-York. On the 25th of Aug. he ſent us a great ſhower attended with a very uncommon quantity of lightning; and on the 29th it being ſo amazing warm that the thermometer ſtood at 96, he cauſed ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the weather that the thermometer ſoon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to 64. In the courſe of four days it grew ſo much colder that it actually froze, and no further north than Portſmouth, ice of a conſiderable thickneſs was ſeen.</p>
               <p>From this we ought to take encouragement ſtill to ſtrive, by leading virtuous lives, to ſecure the kindly aid of indulgent heaven: or if we believe we cannot do this by any of our own works, let us take care not to draw the vindictive vengeance of an Almighty arm down on our guilty heads, by vicious practices.</p>
