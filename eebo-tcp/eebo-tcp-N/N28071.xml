            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is the curſe of the Age in which our Lot hath been caſt, that not only men in general think leſs of thoſe concerns which belong to their permanent tranquillity, than of the carking cares of gain: but, that a very large portion of ſociety think not of them at all.</p>
            <p>HENCE it ariſes, that the public concerns are ſwayed by characters and by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, grovelling and inſignificant; that the moſt abject claſſes of ſociety, give law to their maſters; and that a progreſſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, marks, in painful traces, the funereal progreſs of our political career. We ſeem to have abandoned ourſelves to the lethargy of the Sloth, and to have crept up the Tree of Apathy, where every murmur of every
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:037419_0003_100D2E8A6AEDA3A8"/>breeze excites a narrow and chilling dread leſt our repoſe be for a moment annoyed. Our fears, our alarms, are all the emotions of an abject cowardice, impelled by ſtrong circumſtance to blink at danger, and then ſlinking into the former ſtate of ſluggiſhneſs 'till again rouſed by new excitements, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of all uſeful effect as the former. One call to action ſucceeds another in ineffectual round, for the laſt leaves us where we were found by the firſt.</p>
            <p>FROM viſionary dreams, from fantaſtic prognoſtications and golden hopes, we were rouſed by the phrenzy of the French Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutioniſts, through the inſtrumentality of their Agent, Genet. A miracle, the forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Robeſpierre, extricated us moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately from a dilemma, which it was hoped would terminate in a declaration of war on the part of that extraordinary mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But the whim of Robeſpierre, and our ill ſtars conjoined, cut us off from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency ſo devoutly to be wiſhed: a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency which muſt inevitably have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037419_0004_100D2E8D3576D038"/>all thoſe unhappy calamities which have ſince been brought upon the country. But, this danger evaded, we ſlept again, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the wreath of Meconium, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ourſelves in ſuch confidence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as if ſecurity and thoughtleſſneſs were the only attributes with which we were endowed, the only characteriſtics of our natures.</p>
            <p>THE conceptions of illuſtrious men, of the nature of this extraordinary criſis, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented an almoſt infinite variety. Perhaps, at this period, when from the long-paſt extinction of all paſſions connected with the point of time, there is the better chance for temperate judgment; it may be concluded, that the fever of liberty and equality raged too hotly in the veins of the people to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the only meaſure which, in the eye of wiſdom, could have been deemed expedient, or adequate to the exigencies of that preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant criſis: it may be concluded, that the murder of the Monarch, with all its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant circumſtances of horror, at a time when
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037419_0005_100D3C9D9F80B668"/>Illuminiſm, and the invaſions of barbarians,<note n="*" place="bottom">So the Romans denominated <hi>all Foreigners.</hi>
               </note> had not ſteeled our ſinews to the emotions of humanity, perhaps alone enabled the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of that day to carry into effect, even the Proclamation of Neutrality. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into effect, indeed, it never was; but it was borne, it was ſuffered to be promulged, with however great murmur, with however bitter execrations. Influenced by theſe conſiderations, which, it ſeems probable, an impartial poſterity will recognize as unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal facts, this Act will juſtly be regarded as one of the moſt luminous points in the character of its great Author.</p>
            <p>FROM the torpor which enſued upon the turbulence and conſpiracies of Genet, we were again goaded into momentary "ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility" by new turbulences and new conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, which being overcome, like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by our ſingularly good or ill fortune, were eventually ſucceeded by actual hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037419_0006_100D3C9F33790850"/>and a declaration of war. A declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of war againſt <hi>the Government,</hi> by the Miniſter at our Court, and his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home, and by the actual commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of unequivocal hoſtilities upon <hi>the people,</hi> under the orders of the latter.</p>
            <p>AFTER two years' hoſtilities, waged with remorſeleſs perſecution and cruelty, after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable flagellations of our defenceleſs people, and numerous murders, after the loſs of a thouſand valuable merchantmen, and the extinction of that <hi>Character,</hi> under the auſpices of which alone we could have acted with effect, and after the Government had kneeled again and gain, in the dirt, to lick the duſt at the feet of low-bred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts, the people roſe, and demanded war. A new ſyſtem was put in force, and how wonderful, and how glorious were its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, until our Evil Genius adminiſtered a new potion of Mandragora, lulled the very ſoul of the country to ſleep, and ſunk every energy into a ſtate of inexorable ſomno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037419_0007_100D3CA0C809B188"/>
As we have ſlept, and idly dreamed of peace, and repoſe and ſecurity, and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican millenarianiſm, new perils have ſprung up from the fertile hot-bed of faction; and watered by the genial dews of demagogy, and cheriſhed by the benignant ſun of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophiſm, have taken deep root, to bring forth fruit abundantly.</p>
            <p>As we have ſlept, we have been impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively borne along to the verge of a criſis, on the turn of which hangs no leſs a point than the fate of the whole community: and we are arrived nearly to the deciſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even a random effort to ſtay the plague which impends.</p>
            <p>As we have ſlept, amidſt the deluſions of commiſſioners, aſſurances, negociations, and words and ſounds and ſchemes, without meaning, and without other effect than to prolong our torpidity, the machinations of the ſervants of the enemy, have advanced to a violent probability of ſucceſs, in their long contemplated project of obtaining poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037419_0008_100D3CA429FA46E0"/>of the Government of the country. A cataſtrophe at even the poſſibility of which, who is ſo infatuated as not to tremble?</p>
            <p>BUT the ſucceſs of Faction, in forcing down its Candidate upon the Public, is, as I promiſe myſelf hereaſter to make apparent, but an inſignificant means to a vaſt end.</p>
            <p>THE univerſal end of Jacobiniſm, is the the overthrow of whatever good exiſts. With one conſent, its diſciples are, and have been, and ever will be, ready to exclaim,— Whatever is, is WRONG.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Pursuits of Literature.</note> They are the footpads and the highwaymen of ſociety, with whoſe exiſtence, law and order and ſyſtem are altogether incompatible; the ſcorpions, and adders of mankind, whoſe mortal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom "holds ſuch enmity with blood of man, that ſwift as quickſilver it courſes through the natural gates and alleys of the body, and with a ſudden vigour, it doth poſſet and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037419_0009_100D3CA66823FC58"/>curd, like eager droppings into milk, the thin and wholeſome blood." Such is the general character of Jacobiniſm: Its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial attributes and tendencies, vary with times, localities, and temperaments. The Jacobiniſm, or Anti-Foederaliſm, or True Americaniſm, or (according to the laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which it has aſſumed) the <hi>Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm</hi> of America, took its origin at the eſtabliſhment of the preſent Conſtitution of the United States, impropoperly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Foederal.</p>
            <p>THE Anti-Foederaliſts (the undoubted Jacobins of that day and of this) declared the Government contemplated by their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical opponents, to be monſtrous<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Independent Gazetteer, and the other Anti-Foederal newspapers of that day, passim.</note> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and advocated a form of ſimple confederation in its ſtead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037419_0010_100D3CA8B21D1618"/>
THIS faction miſrepreſented in toto, the nature and form of the contemplated Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; ſince the Conſtitution of the United States poſſeſſes no one feature of a Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Government. On the contrary, it was the miſery which the people had encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under their Foederal Government, which induced the abolition of that form and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the preſent.</p>
            <p>THE Conſtitution of the United States, in its <hi>original form,</hi> (I mean, as it was even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually adopted) contains in no inſtance any acknowledgment of the <hi>ſupremacy,</hi> of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Governments. They are therein repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and expreſsly recognized as fiefs of the general ſupremacy, and as ſuch are by that inſtrument holden to numerous feudal duties; but they are never recognized as paramount ſovereignties, nor even as co-eſtates; So prepoſterous an idea never could ariſe in any other than the preſent ridiculous aera.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037419_0011_100D3CAA4E85A6C0"/>
IN order to ſhew, more clearly, that the prevailing conceptions concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the American Government are erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, it is neceſſary to advert to the cauſes which gave birth to its eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>IN the course of this examination, it will as I think, very clearly appear, that the men denominated Jacobins, are the real Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſts of the preſent day; and that the Conſtitutionaliſts, or friends to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and its Government, as at firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are unwittingly playing into the hands of their enemies, by contributing to the perpetration of a deluſion, under colour of which the Faction are advancing into the ſeats of power.</p>
            <p>THE cabaliſtic denomination of this ſect, as well as any ſet of principles, by which they may affect at ſeaſons to be governed, ought not to obtain the ſerious currency which they have at all times done. It is of no conſequence, under what maſk an aſſaſſin approaches us ſo that we recognize him an
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037419_0012_100D3CAD9A95D4F8"/>aſſaſſin: fair words, ſmooth pretenſions, and hypocritical denominations, charm not the enmity of faction, and ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to lull our apprehenſions, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our views from its invariable end. The Anti-Foederaliſt of 1789, oppoſed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment becauſe he thought it conducive to the happineſs of the country, and the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin or ſoi-diſant Republican of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, acts preciſely on the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. In the eye of reflection, the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are completely identified.</p>
            <p>THE condition of the country from the treaty of peace in 1783, to the year 1787, preſented ſo melancholy a ſucceſſion of diſaſters, of every kind, as to produce an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal voice for a new Conſtitution. Under the Foederal Government, the people ſaw their trade declining almoſt to non-entity; they ſaw all public confidence and all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit between man and man at an end, and they one and all deſpaired of any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable change under ſo untoward a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. They ſaw their Confederation whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037419_0013_100D3CAFE2088E10"/>inadequate to the protection of its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who were in great numbers
<q>
                  <l>Taken by an insolent foe</l>
                  <l>And sold to slavery without redemption thence.</l>
               </q>
While the fire of revolt and rebellion had burſt the cobweb barrier which reſtrained it, and threatened to devaſtate the proſtrate land. With one conſent, it was reſolved to aboliſh that ſyſtem ſo fertile in miſeries, whatever other might be ſubſtituted.</p>
            <p>IN fixing on a ſubſtitute, it was very obvious that vaſt difficulties were to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered; by many they were feared even to be inſurmountable.</p>
            <p>THERE were to be conciliated, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt variety of jarring paſſions, principles and intereſts, that ever fell to the lot of men to encounter.</p>
            <p>"IT was obviouſly <hi>impracticable,</hi>" as the Convention who formed the Conſtitution, obſerve, "to ſecure all rights of <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Sovereignty</hi> to <hi>each,</hi> and yet provide for
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037419_0014_100D3CB309B42950"/>the intereſt and ſafety of all." Therefore, "in all our deliberations," continue they, "we kept ſteadily in our view, that which appears to us the <hi>greatest interest</hi> of every true American, the CONSOLIDATION of our Union, in which is involved our Proſperity, Felicity, Safety, perhaps our National Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence."</p>
            <p>SUCH were the views which prevailed over the eſtabliſhment of the Conſtitution of the United States. It was eſſentially and entirely an act of CONSOLIDATION, taking place of the act of Foederation, which had died of inanition.</p>
            <p>WHILE theſe, the only proper and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate conceptions of the nature of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, obtained, an uninterrupted tide of proſperity diſtinguiſhed the public fortunes. Nor was it till that fatal breach was made in this barrier round the public weal, by which the States were made paramount Sovereignties, that faction ever attained that daring height which is almoſt inſtantly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037419_0015_100D3CB498055290"/>No longer was there wanting to the Jacobins a point of rallying, no longer had any one to exclaim with Archimedes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> their indiſpenſable paſſion for revolutionary movements, was confirmed on the moſt important baſis, by this eſtabliſhment of its practicability, and of the long deſired <hi>means</hi> to their end.</p>
            <p>WHILE there was but one Government in the country; while the States were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded but as ſo many Lieutenancies, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate diviſions, ſuffered to exiſt in their ancient form, inſtead of being conſtituted counties, only from deference to prejudice; while, in fact, there was but one rallying point, and of courſe an unity of action, and an entirety of organization; the people revolted at the projects of revolutionizers when they dared, which indeed was then ſeldom, to carry their views, openly, to that extent. But, no ſooner, was the foundation of the Conſtitution subverted, and the Governments of the country mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied to ſeventeen or eighteen, than Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037419_0016_100D3CB6D2C06A40"/>immediately laid its axe at the root of the Conſtitution of the United States, and employed all its efforts to bring about the ſubſtitution of the State Governments in its ſtead; in other words, to revive the old Confederation. This propoſition is to be found in very diſtinct terms in the writings of ſeveral of the party, and particularly in a work publiſhed at the ſouthward, called "The Proſpect before us."</p>
            <p>This end they hope and mean to obtain through the inſtrumentality of the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date whom they are ſeeking to exalt to the Chief Magiſtracy. His opinions on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are before the world. Theſe have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially varied at different times, according to the different currents of public ſentiment, of which he hath ever been a moſt obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious ſlave. At firſt, though he had thrown whatever influence he poſſeſſed into the ſcale of oppoſition to the New Conſtitution, he yet affected, in public, to be an admirer of that Inſtrument, to which he took no
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037419_0017_100D3CB9C5DE3A50"/>other exception than at the omiſſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with it, a bill of rights.</p>
            <p>BUT when we receive his opinion of the Conſtitution, through a medium exempt from this ſervile influence, we find it of a very different caſt. When in the warmth of confidence, he writes of it what he thinks, we find him ſtigmatiſing that form, as the form of the odious Conſtitution of England. Its ties which he conſiders as Lilliputian "we" ſays he, "ſhall break."</p>
            <p>IT is become a queſtion, then, whether the Conſtitution of the United States ſhall ſtand, or whether we will quietly behold it ſubverted, and the organized anarchy of Federaliſm ſubſtituted. This is the ſimple point of conteſt between the two parties. We have moſt fooliſhly put it at iſſue; and it is with God only to grant us "a good deliverance."</p>
            <p>IF the preceding views be correct, it is obvious that the diſtinctive appellations of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037419_0018_100D3CBB6A4430C0"/>the parties in this country are improper and abſurd. It is true that mankind in all ages have been little influenced by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this regard; having in many inſtances adopted cabaliſtic diſtinctions from accident and often from the moſt ludicrous whim. Yet I think it as well at leaſt to wear a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic name as an unmeaning one, and better even an unmeaning one, than that which conveys a falſe meaning.</p>
            <p>THE Foederaliſts it is to be aſſumed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the Conſtitution of the United States may exiſt in its original, integral ſtate of ſupremacy; that it may be in all caſes, the Supreme Law of the Land, unaffected by the claſhing of Local Intereſts, and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the operations of ſubordinate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They are <hi>Constitutionalists,</hi> Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, loyal to their country and to one another.</p>
            <p>THE Democrats deſire that the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States ſhould be "diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled"—they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037419_0019_100D3CBE12B69E70"/>deſire that condition of things, in which the total abſence of order, may give "paſſage free" to the perſonal violences of their malignant paſſions, and to their thirſt for power and for gold. They would revive the Confederation, and are indiſputably Foederaliſts, without having Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſm or any other object really at heart, any further than as a means of aggrandiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſtep by which to aſcend the height of power.</p>
            <p>WHAT is <hi>Foederaliſm?</hi> This is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry peculiarly neceſſary, notwithſtanding the term has been in ſo common uſe for ſo many years. It may be denominated <hi>The State of Nature applied to Governments;</hi> and this perhaps is the ground of preference with thoſe who call themſelves Republicans, as they are ever ready to exclaim, with the illegitimate villain of Shakeſpeare,</p>
            <q>Thou, Nature, art our Goddess! to thy law Our services are bound.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037419_0020_100D3CC1B966FDF8"/>
BUT their Goddeſs of Nature is a New Deity and of the Modern Pantheon; and ſhe reſembles the image of a celebrated tyrant, in the remorſeleſs cruelties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions which ſhe has inflicted on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, under the fair ſemblance of mildneſs and philanthropy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Foederaliſm,</hi> or the quality of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Foederal form of Government, is ſurely the moſt trivial diſtinctive title of a party that was ever yet aſſumed: a man may be a Foederaliſt and Royaliſt, a Foederaliſt and Republican, or a Foederaliſt and an enemy to either Royalty or Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm. There is no inconſiſtency in theſe characters, as has been exemplified in fact and experience. The conſequence has been that the political adverſaries of the men ſtyling themſelves Foederaliſts, have robbed them of their diſtinctive appellation, and they now act without any name, as they have long done without any fixed or defined principles either of morals or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: As the Cuckow creeps into the neſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037419_0021_100D3CC349AAB370"/>of a certain fooliſh bird, and ejects it and its offspring.</p>
            <p>IN the diſtinctive appellations of parties in every age, we diſcern ſome meaning, ſome connection, more or leſs remote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the name and qualities of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind. This is obviouſly neceſſary, to prevent the dilemma alluded to above. It will be ſaid that Foederaliſm denotes attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Foederal Government, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the government of this country, and that, reaching this end, it is ſufficiently defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. The object to be defined, viz. at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Government, is ſurely ſimple enough; but if, in attempting to define a definite object, a term ſo indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite is made uſe of, as to be liable not only to perverſions but miſconſtructions, the ſimplicity of the object itſelf is rendered of no avail; it might as well have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and abſtruſe.</p>
            <p>THE Conſtitutionaliſt denominates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Foederaliſt, and pronounces the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037419_0022_100D3CC4D6D4D558"/>of Foederaliſm to be theſe or thoſe. The Republican as loudly proclaims himſelf a Foederaliſt alſo, but his picture of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of Foederaliſm is diametrically the reverſe of the other. So oppoſite are the repreſentations and the views of theſe two Foederaliſts, that the latter would (in the words of Mr. John Adams) incontinently "fine, impriſon and hang his own brother" if a perſon of the former perſuaſion. The truth is, that the former, if he be a man of either ſenſe or honeſty, is not a Foederaliſt. No man can be a real friend to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, and a Foederal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, in the ſenſe in which the term is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>TO decide with more preciſion this queſtion, it is worth while to attempt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a right underſtanding of the force and meaning of the term <hi>Foederal,</hi> in its fulleſt extent. The unequivocal derivation of the term, goes far to decide every queſtion of its ſignification, and Foederation (a new root of the word, of American growth)
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037419_0023_100D3CC832DF7000"/>may be aſſerted to extend no farther than to denote a league or covenant. Now a league or covenant may take place, either between individuals or bodies politic. The account of the combat between the Horatii and Curiatii, begins "<hi>Foedere</hi> icto, trigemini arma capiunt," and Otway makes his hero declare himſelf the "<hi>covenanted</hi> foe of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice." By conſtruction, however, and by long uſage, the application of the term Foederation has been reſtricted, and it may be ſaid at preſent to apply only to leagues or covenants between States. And as we have never known the term to be applied to denote leagues or covenants between ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or independant States, it muſt be further reſtricted to leagues or covenants or aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of different States forming one Nation.</p>
            <p>NOW a league, whether between ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Nations, or different States of the ſame Nation is a temporary arrangement for the purpoſe of meeting ſome great emergency. uch was the league of the Grecian States againſt Philip, ſuch alſo was was the league
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037419_0024_100D3CC9C2818E48"/>of the American States againſt Great Britain. As long as the league, commonly called the Old Confederation laſted, the United States were a Federation. But their fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eraliſm merged in the Conſtitution of the United States.</p>
            <p>FOEDERALISM, therefore, is a league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween different States of the ſame Nation, (as England, Scotland and Ireland) for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary purposes: it is the Interregnum of Governments not Monarchical: and it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways implies the abſence of ſettled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>I AM well aware that theſe uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible truths will encounter vehement reſis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from various claſſes of men. Thoſe, who, oſtentatious of their ſuppoſed politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal orthodoxy, carry their bawling Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſm not only into the market place, but actually to market, will with much zeal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt theſe opinions, ſo fatal to the craft by which they have their wealth. Nor will there be wanting the acrimonious taunts
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037419_0025_100D3CCBF9F0BBB0"/>and jeers of thoſe inclement ſpirits, who realizing theſe truths, dread from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence the defeat of their projects and the downfall of their power.</p>
            <p>BUT truth will march onwards in her career, however intereſted ignorance and malice may oppoſe. While it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us to ſpeak, we will with loud voice proclaim thoſe truths which we deem to be uſeful; nor will their tendency to conciliate the applauſe or provoke the ill-will of the malignant and venomous ſectaries of blind and brutal violence be at all enquired into.</p>
            <p>WHILE, yet there is life, and while yet living, we have hope, it ſhall be endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by active exertions to prolong that life, by exciting that hope to energetic action. To the friends of Government, it ſeems time to apply every effort that may tend to rouſe them, to a ſenſe of thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which ſurround them, of thoſe conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies which are unremittingly urged againſt their peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:037419_0026_100D3CCE388567F8"/>
TOWARDS the remedy of an evil, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards defence againſt any danger, it is a potent advance, that we acquire a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its nature and extent. It is in this view that I have endeavoured to indicate what ſeem palpable to me, as the lines of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which the Jacobin faction have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken, in their progreſs towards their vaſt and deſtructive end.</p>
            <p>HAVING ſufficiently ſhewn, by induction, that the purpoſe of aboliſhing the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States and of Foederal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing the country, is contemplated by the Jefferſonian party, it is worth while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the conſequences of a ſucceſſful iſſue to their Foederalizing project.</p>
            <p>THE inſeparable concomitant of the abolition of the preſent form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the annihilation of its debt, ſhould it even ſurvive, which is doubtful, the election of Mr. J. The diſtreſs, the horrors attendant on the overthrow of the public credit, what mind is ſo callous
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037419_0027_100D3CD0C6D55FD8"/>to view with unconcern. Thus will your hearts, if they be made of penetrable ſtuff, be rent, with the ſharp pangs of ancient gentlemen, a long train, worn down with ſorrows and diſtreſſes, and decayed to a dependence on the pittance of their ſtake in the common fortune of the land—thus will your hearts, if not eſtranged from every touch of pity, bleed at the unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woes of widows and orphans, ſtripped of the hardly-ſaved relics of happier days, or the acquiſitions of long and painful toil;—thus, if the emotions of humanity be not expunged from your ſyſtem, if your attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes be not denaturalized, and all the milk of human kindneſs turned to corroding gall, thus will your moſt poignant emotions riſe, at the ſight of maimed veterans ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the ſcanty means that kept their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſcars from mendicancy, periſhing in ſtarvation, or bearing their mouthed wounds to challenge pity of the pityleſs. <hi>Geſrörn,</hi> like Pappenheim,—they will say
<q>Ille et nefasto nos posuit die, opprobrium pagi.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:037419_0028_100D3CD3B512C2F0"/>
SUCH will be the dawn of the Sun of Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſm: the malignant ſplendours of its advance towards a meridian muſt fructify every innoculation and graft of evil, that can diſguſt the wiſe or diſtreſs the good.</p>
            <p>THE Conſtitution overthrown, and the debt abrogated, the new organization, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Foederal Form, with perhaps ſo much of the French ſyſtem engrafted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to provide ſome Conſulates for the Chief and his Compeers, ſucceeds to that ſyſtem under which we once had every the faireſt chance of proſperity and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE Hiſtory of Foederaliſm, through every age, is one continued record of wretchedneſs and affliction. Calculated only for thoſe great emergencies during which, the minds of men are ſuper-natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrained to a ſort of ardor bordering on fury, if it be continued after that fury has declined, and the nerves have relaxed into their natural ſtate of organization, ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance is unvaryingly followed by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037419_0029_100D2E80390E1058"/>of the moſt deplorable and often fatal nature. Seldom, indeed, have Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies of States, upon a ſimilar footing to ours, frequent as they have been, terminated ſo ſucceſsfully as in our caſe. Strangers to any unity of action, their devoted members have often fallen the miſerable prey of corruption, and cabal.</p>
            <p>EVEN from the imperfect and indiſtinct accounts which have been tranſmitted us of the fortunes of the ancient Confederacies, we may gather a ſummary of wretchedneſs more voluminous than the annals of unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governments through long ages. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances unceaſingly recur to our exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obſervation, of revolts, riots and maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres; of corruption, treaſons and <hi>ſpeculations in Flour,</hi> of the moſt atrocious nature. The rebellion of the members againſt the body is continually acted over again, and we obſerve nothing ſettled but the propenſity to diſturbance, nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent but riot and ruin. At every ſtep multiplied evidences crowd on us, of the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037419_0030_100D3CD5F132BDE8"/>impoſſibility of either natural or civil equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; for the ſtruggling equals are each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly aſpiring to elevation, nor is any one ever content even with a benefit, unleſs it has had a larger ſhare than the reſt in producing it. The folly which induces men to reject the deductions of judgment from experience, here meets its deſtined expiation; the vanity of human nature here atones in miſery, its weak and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable paſſion; here it receives impreſſive leſſons, written by the hand of violence in characters of blood.</p>
            <p>THESE multiplied diſorders and diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Foederal Inſtitutions, ſeem to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered ſufficient good ſenſe in their day, to have produced the repudiation of ſuch projects. Through many ages Foederaliſm was unknown. As the ſtate of ſociety changed from the ſtillneſs of more general dynaſties to ſmaller diviſions, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations of whoſe nations altered by the influence of an altered ſoil and climate, formed various new nations, the ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037419_0031_100D3CD82C732680"/>gave riſe to wars of civilization againſt civilization, and the common cauſe of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to barbariſm, was ſunk in ſubordinate hoſtilities. The confederacies of Germany, Switzerland, Holland and others of leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, then aroſe. They aroſe, and more particularly the two laſt, in an exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimilar manner to that of the United States. The paſſion of mankind for change had burſt forth in its full vigour, and from a ſtate of ſubjection to one univerſal ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, men ſeemed to have become only anxious to multiply new ſovereignties and to found new nations. It was a change for the better in almoſt every reſpect; it was favourable to civilization, freedom and ſcience. It was above all favourable to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil liberty, as it founded and confirmed a powerful balance, admirably fortified againſt the encroachments of violent ambition; a balance now effectually broken.</p>
            <p>THE Confederacies of modern times, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a picture ſtill more deplorable than thoſe of the ancients, becauſe our opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037419_0032_100D3CD9D4002DA0"/>of obſervation being more immediate are more intimately employed. Here we obſerve in ſpecification, thoſe minutiae of miſery which a remote tranſmiſſion had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from our view. Here we obſerve fraud, violence and corruption <hi>en gros et en detail.</hi> In theſe vaſt Gymnaſia, crowded with zealots infuriated to inſanity, and with bigots infatuated to phrenzy, a continuous ſucceſſion paſſes of every ſpecies of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrife that can annoy men's preſent repoſe, or cut off their hope of future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Nor are theſe the worſt aſpects of confederate forms. Venality, and of courſe corruption, appear here to have reigned in full vigour. Not only individuals, but whole bodies have been bought and ſold, with a profligacy unparalleled in other hiſtory. A low and deadly jealouſy perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually urges to multiplied embarraſſments, and cuts off every ſhadow of harmony, while ambition inflates every evil propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the utmoſt pitch of malice. Hence faction tears unceaſingly, the quivering limbs of the victim, and it knows no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037419_0033_100D3CDD705BAB50"/>of repoſe from either preſent miſery, or certain apprehenſion. A ſtruggle for predominance generally commences at an early period, between the different members, and this ſtruggle never fails to diſplay all the worſt paſſions of human nature in their worſt forms. Theſe ſtruggles termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the preponderance of ſome one State, more fortunate than the reſt, and they muſt be content to ſubmit, in a condition bordering o ſervility, to its imperious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates: as in the inſtance of Berne in the Swiſs Cantons, and of Holland in the Seven Provinces.</p>
            <p>So abhorrent is equality to every impulſe of human nature, that men are not only found reſtive under the application of this principle to them as individuals, but ſtill more ſo in their political relations. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath wiſely ordained a chain of grades and ſubordinacies, from the peaſant to the peer, from the monarch to the collected majeſty of all monarchs. It is the frequent office of philoſophical arrogance to attempt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037419_0034_100D3CDFACF17E40"/>the diſarrangement of this beautiful ſyſtem, by interpoſing the ſtumbling-blocks and the fooliſhneſs of infidelity, and the vile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of mortal vanity. To the voice of philoſophers, men have delighted more to liſten than to the voice of that wiſdom which is from on high: but as they have delighted to drink at the polluted ſtreams of Sophiſtry rather than at the pure fountains of life, they have drank deep damnation to themſelves and their poſterity: as they have ſwerved from thoſe maxims by which ſociety had been wont to be held together—ſanctified in their origin, and embalmed in every heart by their beneficent effects, men have unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryingly fallen off to that ſtate in which the remembrance of refinement and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſyſtem exiſt but in projects for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalizing mankind, and burying every wonted regulation of ſociety under a maſs of chaotic jargon.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is an entire thing: it is a ſyſtem of influence, penetrating the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of modeſt virtue, and the den of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037419_0035_100D3CE13AF01E98"/>the lurking conſpirator,—encouraging and cheering, and praiſing and rewarding and promoting and bleſſing whatſoever things of goodneſs and of fair report come in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact with it; and ſtamping its ſeal of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or of excommunication upon every naſcent principle of evil. A well ordered State is a flouriſhing Oak—the Conſtitution is its Trunk—its various miniſters are the ramifications—each forming after its capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a proper conduit, through which circulates the bounteous ſtream of the parent trunk, to the leaves and foliages; which like the diverſified actors on the great theatre of life are perpetually coming on and going off, while the mutual dependance is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubſerved by the ſuperior permanency of the intermediate branches. The leaves periodically wither—but the trunk and its branches ſurvive in unimpaired vigour and glory: the hand of violence may prune it of its branches—the dependant leaves then periſh by the ſtroke; yet the Tree is ſtill a Tree: but the blow which levels the trunk annihilates the whole together.</p>

THE venerable parent Trunk, every half-lunatic quack and ſubaltern juggler, thinks he may now ſubject to his delirious incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. No unhappy metal hath been ever more tortured with fire, or the violence of iron, by crack-brained Chemiſts, hunting the Philoſopher's Stone, than has the Conſtitution of almoſt every State, by the Talgols, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drophels and Wackums of the preſent age.

When the charm is firm and good, it is their way to ſouſe the unhappy victim into the fatal vortex. It expires in their hands, and in the act of bubbling over the dragons' ſcales, and wolves' teeth, and fenny ſnakes, and tygers' chaudrons, and adders' forks, and blind worms' ſtings, which now with

WITH infuriate and idiotic air, another deſcription of beings exhibit an inſtrument with which they are deſirous to divide the trunk into a multitude of equal parts, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it may the better accommodate their paſſion for variety by growing in new, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excentric forms; and to gratify this propenſity to change and novelty, are very content to riſk its life.</p>
            <p>IT is time, in the idea of Burke, to <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate</hi> the State. It is time to beſtow on it whatever degree of venerability and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is capable of receiving, that the hand of innovation may be caſt into the fire, as the hand of ſacrilege and patricide. We have ſailed round the world of novelty without making any diſcovery worth retaining, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that our diſcoveries are worthleſs. We have touched on iſland after iſland, we have diſcovered new rocks, new quickſands and new ſhoals, but we have discovered no new continent—we are yet afloat on a wide and procelloſe ocean. In a tone of much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

It is indeed time to haul up the veſſel, and to repair the ravages of tempeſts and whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds; to ſecure a competent rudder, to repair the ſails, and even the keel; inſtead of painting and patching over her defects, by arts which cannot content the wary, who confide nothing in gilded baubles.</p>
            <p>POSTERITY will ſcarce believe, that with ſo many fatal examples before their eyes, and after the bloody tragedy of Foederaliſm acted in France, under their immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, a race of men could have been found, ſufficiently ſtupid and ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated, to wiſh for a repetition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Yet ſuch is the fact, and that man muſt be blind as ignorance itſelf, who does not perceive an intention to revive the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Confederation, in the opinions and practices of the Democrats.</p>

IT is this intention, evidently tantamount to an entire revolution, that the preceding pages are deſigned to expoſe, and if poſſible to defeat.</p>
