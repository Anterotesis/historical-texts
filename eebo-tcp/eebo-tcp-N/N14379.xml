            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </opener>
               <p>AS the ſubject before us is the common ſalvation, I take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to lay aſide your addition, as that which no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the point in controverſy, and conſider myſelf as on a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect level with you, (your ſuperiority in years excepted, to which I mean ever to have a due regard) that I may write with that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and plaineſs, that becomes one, contending for a truth, which I judge, of equal importance to all the deſcendants from apoſtate Adam. I remember to have heard this obſervation, that while we are attempting to pull down our neighbour's one idol, we are in danger of ſetting up two of our own; but I hope I am not ſo ignorant of the pride of the human heart, and the devices of the grand adverſary, as to think myſelf not equally liable with others engaged in controverſial writings, to contend for victory and triumph, rather than truth; and of being influenced by the vanity of my carnal mind, rather than the meekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt. To him who is able to keep me from falling into the condemnation of the devil, I now commit myſelf, and proceed to the remarks propoſed; may they be made with that meekneſs that becomes the man who fears God, loves his truth, doth not deſpiſe, but love his neighbour.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the many objections I have againſt your performance, I muſt acknowledge there are ſome things in it that juſtly demands one's attention, in the premonition to the reader; your bringing up to view, Matthew 7, 13, 14, the exhortation to enter into the ſtraight gate—and to beware of falſe prophets; was very agreeable as you preſent it to view—"as coming from the great light of the world, the only and true way to God and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;" and it ſixed my tho'ts the more, as it is a paſſage of ſcripture that has many years engaged me in the inquiring what is the true

import of it, as not knowing but that I might profit by your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations thereof, which indeed did not appear ſatisfactory to my mind, more than any thing that I had been before acquainted with; therefore I ſet my ſelf to inquire into the meaning of thoſe words of the Lord and Saviour, with other parts of the divine word, by compairing ſcripture with ſcripture, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

i.e. of all men; it is God, not Chriſt."—"Let us look into 1ſt. of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2.3. and we ſhall ſee who is God our ſaviour, and we ſhall ſee that in the Greek it runs, <hi>in the ſight of the ſaviour our God, and ſervants are enjoined to ſhew all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of God our ſaviour in all things,</hi> in <hi>Titus</hi> 2.10. but it is in the Greek, <hi>that they may adorn the doctrine of the ſaviour our God in all things</hi>—and how contrary is this to the interpretation of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> as well as other Arians. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is the truth as it is in Jeſus the ſaviour our God and worthy of all acceptation." And in page 14. line 8 from the top, you ſay, "if the words be juſtly tranſlated the ſenſe will be, there is one God and one mediator of God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo it ſignifies that the mediator is both God and man;— but we note, that the learned <hi>Bitterfield,</hi> has propoſed this tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, which it muſt be owned anſwers word for word to the Greek;—the one God, the one who is alſo mediator of God and man, is the man Chriſt Jeſus; ſo then the man Chriſt Jeſus, who is the mediator, is God as well as man, ſo that he is God and man united." The above quotation is what ſtrikes my mind with ſatisfaction, as the truth as it is in Jeſus the ſaviour our God; and were I capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to recommend them to every ones conſideration I would do it—though I cannot, I dare not, for any other paragraph in your whole performance;—and what follows immediately here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, is as ſhocking as that quotation was pleaſing; to which you add, "but although this mediator has given himſelf a ranſom for all; for it muſt be granted that he has given a ſufficient ranſom and propitiation for all; and he will not caſt abroad any, who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently come to him as he requires, to gain and enjoy the benefit of it; yet it is no where ſaid, that they who will not come to him for life and happineſs ſhall enjoy the benefit of his ranſom and propitiation;"—the ſum of which is, that though our ſaviour be God and has given himſelf a ranſom, a ſufficient ranſom and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for all, yet it depends upon the will of man, whether any ſhall enjoy the benefits of it;—I would aſk you ſir?

a little: "Salvation for all men revealed a ſcripture dictrine,"— then it is a truth, a revealed truth it could not be, if it were not an original, eternal truth. I think I need ſay no more on this.

                        <p>But the text ſays, <hi>That in the name of Jeſus, every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> As when a poor woman, who hath no riches, no worthineſs, nothing by which ſhe can attain any thing in her own name, is married to a Prince, ſhe is intituled to his name, his perſon, his riches, his honour, and now appearing in his name, ſhe is regarded as him. So when in the name of Jeſus, every knee ſhall bow, it is in this view, exactly ſimiliar to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to which the apoſtle here alludes; the very matter of what every tongue ſhall ſwear, is, <hi>Surely ſhall ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength, to him ſhall come</hi>;—Surely ſhall ſay, the mind ſhall be as ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of this truth, as ever any perſon was of any thing to which he was called to ſwear; theſe things being ſo, we have the joint evidence of both teſtaments to this truth, confirmed by the blood of the new teſtament, by the death of the teſtator, and witneſs in his reſurrection: So however dark, ignorant, guilty and miſerable, we are in ourſelves; when we come to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, to bow in his name, we may ſing: <q>
                              <l>Thou art our wiſdom, Thou our guide,</l>
                              <l>Thou art our righteouſneſs;</l>
                              <l>We're blind and guilty, thee beſides,</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>For he is made to us, of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redemption: He hath a name above every name, <hi>That in the name of Jeſus, every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſurely ſhall ſay; In the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength; to him ſhall come.</hi> So be it, the Lord haſten it, in his time.</p>
                     </note> and every tongue ſhall ſwear, ſurely ſhall ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength—unto him ſhall come, and all that are inſenſed againſt him in all be aſhamed: In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi>

only, living and true God; but is ſuch a one as is ſpoken of in verſe 20, <hi>A graven image, a God that cannot ſave</hi>:—No matter whether graven on wood, or in the imagination of thoſe that pray unto a God that cannot ſave; and as he is the ſame yeſterday, to day and forever, with whom there is no variableneſs, neither ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of turning; conſequently, whenever any come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, they know the juſt God and the ſaviour; there is none elſe, no God beſide; and this is his true character, whether we know it or not;—So then, when the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of God, as we are are aſſured it ſhall, it will be with knowledge of the juſt God and the ſaviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth.</hi>—Here is a call or command, to all the ends of the earth, it is his pleaſure that it ſhould be ſo; and what the Lord pleaſeth, that he doth: <hi>For I God and none elſe, I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs—That unto me, every knee</hi> ſhall bow, <hi>and every tongue</hi> ſhall ſwear.—Then follows the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the oath that every tongue ſhall ſwear, <hi>Surely ſhall ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength</hi>;—This being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, will invalidate the objection; for if every tongue ſhall ſurely ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength, they ſhall ſurely be ſaved by him, they ſhall have no lack of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor ſtrength.—<hi>Unto him ſhall come</hi>— And ſurely the comers are the true worſhippers, they are ſo deſcribed, under the old teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament diſpenſation, as <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10.1.—Could never make the comer thereunto perfect; that is, the worſhippers under that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and under the new teſtament diſpenſation. In 1ſt of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 2.4. the worſhippers are deſcribed by coming to Jeſus Chriſt, who has promiſed reſt to the weary and heavy laden, on their coming to him. <hi>Matthew</hi> 11.28. Coming is alſo ſynonimous to believing:—<hi>He that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> So then in this view, when it is ſaid, <hi>unto him ſhall come,</hi> it intends they ſhall be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of him, believing on his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed</hi>—Who have been incenſed againſt him? Surely all <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.3. <hi>He was diſpiſed and rejected of men; He was diſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not</hi>—Surely, you and I have been incenſed againſt him, and it is high time for us to be aſhamed of the carcaſſes of our whoredoms and deteſtable things—it is time for us, with our ſiſters, <hi>Sodom, Samariah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be aſhamed and confounded, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018215_0026_0FA5C117AC49A198"/>
never open our mouths any more becauſe of our ſhame; when he hath revealed himſelf in Chriſt, pacified towards us for all that we have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> By Iſrael I underſtand Jeſus Chriſt. Who are his ſeed? Thoſe that are bleſſed in him; that is, all the nations of the earth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.18.—<hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.27. <hi>All the ends of the world ſhall remember and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before thee; for the kingdom is the Lord's, and he the Governor among the nations: A ſeed ſhall ſerve him; it ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a generation; they ſhall come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteouſneſs unto a people that ſhall be born, that he hath done.</hi> The choſen ſeed that in every age are brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, are a ſpecimen, an earneſt, the firſt fruits unto God and the Lamb, and are choſen for this end, as we may ſee in the firſt of <hi>Epheſians,</hi> from the beginning to the 10th verſe: See verſe 5th. <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> Verſe 9th. <hi>Having made known unto us the miſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelf:</hi> For this end, verſe 10th, <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fullneſs of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being the caſe, way is made to call upon "all the human race, as we are required, to ſerve Jehovah our Lord, our God and Judge, with fear, and rejoice with trembling, and ſeaſonably repent and give glory to God in Chriſt Jeſus;" not as you expreſs it, "that we may not be vexed with his ſore and perpetual diſpleaſure," but becauſe he has blotted out, as a thick cloud, our tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud, our ſins, we are called to return, for I have redeemed thee. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.22.</p>
               <p>But I would further take notice of another particular you mention.</p>
               <p>You ſay, "that the ſame epithet is uſed for the puniſhment of the wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the life of the righteous, and why muſt a two-fold meaning be given to it?" Page 22, line 14 from the top.</p>
               <p>The reaſon I would offer, is in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Sin reigns to death, but grace reigns through righteouſneſs to eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who ſays, <hi>becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo: But death, which is the wages of ſin, and the extent of its reign

is to be deſtroyed and ſwallowed up in victory, when the Lord God, with his own benign hand ſhall wipe tears from all faces.</hi>

                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:018215_0029_0FA5C11C13FBE7E0"/>If we imagine our honour is ſtruck at in ſome things, that we ſay, fleſh and blood can't bear, we cannot be ſo abaſed, as he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, was diſpiſed and rejected, derided, blindfolded, buffeted, ſpit upon and ſuffered ignominy, till he could ſay as, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.20. <hi>Reproach hath broken my heart</hi>—yet he failed not, nor was diſcouraged, but went through his undertaking, till he could ſay, <hi>it is finiſhed</hi>; and hath in his wiſdom and love, ordered this very circumſtance to ſubdue our pride, and teach us our honour lies in denying ourſelves and following him, in conformity to his example of meekneſs, who when he was reviled, reviled not again. And to his precepts, and the precepts of his apoſtles: <hi>But I ſay unto you, that ye reſiſt not evil; but if any man ſmite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other alſo: Recompence to no man evil for evil; be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi>

               <p>If he is pleaſed to bereave us of relations, even thoſe that had the chief place in our affections, it is ordered in wiſdom and love by him, who gave his own life a ranſom for us, and knows what we need, to cure us of idolizing them, and to ſhew us, that he alone, is our chief good—(a perſon who had repeatedly been bereaved, upon inquiring, what have I done, that I muſt be ſo afflicted; had his mouth ſtoped by this reply—what have you not done) for every Babel tower we build upon our children, <hi>to make us a name</hi>; every ſpreading gourd that our imaginations bring up in a night, of which we are exceeding glad—our towering imaginations of future greatneſs, and worldly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in our relations, are all known to him, and he ſees when it is neceſſary to take them from us; who corrects us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs.—If our troubles are greater than theſe, and we have living afflictions, and of long continuance in our relations, there is a hiſtory in <hi>Mark</hi> 5th, from 1ſt to the 19th, deſigned for the conſolation of ſuch relations.—<hi>Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things Jeſus hath done for thee, and had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on thee</hi>—He is the ſame, and has the ſame deſigns in view, in his diſpenſations. The ſickneſs of Lazarus was for the glory of God, that the ſon of God might be glorified thereby—The man was born blind, that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him; yea, a tribute of glory is ariſing to him who caſt out ſeven devils from Mary Magdalen, and ſet the adultereſs free, with direction to go and ſin no more. If I could paint out greater affliction than any I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt be the diſtreſſed caſe of poor prodigal children, from their fathers houſes, ladened with guilt, oppreſſed with ſhame, afflicted with a ſtubborn loathneſs to return, pinched with hunger, going with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſteps towards the place where the ſwine are fed, to look for relief from thence.—Even this painting hath a bright ſide, when we conſider that in all the diſtreſs into which their wilful, ſhameful folly hath plunged them; there is a deſign of love in over-ruling all this miſery, as a means to bring them to themſelves, and return them to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe:—What, though they may not yet have come to this length, and are reſolvedly guarding againſt this depth of diſtreſs and poverty that

hath been deſcribed;—though they chuſe to continue in the way lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto; there is this conſolation, that <hi>every knee ſhall bow, and the loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, and the haughtineſs of man ſhall be made low, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted, and the idols he ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would further ſay, we are the property of our Creator, Preſerver and Redeemer, and obliged to glorify him in our ſpirits, and bodies, which are his; then ſurely, we are not our own, nor at our own diſpoſal, and it is our indiſpenſible duty to keep the place he allots, and do what he bids us, till he calls us away. To ſuppoſe our lives at our own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, is a ſtrong deluſion to believe a lie; and as this deluſion has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the minds of thoſe that have profeſſed a high ſenſe of honour and honeſty in their dealings among men, I would endeavour to ſhew, 1ſt. that it is the moſt contemptible ſentiment that can be embraced— 2d. it is the moſt knaviſh and diſhoneſt, beyond high-way robbery— 3dly. it is the moſt ungrateful:</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The moſt contemptible, not only as it tends to brand the name and memory of a man from age to age among men, but firſt, as it is the evidence of murmuring and diſcontent with the allotments of a wiſe and kind providence, it is a deluſion that has its riſe from enmity to God.—2dly, As it tends to a fooliſh, fruitleſs attempt to run away from our rightful owner; I ſay, fruitleſs, becauſe it is impoſſible, for <hi>If I aſcend unto heaven, thou art there; If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there: If I ſay, the darkneſs ſhall cover me, even the night ſhall be light about me; yea the darkneſs hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day; the darkneſs and the light both alike to thee.</hi>—And what is more fooliſh and contemptible than a runaway, who finally runs right into the hands of his maſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. It Is the moſt knaviſh, as it tends to an attempt to rob God at once of all his property that is in our power.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. It is the moſt ungrateful, as it is directly contrary to all that love, grace and mercy, that is made manifeſt in the goſpel, and to our duty conſequent thereupon: <hi>For the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation unto all men, hath appeared; teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope, even the glorious appearing of the great God, even our ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf, a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3dly. A ſenſe of obligation to gratitude and obedience, reſults from the belief of this truth; whoever knows it, knows they are not their own, but bought with a price, and under indiſputable, indiſpenſible, eternal obligations, to glorify God in their ſpirit and bodies, which are his. Then ſurely we ought always to keep our eye on his will, as our rule in all our actions, and look on our intereſt, our time, and all our talents, as his, and at his ſervice, and be frequently enquiring of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether what we ſpeak and do, is agreeable to the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus, concerning us, agreeable to the exhortation, <hi>Colloſſians,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:018215_0031_0FA5C11D7B651FB8"/>
3.17. <hi>Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And whenever we act contrary thereto, we are guilty of baſe ingratitude.</p>
               <p>What is worſe than to call a man ungrateful? Yet black as it is, we are guilty of it every time we harken to the temptations of ſatan, and walk after our own luſts. What can be conceived of, ſo ungrateful, as when the grace of God, that bringeth ſalvation to all men, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, inſtead of harkening to what it teaches, men curſe and damn one another, bite and devour one another?</p>
               <p>When he feeds and cloaths us, the tendency of our hearts is, <hi>to make empty the ſoul of the hungry, and cauſe the drink of the thirſty to fail, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing wicked devices, with lying words even when the needy ſpeaketh right. Iſaiah</hi> 32.6, 7. O our ingratitude! <hi>The ox knoweth his owner and the aſs his maſter's crib; but my people doth not know Iſrael doth not conſider. Iſaiah</hi> 1.3. But is there hope for us? Yes; 1ſt of <hi>John,</hi> 3 5. <hi>And ye know that he was manifeſt to take away our ſins.</hi> 1ſt of <hi>John,</hi> 3 8. <hi>For this purpoſe the ſon of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> Well may we cry out with the prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Surely then we are called, 4thly, to thankſgiving. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44 23. <hi>Sing, O ye he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This is a ſubject that would lead our minds from eternity to eternity, back to the ſource and fountain of mercy, which the apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſays, <hi>God is love;</hi> and forward to the fruit of the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, the reward of his righteouſneſs, to <hi>the hope laid up in heaven,</hi> to what <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man to conceive</hi>: For which all the diſpenſations of providence are over-ruled in the preſent life; which, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, would lead the mind to an underſtanding of that exhortation to the diſciples, 1ſt of <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 5.19. <hi>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus, concerning you.</hi> But as this opens a large field, and I have already been more lengthy than I intended, I ſhall cloſe with that ſhort, comprehenſive exhortation, we have in pſalm CXVII. <hi>O praiſe the Lord all ye nations; Praiſe him all ye people, for his merciful kindneſs is great towards us, and the truth of the Lord forever: Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>
