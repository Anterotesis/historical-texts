            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the gay and diſſolute reign of Charles the ſecond, when wit was almoſt as general as licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, and a happy vivacity and good perſon the ſureſt recommendations, Henry Arundel was diſtinguiſhed from a crowd of faſhionable liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, by a ſuperiority of elegance, taſte and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance: in a word, for all thoſe ſeducing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements which lend a charm to vice in every age, and for which that was particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
            <p>Arundel, though not wholly deſerving of the laviſh admiration he every where extorted, had advantages few men could boaſt. His figure was graceful; and, what is often thought ſtill better, it was faſhionable: his eyes, naturally fine, had the art of ſaying the prettieſt things in the world
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037796_0004_100F5293B0D56378"/>
to every pretty woman: his manners were ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating: he ſung well, danced well, and dreſſed well. Could any thing further be added to his character? Yet, with all theſe advantages—ſtrange does it ſeem to ſay—Arundel was at heart a diſcontented man. Highly as the world thought of him, there was an individual in it whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion roſe much beyond theirs: it was himſelf: and he ſecretly repined, that ſo much merit, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and grace, had never yet raiſed him to a rank above that he was born to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Arundel was indeed of good family; though, to his unceaſing regret, he had early in life debaſed himſelf by marrying a lady whoſe connections did not add luſtre to it. She was the daughter of an officer of more loyalty than rank, who had ſerved his country in the cauſe of Charles the firſt, and had followed the fortunes of his ſon.</p>
            <p>Cromwell was then protector: dancing and dreſſing were not in faſhion; and mr. Arundel conſequently reſided with his lady on his patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial eſtate in Cornwall. Some years paſſed before they had any children, when he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with an heir, and rather more ſurpriſed on finding himſelf ſoon afterwards a widower.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037796_0005_100F52BCA8F65FB8"/>
Never truly alive either to conjugal or parental affection, he expreſſed little regret on the loſs of an amiable wiſe, nor any great emotion at ſight of her offspring. Decent care, however, was taken of the child; and as all England became inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly engroſſed by politics, his father thought oftener of them than of the little Henry.</p>
            <p>The Reſtoration of Charles the ſecond gave that luſtre to London to which it had long been a ſtranger. Henry Arundel had only to ſhew himſelf there to be admired: his perſon won the ladies—his addreſs the monarch; and from a neglected country gentleman, he found himſelf in a few years the idol of a gay and elegant court. Rapidly as the change was effected, it yet could not fail to bring with it ſome knowledge of the world. He began to think himſelf born to fill the moſt elevated rank there; and regretted too late the having entailed a tax both on his eſtate and his pleaſures, and perhaps prepared a rival at a time of life when he was likely to find himſelf but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpoſed to endure one.</p>
            <p>Mr. Arundel, it may eaſily be judged, was not a man of principle: he therefore formed rather a reſolution than a plan; and, without exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alyſing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037796_0006_100F52959AA78C20"/>
his own motives. ſent his ſon, at two years of age, into France, under the care of a perſon who had once been his miſtreſs, and whoſe declining health induced her to try a more ſettled climate than her own. The woman had her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. The birth of young Henry was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully concealed; and her death, which happened three years after, left the child in the hands of ſtrangers, at a ſmall Engliſh ſchool in Normandy, where an annual ſtipend freed his father from all further anxiety: from the relations of his deceaſed wife he had nothing to fear: moſt of them were dead: the reſt were wanderers over the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; diſtreſſed by the ingratitude of a monarch whom they had abandoned every thing to ſerve.</p>
            <p>Time now rolled rapidly away in vanity and pleaſure; but time, though it had not yet robbed mr. Arundel of his graces, had produced an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible alteration in them: that of novelty was vaniſhing faſt. He began only to pleaſe, where he was accuſtomed to captivate; and had even ſome vague ſurmiſes, that he might ſoon ceaſe to do either, when fortune reſolved, by one ſtroke, to atone for all her paſt inattention.</p>
            <p>The young heireſs of the illuſtrious houſe of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037796_0007_100F52BF0BB2C810"/>
Lindſey was at that period firſt preſented at court. She was beautiful, rich, and had juſt ſeen enough of the world to value all the graces it beſtows. Arundel caught her eye, while his was directed elſewhere: the ſuperior elegance of his perſon fixed her attention; and when he was introduced, a ſofter ſentiment ſunk into her heart. He was ſtill enough the faſhion to make his name a theme of converſation, as ſhe dropped it amongſt her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; nor was it long before he diſcovered that ſhe had done ſo often. The <hi>denouëment</hi> it is not difficult to gueſs: he preſently found that he might win the lady, and therefore inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that he would; but the blind goddeſs, who ſo often embitters her own gifts, was now preparing one for him, which, of all others, he leaſt ſuſpected he ſhould ever deem a misfortune, ſince it appeared in the ſhape of a patent of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To the nobility in his own perſon, indeed, he bore not the ſlighteſt objection; but the clauſe by which it was limited to his heirs, unluckily brought to his recollection a poor little boy in France, who was juſt beginning to wonder to whom he belonged, whenever he found time to do ſo from the more important employments of ſtudying bad Latin, and playing ſchool pranks with his companions; yet this poor little boy had
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037796_0008_100F52994782D230"/>
moſt certainly been brought honourably into the world, ſome years before. Arundel well knew the houſe of Lindſey to be too proud to ſtoop to an <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> where ſuch an obſtacle intervened: he therefore very prudently determined they never ſhould know it. The marriage articles were ſigned without any ſuch impediment being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; and miſs Lindſey became a wife and a mother, in the full conviction that both families were indebted to her for an heir.</p>
            <p>And what became of little Henry?—Why, little Henry was now ſhot up beyond his years; not ſtrictly handſome, yet winning; not formed, yet ingratiating: light traces of ſenſibility and judgment wandered over the glare of youth, like clouds upon ſunſhine, and gave his character a graceful ſhade. The impoſſibility of detaining him where he was, and the fear of detection when he arrived at maturity, had obliged his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to change his mode of education; and he had conſigned him to a tutor, who, though ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of the ſecret, was bound by many ties to conceal it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mortimer—for ſuch was the name which the above-mentioned gentleman choſe on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037796_0009_10121817613A12B0"/>
to aſſume—had once been the companion of mr. Arundel, before he was dignified with the title of lord Lindſey; and had paſſed in his ſociety ſome of thoſe hours, the recollection of which ſhould ſeem to unite man to man, if the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every day did not prove the diſtinction between joviality and friendſhip. To ſay truth, mr. Mortimer's character, while yet immatured by adverſity, did not ſeem to demand or deſerve ſuperior regard; and was one of thoſe which, for want of a deciſive <hi>trait,</hi> the world has agreed to diſtinguiſh by the epithet of <hi>eaſy.</hi> Prodigal without being rich, and diſſolute without being vicious, he found himſelf at fifty a wanderer from his family, friendleſs, and impoveriſhed; and was contented to accept an annuity from lord Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, under ſuch reſtrictions as every day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him were both cruel and mean.</p>
            <p>"Let the boy want nothing that a moderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come can ſupply!"—Such were the words of his lordſhip's letter to Mortimer: "Let him travel—if, as you ſay, he fancies it, and can do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out additional expence: but, above all, ſeize the firſt opportunity of an attachment to marry him, and ſettle his eſtabliſhment in ſome province which he may never think of quitting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:037796_0010_1012181555F2F138"/>
"You know my ſituation—Lady Lindſey is in a dying ſtate:—The phyſicians even threaten me with a voyage to Liſbon. My ſon requires all the indulgences ſuitable to the importance of his rank; and, indeed, my employments at court do not allow me to retrench. From theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, you will conclude how little I am able to ſupply any extraordinary expence. As to my own ſtate of health, it is much as uſual. The gout and rheumatiſm, indeed, make pretty fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent attacks upon me; and I have ſome returns of the giddineſs in my head. Theſe excepted, I find myſelf as young, and as well diſpoſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſures of life, as at five-and-twenty."</p>
            <p>Such was the language of five-and-fifty!—Such <hi>was</hi>—May I not ſay, ſuch is it every day?</p>
            <p>But though loud Lindſey perceived not the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in himſelf, the world was not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant: His friends found out that he was weak; his enemies, that he was unprincipled: the old thought him too young; and the young diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered daily that he was too old. In two points only were they all agreed; that he was an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious huſband and a fooliſhly fond father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:037796_0011_100F52C091F15688"/>
"What is it that takes your attention ſo much?" ſaid Mortimer to his pupil, as they jogged on towards Bruſſels in a duſty <hi>chaiſe de poſte,</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply filled with two gentlemen and a raw-boned Swiſs, who ſerved both as valet: "Is it the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificent ſuite that has juſt paſſed us, or the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered coxcombs in it?"</p>
            <p>"It is an <hi>Engliſh</hi> carriage," replied Henry, ſtill following it with his eyes, through the cloud of duſt in which its rapid movement had involved their more humble vehicle.</p>
            <p>"So much the worſe," returned the other. "Would not a man ſwear, from its ſtructure, that it was the temple of luxury? One might really ſuppoſe that the joints of our modern men of faſhion—" a violent jolt that brought his head in rather too cloſe a contact with that of the Swiſs interrupted his ſpeech, which was as ſuddenly drowned by the poſtillions, who, clack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their whips, gave notice of the poſt-houſe.</p>
            <p>The carriage <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at had paſſed them ſtood at the door as they drew up. It was an Engliſh poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariot, elegantly built, followed by two grooms, ſo perfectly <hi>à l' Anglaiſe</hi> as to attract univerſal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037796_0012_100F529F8C8B3E20"/>
one of whom led a capital horſe, which, by its appearance, ſeemed deſigned for his maſter.</p>
            <p>"Lewis, open the door, and bring up <hi>Comete,</hi>" ſaid a young man, touching the ſpring of the blind, and diſcovering both himſelf and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion at full to the curious eyes of our travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers—"I'll ride the next poſt!"</p>
            <p>"Not on that horſe!" interrupted an elderly gentleman in black at his elbow, in a tone which, as it ſeemed preliminary to much longer expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, made his companion ſpring with ſome abruptneſs from the carriage.</p>
            <p>A form light, graceful, elegant; a countenance lighted up with all the bloom and fire of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, at once fixed the eyes of Henry and his tutor. It was not mere beauty, it was vigour—it was intelligence—it was character, that ſeemed to live in the motion, and ſpeak in the features, of the young ſtranger.</p>
            <p>"I am afraid, gentlemen," ſaid he, advancing, "that we are robbing you of horſes!" caſting his eyes upon thoſe his <hi>avant-courier</hi> had indeed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037796_0013_100F52C22C4B2068"/>
and, by the ſame motion, directing the attention of Mortimer to a melancholy truth, which the poſt-maſter, after condeſcending to mention once to the Swiſs, had left them to digeſt at leiſure. Clamour, fretting, and altercation ſucceeded on all parts, except on thoſe of Henry and the young ſtranger, who ſeemed on terms of perfect familiarity, before their graver tutors had exchanged ten words.</p>
            <p>"The matter is very eaſily arranged," ſaid the young man: "Do you, ſir," turning to Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, "take my place in the carriage: my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's horſe (which was a beautiful creature) ſhall be at this gentleman's ſervice. I will ride my own; and our fellows have only to wait an hour or two, and follow in your carriage as ſoon as a freſh reinforcement arrives.</p>
            <p>To this propoſal a ſort of doubtful pauſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, which was broken by the gentleman in black, who, in a peeviſh tone, exclaimed, "I have told you, ſir, you ought never to ride that horſe again!"</p>
            <p>"Nay, pr'ythee, Walbrook," returned the other, gaily, "no more muſty debates!—Had he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037796_0014_100F52A29586B248"/>
really broken my neck in his laſt frolic, as you ſeemed to apprehend, the world would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been much the loſer. My ſteed, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen," added he, addreſſing himſelf on the the other ſide, "is ſo much of my own taſte, as to have an inſtinctive averſion to every thing old or ugly; and having yeſterday the misfortune to be ſurpriſed by a ſhrivelled Dutch hag ſitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a hedge, he took the liberty of diſmounting his maſter.—But, <hi>allons, mes amis!</hi>—I like him not the worſe for it.—Give me a horſe that will follow a <hi>pretty</hi> woman half the world over, and I'll compound for a few vagaries at ſight of an ugly one." Without waiting a reply, he ſprung into the ſaddle, caſt a look of invitation, which was inſtantly complied with, on Arundel, and, touching his hat to the ſeniors, both gentlemen were out of ſight in a moment. Walbrook groaned inwardly; Mortimer ſhrugged; the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillions again clacked their whips, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage rattled once more over the <hi>pavé.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Is the old gentleman behind us your father, or your tutor?" ſaid the younger ſtranger, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his horſe that his valet might tie up his hair, which, from the velocity of their motion, had got looſe and ſlowed over his ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:037796_0015_100F52C491314E60"/>
"<hi>Both, perhaps!</hi>" cried Truth, in the boſom of Arundel, though his tongue inſtinctively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, "Neither. He is my friend!"</p>
            <p>"A moſt <hi>reverend</hi> one!" ſaid the other, archly.</p>
            <p>"A kind one," returned Arundel, "and a wiſe one!—He gives me the beſt advice poſſible."</p>
            <p>"So will I—<hi>gratis,</hi> too! and there, perhaps, I have the advantage of him!"</p>
            <p>"You muſt ſeek it firſt, I believe," retorted Henry, ſmiling.</p>
            <p>"Not far—I have it in folio—on my chaſe! I love an old friend as well as you do, when I can carry him in my imperial; and to make the matter eaſier, my friend is my father."</p>
            <p>"And who may this father be?" thought A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel—yet he had not the courage to aſk. The note of interrogation ſo common with travellers, was not yet familiar to him: yet had he lived with Frenchmen, and, <hi>par hazard,</hi> had been aſked almoſt every poſſible queſtion with that polite imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence a Frenchman ſo thoroughly underſtands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:037796_0016_100F52A431FD0AF8"/>
But while glowing youth and exhilarated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits thus cemented the liking of the two juvenile travellers, their ſober tutors were far from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating their ſentiments. Life, like the magnet, has two points; the one does not more forcibly attract, than the other can repel; and our party <hi>quarré</hi> were ſtationed at theſe oppoſite extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>Yet were not either mr. Walbrook or mr. Mortimer without curioſity: from the former, however, a name had eſcaped which plunged his companion in a profound <hi>reverie;</hi> nor was it till a flaſk of Burgundy gave freſh circulation to his ſpirits that he appeared to recover himſelf.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Lindſey, your glaſs!" ſaid Walbrook, who was alſo beginning to relinquiſh his ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious taciturnity.</p>
            <p>Mortimer ſtarted again at the name; again looked at the young man who bore it; and again a vague and painful ſentiment of remorſe, enforced by the conviction that his ſurmiſes were right, ſhot acroſs his heart.—The countenance of the ſtranger, his arms, his liveries, his age, all united to prove that he could be no other than the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Arundel—his <hi>younger</hi> brother, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037796_0017_100F52C78F3A2D98"/>
to invade his rights—to annihilate, as it ſhould ſeem, his very exiſtence. Again Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſighed, and again relapſed into uſeleſs reverie. For there is a weakneſs in certain minds, which renders them alternately the prey of pleaſure and remorſe, without power to perpetuate the one, or profit by the other; as the wildeſt trees will put forth bloſſoms, though they require culture and attention to produce fruits.</p>
            <p>"A bumper, gentlemen!" ſaid Walbrook. "I mean to give you a toaſt—My worthy friend and patron, lord Lindſey!"</p>
            <p>"My father!" ſaid the young ſtranger, as he negligently lifted the glaſs to his lips. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret monitor in the boſom of Mortimer ſmote him again—"<hi>Father!</hi>" repeated he, as he caſt his eyes upon Henry: "yet, is the diſcovery new to me?—No! but the epithet is: and what is an epithet?"—Thus arrogantly argued reaſon, while modeſt feeling ſhrunk abaſhed.—Feeling, that indefinable union of the material and immaterial nature; that ſpontaneous ſenſe of right which would ſo often guide when reaſon would miſlead us; and which, though rejected and rebuked, ſtill calls a bluſh into the cheek if the idea ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037796_0018_100F52A81697D810"/>
familiarized to our own boſoms, is inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently obtruded by the lips of another.</p>
            <p>But theſe are metaphyſics!—Metaphyſics in Flanders! We ſhall talk logic next among the Iroquois in North America. Let us change the ſcene then and place our travellers, now ſworn and boſom friends, three whole weeks back, in France—<hi>France!</hi> lovely country! let me ſtop to weep over thee!—to aſk, where are the nobles whoſe valour once graced, the peaſantry whoſe mirth enlivened thee!—the monarch, over whoſe early and unmerited grave the generous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened of every nation ſhed tears of pity!—And you, ſavage band of ruffians, who to the hideous idol ye miſcalled Liberty daily offered up a ſacrifice of human blood, and tears more painful than blood, deem not that your names ſhall be mentioned—your memories be tranſmitted to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity—but, as the ſcum of that mighty maſs, which, "billowed high with human agitation," muſt at laſt purify itſelf!</p>
            <p>As yet, however, France was a country. It had arts; it had manufactures; it had even a police—a bad one, indeed; but a police that at leaſt allowed its inhabitants to carry their heads
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037796_0019_100F52C9D6A1EA30"/>
upon their ſhoulders in perference to a pike—that occaſionally plundered them of their money, but made it no crime that they had ſome to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of—that often ſtript the beautiful plant of genius of its leaves, but never buried it beneath that coarſe and rugged ſoil which blaſts its very root.</p>
            <p>"Will nobody teach theſe fellows that they are miſerable?" ſaid Lindſey, ſmiling, as they paſſed through the beautiful grounds of the duc de T—, where the peaſants, collected under the trees, were capering to the indefatigable violin of an old man, who performed the double cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of fiddler and dancing-maſter, by inceſſantly bawling out every change in the cotillon, with an exertion of lungs that ſeemed to conſole him for the quieſcent ſtate of his heels, "Will nobody, I ſay, perſuade theſe people they are miſerable?"</p>
            <p>"It is more than probable," ſaid Arundel, "that they will ſoon need but little perſuaſion to think ſo. They want every thing towards happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but good-humour and good ſpirits."</p>
            <p>"And thoſe ſome generous miſanthrope or other—ſome ſpeculative reaſoner, who ſeeks in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037796_0020_100F52AA556B2780"/>
his head for what he ought to aſk of his heart, will one day deprive them of. Dear Arundel, I am inclined to think we are often ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as to modes of felicity, and, while calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating too nicely that we are to make for ourſelves, we often overlook that Heaven has made for us."</p>
            <p>"You would infer, then, that the enjoyment of an innocent pleaſure is more conducive to happineſs than the ſatisfying a want? In this, at leaſt, our lively neighbours excel us. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs with which an Engliſhman applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the latter idea, damps his animal ſpirits, and often brings on the ſtrange neceſſity of <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> himſelf into gaiety."</p>
            <p>"While the Frenchmen, <hi>an contraire,</hi> will be taught to reaſon himſelf out of it!"</p>
            <p>"But Liberty—"cried Arundel, with enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm—</p>
            <p>"Is a goddeſs, I grant. But pr'ythee, dear Henry, lift thine eyes to one of the prettieſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ruſtics that ever yet greeted them."</p>
            <p>A blooming girl of about ſixteen, who ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037796_0021_100F52CB5F351ED8"/>
appeared upon a winding path that croſſed the road, was indeed an intereſting object. Yet <hi>intereſting</hi> is not the word; for in truth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the modern acceptation of it, ſhe was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs. But if among my readers there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be a young man about the age of mr. Lindſey, let him find a better. The little <hi>payſanne</hi> was not tall; ſo much on the embonpoint, as to approach the clumſey; and tanned to a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right brunette: yet would a painter, perhaps, have choſen her for his ſubject. The roſes on her cheek, deepened to unuſual richneſs, gave to that very tan, which would have disfigured a colder complexion, the vivid glow poured over the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape of a Claude. Large curls of auburn hair broke upon a brow of exquiſite beauty, while the full-orbed eye beneath them ſparkled in a bright fluid that ſeemed created by youth, by hope, and health. A ſhort jacket in the faſhion of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a ſtraw hat, and a baſket over-weighted with cluſters of grapes, finiſhed the picture. To thoſe who recollect that a figure like this ſtood the earneſt gaze of two young men, it may not be amiſs to add, that an honeſt Lubin attended her, who though tired from the vintage, and laden with ſpoil, ſtill went the longeſt way about, to follow the footſteps of pretty Annette.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:037796_0022_100F52ACA057EC28"/>
"Monſieur peut bien paſſer," ſaid our damſel, retreating, with a ruſtic courtſey, from the grand chemin, where Lindſey, perceiving her about to croſs it, had checked his horſe.</p>
            <p>"Will money, or charity," ſaid he, aloud, in French, "obtain us ſome of thoſe beautiful grapes?"</p>
            <p>The ears of the prety ruſtic were as quick as her eyes—honeſt Lubin, too, had the uſe of his: both were ſolicitous to do the honours of their country; and our travellers, after the prodigious fatigue of riding three leagues, found it neceſſary to reſt under the ſhade, while the ſervants walked their horſes to the neighbouring poſt. But this was a <hi>manoeuvre,</hi> which, though apparently ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to three of the company, was but little agreeable to the fourth: and the eyes of the young peaſant inceſſantly reproached his miſtreſs for thoſe glances which the perſon, the manners—and, above all, the flattery of Lindſey, united to draw from her.</p>
            <p>They ſoon diſcovered that Annettte could ſing. The vanity of her lover, even in deſpite of his jealouſy, betrayed, her. She had juſt led the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037796_0023_100F52CFECA32790"/>
ruſtic chorus; nor was it difficult to prevail on her to repeat the air with which ſhe had charmed the vintagers. Our travellers thought themſelves in Arcadia.</p>
            <p>"Ecoutez, Meſſieurs," ſaid Annette, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting their praiſes with a careleſs gaiety, "je m'en vais vous chanter un autre." And with a naïveté that thought not of entreaty, ſhe ſung a wild and ſimple air, where, as uſual, <hi>l' amour</hi> was the chief ſubject, and of which ſome tender looks ſhe involuntarily beſtowed on Lubin, proved <hi>him</hi> to be the object.</p>
            <p>Lindſey's good humour underwent a ſudden change. "The girl is not ſo pretty as ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared:" ſaid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to Arundel, as they walked through the town—"whereabouts did ſhe ſay ſhe lived?"</p>
            <p>The contradiction of ideas, implied in theſe words, extorted from his friend an incredulous ſmile; in which, however, there was no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of pleaſure or approbation. To ſay truth, he felt neither. The behaviour of Lindſey within the laſt hour had been evidently marked with levity and ſelf-love; levity that reſpected not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and ſelf-love that knew not how to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037796_0024_100F52AE33B79BD8"/>
brook either indifference or repulſe. But, if he had already been ſurpriſed, he found himſelf much more ſo, when the ſame evening, in talking over their future <hi>route,</hi> mr. Lindſey, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the leaſt to conſider his companions, ſpoke of remaining ſome days where he was, and then purſuing a circuit that could not but detach him from theirs.</p>
            <p>The ſecret inſolence that unconſciouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed itſelf in thus ſuppoſing his pleaſure a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient argument for deranging the party, was felt equally by each, though differently received. Mr. Walbrook made a ſententious ſpeech; by which, it was plain, he meant nothing but to ſhew his rhetoric and his complaiſance. Mr. Mortimer uttered a cold compliment; and Arundel replied but by a bow. They ſoon after retired.</p>
            <p>"Henry," ſaid Mortimer to his young friend, as ſoon as they found themſelves alone, "what makes you ſo <hi>triſte?</hi>"</p>
            <p>"Only thoughtful, ſir."</p>
            <p>"Come, come, be ſincere! You are not pleaſed with Lindſey."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:037796_0025_100F52D2498754C0"/>
"I have at leaſt no right to be otherwiſe."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, my dear boy—the man who has a reaſon, has always a right. Shall I tell you frankly <hi>my</hi> opinion of him?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly, ſir," ſaid Arundel. "Yet his tongue and his countenance were a little at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To ſay truth, though himſelf offended with Lindſey, he ſhrunk from a judgment which he felt would be ſevere."</p>
            <p>"Of all the young men I have ever ſeen," continued Mortimer, with more aſperity than the occaſion ſeemed to juſtify, "Mr. Lindſey is leaſt calculated to create eſteem. His heart is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and his mind enervated by indulgence. From his cradle he has heard nothing but adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeen nothing but ſervility. He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed affable, becauſe he is always obeyed; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, becauſe he is rich; ſprightly, becauſe he i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> young and flattered. Take away his youth his affluence, or his dependents, and you ſhall find him ſplenetic, marrow-minded, and arrogant."</p>
            <p>"Heaven and earth!" cried Arundel, "what
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037796_0026_100F52B1F06FAC68"/>
a picture! From whence do you draw your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, ſir, and whither do they tend?"</p>
            <p>The heart of Mortimer was full. The original of the portrait ſtood before his mental eye; and Lindſey was, in truth, but the mirror in which he ſaw his father.</p>
            <p>"Be ſatisfied," ſaid he, after a pauſe, "that my pencil is dipped in the colours of life: and ſhould there even be deformity in the likeneſs, let it at leaſt teach you, before you ſanctify either your own caprices, or thoſe of others, with the name of friendſhip, to calculate how far the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities on which that ſhould be built are incidental, or natural."</p>
            <p>Arundel ſighed; and willing, perhaps, to give a new turn to the converſation, unconſciouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "If ſuch is indeed the character of Lindſey, how much is that father to be pitied, whoſe blind fondneſs thus nouriſhes all that is corrupt in his offspring, and blights all that is worthy! while mine," continued he, ſtruck with the emotion of mr. Mortimer, which he attributed to a ſudden impulſe of paternal regard, "mine—"though poſſibly bluſhing for his ſon—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:037796_0027_100F52D3D2C6B788"/>
"Dear child of my affections!" cried Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, embracing him, "ſpare me this tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic! Oh, Arundel, if I dared tell thee—If it was permitted me to reveal—But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is my witneſs!" added he, with energy, "that there ſhall come an hour in which I will do thee juſtice!—When the grave ſhall have cancelled—I mean when death—Let us wave further converſation!"</p>
            <p>Arundel, confounded with all that had paſſed, obeyed in ſilence. Yet, as far as reſpected the character of Lindſey, his heart was ſtill rebellious. Though not of an age, however, to abide by the ſuggeſtions of experience, he was perfectly alive to thoſe of pride: nor was it till he came to ſhake hands with his young friend the next day, that he repented the engagement he had made with Mortimer to continue their journey <hi>tête-à-tête.</hi> Lindſey was once more himſelf; wild, animated, enchanting.</p>
            <p>"I have picked up a curioſity this morning," ſaid he: "an old German philoſopher, who has been explaining to me a new ſyſtem of the earth. He was on the wing for Paris, with a portmanteau of recommendatory letters, and a waggon load of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037796_0028_100F531B0E783170"/>
muſty manuſcripts, beſides minerals and foſſils innumerable, with which he expects to get a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I have perſuaded him to make one of my <hi>ſuite.</hi> I ſhall pick ſomething out of him—and can indemnify myſelf at laſt," continued he, laughing, "for any extraordinary expence, by ſhewing him in London as a ſpecimen of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tediluvian race of mortals; for a more groteſque animal on two legs I never ſaw."</p>
            <p>The <hi>chaiſe de poſte,</hi> which made its appearance at the door, put a ſudden ſtop to this rattle.</p>
            <p>"Whom have we here?" ſaid Lindſey.</p>
            <p>"Thoſe whom you will not have long," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Arundel, forcing a ſmile.</p>
            <p>"Why, what carries you off?"</p>
            <p>"What keeps you here?"</p>
            <p>The ſame anſwer, I preſume, will do for both," returned Lindſey, with apparent diſſatisfaction, however: "our own inclination."—They ſhook hands, and ſeparated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:037796_0029_100F52D75BED0858"/>
"Mr. Mortimer was in the right," thought Arundel, as he threw himſelf into the chaiſe. "This young man has no idea of an independent being. He is offended becauſe, like the German philoſopher, we are not contented to become a part of his <hi>ſuite.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The days that intervened between this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their arrival at Lyons, were to mr. Mortimer more pleaſant than any that had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves for ſome weeks. The character of his pupil, as it opened before him, became more and more intereſting. It had a ſweetneſs, a ſimplicity, an affecting candour, particularly calculated to win the regard of one, whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the world had produced him ſo few inſtances of it. The tender deference with which the young man looked up to him, by flattering his ſelf-love contributed to ſtrenghten his attachment. Arundel's affections were warmly alive; and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances allowed them ſo few objects, that their energy, when indulged, was unuſually pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful. Duty, as well as ſenſibility, directed them to mr. Mortimer; for he had never been able to perſuade himſelf, that the only being who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to take an intereſt in his fate, could be other than his father. To acknowledge his foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037796_0030_100F531D4BCDE578"/>
as well as his virtues, it ſhould be added, that he ſometimes indulged romantic ideas of viſionary grandeur; flattering himſelf that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical concerns might have involved his family in caſual obſcurity, from whence they were again to riſe to hereditary affluence and rank. To him, therefore, day after day paſſed ſmoothly on; while every ſetting ſun left the mental, as well as natural horizon, embelliſhed with a thouſand brilliant vapours, the riſing one renewed.</p>
            <p>After voluntarily prolonging the journey ſome weeks, mr. Mortimer ſaw himſelf eſtabliſhed in a hotel at Lyons; and taking from his <hi>valiſe</hi> a ſmall packet of letters, informed his companion, that he intended to reſide in the neighbourhood ſome time.</p>
            <p>"The beautiful banks of the Rhone," ſaid he, "preſent an endleſs ſcope for admiration and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. Your education is hardly finiſhed enough to make you view the charms of Italy with a ſcientific eye; and though I do not intend," added he, laughing, "to let you pick up an itinerant philoſopher who may inſtruct you in a new theory of the earth, it may not be amiſs to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of its productions, both natural and moral,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037796_0031_100F52DAA5AC3210"/>
We will, therefore, ramble between this country and Swiſſerland, till our judgments are ſufficiently enlightened, and our imaginations elevated enough, to enjoy the ſtupendous beauties that await us on the other ſide of the Alps. Theſe letters it will be neceſſary to deliver; and of one packet I ſhall make you ſole bearer. It is addreſſed to a lady who reſides in a convent hard by, where ſhe will ſoon, I believe, take the veil. Her family are extremely unfortunate, and have requeſted me to offer her advice and aſſiſtance. I am, however, ill qualified for the office, which yet ſhe may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me to undertake. I would wiſh her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſuppoſe I have choſen a different <hi>route,</hi> that I may avoid bringing on myſelf claims which I cannot fulfil.</p>
            <p>Arundel, for whom the ſound of a convent and a lady had already ſome charms, moſt readily undertook the commiſſion; though, having been but little in the habit of acting for himſelf, he felt ſome doubts as to the grace with which he ſhould execute it. In this, however, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to nature, who had hardly been more liberal to him internally, than externally. His counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance had not, indeed, that beautiful glow of youth and gaiety ſo ſtriking in his brother's. His
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037796_0032_100F531F8BB596D0"/>
perſon, though conſiderably taller, was leſs formed, his manners generally reſerved, and often even a little embarraſſed: but theſe were the blemiſhes of habit and ſituation. Arundel's countenance, to much regular beauty, united an intelligence that ſpoke to the heart, and, where he was fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, a vivacity that captivated the eye. The graces his form had not attained, it eminently promiſed; and in his voice and manner there was a ſhade, a colouring of mind, that was almoſt peculiar to him. He had, beſides, an air of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to the merit of others, and a forgetfulneſs of himſelf, that was ſingularly charming to thoſe who had either undiſcovered talents, or lively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. But, alas! the greater part of the world poſſeſs not theſe, or bury them in ſociety; and, therefore, by the world at large he was little underſtood.</p>
            <p>The lady he demanded at the convent he was readily admitted to; and he found her young, beautiful, and intereſting: for how <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

fancied, a pair of very fine eyes: and to diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a pair of fine eyes was hardly within the ſtretch of Arundel's philoſophy.—In ſhort, why ſhould we make a man a hero, where nature generally makes him a fool? In ten minutes he was as much in love as a young man can be who has never converſed before with a truly beautiful woman; and in ten minutes more as much in deſpair as a lover generally is who finds himſelf on the point of loſing his miſtreſs: for, lo! on breaking the ſeal of the envelope, our fair incognita diſcovered that the letters were not intended for her, but for a ſiſter novice, whoſe ſanctified ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation ſomewhat reſembling her own, had given riſe to the miſtake. Both parties now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a degree of confuſion, which was increaſed by conſcious regret, on perceiving that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſo ſuddenly made, muſt almoſt as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ceaſe. The fair Louiſa at length broke ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence by an aſſurance, "that ſiſter Thereſa was too good-natured to ſee any thing in this error but a little heedleſſneſs on the part of both, from which no harm could poſſibly ariſe. I will have the honour," ſaid ſhe, gracefully courtfying, "to let her know that Monſieur attends at the grate to make his apologies."</p>

            <p>"Mon Dieu!" ſaid Louiſa, ſmiling, "what need of invention? We have only to tell the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple truth."</p>
            <p>"But the words—the manner—" again interrupted Arundel, eager to detain her.</p>
            <p>"Will occur of themſelves. Or, if they ſhould not," added ſhe, caſting down her eyes, and bluſhing, yet with a ſmile of pretty conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. "Thereſa will inſpire you—Thereſa is <hi>ſo</hi> beautiful!"</p>
            <p>With what deſign this was ſaid, or whether with any deſign at all, cannot eaſily be decided; but whatever was the motive, the effect of the ſpeech was a look from Arundel that made the eyes of Louiſa again ſeek the ground, and reſtored that embarraſſing ſilence from which they had been ſo lately relieved,</p>
            <p>"If," ſaid our young Engliſhman, heſitating, and at length forcing himſelf to ſpeak, "if made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle would do me the honour of, <hi>in perſon,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:037796_0035_100F52DE6B95AB48"/>
preſenting me to la Soeur Thereſa, I ſhould then, perhaps, be better able—I mean only that I ſhould know better—"</p>
            <p>"Ah, par exemple," cried Louiſa, recovering her vivacity, "la choſe du monde la plus facile! Elle eſt de mes bonnes amies la petite Théreſe! Attendez, Monſieur! Je vais vous l'amener." And, ſo ſaying, with a girliſh gaiety that brought a brighter roſe into her cheek, ſhe tripped away; and with her went the ſenſes, the heart of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. Her ſparkling eyes, her long fine hair which hung negligently down her back, the playful graces of her figure, and a certain character of countenance that blended the bewitching modeſty of her own country, with the ſprightlineſs of that in which ſhe was educated, might, indeed, have touched a heart much leſs new to beauty than that of our young traveller.</p>
            <p>The boaſted charms of Thereſa he was not permitted to judge of, as ſhe wore the white veil of the novice, which fell over a complexion too pale to appear to advantage under it.

to Louiſa; and when on having finiſhed the peruſal, Thereſa threw up the veil to thank him, his eyes wandered over her features with ſo apparent an abſence of mind, that the ſhade, through negligence or pique, was again permitted to fall, and ſhe was contented no further to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude herſelf on his attention, than by thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments politeneſs would not allow her to diſpenſe with.</p>
            <p>"A-propos!" ſaid Mortimer, after ſupper, as they talked over the occurrences of the day; "you ſaw the girl at the convent!—Is ſhe pretty?"</p>
            <p>"Yes—very—"returned his young friend, with embarraſſment.</p>
            <p>"What did you talk of?"</p>
            <p>"Oh—a great many—a thouſand things!"</p>
            <p>"Indeed?" returned Mortimer, laughing. "Methinks your acquaintance came on very faſt then! Pray indulge my curioſity with one of your thouſand."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:037796_0037_100F52E0F6DBA3E0"/>
"I—I have really forgotten them," again ſtammered Arundel.</p>
            <p>"Since they were ſo very unintereſting," ſaid Mortimer drily, "I hope, at leaſt, your method of treating them did more honour to your elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qence than the ſpecimen you <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

However, if your memory does not continue thus treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, have the goodneſs to go again to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, within four days at furtheſt; and, among your thouſand topics, pray enquire if Thereſa has any letters for England. I ſhall have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſending them, which ſhe may wiſh for in vain."</p>
            <p>Arundel bluſhed, and bowed aſſent. For the firſt time in his life he had been but half ſincere; yet why, he hardly knew. A troubleſome glow that ruſhed from his heart to his cheek, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly heſitation that ſeized upon his tongue, and a confuſed apprehenſion of the interference of mr. Mortimer, firſt involuntarily led him to conceal, what he afterwards knew not how to avow.</p>
            <p>Time now paſſed not with Arundel as it had done. He loved with the ardour of a man who had never loved till then, and who ſuppoſed the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037796_0038_100F532813CF6558"/>
ſentiment to be as much above that entertained by others, as he felt it to be to any he had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before experienced.</p>
            <p>Was Louiſa ſuſceptible? Why, time muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. She had, at leaſt, eyes for beauty, ears for admiration, and a happineſs of invention that furniſhed her perpetual excuſes for being in the way of both. Thereſa, undeſired by either party, yet often the oftenſible object of the viſit, formed, generally, the third at the grate. To Thereſa, therefore, the hopes, the fears, and all the energy of Arundel's character, became intimately known. Of hers, he knew little. Ill health and ill fortune depreſſed, timidity concealed it. Humility, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, and ſadneſs were all the <hi>traits</hi> by which he ever recognized her.</p>
            <p>It was now, however, that our young traveller began to ſpeculate ſeriouſly upon life; and the firſt ideas that occurred were relative to his own ſituation there. Had he any claims in ſociety? Was he the object of beneficence to mr. Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or that of natural tenderneſs? What were his proſpects, and where was to be his future eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment? Painful queſtions, which the youthful heart never aſks itſelf, till it has breathed that
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037796_0039_100F52E3EB68ABC0"/>
ſickening ſigh which is drawn from it by the heavy atmoſphere of the world!</p>
            <p>Shrinking from an enquiry, of which he now, for the firſt time, dreaded the conſequences, Arundel paſſed whole days, whenever he could do it without obſervation, in ſolitary rambles. He drew exquiſitely; and as his liberality and ſweetneſs of character ſoon made him known to every cottage in the neighbourhood, he took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in introducing, amid his ſketches, the little cherub faces that curioſity or playfulneſs attracted round him.</p>
            <p>It was on a lovely ſummer evening, when the rays of the retiring ſun ſtill glowed on the river, and threw it forward, a bright mirror amid the landſcape,
<q>
                  <l>While woods, and winds, and waves diſpos'd</l>
                  <l>A lover to complain,</l>
               </q>
that he was ſlowly returning to the city, when his attention was engaged for a moment by a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. It was only a moment; for hardly was that paſſed, ere one of the two travellers it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained was in his arms.</p>
            <p>"Dear Arundel!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:037796_0040_100F532B3447AEA8"/>
"Dear Lindſey!" exclaimed they at once inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently; "are we ſo lucky as once more to meet!"</p>
            <p>"Aye; and we will be ſo wiſe as not eaſily to part again," cried the ever impetuous Lindſey. "In the interim, dear friend, pr'ythee make a ſpeech to my old Mentor, who ſits there," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, pointing to the vehicle, "as ſullen as Bajazet in his cage. In truth, we have quarrelled worſe than Turks ſince I ſaw you. However, having once carried my point of dragging him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, I leave all the ſubordinate articles of our amneſty to be regulated as he pleaſes."</p>
            <p>Arundel who conceived no motive for diſguſt or ill-humour in mr. Walbrook towards himſelf, immediately complied with the requeſt of his friend; but met with ſo ungracious a reception, as little diſpoſed him to any further exertions of complaiſance.</p>
            <p>"And now that we are once more met," ſaid he to his friend, as they followed the carriage on foot into the city, pray tell me why we parted?"</p>
            <p>"Why, thou traitor to thy country," ſaid
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037796_0041_100F52E5721B0AA8"/>
Lindſey, laughing, "canſt thou find an Engliſh law that obliges a man to impeach himſelf? However, if it muſt be ſo, in two words, we parted becauſe I was capricious and arrogant."</p>
            <p>"And we meet again—"</p>
            <p>"Nay, <hi>there,</hi> dear Arundel, I can give a better account of myſelf: becauſe I have met none like you <hi>ſince</hi> we parted:—becauſe, though my head was wrong, my heart was right:—in ſhort, for fifty other reaſons unneceſſary to detail."</p>
            <p>"And how long is it ſince you left B—?"</p>
            <p>"Three days."</p>
            <p>"Three days!—Impoſſible. Why, it is a week's journey."</p>
            <p>"For a philoſopher, I grant you. But I was in purſuit of a friend; which all your philoſophers agree they have had nothing to do with. So, as the day was not long enough, I took the liberty of borrowing the night."</p>
            <p>"And of obliging mr. Walbrook to borrow
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037796_0042_100F532CC207D620"/>
it too! Upon my word, I cannot wonder that he had no ſuperfluous complaiſance to beſtow, after you had taxed it ſo highly."</p>
            <p>The converſation now grew more intereſting; and in the courſe of twenty minutes the two young men had diſcuſſed almoſt every topic that could touch the heart of either. Their ſhort ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration had made them mutually feel the want of a companion and an intimate. They met, therefore, with that impaſſioned intereſt ſuch a conviction inſpires, and with the lively ſlow of animal ſpirits every ſentiment of pleaſure creates in a youthful mind.</p>
            <p>"You muſt ſhew me this Louiſa to-morrow," ſaid Lindſey, in a low voice, as they parted; "I would ſain ſee the woman who can turn <hi>your</hi> head." There was an emphaſis in the ſpeech that Arundel might have obſerved; but obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except on the eyes of his miſtreſs, had not of late been his <hi>forte,</hi> and the inference paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed.</p>
            <p>"Louiſa tells me,"—ſaid he, ſtarting one evening from a long <hi>reverie</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:037796_0043_100F52E7B555AFC0"/>
"And who, pray, is Louiſa?" ſaid Mortimer, ſtarting in turn.</p>
            <p>The queſtion was ſudden, was mal-a-propos; and neither willing, or, to ſay truth, quite able to anſwer it, he ſtammered out with much perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, that ſhe was "the friend of Thereſa."</p>
            <p>"The friend of Thereſa!" again re-echoed Mortimer with a tone of ſurpriſe and incredulity, "and pray what friend has ſhe?—that is, where did ſhe find—I mean, in ſhort, how came you acquainted with any friend of Thereſa's?"</p>
            <p>The manners of Arundel, we have before ſaid, were reſerved, but his character was impaſſioned to a fault; and to dive beyond the ſurface was to call forth all its vigour. With the ſpirit of a man, therefore, and the eloquence of a lover, he now at full length recited the ſtory of his heart. That of his auditor was viſibly moved with the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. "Imprudent boy," ſaid he, ſighing when it was concluded, "I have then vainly ſtrove to ſave you from the contagion of vice!—You are, doubtleſs, ignorant," he added, with a tone of unuſual aſperity, "that the father of this girl,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037796_0044_100F53336485BB40"/>
whoſe name I now well recollect, is a needy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer—a profligate, diſgraced in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and diſgracing it in others—a being ſo low—"</p>
            <p>"No, ſir," interrupted Arundel, in a ſtifled tone of ſenſibility and pride, "I am <hi>not</hi> ignorant of the diſgraceful connection—I have even thought of it with grief; and, when I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf that virtue and vice are hereditary, I ſhall doubtleſs think of it with ſhame. Till then, allow me to ſay, that, however an early and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded attachment may impeach the <hi>head,</hi> thoſe who check it are not always aware of the dangers to which they expoſe the heart; nor do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that by teaching us thus early to weigh pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt nature, they poſſibly ſubſtitute the cold and frivolous errors of ſelf-love, for the more generous ones of paſſion." Bluſhing, as he ſpoke, with the conſciouſneſs of offended, and offending feeling, he haſtily withdrew. Yet the temperate ſilence of Mortimer was not loſt upon him. "What am I to think of it?" ſaid he, as he attempted to reſt. "He is indignant at my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulance, or he relies upon my prudence: either way there is but one reſolution to take, and, painful as that may prove, it ſhall be adopted."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:037796_0045_100F52EA07EB7F10"/>
Youth always ſleeps well upon a reſolution. The reſolution, it is true, often evaporates with the ſlumber, and leaves nothing for the morning but the ſelf applauſe of having formed it. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Arundel's outlived the night; and it was at breakfaſt the next day that he communicated to mr. Mortimer his intention of purſuing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed tour into Switzerland, and of conquering, if poſſible, by temporary abſence, a paſſion he ought not to gratify.</p>
            <p>Was Arundel ſincere?—No matter: at leaſt he thought he was. But the heart of a lover has ſometimes a <hi>fineſſe</hi> that deceives even himſelf; nor is it impoſſible that a rigid examination of his own would have convinced our young philoſopher, that he had more lurking gratification in the idea of proving his paſſion unconquerable, than any real intention of conquering it. To Switzerland they went. But were the bold, the romantic, the intereſting ſcenes that country afforded, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to chill a ſenſibility to which every object was congenial? In vain did Mortimer read lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon botany: the letters of Louiſa were to his pupil a more intereſting ſtudy than all the Alpine curioſities which a young and ingenious Italian had ſpent years in collecting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:037796_0046_100F533125345678"/>
"Theſe inſenſibles," cried he, as he rambled from them amidſt immenſe mountains, whoſe white boſoms were tinged with the beams of the ſetting ſun, and diverſified with hanging cottages "theſe inſenſibles pretend to admire the fibres of a leaf, yet to thoſe more tender and living ones within our breaſts are they ſtoics. Great and ſupreme Creator!" would he add, lifting his eyes towards heaven, haſt thou drawn this bright ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy over our heads? Haſt thou enriched the earth on which we tread with numberleſs and ever-varying beauties? Haſt thou ordained them through the medium of the ſenſes to ſteal upon the heart, and waken there a tremulous ſenſibility that reaſon is to cruſh?—Ah, no!—Choice, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, character, are thy gifts?—While Nature and her God are before him, man feels the influence of both: plunged in the vortex of cities, he becomes an artificial being, vulnerable no longer through any ſenſe but intereſt or vanity?"</p>
            <p>Whilſt his heart glowed with ſimilar ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did he often return to Mortimer: but alas! the glow was only in his heart; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion had loſt it. Marlini, the young Italian, noticed the change; and, as he valued himſelf upon ſome knowledge of medicine (which was
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037796_0047_100F52ED0213AD60"/>
the more generous of him, as he was never valued for it by any body beſides), he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: but the complaiſance of Arundel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to liſtening; and as Mortimer well knew that the complaint might defy a college of phyſicians, he was not very earneſt in enforcing their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The heart of the young man, however, was yet to ſtruggle with a grief more oppreſſive than that of love. Louiſa, who during the firſt month of his abſence, had punctually attended to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of writing now ſometimes neglected, and at others coldly fulfilled it: and Mortimer, who cloſely watched the effect of his pupil's feelings, at length thought he ſaw the luckleſs moment ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, when it was neceſſary to yield to a paſſion, that could no longer, without danger be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled.</p>
            <p>"Henry," ſaid he, you have blaſted <hi>my</hi> hopes; but I will not deſtroy yours; the power I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs of regulating your fate, I now confide to yourſelf. Return to Lyons, offer to Louiſa a moderate fortune, and a heart dear to me as that within my own boſom: let her eſtimate the gift as it deſerves, and both may yet be happy."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:037796_0048_100F5334EB005CA0"/>
Arundel, ſcarcely able to believe his ſenſes while they conveyed to him a language ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, falls, as it ſhould ſeem, motionleſs at the feet of his benefactor:—Not at all, however: he riſes in a moment—he flies to the poſt-houſe—he is no longer a conſumptive and enfeebled young man, who has neither eyes nor ears for any thing that paſſes: on the contrary, he appears to think that he has borrowed the ſenſes of all around him, by the ardour and frequency with which he reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates his orders. In fine, they are once more at Lyons, and forgetful of Lindſey, or his <hi>ſuite,</hi> whom they had left there—forgetful of Mortimer, who was ſatigued—or of Marlini, who was a ſtranger—he flies to the grate where he had ſo often beheld Louiſa, and, with all the eagerneſs of paſſion, acquaints her that propoſals were on the point of being made to her father. What was the exceſs of his diſappointment, when, after liſtening to him in ſilence, Louiſa threw herſelf back in her chair and burſt into a flood of tears! The countenance of Arundel, vivid but a moment before with hope and pleaſure, changed inſtantly to deadly paleneſs.</p>
            <p>"Louiſa! deareſt Louiſa!" cried he, throwing himſelf on his knees before her, "To what am I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037796_0049_100F52EE89C18F00"/>
to impute this emotion? You alarm, you ſhock me! Can it be poſſible that I am unfortunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have loſt my intereſt in your heart?"</p>
            <p>"I will not deceive you, mr. Arundel," ſaid Louiſa, ſobbing, and covered with bluſhes; "you deſerve my candour—and—I will frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge—" She heſitated; but the imperfect ſentence was conviction—Arundel ſtarted from his knees, ſhocked at the abruptneſs, and overwhelmed with the diſappointment, of ſuch an event.</p>
            <p>"I thank you, madam," ſaid he, after a pauſe, and in a voice hardly articulate; "I think I <hi>have</hi> deſerved your candour; though to bear it—" Again he ſtopped—turned from her, to her; and gazing for a moment on the lovelineſs of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance even tears did not disfigure, reproachfully added, "Oh Louiſa!"</p>
            <p>"Do not believe," ſaid ſhe, ſtretching out her hand to meet his, as it graſped the grate, againſt which he leant—"do not believe that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy object has ſupplanted you in my regard—I am ſure, when I have explained all, you will excuſe, will pity me!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:037796_0050_100F53372C715D78"/>
Arundel looked earneſtly at her—She had not then loſt the paſſion, but changed the object—a new ſentiment glanced faintly acroſs his mind—it felt, for a moment, like contempt; but love ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted the intruder, and changed its nature into jealouſy. "If to have adored you with a paſſion too powerful both for my happineſs and health," replied he, with a heavy ſigh, "could have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me your regard, I ſhould not now have the grief to know I have loſt it. May he on whom it is beſtowed have more ſucceſsful claims!—But you are pale!—This happy, this envied being poſſeſſes not the power of making happy! Or is the felicity you would have enjoyed embittered by regreat for that you were about to deprive me of?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, doubtleſs," ſaid Louiſa, with an air of melancholy and confuſion, "we have both felt for you."</p>
            <p>"<hi>Both!</hi> repeated Arundel, trembling with a new and vague apprehenſion, "How—how am to underſtand you?"</p>

"Louiſa, I adjure you by every thing ſacred, to tell me the name of him for whom I am thus cruelly renounced."</p>
            <p>Louiſa bluſhed, wept, and was ſilent.</p>
            <p>"Is it," continued he, heſitating, and ſhaking with uncontrollable emotion—" Is it not—<hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey?"</hi> The countenance of Louiſa made reply unneceſſary, while that of Arundel, true to his heart, ſparkled with indignation. The generous diffidence of his nature, however, preſently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. She avowedly loved another:—tenderly—fondly loved him; and that other was, in the eyes even of his rival, the moſt winning of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings—endued with beauty, youth, wit, and accompliſhments enough, unintentionally to win the coldeſt heart; and Louiſa!—ah! could he wonder that ſhe was irreſiſtible?</p>
            <p>By ſhort and imperfect explanations, he learnt that mr. Lindſey had, from the moment he was ſeen by her, left an impreſſion on her memory, abſence did not efface: during that of Arundel, he had viſited her once or twice through mere complaiſance: that an intereſt inſenſibly ſprung up between them: that his attendance became
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:037796_0052_100F5338BB791900"/>
more frequent: that love in fine lent his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to their eyes, and placed his interpreter in their hearts.</p>
            <p>"It is enough!" ſaid Arundel, ſtarting from a train of thought this avowal occaſioned. "I cannot <hi>be</hi> your happineſs, deareſt Louiſa—but I will at leaſt endeavour to eſtabliſh it." With theſe words he flew to her father, who had juſt received a letter from Mortimer, explained to him his ſituation, and as haſtily went in ſearch of Lindſey. A generous and delicate miſtruſt of himſelf, made him precipitate meaſures from which he feared he might recede: for Arundel was yet to learn all the value and nobleneſs of his own heart.</p>
            <p>Lindſey received him with open arms; and his friend even thought he perceived the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of ſucceſsful paſſion embelliſh his complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and lend animation to his eyes. What then was his aſtoniſhment to ſee this envied lover plunged by his narration into a deep and cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie!</p>
            <p>"It is certain," ſaid he, at length breaking ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, "that I love Louiſa; ſhe has there ſimply
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037796_0053_100F52F34B02C190"/>
ſtated a truth, which for your ſake I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have ſuppreſſed: but as to marrying her, <hi>that</hi> is wholly out of the queſtion at preſent; nor am I indeed ſure I ſhall ever find it one at all." A tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of new and indignant emotions again ſwelled the heart of Arundel; nor was it till his friend had given him the moſt unequivocal proofs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand that Louiſa's paſſion had kept pace with, if not preceded the acknowledgment of his own, that harmony was reſtored between them.</p>
            <p>Obliged ſlowly to reſign the illuſive image of perfection he ſo long had cheriſhed, Arundel ſtill thought ſomewhat due both to that and himſelf. By arguments, therefore, and remonſtrances, he wrung from his frieud a ſolemn promiſe to ſee Louiſa no more, till abſence, by trying the cauſe between his tenderneſs and his pride, might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his intentions leſs dubious.</p>
            <p>"Louiſa," ſaid Arundel, "is indiſcreet; but you aſſure me ſhe is virtuous: the pain of ſeeing her otherwiſe would be more than I could pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endure. Self-intereſt, therefore, bids me ſtep forth the guardian of her innocence. If <hi>you</hi> love her enough to make a ſacrifice, I will prove to you that I love her enough to rejoice in it.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037796_0054_100F533BB1822220"/>
But beware that you do not demand any from her."</p>
            <p>Lindſey laughed at his refinements, and, after much expoſtulation, agreed to prove his ſincerity by taking a temporary leave of Lyons on the ſame day; a compliance in which he had, indeed, no great merit; as he had already more than half promiſed a party of his countrymen to join them in a rambling excurſion to Niſmes.</p>
            <p>Sad, ſolitary, hopeleſs, Arundel now bent his ſteps towards home. The buſineſs of the day was accompliſhed. Of the day!—Ah! rather that of his life; for what remained of it ſeemed nothing but vacuity and gloom: and he looked round in vain for ſome farther ſacrifice on which to ſpend the feveriſh enthuſiaſm of an overheated mind. Mortimer with concern perceived it glow on his cheek, and give an alarming expreſſion to his eyes. Lindſey, gay, inſolent, and happy—Lindſey tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant alike in fortune and in love over his more deſerving brother, became an object of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deteſtation to the guardian of Arundel. The ſecret ſo long concealed now trembled on his lips: his young friend even perceived that it did, and urged, with tender vehemence, to know what
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037796_0055_100F52F4D37118B8"/>
further hope in life remained for him. The eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal argument, that he ſhould always find time enough to do the juſtice he deſired, again ſilenced Mortimer. That ſecret and inviſible Power, which ſo often hovers over mortality, and with his icy breath annihilates its projects, unfelt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, nevertheleſs, even then approached him! The important truth, the deliberating mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were yet within his reach; but the truth was once more ſuppreſſed, and the moment paſſed away no time was ever to reſtore!</p>
            <p>"I will conſider more of this, my dear boy," ſaid he, as he mounted his horſe to take an air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; "endeavour to compoſe yourſelf for an hour, during my abſence, and my return ſhall produce a ſuitable explanation."</p>
            <p>Mr. Mortimer was brought home three hours after, <hi>cold, ſtiff,</hi> and <hi>bloody.</hi> A piſtol bullet paſſing through his temple had perforated his brain; and in this condition he was ſound, by ſome peaſants, not a hundred yards from the high road. His horſe was grazing by his ſide. His purſe which contained only a trifling ſum, remained; but his pocket-book, where notes of value were probably encloſed, was not to be found.</p>

               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:037796_0056_100F279C41536E88"/>
The ſhock was too mighty, and Arundel's conſtitution, already attacked, for the time ſunk under it. Marlini, the young Italian, attended him with exemp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y kindneſs and humanity, through a burning fever; but ere he recovered to reaſon, the wiſhes, the intentions, and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Mortimer had long ſince been buried with him in the grave. Hardly eſcaped from thence himſelf, Arundel impatiently haſtened to weep over that of his benefactor, and if poſſible, to diſcover the perpetrators of his murder. Of them, however, no traces could be found. He was an eaſy mark for robbery, as it was his cuſtom to take gentle rides in the environs of the city at that hour when the retiring ſun made the exerciſe moſt pleaſant; and, when unaccompanied by Arundel, thoſe rides were well known to be ſolitary. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by vain and painful ſurmiſes on this cruel event, the latter at length began to examine the papers and property his protector had left behind him. But one inexplicable myſtery ſeemed now to overſhadow the fate of Arundel. A few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonals of value, ſome Engliſh bank-notes, and letters of credit upon a houſe at Genoa, were all that remained to trace his paſt life, or to guide his future. Perplexed, bewildered, he pauſed in ſilence over the gloomy proſpect, when ſome ſlips
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037796_0057_100F52F7C7D1A5E0"/>
of paper, that were wedged within the hinge of a caſket, from whence the reſt appeared to have been haſtily torn, attracted his attention. Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly diſengaging one of them he ſound three lines, which ran thus: "To acknowledge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, another ſon, nay even an heir, would be a ſtep too injurious to my intereſt and honour to be thought of: I am determined <hi>never</hi> to do it; and Arundel muſt be content—"</p>
            <p>"Oh heaven and earth!" exclaimed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured and unfortunate ſon of lord Lindſey, as he peruſed theſe cruel words, from a hand which he could not doubt to be his father's; "<hi>Muſt</hi> be content! Content without a tie! without a hope without one trace of thoſe to whom he owes his exiſtence, but in the unnatural ſentence which cuts him off from them for ever!"</p>
            <p>It was ſome moments before he could recover compoſure enough to examine the remaining pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Nay, he was almoſt tempted, by an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of indignant ſenſibility, to commit to the flames, unread, what, in the peruſal, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deſtined to inflict a ſecond and more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable pang. The hand was evidently a female one; and the purport of the writing awakened a
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037796_0058_100F53403053A888"/>
feeling more lively, if poſſible, than that excited before.</p>
            <p>"Yet why ſhould I bluſh to acknowledge what I do not bluſh to feel? In mr. Arundel are united every grace that wins affection, and every virtue that juſtifies it. Born, I ſincerely hope, for a more brilliant lot than that"—The tormenting paper here finiſhed: but ſo did not his peruſal of it. Three times was it read; minutely was it ſcrutinized. Even that by which he had been a few moments before ſo cruelly chagrined, ſeemed to vaniſh from his memory: while a ſoft conſcious ſluſh of vanity and gratitude ſtole imperceptibly over a cheek lately pallid with ſickneſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The world again reſumed its charms; it contained at leaſt <hi>one</hi> being intereſted in his fate; one who "did not bluſh to feel"—who would not bluſh "to acknowledge his virtues."</p>
            <p>Nor was it till memory had dwelt with delight on many individuals of a gay and beautiful circle, with which his reſidence at Lyons had accuſtomed him to mingle, that he recollected the myſtery in which that being would probably remain ever enveloped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:037796_0059_100F52FA0AD2B8B0"/>
To the tranſient gleam of pleaſure which for a moment had brightened his horizon, now ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded long and cheerleſs months. Fruitleſs journeys to every place where mr. Mortimer had ever appeared to cheriſh intimacy, or demand credit, though by variety of ſcenes, and ſucceſſion of hopes, they re-eſtabliſhed his health, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to diminiſh his little fortune, without fixing his views. Of Louiſa he had taken a tender farewel previous to his leaving Lyons; and to Lindſey he knew not how to addreſs himſelf, during an excurſion, the plan of which was not ſettled even by thoſe who undertook it.</p>
            <p>Buſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in tracing the channels through which mr. Mortimer had tranſacted his pecuniary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, he had juſt learnt, by a journey to Paris, the name of the Engliſh banker with whom his credit originated, when he was one day agreeably ſurpriſed by a letter from Marlini. It was dated only ten days from that on which he had himſelf left Lyons, had followed him in his wanderings, and reached him at laſt by mere accident. The good-natured Italian who took a ſincere intereſt in the happineſs of Arundel had engaged to write him any occurrence by which that might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. "I fulfil my promiſe," ſaid he, "by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037796_0060_100F534271FB74B8"/>
you that your friend Lindſey left Lyons laſt week. He was here only a few days, and was ſuddenly called to England, by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that his father would moſt probably be dead ere he could reach it—an event for which, by the bye, he ſomewhat reproaches his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance and inattention. Will it grieve you to learn, that the fair Louiſa is his companion, and that their union has at length completed a felicity which I am ſure you ſincerely wiſh them both?</p>
            <p>"The generous patronage he has ſo warmly aſſured me of in England, I am preparing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: therefore, when you hear of me again, it will probably be at the <hi>Hotel de Lindſey.</hi> Come, dear mr. Arundel, and ſhare in the pleaſures of this munificent and kind friend, who I am ſure, by his conduct to myſelf, deſires nothing ſo much as to ſerve you, and who particularly enjoined me to ſay, that he is only prevented addreſſing you by the haſte with which he is obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part."</p>
            <p>Arundel cloſed the letter with a ſigh. He had long ceaſed to eſteem Louiſa: even the impreſſion ſhe had made upon his ſenſes was conſiderably
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037796_0061_100F52FE15650D00"/>
diminiſhed by the efforts of reaſon and abſence; yet he heard not with indifference that ſhe was the wife of another; nor did the temptation of living in the <hi>Actel de Lindſey,</hi> and under 'the munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent patronage of its lord," accord quite ſo well with his feelings, as with thoſe of the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Italian. Yet, to England, circumſtances ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to go; and <hi>in</hi> England, though his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoil, he was a wanderer and an outcaſt. The character of Lindſey, "in that rare ſemblance that he loved it firſt;" their ſocial and congenial habits—their early and unſtudied confidence in a word, a thouſand tender recollections roſe to mind, and impelled a heart, naturally ſuſceptible, to cheriſh the only tie it ever yet had formed.</p>
            <p>"I will try him, at leaſt," ſaid Arundel, as he laid his hand upon the knocker of a magnificent houſe in St. James's. We underſtand each other, and a moment will decide for us both." A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did decide: he was welcomed by Lindſey, not indeed without embarraſſment; but it was the embarraſſment of a man who doubts his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, not that which he is to beſtow; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with laviſh kindneſs, with generous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diality, with every teſtimony of friendſhip that ſenſibility could offer, and graceful manners could
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037796_0062_100F53456BFBB078"/>
embelliſh. Arundel would have avoided ſeeing lady Lindſey, and for that reaſon excuſed himſelf from reſiding under the ſame roof with her. But this was not to be thought of. The young lord, too happy both in love and fortune not to be a little vain, ſaw, in the ſociety of Arundel, nothing but a new, and, as he deemed it, admiſſible grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to his ſelf-love; and reſolutely, therefore, inſiſted on not parting with him.</p>
            <p>"Women, my dear friend," ſaid he, "are among the baubles of life; we may each wiſh to appropriate, but we will never wrangle about them. Come, come you are a philoſopher, and Louiſa is at laſt only a beautiful coquette. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſo ſurely diſunite you as knowing more of each other." So ſaying, he dragged his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful rival to her dreſſing-room. From the toilette Arundel attended her to dinner, where he was led in triumph through a circle of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites and ſops.</p>
            <p>"You ſee that creature with his fine languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing black eyes!" ſaid Louiſa to a young nobleman who ſat on her right hand.</p>
            <p>"And his ruſty black coat! replied his
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037796_0063_100F530117D4C8C8"/>
lordſhip, caſting a glance of nonchalance upon Arundel.</p>
            <p>"Nay, that is downright ſlander," ſaid Louiſa laughing. "Not ruſty <hi>yet;</hi> though it may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſee veteran ſervice. He is an old adorer of mine—ſo pray be civil to him!"</p>
            <p>"With all my heart; provided <hi>you</hi> are not ſo: but you had better make ſure of my complaiſance—a <hi>fortunate</hi> lover is never quarrelſome, you know!" Louiſa laughed again. If my reader happens to have white teeth, and one of the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt mouths in the world, ſhe will find out the jeſt: if not, it will probably defy her penetration, and may as well remain unſought.</p>
            <p>Lindſey had judged truly: in leſs than a week, Arundel was completely cured of his partiality for Louiſa—a Louiſa far different from her he had firſt ſeen at the convent. When he beheld her, cold of heart, and light of conduct, living only to diſſipation and flattery; ſcarcely mingling with any of her own ſex, and admitting to her familiar ſociety the moſt diſſolute part of his, often did he call to mind the caution Mortimer had once given him, of weighing, before he formed his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037796_0064_100F530355E06B08"/>
whether the qualities by which they were excited, are incidental or natural. Nor, though more ſlowly developed, did the character of Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey riſe in his eſtimation. Warm in his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and elegant in his manners, he ſtill attracted affection; but it was not poſſible to overlook the profligacy of a life, every hour of which was marked by being abuſed; and his friend perceived, with a ſigh, how inſenſibly, when not effaced by principle, the faint outline of youthful indiſcretion becomes filled up in our progreſs through life with the bold colouring of vice.</p>
            <p>Amid the motley group who attended the levee of lord Lindſey, Arundel was particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by an officer, whoſe countenance, though ſtill in its bloom, bore the traces of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was lately returned from a long ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Weſt Indies; inclining to thin, but of a noble and graceful carriage; the climate had ſomewhat impaired his complexion, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret chagrin that ſeemed to rob his eyes of their ſire, lent them a ſeriouſneſs calculated to excite intereſt. Thoſe of Arundel had at firſt ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſought their acquaintance; yet, ſtrange to tell, had ſought it in vain. Like an apparition, captain Villiers hovered amid the brilliant circle,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037796_0065_100F53114A6CEA30"/>
attentive, calm, and impenetrably cold to all but lord Lindſey. As Arundel doubted not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that he courted promotion, and gueſſed by the crape round his arm that he had ſuſtained ſome family loſs, he adopted the cauſe, though not permitted judge of it, with an ardour that was natural to his character. But he was not long in diſcovering, that Lindſey's love of patronage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to promiſes; and that, far from ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing ſucceſsfully for others, he might perhaps do it vainly for himſelf. Yet, eager to emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate his ſituation from that dependance to which it was every day approaching, he made the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and was cruelly confirmed in his conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Still never did refuſal wear ſo fair a form: "My fortune and my houſe, dear Arundel, are yours," ſaid his friend; "when the one is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, or the other diſagreeable to you, we will think of new plans."</p>
            <p>Arundel was thus plunged again, deſpite of himſelf, into gay and diſſolute ſociety: he was young and charming; was it wonderful that he ſhould be charmed; Ah! is there any illuſion ſo complete as that our own talents and graces ſcatter around us? Every day more captivating in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, more poliſhed in manners, more enervated
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037796_0066_100F5346F392BE58"/>
in heart, he imperceptibly drew nearer that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice of error, from which, no kind hand, either of nature or friendſhip, was extended to ſave him.—Yet ſtill had he both ſenſibility and pride—ſtill did he ſpend many a ſolitary hour in forming plans, by which the next might be more active—in ſighing over the memory of Mortimer, and in fruitleſs peruſals of the cruel, the inexplicable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers he had left behind him. Loſt in <hi>reverie,</hi> often did his thoughtful eye pierce through crowds for that unnatural father, who had thus announced his intention of never acknowledging him; often did his beating heart diſpel the illuſion, which beauty diffuſed over his ſenſes, and anxiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, where—where was the gentle being to whom his graces and his virtues were ſo diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtedly dear. For the paper which contained this avowal, from the moment that Louiſa had loſt her place in his affections, he cheriſhed a roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nderneſs: the other, he had, on his arrival in England, communicated to Lindſey; who ſo far got the better of his uſual inattention and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, as to accompany him in perſon to the banker's, whence mr. Mortimer had obtained cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit at Paris. From him, however nothing could be learnt, but that five hundred pounds had been annually lodged there in that gentleman's name,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037796_0067_100F5304DC0F3A40"/>
the larger part of which had in the laſt year been drawn out, without ſince being replaced. Of this latter ſum, a very ſmall portion now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to Arundel; and his indignant heart, rouſed at the idea of pecuniary obligation, began to affect his temper: that moſt cruel of all mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſelf-reproach, ſeized upon it. To Lindſey he ſcorned any other obligation than that of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſtruggle for himſelf—an obligation which of all others Lindſey was leaſt likely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: nor exiſted there a being beſides, from whom he could hope it. With a grieved and rankling heart, that veiled itſelf in ſmiles, was he going to the apartment of the latter, when he met cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Villiers coming from it: both ſeemed to have departed from their natural character; for Arundel, whoſe thoughts were pre-occupied, and who was beſides ſomewhat diſguſted by the coldneſs with which his efforts at civility had been received, ſcarcely noticed Villiers, who, on his part, bruſhed by with a haughty rapidity that nearly amounted to rudeneſs.</p>
            <p>"Did you meet that ſcoundrel on the ſtairs?" ſaid Lindſey abruptly as he entered the room.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:037796_0068_100F534A84785D08"/>
"If you mean Villiers, he paſſed me this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
            <p>"'Twas well he did not affront you," ſaid Lindſey; "he was ſufficiently diſpoſed to have done it."</p>
            <p>Arundel pauſed for a moment, uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to think he had done ſo or no, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentfully added—"It <hi>was</hi> well, as you ſay, that he did not; for I was never leſs diſpoſed to bear it"</p>
            <p>"I would have you beware of him, however," ſaid Lindſey; "for as <hi>I</hi> cannot fight him," glancing fretfully at his arm, which a ſtrain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to wear in a ſling, "it is ten to one but he makes you do it."</p>
            <p>"<hi>Me!</hi>" repeated Arundel, with a tone of aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>"Yes, <hi>you:</hi> ſince, if I may judge by his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:037796_0069_100F530834C206F8"/>
"The <hi>preſent</hi> will do for me," ſaid Arundel warmly, and involuntarily advancing towards the door—"But what was the matter in diſpute?"</p>
            <p>"Faith I hardly know—Aſk <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"I am more than half tempted:—and if I do, I may probably convince him that I can take up the cauſe of a friend, without being either his dependant or paraſite."</p>
            <p>"Dear Arundel," ſaid Lindſey, warmly ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand, "how generous, how kind is this idea!—I cannot however admit it: it is true, we have both been inſulted; but the cauſe is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mine."</p>
            <p>"If <hi>both</hi> have been inſulted," ſaid Arundel, "<hi>either</hi> is entitled to demand an explanation."</p>
            <p>Lindſey pauſed on the idea; and his friend, who thought he perceived his aſſent to it in his ſilence, felt his ſpirit and his pride both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in not receding. The converſation that followed corroborating this opinion, he preſently diſpatched a note to captain Villiers, requeſting a few moments' converſation at any place he ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037796_0070_100F530A71C1F210"/>
name. This done, he left the apartment of lord Lindſey, flattered with his applauſe, and gratified by his kindneſs.</p>
            <p>But, though the temper of Arundel was thus inflamed, all felt not as it ſhould have done in his heart. Perſonal courage was in him a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional gift, and it was that perhaps which leſt him more at leiſure to aſk why he had thus drawn on himſelf the probability of a duel; but as on this head his own memory did not ſupply him with any very ſatisfactory anſwer, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to refer to that of captain Villiers.</p>
            <p>When two young men meet to know why they are to fight, it will be fortunate if ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation does not ariſe to render the enquiry needleſs: neither of thoſe in queſtien had any animoſity, though no longer any perſonal prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, to each other; but truth muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. The high-ſpirited Villiers did indeed look upon Arundel as one of the venal many whoſe word and ſword were equally at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of lord Lindſey. Plunged in family cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grins, and embittered by diſappointment, he had attended but little to nice diſcriminations of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and came prepared to conſider the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037796_0071_1012181ACA068B28"/>
only as a paltry pretence for appropriating the quarrel: it was conſequently ſhort. Arundel, proud, youthful, and brave, felt all his paſſions raiſed by the cold indignity with which he ſaw himſelf treated: the marked contempt with which Villiers mentioned the name of lord Lindſey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted his friendſhip: and when to that of Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, as it accidentally aroſe, he returned a look and expreſſion of moſt ineffable diſdain; Arundel, whoſe heart ſtill retained ſome embers of the ſire which once had made that name ſo ſacred, was no longer maſter of himſelf. It was the cauſe of gallantry, of honour, of friendſhip; and, fearful perhaps leſt reflection ſhould diſcover to him that it was <hi>not</hi> the cauſe of reaſon, he the more readily embraced mr. Villiers's propoſal of meeting him, behind Montague-Houſe, at five the next morning.</p>
            <p>The hours that intervened were ſpent in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſearch after lord Lindſey, who had early left the party with which he dined, and was not to be heard of. Diſappointed in the purſuit, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in a train of no very pleaſant reflections, Arundel ſtood ſurrounded by a gay and brilliant circle apparently liſtening to a concert, of which he heard nothing, when his eye caſually reſted upon one of the band, whoſe face inſtantly
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037796_0072_100F530CAFF1B268"/>
brought to mind the recollection of Marlini—but Marlini ſtill in England—Marlini the botaniſt turned fiddler, and that in an inferior rank—it was a thing impoſſible!—Advancing cloſer, and leaning againſt the wainſcot, he amuſed himſelf, till the concluſion of the ſonata, with examining the features of his friend, till ſatisfied of their identity, he approached the orcheſtra and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him by name.</p>
            <p>"Ah, mr. Arundel!" ſaid Marlini—"how glad am I to ſee you, and how glad to find that you have not forgotten me!" Arundel moſt cordially returned the ſalutation, and expreſſed his ſurpriſe both at the place and the employment in which he found his friend engaged. "I have frequently," ſaid he, "enquired of lord Lindſey where I might find you: he aſſured me that you were diſguſted with England, and had, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, returned to Italy: that you had almoſt renounced botany; and I now recollect he even told me ſomewhat of your having ſhewn an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary genius for muſic."</p>
            <p>"So he was kind enough to tell <hi>me,</hi>" replied Marlini, ſmiling with ſome ſcorn; "and you ſee to what <hi>extraordinary preferment</hi> my genius has led
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037796_0073_100F530EF6EBDC38"/>
me. As to England, I have certainly no diſguſt to it, though I have ſome cauſe to wiſh it did not ſend its fools abroad to bring foreign fools home.—Another time, mr. Arundel, I will tell you more."</p>
            <p>Arundel, who really felt intereſted in the tale, and acroſs whoſe mind it glanced that <hi>another time</hi> to him might never come, preſſed him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the converſation.</p>
            <p>"Nay, I have not much to tell neither," ſaid Marlini, laying down his fiddle. "You know the repeated invitations which induced me to come to London; where I found <hi>il cavaliere</hi> Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey converted into <hi>la ſua excellenza,</hi> and ſurrounded by a crowd of fools all gaping like myſelf for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. To do him juſtice, however, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me very civilly, and recommended me to the care of his Swiſs valet, through whoſe intereſt I got a lodging in the Seven Dials—not without a general invitation to dine at the hotel de Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey whenever it was agreeable to me. Alas! I did not then know that the latter clauſe was in fact a perfect excluſion. I made my way, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to his lordſhip's table, though not without bribing his porter with twice the money for which
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037796_0074_100F5315B1945260"/>
I might have dined at the ordinary, and had the honour of taking my place at the bottom of it, between an old German and a young Engliſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. The company was numerous, and ſome of them talked as if they were men of ſcience: I was therefore not without hopes, that his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would take an opportunity of recommending myſelf and my ſtudies to their notice. But in this I was diſappointed: they ſat long, drank hard, and at length unwillingly broke up, to adjourn to the drawing-room, where lady Lindſey had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a concert. I flattered myſelf, that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral converſation I might at leaſt be able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my own plans, and was greatly pleaſed by the civilities of an old gentleman, whoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was denoted by a ſtar, and who talked to me in very good Italian. He had already invited me to his palace; and I had diſcovered him to be the duke of B—. I was beginning to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate myſelf on my good fortune—But, alas! how cruelly was I diſappointed, when, in the midſt of an intereſting converſation upon botany, he reminded me with great eagerneſs, that the concert was going to begin, and recommended me to take up my violin. I aſſured him I was no performer, and even totally unſkilled in muſic: he heard me at firſt with incredulity, till, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037796_0075_100F5317EFFC9B60"/>
that, far from being the phenomenon he doubtleſs had imagined, I actually took no part in what was going forward, he abruptly ſhifted his place, and became ever after ſo near-ſighted that it was impoſſible for me to attract his notice.—Why ſhould I tire you, mr. Arundel, with repetitions of the ſame thing? Day after day did I attend the levee of lord Lindſey, and vainly did I ſolicit the patronage he had promiſed. Perhaps he meant not to impoveriſh or betray me; but, woe to the man in whom vanity and ſelf-love do the offices of the blackeſt treachery!—impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed I certainly became. The ſtory of the duke, which in our firſt familiarity I had related, appeared to him <hi>then</hi> an exceeding good jeſt; but what was my ſurpriſe, when, after being worn out in that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, it ſuddenly took another, and he very ſeriouſly propoſed to me to turn muſician! Vainly did I repreſent the years I had ſpent in my favourite ſtudy, the expenſive collection of plants I had brought over with me, in the hope of being preſented to ſome of thoſe ſocieties in London whoſe applauſe ſecures celebrity and wealth. My remonſtrances were not liſtened to, I was poor, and could not enforce them. It was ſettled, in his circle, that a fiddler I was; and a fiddler I at length became—lucky in getting half
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037796_0076_100F534D74515368"/>
a-guinea a night by ſcraping in a manner which the taſte natural to my country renders offenſive to my own ears, and contented to be any thing rather than the table companion and the attendant upon a <hi>lord!</hi>"</p>
            <p>Arundel, to whom parts of this narrative had communicated ſtings of which he who related it was wholly unconſcious, was preparing to reply, when Marlini, being called upon to take his part in a full piece, had only time to give his addreſs; and the other, not unwillingly, reſigned his place to ſome ladies who preſſed near him.</p>
            <p>One, two, three o'clock came, and lord Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey returned not. Arundel, who had ſpent the night in walking his chamber, at length ſaw day appear; and with a mixture of irreſolution, ſelf-diſdain, and deſpair, ruſhed, with the friend who was to accompany him, to the place of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Villiers, with his ſecond, was there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame moment. The calmneſs and intrepidity of <hi>his</hi> countenance; the ſhame, too, of ſeeming to ſhrink from the occaſion ſealed up thoſe lips on which native candour and ſenſibility had half-prepared an apology. They drew; both were admirable ſwordſmen; but Arundel, who
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:037796_0077_100F531979C65C08"/>
eminently excelled in every manly exerciſe, ſoon gained a manifeſt advantage; and, being preſſed on too boldly by his antagoniſt, moſt unwillingly ſheathed his ſword in his breaſt.—Villiers dropped his—ſtaggered—and fell.</p>
            <p>Had the univerſe, and all it contained, been vaniſhing from before his eyes, hardly could A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel have felt a greater ſhock. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had miſled him, fled inſtantaneouſly; and Villiers, whoſe languid looks were directed to thoſe who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, ſaw, not without ſenſibility, the change of that cheek which the approach of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal danger had not for a moment blanched.</p>
            <p>"You have uſed a brave as well as ſkilful ſword, mr. Arundel," ſaid he, "in a bad cauſe; and have, I fear, completed many family calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I pardon you, however.—The challenge was mine, gentlemen," added <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which had faltered on his lips faded imperceptibly and he fainted.</p>
            <p>Neither the ſenſe of danger, nor the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of their mutual friends, could for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:037796_0078_100F291B71D23238"/>
incline Arundel to reſign the care of him whoſe murderer he now began to deem himſelf; and he reſolutely followed them into the carriage which was to convey mr. Villiers to an hotel not far diſtant. The danger was there declared by the ſurgeons to be leſs imminent than it appeared. The ſword had fortunately miſſed the vitals; and though by penetrating deeply it had cauſed a vaſt effuſion of blood, the wound bore no preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being mortal. Arundel became more compoſed at intelligence ſo unexpected, and was at length prevailed upon to retire.</p>
            <p>The events of the morning were now to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to Lindſey; and to Lindſey, ſpite of his faults, the agitated ſpirits of his friend ſtill turned with habitual confidence. But he was yet to learn, that the man who relies on the gratitude of the diſſolute muſt have claims more impoſing than <hi>deſert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lindſey, who was juſt returned from a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-table, feveriſh with-accumulated loſſes, and ſtupified for want of reſt, liſtened with coldneſs to the narration and ſmiling at the end of it, ſarcaſtically thanked him for his knight errantry. "Louiſa, too," added he, "will, I doubt not, be
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037796_0079_100F280AD1AC3F08"/>
               <hi>duly</hi> grateful for her ſhare of the obligation; and a gratitude ſo well-founded I certainly can have no right to interfere in."—Arundel, to whom this ſpeech was wholly incomprehenſible, replied not.</p>
            <p>"Or perhaps," added Lindſey, "ſhe has been ſo already!—But pr'ythee, dear Arundel, let me counſel you as a friend not to make a practice of drawing your ſword in <hi>that</hi> cauſe!" There was a half jealous and half diſdainful ſneer in his manner, at once calculated to alarm and to irritate.</p>
            <p>"I ſhall moſt aſſuredly never draw it again in your lordſhip's cauſe," ſaid Arundel indignantly; "but for lady Lindſey—"</p>
            <p>"Lady Lindſey! mr. Arundel. You certainly do not ſuppoſe that ſhe is really my wife?"</p>
            <p>A thunderbolt at the feet of Arundel would have aſtoniſhed him leſs than this ſpeech. It was then for two beings equally licentious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful that he had hazarded all dear to nature or to principle! <hi>Louiſa—Lindſey</hi>—deſpicable names! Yet

               <q>
                  <l>For <hi>them</hi> the gracious Duncan had he murdered!</l>

                  <l>Only for them.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>"The generous blood of Villiers is on my ſword!" exclaimed he, ruſhing from a roof which he knew not to be his paternal one: "I will not wrong him ſo far as to blend it with the unworthy tide that flows through the heart of lord Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey!"</p>
            <p>His feet ſpontaneouſly moved to the hotel to which captain Villiers had been carried; but the recollection that repoſe and perfect quiet had been deemed eſſential to his ſafety forbade him to enter it. Loſt in a tide of heart-wringing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections, he wandered, he knew not whither, through half the ſtreets of the metropolis, till the buſy crowds with which they were filled retired at the approach of evening. Stragglers among the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute or the idle ſtill faced the nipping autumnal wind, which began to riſe; and a ſmall crowd of theſe, collected round a ballad-ſinger, impeded, in a narrow ſtreet, the paſſage of Arundel. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary embarraſſment awakened his ſenſes, and a ſound that ſtruck from thence upon his memory induced him to ſtart forward. It <hi>was</hi> to be a day of painful retroſpection. The female who
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037796_0081_100F2907AFB6F740"/>
ſung had the appearance of a Savoyard: a little common organ hung at her ſide—her complexion was tanned—her figure was emaciated—her eyes were hollow—ſtraggling locks of auburn hair added rather a miſery than a charm to her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;—yet the foreign accent, the beautiful brow—above all, the well remembered air ſhe ſung, at once carried conviction to the heart of Arundel—It <hi>was</hi>—it <hi>could</hi> be no other than Annette! Annette betrayed!—Annette, the victim of Lindſey! expoſed in the firſt inſtance to diſgrace, and in the laſt to poverty! frail, yet not licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious! miſerable, yet not vindictive! drew from the charity of ſtrangers that humble pittance which induſtry and innocence had rendered once ſo honourable!—Let us draw a veil over the picture, and follow Arundel.</p>
            <p>In ſolitude, ſilence, and adverſity, he now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had learnt to think—to eſtimate the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between real and imaginary bleſſings—and to perceive how neglect, indiſcretion, and ſelf-love, ſcatter, even from the boſom of luxury, the fruitful ſeeds of vice and devaſtation.</p>
            <p>After various painful ſelf-denials, he thought he might at length venture to requeſt admiſſion
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037796_0082_100F281BD52233B8"/>
to Villiers, of whoſe wound he received the moſt favourable reports; nor was it among the leaſt of his late mortifications to learn, that on the noon of that day, Villiers had by his own orders, been conveyed into a chair, and, after paying every expence, quitted the hotel without leaving behind him the ſmalleſt indication of the place of his retreat.</p>
            <p>Arundel was now overwhelmned with chagrin and diſappointment. On the idea of offering an honourable and ample conceſſion, his heart had reſted with romantic enthuſiaſm. Perhaps he had ſecretly flattered himſelf he might find a friend in that generous antagoniſt with whom his feelings had at firſt ſight claimed acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Fruſtrated in his paſt views, and hopeleſs of the future, his ſpirits would have been wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed but for a ſingular event.</p>
            <p>A note from the banker with whom mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer had tranſacted buſineſs, informed him, that two hundred pounds had been recently lodged in the houſe, payable either to that gentleman's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or mr. Arundel's,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:037796_0083_100F29095446DB60"/>
Soft hope again ſtole over the heart of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He was not then forgotten!—Some being was ſtill intereſted in his fate! Some protecting ſpirit, like that of Mortimer, ſtill hovered over him!—Ah! could it be a female one?</p>
            <p>Relieved from pecuniary embarraſſments, it was his firſt employment to diſcover the habitation of captain Villiers. The poor rarely have a ſecret that is well kept; and in a very few days it was traced to be the ſecond floor of a houſe in a ſmall ſtreet near Piccadilly. Bounded as Arundel's means were, yet, to ſhare them with the man he had injured, and whoſe circumſtances, it was plain, could ill ſupport extraordinary expence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came now the firſt object of his life. To have ſhared them, indeed, with thoſe he had <hi>himſelf</hi> injured, might have been only juſtice; but to ſay truth, the improvident Arundel was hardly leſs diſpoſed to ſhew his liberality to Marlini and Annette.</p>
            <p>Captain Villiers was now in a ſtate to quit his chamber; and Arundel, who well knew how to calculate the wiſhes of pride, eaſily concluded that he had no other mode of inſuring their meeting but a ſurpriſe. Forbearing, therefore, his uſual
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037796_0084_100F281DC000BF68"/>
anonymous enquiry, he one evening repaired to the houſe; where, being told by a ſervant that mr. Villiers was in his apartment, he abruptly walked up ſtairs, and, without further ceremony than a gentle rap, opened the door. Candles in the room there were none; but the twilight, aided by the bright blaze of a ſire, enabled him clearly to diſcern Villiers, who repoſed on a ſopha on one ſide of it, while on the other ſat a tall and fair young lady in mourning, who appeared to have been reading to him.</p>
            <p>Generous minds are not long in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other. Villiers was prepared, by ſome frank and noble <hi>traits</hi> that he had diſcovered in the character of his viſitor, to give him credit for qualities the other was now well diſpoſed to ſhew. To remove prepoſſeſſion, was to enſure regard: Arundel was born to be beloved; and captain Villiers, though leſs faſcinating, had a candour and martial enthuſiaſm of mind which circumſtances only had concealed. The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſoon became unfettered and intereſting.</p>
            <p>"On the father of the preſent lord Lindſey," ſaid Villiers, "mine had claims of friendſhip to which the former was not inſenſible: they induced
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037796_0085_100F290BEFDB9A28"/>
him to beſtow on me, very early in life, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which, though it brought with it many years of painful ſervice, in a climate injurious to my health, ought to be remembered with kindneſs. Attentive to me even during his laſt illneſs, by a letter addreſſed to the ſon whoſe ingratitude and negligence avowedly ſhortened his days, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his earneſt deſire that I might be promoted in my profeſſion, and relieved from various pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary embarraſſments, in which the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my father had involved his family. By the young lord Lindſey I was at firſt treated with kindneſs and diſtinction. Reiterated promiſes taught me to hope every thing; but I hoped, only to be diſappointed. I knew enough of the world, however, to have ſuſtained that like a man;—but when to neglect he dared to add injury—when he preſumed to violate—in ſhort—why ſhould I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble? when he would have trafficked upon the ſiſter's honour for the brother's promotion, it was then I felt like a ſoldier."</p>
            <p>Arundel, whoſe cheek glowed with indignation and remorſe, ſtarted haſtily from his ſeat; which Villiers, with a ſmile of kindneſs, motioned to him to reſume.—"By an intercepted letter I became apprized of a ſecret which my ſiſter's ſears for
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037796_0086_100F2820F5E7BE60"/>
my ſafety had induced her to conceal. With what determination I afterwards ſaw lord Lindſey, I hardly know myſelf; but I well recollect, that reſpect for the memory of his father, and his own inability to ſight, alone prevented my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing thoſe violent meaſures I was but too well inclined to, when the ill fortune of both induced you to requeſt an interview with me. I ſaw you with prejudiced eyes: had I ſeen you with any other, our ſwords had never been drawn. Yet let me do you the juſtice of acknowledging, that, even in the ſhort converſation which preceded our appointment, I perceived I had an adverſary to encounter, of whoſe dignity of character I was little aware; and though unable to reduce either my reſentment or my pride to a tardy expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I met you with a reluctance, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps contributed, with your own ſkill, to give you the advantage you obtained."</p>
            <p>Arundel, at once grieved and flattered, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the growing friendſhip by a confidence, not indeed minutely detailed, for the health of Villiers allowed not of long converſation, but unbounded as far as related to lord Lindſey, and departed with an invitation to repeat his viſit next day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:037796_0087_100F290EC4230560"/>
The viſit was repeated again—and again—and again. Miſs Villiers was almoſt conſtantly with her brother, and as conſtantly purſued the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſhe had firſt adopted, of retiring at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his friend. Arundel could not avoid feeling ſome pique at the beautiful ſtatue he had ſo little power of animating: not that he allowed beauty to be any advantage—oh, no! "Louiſa had cured him! Louiſa had rendered him forever indifferent to ſo illuſive an attraction;" and he repeated this ſo often that he really believed it. It was the mind—the viſible expreſſion of it in the countenance of Henrietta with which he was now charmed. It was the ſweet ſeriouſneſs of her eyes—ſo like her brother's, only heightened by the fineſt long laſhes in the world, that made an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible impreſſion on his memory. Yet, never to ſpeak, never to permit him the common claims of an acquaintance eternally to curtſey and withdraw it was ſo ſtrange, ſo cruel, ſo ſingular an inſtance of coquetry, that really all the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy he was maſter of could not ſtand it.</p>
            <p>Chance, however, did for him what miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers would not do. After ſpending the morning with her brother as uſual <hi>tête-à-tête,</hi> he had taken his leave, when, on walking the length of the

ſtreet, ſomewhat occurred that he had neglected to mention; and haſtily returning, he threw open the door of the apartment, where Henrietta was then ſitting alone. A conſcious—a half re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful ſmile brightened the features of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, as he reſpectfully advanced and addreſſed her. Miſs Villiers, on the contrary, turned pale, bluſhed, and, dropping her eyes, <hi>faintly</hi> replied to his queſtions; but the voice was not to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken—a voice ſo touching, ſo inimitably ſoft—Heaven and earth! what was his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it was immediately recognized to be that of Thereſa!—Thereſa,—the tender friend ſo long and ſo ungratefully forgotten.</p>
            <p>If Arundel was tranſported, far different were the feelings of miſs Villiers.—Conſcious, abaſhed, devoid of all power of feigning—<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Ah! he learnt not that only: there was a ſuſpicion, there was a truth remained behind, at which, though his heart beat with exultation and hope, he ventured not even remotely to glance. Yet who elſe ſhould write to Mortimer that ſhe did
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:037796_0089_100F2910552986B8"/>
not bluſh to acknowledge an intereſt for him?—Who elſe ſhould tell his guardian and his friend, "that he had every grace that wins affection, and every virtue that juſtifies it?" Who but Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta had opportunity, whilſt he was in purſuit of another object, to dwell unobſerved upon his character—to trace all its energies—to feel all its diſappointments—and unconſciouſly to cheriſh a treacherous ſentiment under the name of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous one?</p>
            <p>Captain Villiers, who was only in the adjoining apartment, entered at this moment, and ſaw with ſurpriſe Arundel holding the hand of his ſiſter, and ſpeaking with an eagerneſs that marked the tendereſt intereſt in what he uttered.</p>
            <p>"Dear Villiers!" ſaid the latter, recovering himſelf to ſpare her embarraſſment, "Would you believe that I have found in your ſiſter an old and tenderly beloved friend?"</p>
            <p>"So it appears," ſaid Villiers ſmiling; "but how came you to take advantage of my abſence to make this diſcovery?"</p>
            <p>"Mr. Arundel," ſaid Henrietta, ſtriving to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037796_0090_100F285054C57D58"/>
command herſelf, "had <hi>forgotten</hi> his friend, and I was not willing to obtrude her upon his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory."</p>
            <p>Every truth but one was now avowed on all ſides; and Villiers was not ſo dull of comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as to overlook that.</p>
            <p>"The veil—the cruel veil," cried Arundel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully, as they recounted their interviews in the convent—</p>
            <p>"—Was <hi>once</hi> at leaſt withdrawn," added Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta bluſhing;—"but the features it ſhaded were not worthy of retaining your eye."</p>
            <p>Arundel, who too well recollected the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their firſt meeting, could only anſwer by a look—a look that at once conveyed his own ſelf-reproach. Yet time, that had matured his underſtanding, had alſo matured the beauty of Henrietta; whoſe features, though ever regular, were far from poſſeſſing, while in the convent, that lovely finiſh her whole perſon had ſince at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>The older mr. Villiers, obliged by his neceſſities
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:037796_0091_100F2913438F7FC0"/>
to renounce his own name, had, under that of Mortimer, afforded the parental protection to Arundel which nature had deſigned for his own children. Of theſe children one had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the care of lord Lindſey, who, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking him early in a military line, deprived him of the opportunity to make troubleſome enquiries. For his daughter, unprotected and dowerleſs, mr. Villiers's religion enabled him to allot a life of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in the convent where ſhe had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; nor was it till lord Lindſey himſelf ſtarted the propoſal of marrying Arundel abroad, that he thought of a ſcheme by which all their views might be conciliated. With this ſcheme, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Henrietta alone had ever been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; and though Arundel and her brother could not fail, in the courſe of the explanation, to ſurmiſe it, ſhe earneſtly guarded the idea from obtruding.</p>
            <p>To captain Villiers, indeed, all this was new: his father's caution had kept from his knowledge the change of his name—the companion of his travels—in a word, every thing but what related to the embarraſſment of their affairs, or the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his ſiſter. Unconſcious, therefore, that ſuch a being as Arundel exiſted, till he met him
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037796_0092_100F2852DBDB3DA8"/>
in the houſe of the young lord Lindſey, it was on the event of the duel that his name firſt tranſpired to Henrietta. Why her previous acquaintance with it had been ſo cautiouſly omitted in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations with her brother relative to her father's viſit at Lyons, neither gentleman preſumed to aſk, probably for the beſt of all reaſons—that both of them could gueſs.</p>
            <p>The moment of final diſcovery now ſeemed dawning upon Arundel—but it was only a gleam. Of his birth, captain Villiers knew nothing; and Henrietta, to whom her father never confided more of his plans than was neceſſary for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, only faintly recollected to have heard him once ſay that he was the ſon of a mr. Arundel of Cornwall.</p>
            <p>"It is ſtrange that my father ſhould leave no papers by which to gueſs at this myſtery," ſaid Villiers. The anxious eyes of his ſiſter half ſought thoſe of Arundel, and her cheek was fluſhed with apprehenſion for his anſwer.</p>
            <p>"Very ſtrange," replied the latter with a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity love firſt had taught him—"It was, I know, his cuſtom to burn all his letters after
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:037796_0093_100F2915676B9938"/>
reading them: the few lines that alone fell into my hands we will take an early opportunity of examining together."</p>
            <p>Re-aſſured by the careleſſneſs of his anſwer, Henrietta recovered herſelf. Her ſecret ſafe—her lover and her brother thus perfectly united—could the world preſent a livelier pleaſure than that which glowed round her heart? The fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of Villiers was now embelliſhed with the ſmiles of happineſs, and a long, a lengthened evening ſucceeded, during which Arundel drank deep draughts of a paſſion which he attempted not to reſiſt; and which beauty, merit, cultivated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and poliſhed manners, united to juſtify.</p>
            <p>Strolling through the city the next morning with Villiers, a man who ſeemed guarding the door of a narrow and dirty entry attempted to put a printed paper in his hand. It would have been rejected, had not the unexpected enforcement of "You had better take it, mr. Arundel," induced him to ſtop. He looked earneſtly at the figure by whom it was preſented, and, under an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe buſh of wig, a threadbare coat and a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let waiſtcoat laced with gold, diſcovered his quondam acquaintance, the German philoſopher.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:037796_0094_100F28559E3C8638"/>
"You can't oblige an old friend with leſs than a ſhilling, mr. Arundel," ſaid the German, "ſo pray have the goodneſs to walk in." Arundel complied; but he muſt have been a philoſopher himſelf to forbear ſmiling when he perceived his friend's collection of minerals and foſſils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into what be called a very pretty "<hi>rarce ſhow;</hi>" by which, with the aſſiſtance of a few common philoſophical experiments medical ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice offered gratis, and a ſmall pretence at judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial aſtrology, the German aſſured him he gained a tolerable livelihood.</p>
            <p>"Not," ſaid he, "but I had better have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died a ſyſtem of the world than that of the earth, and then I ſhould have been aware of ſome of its revolutions, which all my knowledge of the ſtars even did not inform me of."</p>
            <p>Arundel, who knew his acquaintance's head to be filled with as much real learning as might have ſupplied half a univerſity, could not but ſmile at the ſingular ſtoiciſm diſplayed in his conduct; and though he felt not that tender intereſt with which the quick ſenſibility and embittered ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Italian had inſpired him, yet was his ſmile inſenſibly chaſtened by a ſigh, when he
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:037796_0095_100F2916F4DDA548"/>
contraſted the <hi>character</hi> of the German and his fate.</p>
            <p>"The romantic days of chivalry, and the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic ones of ſeudal authority, are both vaniſhed," ſaid he, as he commented with his friend on the events they had lately witneſſed. "M<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, at that period, was contented to barter independency for protection, and found in the cheriſhing power of rank ſomewhat that conſoled him for its ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority. The groſſer ligaments that then bound the great to the little have inſenſibly refined into the nicer ones of benevolence, diſtinction, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. How careful ought the great to be that they ſnap not theſe by ſelfiſhneſs, pride or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price!—How, inſtead of weakening, ought they to ſtrengthen, ties, by which the human ſpecies is <hi>allured</hi> to that ſubordination to which no mortal effort can ever, perhaps, <hi>awe</hi> them!"</p>
            <p>"You think deeply," returned his friend.</p>
            <p>"No, dear Villiers, I only feel deeply—feel for the virtues I have ſeen betrayed—the talents I have ſeen blighted—the ſenſibilities," he added, half ſmothering a ſigh, "I have known rejected; and by a man to whom it would have coſt ſo little to have cultivated all."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:037796_0096_100F28F50C8A76E8"/>
The ſight of miſs Villiers at once diſſipated ſpleen and philoſophy. A thouſand more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting topics occurred; and the ſubject of his birth engaged the attention both of Arundel and his friends. The paper he believed to have been written by his father was vainly examined by each.</p>
            <p>"The clue my ſiſter has given us," ſaid cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Villiers, "ſeems, after all, the only poſſible one to lead to a diſcovery. You muſt go into Cornwall, and the ſooner the better; for we are none of us rich enough to ſpend either money or time in unneceſſary delays. Suppoſe you ſet off to-morrow!"</p>
            <p>"To-morrow is ſurely too ſoon!" anſwered Arundel, intuitively fixing his eyes on miſs Villiers.</p>
            <p>"I think not," ſaid her brother ſmiling; "ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remember, dear Arundel,
<q>
                  <l>To-morrow is too late:</l>
                  <l>The <hi>wiſe</hi> lived yeſterday!"</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>"Ah!" cried Arundel warmly, "it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed only yeſterday that I began to live! How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will go to-morrow, if you think it adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037796_0097_100F2925269355F0"/>
A family of conſequence enough to mention an <hi>heir</hi> cannot be unknown in the country; and I may at leaſt find ground for conjecture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am able to make the wiſhed-for diſcovery or not."</p>
            <p>"I have good preſentiments," ſaid Villiers as he quitted the room to attend a troubleſome viſitor in the next—"though certainly that nothing ſhould even accidentally remain but thoſe lines is very extraordinary!"</p>
            <p>Henrietta and her lover were left <hi>tête-à-tête;</hi> ſhe felt embarraſſed; and with the ill fortune that generally follows the attempt at diſpelling an awkward ſilence, haſtily repeated her brother's words, that it <hi>was</hi> very extraordinary! Arundel, unable to reſiſt the temptation, advanced towards her.</p>
            <p>"Will miſs Villiers," ſaid he, "do me the honour of becoming my confidante?"</p>
            <p>"Moſt undoubtedly," faltered ſhe, turning pale.</p>
            <p>"And may I—dare I venture to tell her that there was yet another paper?"—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:037796_0098_100F28F802F337F0"/>
"Is it not better—would it not be right, I mean—why not rather tell my brother?" again incoherently cried Henrietta, ſtill paler than before.</p>
            <p>"Becauſe," interrupted Arundel, "if my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are true, the writing is too ſacred to be prophaned by any eye but my own; becauſe on their deciſion probably depends the happineſs or miſery of my life; and becauſe," added he, taking it from his boſom, "with miſs Villiers alone it remains to tell me which."</p>
            <p>She caſt a timid eye upon the paper, and, too conſcious of the hand, as well as the probable purport of it, would have ſunk from her chair, had not the ſupporting arms of Arundel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her. He was at her feet when captain Villiers returned; nor could the latter forbear aſking with a ſmile, whether theſe tender demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of regard were meant for the old friend, or the new one?</p>
            <p>Arundel, who had not been able to reſolve on the journey of the morrow without previous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation to both, now heſitated not to diſcloſe his whole heart. Villiere heard him with undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed pleaſure; and though not apprized, by any
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037796_0099_100F291886AC9288"/>
part of the converſation, of his ſiſter's partiality, thought he ran no riſque of violently offending her by ſanctioning the hopes of her lover.</p>
            <p>Pleaſure, however, is a fleeting good! So thought Arundel as he looked the next day through the dingy panes of glaſs in an inn window about thirty miles from London. His gaiety was not greatly increaſed by the probability of having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better to do than to look through them for two hours longer. Luxury had not yet provided for travellers as in more modern times; and the only poſt-horſe the ſtables afforded, Arundel, from a principle of humanity and good-nature, had reſigned to a gentleman whom the landlord had deſcribed to be in a ſtate of agitation that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke his journey a matter of the utmoſt importance. He was ſomewhat tempted, however, to repent of his good-nature, when paſſing through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he caſt his eyes on this <hi>gentleman,</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to be the valet of lord Lindſey; a man who had long reigned over his maſter with moſt unbounded influence, and whoſe inſolent manners rendered him the deteſtation of all within his circle.</p>
            <p>"Ah, mr. Arundel," ſaid Verney, ſtarting at
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:037796_0100_100F28FA4DA20550"/>
the ſight of him, "is it you, then, to whom I am ſo greatly obliged? You were always good and generous, and I am almoſt tempted—"</p>
            <p>"To profit by the example, I hope," ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel, coldly ſmiling, and paſſing on. The man ſeemed ſtruck with the ſpeech.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Arundel, for the love of Heaven, ſtop!" ſaid he, eagerly ſeizing his hand: favour me with a moment's converſation. It may be of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to you than you are aware of." Arundel heſitated; yet, ſomewhat impreſſed with his manner, went with him into an adjoining apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Verney ſhut the door.</p>
            <p>"You have been, ſir, for a long time now, the companion and intimate of my lord: you have been the confidant of many of his ſecrets; yet I believe—nay, I am very ſure, that you did not know him to be your brother."</p>
            <p>"My brother! ſaid Arundel, ſtarting back with amazement.—"Lord Lindſey my brother!"</p>
            <p>"As ſurely, ſir, as that he was the ſeducer of miſs Louiſa, and the murderer of mr. Mortimer!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:037796_0101_100F2808AB396E00"/>
"Have a care, Verney, of what you ſay!" cried Arundel aghaſt with horror.</p>
            <p>"I can ſtand to it upon oath, ſir, when, and where you pleaſe; but my time is precious, and I muſt tell my ſtory in few words. It was juſt after you ſet out for Swiſſerland, mr. Arundel, that I came into confidence with my lord; I uſed often to carry meſſages and notes between him and ma'amſelle Louiſe; who, to ſay the truth, I believe courted him as much as he did her. However that was, he fell into a very great paſſion when he found that ſhe had told you of their correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſwore he would never ſee her more. Nay, he actually made you the ſame promiſe, or ſomething like it, as you may remember, and left Lyons accordingly. His heart, however, failed him before he had gone many miles; for they were to have met that night—as I ſhould have told you they often did—when miſs Louiſe could make a pretence for getting out of the convent to viſit her acquaintance. Nothing then would ſerve my lord but returning; and a melancholy return it was for poor mr. Mortimer, whom we overtook as we paſſed through the ſhort cut that leads to the high road. My lord at firſt would have avoided him; but perceiving he was already
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037796_0102_100F28FC793EFBC8"/>
known, determined to ride boldly on. They ſoon came up with one another, and interchanged ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations; not very civil. Some converſation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; and though I was at a diſtance, I could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that mr. Mortimer upbraided my lord with treachery, and falſehood. <hi>Falſehood</hi> was the word. You may gueſs how this was taken; both of them fell into ſuch a paſſion that I verily believe they knew not what they ſaid, or did: and as curioſity drew me nearer, I diſtinctly heard mr. Mortimer tell my lord that he had no occaſion to value himſelf upon his birth; that he was only a younger brother; and that you were both ſon and heir to lord Lindſey, as he could ſufficiently prove by letters then in his pocket-book. All my lord's paſſion before was nothing at all to this. As ill-luck would have it, we had piſtols in the holſters for it was then duſk, and we were to go out of the city again that night.—To be ſhort, I held their horſes while they both fired, and I ſaw mr. Mortimer drop. By my lord's command I myſelf took the pocket-book from him, for he, poor man! was quite gone; and away we rode as if the devil was behind us, and ſo to be ſure he was. My lord was very moody, and, as I thought, very penitent; and often ſaid he did not intend the old gentleman's death, but that it was an even
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:037796_0103_100F291E38DF6320"/>
chance, and therefore done in an honourable way. However, as honourable as it was, he made no ſcruple of keeping the pocket-book, in which, ſure enough, there were ſome choſen letters from the old lord, that ſufficiently confirmed the truth of mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer's ſtory. Not that I got ſight of them at firſt; ſo far from it, that he would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded me they contained nothing of conſequence. However, I knew my opportunities, and when I had once ſeen them, we uſed to talk them over very often; and he even told me that he ſhould never have fallen into ſuch a rage at firſt hearing of them, but that his father, when angry with him once, let fall an odd ſaying, that dwelt upon his mind. All this, mr. Arundel, I will ſay, and ſwear too!—As to the reſt, to be ſure it grieved me to ſee you forced by ill treatment to quit your own father's houſe, and throw yourſelf upon the wide world; while, on the other hand, my lord—" Here Verney began to ſtammer, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel, to whoſe overburdened and agitated mind a pauſe ſeemed neceſſary, threw open the ſaſh, and, leaning againſt the window-frame, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to recover a compoſure of which the dreadful train of facts he had liſtened to, ſeemed wholly to have deprived him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:037796_0104_100F28FE17AE3D98"/>
"Well, mr. Arundel, I muſt go," ſaid Verney, abruptly ſtarting up, as if himſelf awakened to ſome new recollections.</p>
            <p>"Whither?" returned the other.</p>
            <p>"That I can't immediately tell—Not to my lord, you may be ſure. This confounded gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling has ſo ruined his temper, that a man had better live in Bedlam than with him. However, if you will tell me where a line may find you, depend upon receiving one 'ere long; and, if I can do you juſtice, juſtice you ſhall have."</p>
            <p>To part in ſo light a manner with a teſtimony of ſuch importance, and of which he might be ſo eaſily deprived, either by corruption or accident, appeared ſo Arundel the extreme of folly; and he urged every motive either of juſtice, or intereſt, that might induce Verney to return with him to town. The man ſeemed irreſolute, yet more inclined to purſue his own <hi>route,</hi> than that pointed out to him. The horſe at length was brought to the door.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Arundel," ſaid Verney, as the former ſtill oppoſed his departure, "what I have ſaid may well ſhew you how much I am diſpoſed to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:037796_0105_100F291FCCC78BA0"/>
do you a ſervice. I will go greater lengths, however; but you muſt firſt ſwear, that, after the proof I am going to give you of my confidence, you will neither attempt to follow, nor detain me a ſingle moment." Arundel heſitated; but, as no alternative preſented itſelf, at length complied with the requiſition.</p>
            <p>"<hi>There,</hi> ſir!" ſaid Verney taking ſome papers from his portmanteau, "<hi>there</hi> are the very letters found in mr. Mortimer's pocket-book. Aſk no queſtions, but remember your promiſe." So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſnatched up the portmanteau, ran haſtily out of the room, and left Arundel in an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from which he was firſt rouſed by the clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the horſe's hoofs.</p>
            <p>The man was quickly out of ſight; but in his hand Arundel indeed held the ſtrange, the affecting teſtimonials of his birth—ſo long concealed, ſo wonderfully brought to light. That Verney had robbed his lord could not be doubted; ſo often doth "even handed juſtice
<q>
                  <l>Return th' ingredients of the poiſoned chalice</l>
                  <l>To our own lips."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Had the ſpeed with which Arundel returned to town allowed more time for reflection, how new,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:037796_0106_100F2901B54ED5D8"/>
how brilliant was the proſpect that now opened before him! To conceal his birth was once eaſy, but to trace it could no longer be difficult. Miſs Villiers raiſed to fortune and rank by his means—miſs Villiers, the ornament of his family, and the reſtorer of her own, ſwam before his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and diffuſed an enchanting ſenſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure throughout his heart—a pleaſure ſoftened into grateful ſenſibility, when he recollected that he was paying to the daughter of Mortimer, thoſe dues his affection vainly laviſhed on the aſhes of the father.</p>
            <p>To captain Villiers his return was as deſirable as unexpected. A chance enquiry had already diſcovered to him that Arundel was the original name of the Lindſey family; and a compariſon of circumſtances had inſpired him with a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of that truth now ſo wonderfully confirmed.

They were told he was indiſpoſed, and could ſee no one, but to a ſubterfuge apparently the reſult either of

            <p>"My lord wiſhes to ſpeak to mr. Arundel," ſaid the ſervant, returning; "but captain Villiers he begs will excuſe him."</p>
            <p>The verbal meſſage, the oftentatious approach, the ceremonious introduction, had already, in the boſom of Arundel, repelled the generous tide of nature. Oh God! how did the impetuous cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent return upon his heart, when, ſtretched on a couch at one end of a magnificent dreſſing-room, he caſt his eyes on the ſpectre of that gay, and beautiful Lindſey, whom he had parted with but ſix weeks before, blooming in health, and vigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in youth!—A ſigh—almoſt a groan of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite anguiſh burſt from the heart of Arundel, as,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:037796_0108_100F2903D7089758"/>
the hand of his brother, he bent his face over it in womaniſh emotion. The ſhort and ſudden cough—the agonizing pain that ſeemed to ſeize upon lord Lindſey, as inſtantly recalled his reaſon.</p>
            <p>"My brother—my friend!" cried he incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, "recover—compoſe yourſelf. I come not to upbraid. Oh, why," added he more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, "did I miſtruſt your meſſage? Why did I thus ſuddenly force myſelf upon you?" Lord Lindſey, choked by agitation, could not ſpeak; and Arundel, unable to witneſs ſufferings he could not aſſuage, flew into the anti-chamber, while the attendants adminiſtered relief. From one of them he learnt what had in part effected this devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Lord Lindſey, a month before, had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a rural <hi>fête</hi> given by the ducheſs of Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, where, after a night of dancing and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exceſs, he had fallen aſleep, undiſcovered for many hours, upon the wet graſs. The ſervant had no time for further information. Recalled by the found of his brother's voice, Arundel ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly returned to the apartment. The former tenderly preſſed his hand, and by ſlow and painful efforts was now able to ſpeak. But the long-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed hours of proſperity and health, that make atonement virtue, were loſt to Lindſey; and
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:037796_0109_100F29278234D5A8"/>
though in ſpeaking he failed not to render Arundel a noble juſtice, yet from it, his own boſom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted not that balm which might in happier days have proved ſo healing.</p>
            <p>It was not, however, without an exquiſite ſenſe of ſuffering, that his generous brother diſcovered Verney to be a principal inſtrument in the cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe which the appearance of Lindſey an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to be ſo near; a ſuffering conſiderably augmented, when he found that it was to a latent ſpark of tenderneſs and remorſe in the latter, he had owed the two hundred pounds lodged for his uſe at the banker's.</p>
            <p>Hardly had lord Lindſey got rid of ſome of thoſe alarming ſymptoms which were produced by the violent and dangerous cold he had taken, when Verney, who was dreſſing him, one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encroached ſo far upon his uſual inſolence as to exaſperate a temper already peeviſh and fretful. In a tranſport of rage, lord Lindſey ſtruck him. The brutal precedent was not loſt: Verney re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the blow. A violent ſtruggle enſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and before Lindſey had either time or recollection to ring his bell, he was thrown againſt a cabinet that ſtood near, with a force that
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037796_0110_100F2905661BFF28"/>
left him breathleſs: while Verney, early ſeduced to villany, now profited by the leſſon, and eſcaped with ſuch valuables and papers as he deemed moſt likely to ſecure him either impunity or revenge.</p>
            <p>Lindſey revived: but ſevere irritation and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal injury had done the work of time; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived only to know that he was dying.</p>
            <p>Yet within the ſweet circle of love and virtue there is an atmoſphere that renders death leſs pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! Arundel, Villiers, his ſiſter, all united their cares in alleviating his ſufferings; and the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſeaſe ſubſided into inſenſible decay.</p>
            <p>"I give you, miſs Villiers," ſaid Lindſey on the day that united her with his brother, "an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable heart. I ſhall ſoon leave you," added he faintly ſmiling, "thoſe worldly advantages to which that alone gives true nobility."</p>
            <p>Ah, what could <hi>nobility</hi> add to the happineſs of Arundel and Henrietta! Love, friendſhip, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petence! "Flowers of Paradiſe as yet unſaded," are in themſelves, to tender and well-regulated minds, "all they can gueſs of Heaven."</p>
