            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words contain the firſt Opening of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel Day to poor loſt Man.</p>
            <p>Here is the firſt Promiſe revealed by the glorious Deity, and the Foundation of all the reſt; which began in that Moment to be fulfilled, and will continue to bring forth its glorious Effects, throughout the periodical Eternities, or Ages of Ages, till all Things ſhall be reſtored to their priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Perfection; and Sin and Sinners have no more a Name among the Creatures of God.</p>
            <p>In order to have proper Ideas of the glorious Deity, we muſt conſider him as a Being poſſeſſed of Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, and Goodneſs; that he can only have one Will towards all his Creatures, which always continues the ſame and alters not thro' the Fall of any of them; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually manifeſts itſelf as a Will of Infinite Goodneſs towards them all, according to their various Circumſtances; ſeeking their Recovery, and complete Reſtoration.</p>
            <p>Fury, Wrath, or Anger, can never dwell in the Fountain of Love, but are only to be found in fallen Nature, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Life of God.</p>
            <p>If Fury was in the glorious <hi>Jehovah,</hi> it muſt have been an eternal, immutable, unbounded Wrath, that never could be extinguiſhed; and viewed in that Light, he muſt have forever been the moſt unhappy of all Beings; for wherever Fury is found, Selfiſhneſs, Envy, and Pride are joined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: Theſe are the four Elements of Hell or fallen Nature, and mutually generate each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:017441_0003_0FA11F0BF5B3CD80"/>But bleſſed be the Name of the Triune God, he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us that "He is Love" eſſentially, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſo communicatively to all his Creatures.</p>
            <p>The glorious Theme into which I am now about to enter, far exceeds what any human Heart can conceive, Tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, or Pen deſcribe! O the Grandeur, the Beauty of this wonderful Paſſage! Could I ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Tongue of an Angel I ſhould fall ſhort, far ſhort of the Glories it contains! How then ſhall my feeble faultering unclean Lips attempt to utter the boundleſs Love! or proclaim the joyful News here revealed to periſhing Creatures!</p>
            <p>Expect not, my Brethren, that I ſhall be able to fathom this Ocean of Love; there is enough contained here to employ my Tongue forever; but I hope to bring forth ſome refreſhing Drops at this Time, by which you may have a ſmall Taſte of its Sweetneſs. When the glorious <hi>Jehovah</hi> or <hi>Elohim</hi> created Nature at firſt, it was pure, tranſparent, heavenly Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, deſcribed as "a Sea of Glaſs mingled with Fire;" into which all Matter muſt finally return, through various Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of Refinement. Out of this Nature God created Hoſts of Angels, finite, and conſequently mutable Beings; as it was impoſſible they ſhould be otherwiſe, and retain their Freedom of Will.</p>
            <p>They were glorious Images and Reſemblances of the Deity; and ſtood in the Life, Light, and Love, of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une God; manifeſted in Nature, by the threefold Properties of Fire, Light, and Spirit.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Luci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er,</hi> the Son of the Morning, ſeeking to enter into the firſt Properties of Life, and turning his ſtrong Will and Deſire towards them, awakened Wrath in Nature; and found himſelf ſhut up in his own chains of Darkneſs, together with all his Legions, who joined with him in his Rebellion; and thus one third Part of the Stars of Heaven fell into the dark Centre of Nature, and became incapable of bringing forth any Thing but Darkneſs, and Diſorder around them.</p>
            <p>Thus we can account for the "Earth being without Form, and void; and Darkneſs covering the deep:" A State which had no Poſſibility of Exiſtence, till the Fall of Angels had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it into their Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now while the Good and Evil were at Strife with each other, the glorious God ſtopped the Progreſs of the Evil, by joining his Power to the firſt Property of the Deſire, which became the Almighty Fiat; by which he congealed the whole together into ſolid Bodies; and thereby prevented the Angels from introducing any more Wrath and Darkneſs into Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017441_0004_0FA11F0CB399DAA8"/>Then the Spirit of God "brooded upon the Face of the Deep;" baptizing the ſame with Light, that the heavenly Properties might be awakened or ſtirred up; that ſo Paradiſe might cover the Earth, hide the Curſe, and bring forth its own proper Fruit.</p>
            <p>After the Formation of all other Things, God ſaid "Let us make Man in our own Image after our Likeneſs; &amp;c." "So God created Man in his own Image," forming him out of the three Principles, viz. the Fire, which is the Root of all Life, the Water, or Meekneſs neceſſary to qualify it, and the Principle called the third, viz. of this outward World, or Nature; which it was neceſſary ſhould be in him, in order that he might rule over the whole lower Creation, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ain into the heavenly Subſtantiality, from which it was ſeparated.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Adam</hi> created in the Image of God; having in himſelf a Birth of Life from the Father, Son, and Spirit. He had alſo the whole human Nature undivided in him; for he was both Male and Female in one.</p>
            <p>He had Power over all the Elements, and over all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Fire could not burn, nor Water drown him, neither could the Air ſuffocate him, nor the Earth hinder his Courſe: All the Creatures obeyed him; he knew all their Natures, in an angelical Manner; and was able to bring forth the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God in this World, without feeling, knowing, or ſeeing the Good, or Evil hid therein. He was joined with the pure Virgin of the Wiſdom of God, <hi>that</hi> was the Wife of his Youth, from whom by his Fall he was ſeparated.</p>
            <p>As his Soul was pure, ſo was his Body; quite different from our dead, dark, groſs, corrupted Bodies: His was lumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, aegile, ſpiritual, as the Reſurrection Bodies ſhall be.</p>
            <p>Now we may ſee the true Nature of his Trial; it was not arbitrarily impoſed upon him by God; neither was the Tree of Knowledge planted in the Garden on Purpoſe to tempt him, as is commonly ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>Underſtand the Matter thus:</p>
            <p>Adam had in him the three Principles as mentioned before; now each of theſe ſought to bring forth its Wonders in him, and to one or the other his Will muſt of Neceſſity incline.</p>
            <p>The Root of Fire attracted him; the Meekneſs of the Light waited for him; and the Principle of the great World alſo drew him. Now his Eyes were ſhut as to the beaſtly Life, he knew not the Good and Evil which it contained; he was to rule the Elements, and Creatures, by Virtue of the

            <p>But as his Luſt had conceived, and the fatal Tree was brought forth, the Drawing became ſtronger than before; ſo that his Fall became almoſt inevitable, or at leaſt his Trial was harder than before, according to the Nature of the Power of Attraction, as the Deſire began to be awakened.</p>
            <p>Thus he ſunk down into Sleep through the Power of Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which he began to be captivated.</p>
            <p>Then GOD ſaid, <hi>IT is not good for Man to be alone, &amp;c.</hi> This ſhows the Defection was begun; becauſe at his firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation it was good, and very good; pronounced thus by GOD himſelf.</p>
            <p>Therefore to prevert (if poſſible) his falling into the beaſtial Life, or in caſe of the Completion of his Fall, to provide a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, GOD ſeparated the Female Part from him, formed a Woman, on whom he might place his Delight, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ignorant of the animal Life.</p>
            <p>But now the Drawing was grown ſo powerful that our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents could no longer reſiſt, but took the Fruit, eat of the ſame, and immediately their Eyes were opened; the Life of this World roſe up in them, and the divine Life was as ſoon extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>Their Souls loſt the Perfection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the divine Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,

the white Garment; and were ſhut up in Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Envy, Pride and Wrath; and their Bodies no longer lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, became groſs, dark, and beaſtial, filled with all Kinds of Luſts, and vicious Appetites: They were now fallen home to the World, had loſt all Dominion over the Creatures and Elements, and had the Mortification to find themſelves Slaves, where before they had been Lords.</p>
            <p>This their Fall was more deplorable than any Words can expreſs; Paradiſe was now hid from them; their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like Beaſts, and their Souls like fallen Angels. In this forlorn Condition they lay, without any Power at all to raiſe themſelves up, any more than Lucifer had to regain his loſt Glory.</p>
            <p>Now then let us ſee whether there was Fury in GOD; or any Alteration produced in the <hi>Deity</hi> by the Fall of Man.</p>
            <p>He came in the <hi>"Cool of the Day;"</hi> and after ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the State into which they had fallen, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the ſame, which were inevitable, and not arbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarily denounced; he proceeded to this Threatening, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Day break of the Gosſel, <hi>"And I will put En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if God had ſaid, "O thou envious Deſtroyer, doſt thou now imagine thou haſt overthrown my Purpoſe, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all my Deſigns?

            <p>This was a Promiſe full of the moſt important Realities and glorious Truths, upon the Suppoſition of the univerſal Reſtoration; but upon the common Syſtems, almoſt without any Meaning at all; for if but a few ſhall ever be made free from the Power of Sin, in what Senſe can it be ſaid, with Truth, that the Serpent's Head is bruiſed, or his Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed?</p>
            <p>This Promiſe was attended with the ſame divine Power, as when God ſaid to the dark Chaos of fallen Nature, <hi>"Let there be Light,"</hi> Light immediately came; ſo GOD no ſooner promiſed the Seed of the Woman as a Bruiſer of the Serpent,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017441_0007_0FA11F0FB49CFE80"/>
to the Parents of Mankind, but it was planted in their Breaſts, as a Spark of the divine Life: from which Moment <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Incarnation, and Man's Reſtoration was begun.</p>
            <p>Now every Man that comes into the World, feels in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Truth of his fallen, and Beginning of his reſtored State.</p>
            <p>All that Selfiſhneſs, Envy, Pride and Wrath that we feel, proves that we have the Nature of the Devil; and all thoſe Luſts, and ſenſual Appetites that tyrannize over us, prove to a Demonſtration that we have the Image and Life of the Beaſt; ſo alſo that ſomething which ſpeaks within, checks us for our Sins, ſeeks to turn us to God, call it what you will, Conſcience, or the Law written in the Heart, or Light of Nature, or whatever, it is the inſpoken Seed of the Woman, and the Effect of that Promiſe, as really as all the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we feel to ſin againſt God proceed from our fallen State.</p>
            <p>This is "the true Light that lightens every Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World." This is that immortal, "incorruptible Seed," of which we muſt be born, before we can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>For as we have loſt the Life of the Son, and Spirit of God, ſo no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing can bring us again into a State of Happineſs, but a Birth of the ſame raiſed up in us; by which we are created anew, and made the Sons of GOD, by having <hi>Chriſt</hi> formed in our Hearts, by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have this Rule given us in Scripture to know Spirits, and Teachers by, <hi>"Every Spirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh is of God: And every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh is not of God."</hi> 1 John 4.2, 3.</p>
            <p>They that cry, "Lo here is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or "lo there," are not to be regarded.</p>
            <p>All Deceivers of Mankind take this Way, they will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to perſuade you, that you can have no Salvation, but by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to their Inſtructions, adhering to their Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>iments, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Party, following their Modes, &amp;c. whereas <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Miniſters direct Man to that Seed of the Woman which is within; they ſeek to raiſe, or ſtir up that which is hidden there in Darkneſs. Thus <q>when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was demanded of the Phariſees, when the Kingdom of God ſhould come;</q> he anſwered them and ſaid, <q>The Kingdom of God cometh not with Obſervation. Neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or lo there; for behold the Kingdom of God is within you.</q> Luke xvii. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Here Chriſt himſelf called the Phariſees to behold that the Kingdom of God was within them; and if within thoſe who
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017441_0008_0FA11F107379B430"/>
are elſewhere called "Serpents and Vipers," and threatened with "the Damnation of Hell," then certainly in all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>This divine Seed is the only Beginning and Poſſibility of a new Life; and unleſs the Means of Grace can reach that hidden Spark, they can do us no Good. And it is alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that unleſs there was a Seed hidden in our Souls, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being raiſed up by the Power and Attraction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nothing from without could take any Effect upon us, or raiſe up the divine Life in us, any more than the Sun, Air, and Water of this World, could cauſe a Flint to vegetate, like a Corn of Wheat, or any other Seed. For as Vegetation is produced by the Power of the Elements attracting the Seed, which has their Nature ſhut up in it, and which longs to break forth out of a State of Confinement, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> raiſes up the divine Life, by attracting that in us which is an Emanation from him, and longs for his coming, as the impriſoned Seed, ſhut up in Death and Darkneſs, longs for the Influences of the Heavens to raiſe it up to Life.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee there is nothing arbitrary; all is natural throughout the whole Proceſs; nothing can riſe up but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Poſſibilities of Nature. If the beſt of Seed was ſown, and you ſhould cover it over with Stones, or hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, and then blame the Sun, becauſe it did not cauſe the ſame to ſpring up and grow; it would be a faint Picture of the Impiety of thoſe who blame the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that Salvation doth not come to them; for all that hinders the divine Life from ſpringing up in every Heart, is the Oppoſitions that are made to it, the Obſtructions that hinder it.</p>
            <p>Now as it is impoſſible for the Sun, Water, and Air, to raiſe up the beſt of Seed, if covered over with Mountains of Rocks, till they are removed or diſſolved; ſo we may account why all are not brought alike ſoon and eaſily to the State of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; it is becauſe of different Obſtructions that hinder. As in one Place <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not do many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works becauſe of their Unbelief; and at another Time ſaid, <hi>"How hardly ſhall they that have Riches enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>"It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely this implied more than common Difficulty, more than common Obſtacles to be removed!</p>
            <p>Herein ſtands the whole Foundation of the Goſpel; we have loſt the divine Life, and have raiſed up in ourſelves the Life of this World, by falling into the Spirit of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:017441_0009_0FA11F1132D74DF8"/>Now could GOD by an arbitrary Act have raiſed us up, he would have done it; he wanted not Love; but we had died to that Life, which we had from the Son of GOD, and opened in ourſelves the Life of the Beaſt; which of Neceſſity muſt be ſacrificed, deſtroyed, and ſlain, in order that the former ſhould riſe up in its primitive Perfection, and bring forth a Birth of itſelf within us. And thus we find and ſee the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Son of GOD's being an inſpoken Seed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man, going through all the Stages of our Life, from his Birth to his Death. It was that he might deſtroy the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the old Man in us, that he might raiſe up the new Man, or give us a Principle of Life divine, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as truly, and in as proper a Senſe our Father as <hi>Adam</hi> was.</p>
            <p>That as we received a fallen corrupt Nature from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo we might be made Partakers of a divine Nature from <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all the Diſpenſations of GOD under the Law, Prophets, or Goſpel, were calculated for the ſame Purpoſes; viz. that Sin might be manifeſted and deſtroyed, and the Life, or Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> might be revealed and reſtored.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> we read, <hi>"Moreover the Law entered that the Offence might abound;"</hi> that <hi>"it was added, becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come, to whom the Promiſe was made." &amp;c.</hi> Rom. v. 20. GaL iii. 19.</p>
            <p>All the Sacrifices ſlain, offered, conſumed and eaten, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the Neceſſity of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s taking our Nature upon him, and ſacrificing that Life which belonged to this World, which he overcame; and giving his ſpiritual Fleſh and Blood to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in us a new Life, and the Support of it, as really as we had derived an earthly beaſtial Life from <hi>Adam,</hi> which was ſupported with the Food produced by theſe Elements.</p>
            <p>The Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſhed for us, to deſtroy, by its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Efficacy, all the Evil in fallen Nature; a glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of which was ſeen when it was poured out; it cauſed the Rocks to ſplit, the Vail to be rent in twain, the Earth to quake, the Graves to open. Its Power over fallen Nature is increaſing every Day; this cauſes ſuch univerſal Commotions, and it will ſhake, and remove all Things that can be ſhaken, till all Nature ſhall be ſubject to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Evil be no more.</p>
            <p>Now we ſee the Neceſſity of the whole Proceſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> agreeable to the Scriptures, that <hi>"Foraſmuch as that Children are Partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took Part of the ſame, that through Death he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil."</hi> Heb. ii. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017441_0010_0FA11F11F4404C08"/>He went through every Stage of our Lives, overcame all the Evil in Nature in his own Body, that we through him might overcome all; he paſſed through Death, died out of the World into Paradiſe, as <hi>Adam</hi> died out of Paradiſe into the World; he poured out his Blood in the Gate of the ſecond Death, to break the Power of the ſame, that he might ſet the Priſoners free; and thus exactly reverſed all that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had done; that he might become the Fountain and Father of all his wretched Progeny, and reſtore to us all that we have loſt.</p>
            <p>Now the whole Proceſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from his becoming the inſpoken Word, or Seed of the Woman, till he ſhall reſign the Kingdom to the Father, is, and will be of Uſe to us, in theſe two Reſpects:</p>
            <p>Firſt, to deſtroy that Life of Fleſh and Blood, which cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and ſecondly, to raiſe up in us that divine Image, Righteouſneſs, or Life, that may ſit us to ſtand in his Preſence. The whole of Religion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained here; the one Thing needful is, to have the Proceſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> carried on in us, till we ſtand complete in that divine Nature which we derive from him. Here let us be willing to have the Fleſh of the natural Man poured out like D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng, and his Blood like Duſt, that we may be clothed with that Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which alone we can ſtand in the Preſence of the Lord.</p>
            <p>This, whether it be called the wedding Garment, the Houſe from Heaven, the fine Linen, the Righteouſneſs of Saints, the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Juſtification, or any other Name, is the ſame Thing; and is, when complete, the whole we need to make us happy; for though it is called by various Names, it no more intends different Things, than <hi>Chriſt</hi> is different from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or the Lamb of GOD, or the Bread of Life, or the Foundation Stone, or Saviour of the World; for all theſe Expreſſions are uſed of him, not to divide his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but to ſhow his Suitableneſs to our Needs.</p>
            <p>It would be well for Mankind if they would lay aſide all Strife about Words and Names, and attend wholly to this "one Thing needful," to have <hi>"Chriſt</hi> formed in them, the Hope of Glory." Perhaps ſome may think we ſet up ſomething within, in the Room of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as diſtinct from the Son of GOD, born of <hi>Mary</hi>; but that is as falſe a Suppoſition, as though any ſhould aſſert, that when I ſay, the Sun is in the Houſe, I mean ſomething diſtinct from the Sun in the Firmament; when they muſt know that I mean the Rays of that one Body that enlightens the whole

World, is the ſame in all Parts of it, the Whole to every Man, yet is but the ſame to all, in all, and for all; that ſhine every where freely, where it meets with no Obſtruction.</p>
            <p>Or if I was to ſay, There muſt be the Nature of Fire, Water and Air, in a Seed, in order to produce Vegetation or Growth; they ſhould imagine that I ſet up the Elements within, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from thoſe without it, when it would eaſily appear that I intended a Birth of the ſame.</p>
            <p>For if there was not the Nature of the Sun in the Grain, the Sun could not draw it up out of the earthly Part, leaving the Huſk to die in the Ground: Yet was not the Sun to ſhine ſo as to reach it with his Beams, it never could riſe up to Life.</p>
            <p>This ſhows plainly the Neceſſity of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming into the World, in order to raiſe up that Life which was loſt; by calling forth through his divine Influences, that Seed which he had planted in Man, which was an Emanation from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>So we may conſider the Seed of the Woman as <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether as inſpoken to <hi>Adam,</hi> manifeſted to <hi>Abraham,</hi> revealed to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, or born of <hi>Mary</hi>: In his Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Seſſion at GOD's right Hand, and Interceſſion there, he is carrying on the ſame work which he begun in <hi>Adam</hi>; and only differs from it, as the ſeveral Manifeſtations of the Sun, until it comes to the Meridian, differs from the firſt Break of Day. Therefore the Light of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Man is not ſomething diſtinct from divine Revelation, much leſs in Oppoſition to it; but is the Beginning of it, and ſtands in the ſame Need of farther Manifeſtations as the Breaking of Day does of the Riſing of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavored to make this Matter as plain as I can, that you may ſee the Beauty of the glorious Myſteries of our Redemption; and be led moſt earneſtly to deſire, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might riſe up within you as the Hope of Glory; raiſe up in you the loſt Image of GOD; deſtroy Sin out of your Souls, by bruiſing the Serpent's Head; and give you that Knowledge which is Life eternal.</p>
            <p>We find it is expreſsly aſſerted in the Text, "That the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head." Now as the Serpent's Head, or Power, is found in every Man, ſo it muſt be bruiſed in every Man, if ever theſe Words are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled.</p>
            <p>From hence follows the Doctrine of the final Reſtitution of all Things, which deſerves a particular Conſideration, as it has been for a long Time greatly clouded over with <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017441_0012_0FA11F1372BB55D0"/>
Darkneſs. Now to demonſtrate this Truth, wee need only inquire what the Deſign of God in creating finite Intelligences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s? Even the Aſſembly of Divines were ſo ſenſible that GOD's Deſign in creating finite Intelligences, could only be to make them eternally happy in the Enjoyment of himſelf; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in Anſwer to their firſt Queſtion, "What is the chief End of Man?" they ſay, "Man's chief End is to glorify God, and enjoy him for ever." A glorious End this; but which, according to them, is to be eternally fruſtrated, and never accompliſhed, except in a very few of the human Race. I ſhall therefore, for the Satisfaction of all ſerious Inquirers, treat a little of the final Subjection of all rebellious Beings; and of Conſequence, final Reſtoration of all lapſed Creatures. This Doctrine I ſhall prove from plain Scripture Arguments. GOD ſays, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xlv. 23. <hi>"I have ſworn by myſelf, the Word is gone out of my Mouth in Righteouſneſs, and ſhall not return, that unto me every Knee ſhall bow, and every Tongue ſhall ſwear."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we obſerve the Words, we ſhall find that GOD here promiſeth to bring all Creatures to return again to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; not one ſhall to all endleſs Eternity remain in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him; for ſwearing to him plainly ſuppoſes a hearty returning.</p>
            <p>Therefore if every Knee ſhall bow, and every Tongue ſhall ſwear, then not one ſhall remain to all Eternity in Oppoſition to GOD.</p>
            <p>But the firſt is true, therefore alſo the laſt.</p>
            <p>Thus as long as Rebellion againſt GOD laſts, Miſery muſt laſt alſo.</p>
            <p>But Rebellion againſt GOD will not laſt to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Neither then will Miſery laſt to all Eternity. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> lvii. 16, <hi>"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made."</hi> If GOD will not contend for ever, the Time muſt come when none ſhall ſtand in Oppoſition to him.</p>
            <p>But the firſt is true, therefore alſo the laſt.</p>
            <p>GOD gives this Reaſon why he will not be always wroth, becauſe he is the "Father of Spirits and the Creator of Souls." This Reaſon is univerſal without Exception, and equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards all intelligent Beings; and unleſs ſome can be found that are not created by GOD, none can be found that will be to all Eternity miſerable.</p>
            <p>But none can be found that are not the Creatures of GOD; therefore none can be eternally miſerable.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſure us in <hi>Philippians</hi> ii. 9, 10, 11. that <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:017441_0013_0FA11F1432BC2CA8"/>
becauſe of the Saviour's Sufferings, <hi>"hath given him a Name which is above every Name; that at the Name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>every Knee ſhould bow, of Things in Heaven, Things in Earth, and Things under the Earth: And that every Tongue ſhould confeſs that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is Lord to the glory and Praiſe of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whoever will conſider, that all in Heaven, on Earth, and under the Earth, ſhall bow and confeſs in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and for the ſame Purpoſe, muſt I think be convinced of the Truth of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Coloſſians</hi> i. 20. We read, <hi>"And having made peace through the Blood of his Croſs, by him to reconcile all Things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, by him I ſay whether they be things in Earth or Things in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we find all Things ſhall be reconciled to GOD again, by the Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Can any one doubt of this who has ever been reconciled himſelf? Then <hi>"every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, ſhall</hi> ſay <hi>Bleſſing, and Honor, and Glory, and Power, be unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb, forever and ever."</hi> Rev. v. 13.</p>
            <p>Here is no Exception of any one of the whole Creation; all join the univerſal Chorus, to praiſe GOD, and the Lamb. This is enough to convince any one that believes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the Truth of the univerſal Reſtoration of all Things. There are a Number of Paſſages which ſhow that there will be a Time when Death ſhall be deſtroyed, ſwallowed up in Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, loſe his Sting, &amp;c. ſuch are <hi>Iſaih,</hi> xxv. 3. <hi>Hoſea,</hi> xiii. 14. I. <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 22—29, 54, 55, 56. <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 4, 5. Theſe five ſtrong and plain Paſſages prove that even Death, the laſt Enemy, ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Now if the laſt Enemy ſhall be deſtroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there ſhall not be one left.</p>
            <p>But the firſt is true, therefore alſo the laſt.</p>
            <p>It would be very abſurd to ſay, "The laſt Enemy is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but many Millions ſhall remain to all Eternity."</p>
            <p>Now while Creatures are unreconciled to GOD, they are his Enemies; but the Time will come when he ſhall not have one Enemy remaining. Therefore all Creatures ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
            <p>If all Creatures ſhall be finally reconciled, all ſhall be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored.</p>
            <p>But the firſt is true, therefore alſo the laſt.</p>
            <p>While Sin remains in Being, Death will be able to ſhew his Sting; but the Time will come when Death ſhall have no Sting to boaſt of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017441_0014_0FA11F14F31FC4C0"/>Therefore Sin ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And to this agree the Words of Scripture, as it is written, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 8. <hi>"For this Purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil,"</hi> Unleſs <hi>Chriſt</hi> final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroys the Works of the Devil, even all Sin out of the Univerſe, his Purpoſe muſt be eternally fruſtrated:</p>
            <p>But the laſt can never be: Therefore the firſt is true.</p>
            <p>We read <hi>Romans</hi> v. 20. <hi>"But where Sin abounded, Grace did much more abound,"</hi> l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is evident that Sin has abounded to the Deſtruction of all Men: Now if Grace abounds more, it is evident that all muſt be at laſt reſtored thereby; otherwiſe there is no Shadow of Truth in the Words.</p>
            <p>Therefore if Grace ſhall abound more than Sin, it muſt be as extenſive, and more powerful:</p>
            <p>But the firſt is true, therefore the laſt alſo.</p>
            <p>Now if all are not reſtored, it muſt be owing either to the Want of Will, or Power, in the Deity to reſtore them; but none can deny his Will without contradicting <hi>St. Paul,</hi> i. <hi>Timothy</hi> ii. 1 to 7. and many other plain Paſſages: And who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are ſay, that his Power and Wiſdom are not ſufficient to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his Purpoſes? Some <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed ſay, GOD is able, but it is not his Will; others ſuppoſe, nay affirm, that he is willing, yea willeth the Reſtoration of all; and yet it never ſhall be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Ideas of the Deity are highly diſhonoring to GOD; both pave the Way to Infidelity, and Atheiſm; nor is it to be wondered at, that ſo many renounce Religion altogether, when they hear ſuch contradictory Accounts of it, from its profeſſed Friends and Advocates.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be GOD, there is no Contradiction in the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is his Will to reſtore all again to himſelf, and he has Power to effect it:</p>
            <p>Therefore it ſhall be done.</p>
            <p>I have the Pleaſure to find that Writers, and Diſputers againſt <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> have never entered into the Grounds of it; and conſequently have never underſtood it. They have only fought in general againſt a GOD in whom Fury was to be found, and who made his Creatures with a determinate Purpoſe to damn them to all Eternal Ages; and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed their evil Actions, that he might have a Colour of Right to condemn them.</p>
            <p>They have fought againſt Original Sin, becauſe they never underſtood any Thing more about it than that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin was imputed to all his Children; and they condemned for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though they had been the real Actors. As for Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017441_0015_0FA11F15B5145548"/>
they have never underſtood it in any other Light than an arbitrary Infliction upon the Sinner, by the Deity; inſtead of being as natural a Conſequence of Sin, as Pain is of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Bones.</p>
            <p>The Atonement of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they have rejected, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the leaſt of its Deſign: Oh, would they but conſider that the Scripture never repreſents it as intended to quench, or put out, a Wrath that was riſen in the Deity; but to break the Power of Death in us, and overcome the Wrath of fallen Nature; to raiſe a new Life in our Souls, and bring both fallen Nature and Creatures back into their firſt State of Purity and Perfection! If they underſtood the Matter thus, they could never fight againſt the glorious Doctrine of Atonement by the precious Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without which we never could have been raiſed to GOD, any more than a Rock, while its Hardneſs remains, can riſe into Aether. The ſame Reaſon that a hard Rock cannot expand itſelf, becauſe it is ſhut up in its own Darkneſs, Groſsneſs, and Hardneſs, until it is melted or diſſolved, may be given why our Souls, filled with Sin, and ſhut up in Death and Darkneſs, are by no Means able to riſe to GOD, until that State of Death in which we are ſhut up, is diſſolved. Now the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is able, and will finally diſſolve all Hardneſs in Nature; and quench all Wrath in Creatures. It was evident when the Saviour died, that his Blood had a phyſical Power over Nature, by the Effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, in cauſing the Earth to ſhake, the Rocks to rend, and the Graves to open. This phyſical Virtue of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> prevails more and more, and will prevail through the Ages of Ages, until all tormenting Envy, ſelfiſh Wills, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn Pride, fiery Wrath, Darkneſs, Groſsneſs, Death, and Hardneſs, ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>Oh, that all the <hi>Deiſts</hi> would attend to what is within their own Breaſts! There lies the Truth of all I have advanced. There they might feel their own undone State, and there they might find the Seed of the Woman.</p>
            <p>I would no more adviſe them to read over all that has been written on both Sides, in Order to be convinced of the Truth of the Reality of Religion, than I would adviſe them to go on a Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> I would adviſe them to be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to feel their Want and Miſery, and to hunger and thirſt after that Deliverance which the Goſpel brings.</p>
            <p>The Righteouſneſs of Faith ſaith, <hi>"Say not in thine Heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? That is to bring down</hi> Chriſt <hi>from above. Or who ſhall deſcend into the Deep? That is to bring up</hi> Chriſt <hi>again from the Dead. But what ſaith it? The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017441_0016_0FA11F167253CDE8"/>
Word is nigh thee even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that is the Word of Faith which we preach."</hi> According to this glorious Plan, we may call Sinners, in the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to turn to GOD; but according to the common Plan, the Good News which <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded to be preached to every Creature, is Mockery, Inſult, and Inſincerity. It is as if I ſhould ſay to a Thouſand Criminals under Sentence of Death, "I have the moſt charming News to proclaim to you all; Which is, that ten of you are to be reprieved, and all the reſt are to ſuffer, without the leaſt Chance of Remedy, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe." I only aſk what they might be ſuppoſed to think of me and my inſulting Declaration? Would they not judge that I came on purpoſe to aggravate their Miſery, by firſt raiſing their Expectations with a Falſhood, and then deſtroying all their Hopes by the Truth? In ſuch a Caſe, an inſulting Liar, would be the beſt Name I could deſerve. Now, ſuppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not die for all Men; can any Perſon tell me what <hi>"Good News"</hi> can poſſibly be proclaimed to every one, without they will call endleſs Damnation <hi>"Good News!"</hi> For this muſt be all the good News, and glad Tidings of great Joy, that can be publiſhed to them for whom the <hi>Saviour</hi> did not die!</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be the Lord, we are aſſured the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was for all without Exception.</p>
            <p>And indeed whoever conſiders a Moment, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> could die for all, as eaſily as for one, muſt think that he did not limit his Death to one in a Thouſand, or a ſmall Part of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>Let every one therefore "ſeek the <hi>Lord</hi> while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near;" and ſeriouſly apply to him. "who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to GOD through him;" "who will have all Men to be reſtored, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth: For there is one GOD, and one Mediator between GOD and Man, the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due Time."</p>
            <p>I have not at this Time entered largely into the Arguments for the univerſal Reſtoration, having ſeveral Times treated profeſſedly upon the Subject: Neither have I here attempted to anſwer the Objections commonly made to it, having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them in a former Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The Glorious Doctrine is built upon the following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which muſt be proved to be falſe, before it can be overthrown:</p>
            <p n="1">I. GOD is Love, eſſentially, and communicatively, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017441_0017_0FA11F1874432680"/>
loves all the Beings he hath made, conſidered as his Creatures, and is conſtantly ſeeking to do them Good.</p>
            <p n="2">II. GOD's Deſign in creating intelligent Beings, was to make them happy in the Knowledge and Love of his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfections.</p>
            <p n="3">III. GOD's abſolute ultimate Deſigns cannot be eternally fruſtrated.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for all; and died not in vain.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to deſtroy the evil Principle, or Sin out of the Univerſe, which he will finally effect; and then Miſery ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>Here are the Merits of the Cauſe; theſe Propoſitions are ſome of them ſelf evident, and the others admit of the fulleſt Demonſtration, or Scripture Proof: and till theſe the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Principles are overthrown, all Attempts againſt the Doctrine are vain.</p>
            <p>Glory to GOD in the higheſt, we believe the Time will come when <hi>Chriſt</hi> "ſhall ſee of the Travel of his Soul and be ſatisfied;" when the Serpent's Head ſhall be bruiſed;" "all Things put under the Feet of the Mediator;" and finally, "the Kingdom delivered up to the Father, that GOD may be ALL IN ALL." "For of HIM, and through HIM, and to HIM, are ALL THINGS. To whom be GLORY for ever. AMEN."</p>

               <p>THERE are a Number of Objections made to the glorious Doctrine of the Reſtoration of all Things, which I ſhall endeavour to anſwer, in the Fear of the Lord, according to the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The firſt, and one of the moſt principal Objections, is taken from the Words everlaſting and eternal being uſed as well for the Miſery of the Wicked as for the Happineſs of the Righteous; as in the following Paſſages:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> xxxiii. 14. The Sinners in Zion are afraid, Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs hath ſurpriſed the Hypocrites. Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring Fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel,</hi> xii. 2. And many of them that ſleep in the Duſt of the Earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting Life, and ſome to Shame <hi>and</hi> everlaſting Contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthew,</hi> xviii 8. Wherefore, if thy Hand or thy Foot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee cut them off, and caſt <hi>them</hi> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into Life halt or maimed, rather than having two Hands or two Feet, to be caſt into everlaſting Fire.</p>
               <p>xxv. 41. Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left Hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</p>
               <p>46. And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment, but the Righteous into Life eternal.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jude,</hi> 6, 7. And the Angels which kept not their firſt Eſtate, but left their own Habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting Chains under Darkneſs unto the Judgment of the great Day. Even as Sodom, and Gomorrha, and the Cities about them in like Manner giving themſelves over to Fornication, and going after ſtrange Fleſh, are ſet forth for an Example, ſuffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</p>
               <p>Theſe eight Paſſages are all that I remember where the Word everlaſting or eternal is uſed for the Continuance of the Miſery of fallen Creatures.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall not cavil as ſome do, pretending that Sins, and not Perſons, are intended by the wicked ones; nor as others, who would inſinuate, that everlaſting or eternal only ſets forth the Nature of the Fire, and not the Continuance of Miſery. Both theſe Notions are mere Subterfuges, not worthy of any Attention. I ſhall therefore anſwer the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken from theſe Paſſages, by an equal Number, where the Word is uſed for Times and Things which are not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Every one who reads the Scripture muſt know that the Word forever intends an Age, Period, or Eternity, as may be ſeen by the following Paſſages; which let any one take the Bible and read, and they will ſee it as plain as the Sun.</p>

               <p>Theſe Paſſages ſhow that nothing can be concluded from the Word forever in Favor of endleſs Torments, ſince here are more than threeſcore Paſſages where it is uſed for a limited Time, beyond Contradiction; and many more might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if neceſſary. This obviates a ſecond Objection taken from the Words forever and ever, which are uſed in ſeveral Places for the Continuance of the Torments of the Damned.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Rev</hi> xiv. 11. And the Smoke of their Torment aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth up forever and ever; and they have no Reſt Day nor Night, who worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Now theſe Words do by no Means prove Damnation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

End; for I am able to produce an equal Number of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages where the ſame Expreſſions are uſed for Periods, which muſt have an End.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxlviii. 6. He hath alſo eſtabliſhed them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever; he hath made a Decree which ſhall not paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxx. 8. Now go, write it before them in a Table, and note it in a Book, that it may be for the Time to come forever and ever.</p>
               <p>Forever and ever it might endure; but not to all eternal Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jerem.</hi> vii. 7. Then will I cauſe you to dwell in this Place, in the Land that I gave to your Fathers, forever and ever.</p>
               <p>But not ſurely to all Eternity, or while God himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>! Therefore if forever means a Period, Age, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as has been ſhown by more than ſixty Paſſages, then forever and ever muſt mean Ages, Periods, Eternities, or Ages of Ages; as is clearly ſhewn by the forecited Texts.</p>
               <p>Thus if any would ſuppoſe that the Words forever and ever mean any more than the ſimple Word forever, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d; but then that overthrows the Notion of their intending infinite Duration; for if forever and ever contain more than forever, then ſurely more in ſome Proportion, and if in any Proportion, then both intend limited Duration: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ugh both forever and forever and ever are ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Things which being unchangeable in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e can have no End, as the Being and Perfections of God; yet their being ſometimes applied to thoſe Things which by a Neceſſity or Nature muſt endure to all Eternity, does by no Means alter the proper Signification of thoſe Words.</p>
               <p>Therefore it muſt be very abſurd to ſuppoſe that when the Words forever and ever are uſed in ſome Places of Scripture, reſpecting Times and Things which other Paſſages aſſure us muſt end, that the bare Uſe of thoſe Words alters the Nature of Things, and contradicts the other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Now though the Paſſages before mentioned, intimate that Pain, Sorrow, and the ſecond Death ſhall laſt forever and ever, yet there are many other Places in Scripture that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the Time ſhall come when theſe ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxv. 8. He will ſwallow up Death in V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away Tears from off all Faces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoſea</hi> xiii. 14. I will ranſom them from the Power of the Grave; I will redeem from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plagues; O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction: Repentance ſhall be hid from mine Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:017441_0039_0FA11D98B22DDB10"/>I <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 26. The laſt Enemy <hi>that</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>is</hi> Death.</p>
               <p>54<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then ſhall be brought to paſs the Saying that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Death is ſwallowed up in Victory.</p>
               <p>55. O Death where <hi>is</hi> thy Sting? O Grave (or Hell) where <hi>is</hi> thy Victory.</p>
               <p>56. The Sting of Death <hi>is</hi> Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 14. Foraſmuch then as the Children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took Part of the ſame; that through Death he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 4. And God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there ſhall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither ſhall there be any more Pain: for the former Things are paſſed away.</p>
               <p>From all theſe Paſſages, and many others, it is plain that all that bears the Name of Death ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>Therefore, in order to make theſe Scriptures conſiſtent one with another, we muſt allow the Words <hi>forever and ever</hi> to intend certain Periods, or Ages of Ages, which muſt have an End.</p>
               <p>A third Objection is taken from thoſe Words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> xii. 31. Wherefore I ſay unto you, All Manner of Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto Men; but the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto Men.</p>
               <p>32. And whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Son of Man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this World, (Age or Period) neither in the <hi>World</hi> to come.</p>
               <p>Here the Enemies of the glorious Reſtoration pretend to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; but with how little Reaſon ſhall be left to the candid Reader.</p>
               <p>It is plain and evident that our Saviour meant to ſet forth <hi>that</hi> Sin as more terrible in its Conſequences than any other. But according to the common Opinion, that all who die in Sin, even the Heathen, ſhall be puniſhed to all Eternity, without a Poſſibility of Releaſe, there is Nothing more to be feared from dying in that Sin than any other.</p>
               <p>All Writers acknowledge that the Loſs of GOD is the greateſt Part of Hell Torments; but this all muſt ſuffer who are baniſhed from the Preſence of the Lord alike (according to the common Syſtems); and if this is to continue to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it reduces this Sin, and the Miſery attending it, to a Level with the Sin of an idle Word; which deſtroys all Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017441_0040_0FA11D9973C2D2F0"/>
and Juſtice, and makes Nonſenſe of the terrible Doom the dear Redeemer denounces againſt thoſe who ſin the Sin unto Death.</p>
               <p>This Paſſage, upon a Suppoſition that it contradicts the Univerſal Reſtoration, proves more than the Objectors are willing to acknowledge; for it declares a Poſſibility, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, if not a Certainty, that all other Sins may and ſhall be forgiven, either in this World, or Age, or in the World, or Age to come; or elſe why is the World (or Age) to come mentioned?</p>
               <p>If we compare the ſeveral Paſſages which ſpeak of this dreadful Sin together, ſuch as <hi>Matt.</hi> xii. 31, 32. <hi>Mark</hi> iii. 28, 29, 30. <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4, 5, 6. x. 26,—to 31.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 1.—I. <hi>John</hi> v. 16. We ſhall find that it is a different Sin from all others; being a direct, wilful, malicious, contumacious, continued Oppoſition to divine Love, and to all the Methods of Reſtoration which in the preſent World can be uſed: and of Conſequence ſuch muſt know by ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, what it is to have their Part with the Devil, and his Angels, the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone; which is the ſecond Death.</p>
               <p>And this will not only laſt while the World to come, or Millennium laſts, but even after that, for an Age of Ages, or Ages of Ages (for ſuch our Saviour has declared, are in Danger of eternal Damnation). Not becauſe the Lord is not willing to reſtore them ſooner, but becauſe they have gone ſo deep into Sin, that it will require a long and ſevere Proceſs to reclaim them.</p>
               <p>But as the Time muſt come when all ſhall be ſubject to Chriſt, and he ſhall deſtroy Death the laſt Enemy, by deſtroying Sin, which is the Sting of Death; ſo this Sin as well as Others ſhall be no more. For if this was not to be the Caſe it never could be true that "where Sin abounded Grace did much more abound;" for it never would abound quite ſo much. Neither would Death and Hell be ſilent when God ſhall aſk the grand Queſtion. "O Death where is thy Sting? O Grave (or Hell) where is thy Victory?" For Death could ſay, "Here is my Sting, <hi>that</hi> Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which muſt endure to all Eternity, and which even divine Grace ſhall never deſtroy; I have therefore the Victory and Dominion over theſe, and will hold it, while God himſelf remains."</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Death could never be deſtroyed, nor ſwallowed up in Victory:</hi> neither would <hi>Sorrow, crying,</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi> ceaſe: neither could God ever be <hi>All in all</hi>; in any other Senſe with reſpect to them than he is now: nor would <hi>every Tongue ſwear</hi>: neither
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017441_0041_0FA11D9A31C0BD78"/>
                  <hi>all Things</hi> ever be <hi>made new</hi>: The Univerſal Chorus of Praiſe could never be ſung by <hi>every Creature in Heaven, on Earth, and under the Earth:</hi> And finally the Scriptures would never be entirely fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Conſequences that follow, only from the Suppoſition that ſome ſhall remain God's Enemies to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; what dreadful Conſequences muſt then be drawn from that Doctrine, that teaches that almoſt all the human Race will remain in Oppoſition to God, under the Power of Sin and Death while God himſelf endures?</p>
               <p>Either God created his Creatures to be miſerable to all Eternity; or will be fruſtrated eternally in his Deſigns; or all muſt be at laſt reſtored, and made happy by Love, and free Love.</p>
               <p>The firſt is blaſphemous, the ſecond is diſhonorable to God; therefore the third muſt be true: for a fourth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cannot be thought upon.</p>
               <p>A fourth Objection is taken from the Words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour concerning <hi>Judas, Matt.</hi> xxvi. 24. <hi>Mark</hi> xiv. 21.</p>
               <p>"The Son of Man indeed goeth as it is written of him; but Wo to that Man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! good were it for that Man if he had never been born."</p>
               <p>The Argument from theſe Words is framed after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
               <p>"If Judas was not to be damned to all Eternity, how could the Saviour ſay, Good were it for that Man if he had never been born?"</p>
               <p>This is at beſt but a weak Argument, however as I never mean to evade any Thing that has a Colour of Reaſon, I ſhall anſwer it from the Scriptures of Truth. Note, A Man may have a Being, and be happy, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We have a Number of Inſtances in the Scripture where light Afflictions (compared with the Damnation of Hell) cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever good Men to wiſh they had never been born. <hi>Job</hi> is noted for the moſt patient Man; and yet he not only curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe Day in which he was born, but the Night in which it was ſaid, "There is a Man Child conceived." And yet great as his Afflictions were, they were trifling to the Torments of the Damned. He wiſhes over and over again that he had never been born. Read the whole of the Second Chapter, and ſee how far he exceeds the Expreſſions of Chriſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judas; alſo Chap. x. 18, 19. and if you are not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to remain ignorant, you will ſee that <hi>Job</hi> thought that

               </p>
               <p>Another Inſtance is that of the good Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>; who when he met with a little outward Trouble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Curſed <hi>be</hi> the Man who brought Tidings to my Father, ſaying, A Man Child is born unto thee, making him very glad. And let that Man be as the Cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the Cry in the Morning and the Shouting at Noon Tide; becauſe he ſlew me not from the Womb; or that my Mother might have been my Grave, and her Womb <hi>to be</hi> always great <hi>with me.</hi> Wherefore came I forth out of the Womb to ſee Labour and Sorrow, that my Days ſhould be conſumed with Shame?" (See <hi>Jer.</hi> xv. 10, and xx. 14, to the End of the Chapter.) Here we may ſee by theſe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that Men of the beſt of Characters, when in outward Trouble, ſaid much more of themſelves than our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Judas</hi>; they curſed the Day of their Birth, in the bittereſt Manner: And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> even curſed the Man who brought Tidings of the ſame to his Father. While <hi>Jeſus</hi> only ſaid, "Good were it for that Man if he had never been born." And who does not ſee that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpoke with great Propriety, and Compaſſion too, concerning <hi>Judas</hi>? Thus Nothing can be concluded from our Saviour's Words, on that melancholy Occaſion, in Favour of endleſs Torments.</p>
               <p>For who among Men would not chuſe rather never to have been born, than to have betrayed the dear Redeemer? And if both <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wiſhed they had never been born, becauſe they met with a little Sorrow and Trouble, with how much greater Propriety did <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeak when he ſaid, "Good were it for that Man if he had never been born!"</p>
               <p>But I am aware that ſome will ſay, "Though <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> curſed the Days of their Birth, yet that is no real Proof that any Thing leſs than Damnation without End is a ſufficient Reaſon for any to chooſe rather never to have been born than to ſuffer it; and though they in their Anger ſaid, they would they had died in the Womb, yet that an untimely Birth upon the whole cannot be preferable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o any State ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of endleſs Miſery." To which I anſwer, <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:017441_0043_0FA11D9C72393D20"/>
the wiſeſt of Mortals, and one under the immediate Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, was of a very different Mind, for he ſays, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> vi. 3—6, "If a Man beget an hundred <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and live many Years, ſo that the Days of his Years be many, and his Soul be not filled with Good, and alſo <hi>that</hi> he have no Burial; I ſay <hi>that</hi> an untimely Birth <hi>is</hi> better than he: For he (the untimely Birth) cometh in with Vanity, and departeth in Darkneſs, and his Name ſhall be covered with Darkneſs. Moreover he hath not ſeen the Sun, nor known <hi>any Thing</hi>: this hath more Reſt than the other. Yea though he live a thouſand Years twice <hi>told,</hi> yet hath he ſeen no Good."</p>
               <p>Here is a State infinitely better than that of Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (though limited by certain Periods) to which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Birth is preferred.</p>
               <p>Here it is ſuppoſed, nay affirmed, that if a Man lived two thouſand Years, and begat an hundred Children, and yet had not his Soul filled with Good, and eſpecially had no Honor in his Death, being denied a Burial, that it would have been better for him never t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So had <hi>Judas</hi> never been born, he would have been at Reſt; even with Kings and Counſellors of the Earth, &amp;c. where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the weary are at Reſt. See <hi>Job,</hi> ii. 13, 14, 17.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The next Objection is taken from the Words of <hi>Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> "Mark</hi> ix. 43—49. And if thy Hand offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into Life maimed, than having two Hands to go into Hell, into the Fire that never ſhall be quenched: Where their Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched."</p>

And if thine Eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the Kingdom of God with one Eye, than having two Eyes, to be caſt into Hell Fire: Where their Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched." See alſo <hi>Matt.</hi> v. 29, 30. xviii. 8, 9. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> lxvi. 24.</p>
               <p>The Objection from theſe Words is thus formed, "If the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017441_0044_0FA11D9D32714CB0"/>
Worm dieth not, and the Fire be never quenched, then the Miſery of the Wicked ſhall endure to all Eternity." To which I anſwer, that the Expreſſions of the Fire that never ſhall be quenched, ſuppoſe that it burns perpetually, without Intermiſſion, or Ceſſation, the whole of the Age or Period for which it laſts, or until it has conſumed all that is in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it, but by no Means to all Eternity; ſince there may be produced a Number of Texts where the ſame Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are uſed of Fires that have gone out long ago. And indeed the very Nature of Things teaches, that Fire can give Pain no longer than it meets with Contrariety, nor burn any more when all Combuſtibles are conſumed. So that when theſe Words occur, "the Fire ſhall never be quenched" we may underſtand, that it ceaſes not during the Period aſſigned for it, or that it ſhall accompliſh the Deſign for which it is kindled. Thus we read in <hi>Lev.</hi> vi. 13. "The Fire ſhall ever be burning upon the Altar: it ſhall never go out." Now this is expreſſed much ſtronger than though it had been ſaid, "It never ſhall be quenched," for it is declared," it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall go out." Yet will any one ſay that it is burning ſtill, when the Altar and Sacrifices are long ago aboliſhed? Or can we ſuppoſe that God meant to command the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep the Fire burning on the Altar to all Eternity, or only while the ceremonial Diſpenſation laſted?</p>

                  </gap>ave whither thou goeſt." To which ſome add, "There is no Repentance in the Grave." A Paſſage no where to be found to the Bible, and which, if it could be found, would be Nothing to the Purpoſe. If the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:017441_0047_0FA11D9F71D5D7D0"/>
Text quoted proves any Thing againſt the Reſtoration, it proves as much againſt the Immortality of the Soul; for if there is "no Knowledge, nor Wiſdom," among the Souls departed, there can neither be Happineſs nor Miſery; and conſequently the Soul dies with the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo ſays (Ver. 5. of this ſame Chapter) "The Dead know not any Thing; neither have they any more a Reward; for the Memory of them is forgotten." What Work ſhould we be obliged to make of the Reſt of the Bible, if we were to explain this of the State of Souls departed? We muſt deny their Senſibility, and all Rewards, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as well as the Day of Judgment. But explain it of the State of the Body, and all appears eaſy; and then it will be manifeſt, that it militates nothing againſt the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Another Objection (ſtill weaker than the former) is taken from chap. xi. 3, "And if the Tree fall toward the South, or toward the North; in the Place where the Tree falleth, there it ſhall be."</p>
               <p>To which many add "As Death leaves, ſo Judgement finds." A Sentence not to be found in all the ſacred Writings, and if theſe Words were to be found, they would prove No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the Reſtoration. It is indeed very ſurpriſing that People will hang on ſuch ſlender Things! I have heard People as poſitive as of their Being that they could find theſe Expreſſions in the Word of God, "There is no Repentance in the Grave; as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment will find us:" and many other Paſſages which cannot be found, and if they could, would not anſwer their Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As for that Text, "And if the Tree fall, &amp;c." it belongs not at all to the Matter in Hand, neither one Way nor the other; but if it did, it would be ſo far from being a Proof againſt the Reſtoration, that it would be in Favour of it; for a Tree lies not long as it falls; but is either cut up and framed for Uſe, or burned in the Fire, and turned again to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whence it ſprung, or ſoon moulders away, and comes to its firſt Matter again, and will, with the Reſt of the Earth be brought back into the cryſtal Sea before the Throne. I ſhould not have ſaid ſo much upon theſe Paſſages, as they are nothing to the Purpoſe, if they were not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally urged as Objections to the Reſtoration; though without any Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Another (and ſomething of a plauſible) Objection is taken from <hi>Job.</hi> xxxvi. 18, "Becauſe <hi>there is</hi> Wrath, <hi>beware</hi> leſt he take thee away with his Stroke; then a great Ranſom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver thee."</p>

"As for thee alſo, by the Blood of the Covenant I have ſent forth thy Priſoners out of the Pit wherein <hi>is</hi> no Water." We believe that the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and is ſtrong enough to break the Power of Sin, Death, and Hell.</p>
               <p>By the Ranſom ſpoken of in the Text, we may underſtand Strength, Riches, Wiſdom, &amp;c. as it is explained in the 19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That he ſhould ſtill live for ever, <hi>and</hi> ſee Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." From all which, carefully compared with the Reſt of Scripture, we find the meaning of the Words to be, that a great Sum, or Ranſom, cannot deliver from the Stroke of Death. This we know to be true; but nothing in this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage tends to depreciate the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor to ſhow that it cannot be effectual to loſt Souls.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of the rich Man is frequently brought to prove that Miſery will endure to all Eternity. It is ſaid by ſome, that "as he was denied a Drop of Water, it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that his Sufferings will ever have an End." To this it may be anſwered, that it was neceſſary and right that he ſhould have "Judgment without Mercy, who ſhewed no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>James</hi> ii. 13." and be deprived of every Senſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in Order that be might come to feel his Miſery, and ſubmit to the Saviour: but Nothing can be concluded from hence againſt the Reſtoration, ſince it is ſaid, <hi>Zech.</hi> iv. 11, "As for thee alſo, by the Blood of thy Covenant I have ſent forth thy Priſoners out of the Pit wherein <hi>is</hi> no Water."</p>
               <p>Now there cannot be ſuch a Place in this Life or World; there is always ſome Cordial in the moſt bitter Cup; therefore the Pit where no Water is, muſt be Hell itſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls Hell "A Furnace of Fire," <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. 42, 50. Golden Ore is thrown into the Furnace to be melted, and refined, not deſtroyed or annihilated; as it is caſt there to be purified by Fire, it is well known that no Water muſt come to it during the Seaſon of its Refinement, even though it ſhould be intended finally to make Veſſels to hold Water; for if one was to quench or mitigate the Fire, it would tend to

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt plauſible Objection in the Inſtance of the rich Man is taken from thoſe Words, <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 26, "And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines all this, between us and you there is a great Gulph fixed; ſo that they which would paſs from hence to you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: neither can they paſs to us that <hi>would come</hi> from thence."</p>
               <p>This Gulph is Sin, or the Want of the New Birth, without which no Man can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. It is evident therefore that there was a whole Birth between them, and as it is impoſſible for any to go into Miſery or Pain that are perfectly holy, ſo alſo for any to enter into Happineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are free from Sin, and become as pure as Light it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>This concludes Nothing againſt the final Reſtoration, but ſhews it muſt be effected by a new Birth of the divine Life produced in every one.</p>
               <p>The rich Man ſeems not to have loſt the Spark of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, nor the immortal Seed, ſince he earneſtly deſired that "his Brethren might not come into the Place of Torment where he was." This ſhows him not to have been ſo loſt to Virtue as Satan, ſince the Devil and his Angels, though mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable themſelves, ſeek to make all Men ſo too, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it increaſes their Torment. Add to all this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> calls the rich Man "Son," and puts him in Mind of the Difference between him and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in their Lives, and the Reaſonableneſs of the preſent different States they were in, and I think it will appear that Nothing can be concluded from his Caſe in Favour of Damnation without End. For in Caſe that he was to be puniſhed to all eternal Ages, there could be no Kind of Proportion between the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Torments, and evil Things of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and thoſe Things which he endured; whereas it is intimated, that all are dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"And that Servant which knew his Lord's Will, and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not <hi>himſelf,</hi> neither did according to his Will, ſhall be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with MANY <hi>Stripes.</hi> But he that knew not, and did commit Things wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Or how could either be ſaid to have FEW, if there was never to be an End? Impoſſible! <hi>Rev.</hi> xviii. 7. "How much ſhe (Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon)
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017441_0050_0FA11DA28D06BF50"/>
hath glorified herſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much Torment and Sorrow give her." All here appears equal and juſt; but to ſuppoſe a poor ignorant Heathen, or a Child of fourteen, dying in his Sins, will be in Miſery as long as the moſt wicked perſecuting Tyrant, or Apoſtate <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> contradicts all the Ideas we have of Juſtice, Goodneſs, or Equity; and tends directly to Infidelity. For who can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in this Caſe, that every Man is rewarded according to his Works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <hi>Matt.</hi> xix. 24, <hi>Mark</hi> x. 25, <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 25, "It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</p>
               <p>This implies the greateſt Difficulty imaginable, nay with Men an utter Impoſſibility; yet we are expreſsly aſſured "it is poſſible with God, to whom all Things are poſſible." Now did any of us ever know a Man that paſſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ough greater Difficulty here than it would be for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle? Which yet a rich Man muſt paſs through before be can enter into the Kingdom of God. He is therefore made to paſs through it, either here, or hereafter; and this, though impoſſible to Men, is poſſible with God. Thus though it was as impoſſible for the rich Man to paſs from Pain to Bliſs, from Torment to Paradiſe, as for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, yet it is by no Means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to deliver him, and make good that Promiſe to him in due Time; "I will give unto him that is athirſt of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely." <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 6.</p>
               <p>Then, when he and thoſe like him "come out of great Tribulation," even the ſecond Death, "they ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more:—For the Lamb which is in the Midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living Fountains of Waters: and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes." <hi>Rev.</hi> vii 14, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>When Sin is deſtroyed, the Gulph ſhall be no more; ſo while the Gulph remains it is impaſſab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another Objection is taken from thoſe Paſſages of Scripture, where God is repreſented as ſwearing in his Wrath, that the Unbelievers ſhall not enter into his Reſt. Such as <hi>Pſalm</hi> xcv.

               </p>
               <p>By the Reſt that was promiſed to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which they forfeited by their Unbelief, we muſt underſtand the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not future Happineſs. For who can ſuppoſe that out of ſix hundred thouſand Men, beſides Women, only two entered into Paradiſe at Death! Then, were but two who entered into <hi>Canaan, Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who fallowed the Lord fully: and even <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were denied that Favour; but who will ſuppoſe that they did not enter into Paradiſe? The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of the milennial Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which they who are Over-comers ſhall reign with him on his Throne. "There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth therefore a Reſt (or keeping of Sabbath) to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God." <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 9. This Sabbath (pointed out by the ſeventh Day Sabbath) intends the "thouſand Years that <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall be bound, and the Kingdoms of the World ſhall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his <hi>Chriſt."</hi> Into this Kingdom none ſhall enter who are fearful, and unbelieving; but ſuch as follow the Lord fully.</p>
               <p>But as this Matter is very plain, I ſhall not add any more at preſent upon it.</p>
               <p>Another Objection is taken from our Saviour's Words <hi>John</hi> ix. 4. "I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me while it is Day: the Night cometh when no Man can work."</p>
               <p>But I cannot ſee how this affects the Controverſy at all, and without it can be ſhown wherein it is to the Purpoſe, no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer need be given. It is readily granted, that Bodies in the Grave are incapable of Action; but this by no Means affects the State of Souls departed, who are capable of Thought, Volition and Action. None can ſuppoſe our Saviour's Soul lay ſenſeleſs while his Body was dead; but this muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, before the Paſſage will appear to be any Thing to the Purpoſe it is brought for.</p>
               <p>It is certain that there are many Works which we may do while we live, that we cannot after Death; ſuch as feeding the Hungry, clothing the Naked, relieving the Poor, Strangers, Fatherleſs, Widows, &amp;c.

               <p>It is inſinuated by ſome, that this Doctrine is the ſame that

                  <hi>Satan</hi> taught <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> iii. 4. "And the Serpent ſaid unto the Woman, ye ſhall not ſurely die." I can hardly think that thoſe who make this Objection think it is any Thing to the Purpoſe. All who have ever examined our Principles, or the Sentiments of the Myſtic Writers, know that we hold, that Death came immediately upon our firſt Parents, when they eat of the forbidden Fruit, as the neceſſary Conſequence of Sin. It came inſtantly, not nine hundred Years afterwards, as ſome ſuppoſe, and thereby in Part approve of the Serpent's Words, ſince they hold they did not die exactly according to the Word of God, on the ſame Day that they ſinned.</p>
               <p>The Death they died conſiſted in a total Loſs of the Life of God, the divine Image; or the whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I. <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 22. "For as in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive." Some will ſay that this intends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Reſurrection of Bodies; but remember, that we died a Death of Souls in <hi>Adam</hi>; and muſt therefore have a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or there is no Likeneſs at all between what we loſt in one, and gain in the other. And it is eaſy to ſee that both Expreſſions are alike univerſal, and certain. As ſure as all die in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo ſure ſhall all be made alive in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Other Texts might be added, but theſe are ſufficient.

               </p>
               <p>"The Serpent ſaid, Ye ſhall not ſurely die." But we ſay that all have died, and that Death is the conſtant Attendant of Sin, and muſt abide while Sin remains. "For the Soul that ſinneth ſhall" as ſurely "die," as a Man that breaks his Bones ſhall feel Pain: but we declare alſo, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will deſtroy Sin, Death, Hell and the Grave, and raiſe up the whole Creation into its primeval State of Glory: According to theſe Scriptures following; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxv. 8. <hi>Hoſea</hi> xiii. 14.

                  </gap> Wrath periſhes, Miſery muſt end. If it is ſaid, The wicked hope to go to Heaven in their Sins; it may be anſwered, that all ſuch Hopes muſt periſh before they can be reſtored. And will be rejected, that have not a Wedding Garment; Nothing can enter into the Kingdom till it is pure, without Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing.</p>
               <p>If the Hopes of the Wicked are bad, and ſinful; then they muſt periſh, before any Good can come to them. Even a Soul in this World, under the Operation of the Spirit of God, muſt have all his falſe Hopes periſh, and be taken away, his vain Confidence entirely o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So that the Hope of the Wicked being deſtroyed, is ſo far from being againſt their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, that it makes greatly in Favor of it; ſince without the Deſtruction of every Thing that is evil, the Good can never perfectly prevail.</p>
               <p>We readily allow, that all the Wicked (as well as their Hopes, Deſires, Thoughts, Ways, and Expectations) ſhall periſh; but this is no Argument at all againſt their Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the very Way to bring it about.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lvii. 1. "The Righteous periſheth," and in <hi>Micah</hi> vii. 2. "The good <hi>Man</hi> is periſhed out of the Earth:" yet theſe Scriptures will by no Means prove that they are loſt, ſince other Paſſages aſſure us, that they ſhall be raiſed up again.</p>
               <p>In the fourteenth Chap. of <hi>Job,</hi> we find the Caſe of Man cut down by Death, repreſented as more helpleſs than that
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017441_0054_0FA11DA57295CC70"/>
of a Tree cut down; yet who would uſe it as an Argument againſt the Reſurrection, and future State? which Truths are declared in many other Places. So though great Numbers of Scriptures intimate that Deſtruction ſhall come to the Wicked; yet many others declare that all ſhall finally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and be reſtored. Now all theſe are true, all muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: Therefore their Deſtruction, and Reſtoration, are perfectly conſiſtent with each other. Their Deſtruction is wholly from themſelves, and Sin, but their Reſtoration, from firſt to laſt, is entirely from God, by free Grace, through the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>The Author of this Objection which I have juſt anſwered, once ſaid in my hearing, "If it were not for Hopes the Heart would break; and as ſoon as all Hopes are gone, the Heart breaks at once." This is true; then it is no Matter how ſoon the Hopes of the Wicked periſh, in order that their ſtubborn Hearts may break. When that is once the caſe, then they will find, that, "The Sacrifices of God <hi>are</hi> a broken Spirit: a broken and contrite Heart God will not deſpiſe. <hi>Pſalm</hi> li. 17. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lvii. 15. and lxvi. 2.</p>

                  </gap>ctrine of Univerſal Reſtoration, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not pray for all, and therefore did not die for all, and of Conſequence all ſhall never be reſtored. This is taken from <hi>John</hi> xvii. 9. "I pray for them: I pray not for the World, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine." In the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h to the 20th Verſe, it is evident that our Lord prays for his choſen Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Apoſtles, and for them only, as will appear to any one who reads with Attention; but in the 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h Verſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends much further in theſe Words, "Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their Word."</p>
               <p>Now it is evident, that our Lord did not pray for all in the ninth Verſe for whom he died; for had that been the Caſe, he would not have enlarged his Prayer in the twentieth Verſe, which he has done; and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he 21ſt and 23d Verſes, he has prayed for the whole World, that the whole World might have that Faith and Knowledge which is Life eternal; Verſe 3, "And this is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> whom thou haſt ſent." He prays, "That they all way be one, as thou, Father, <hi>art</hi> in

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt me, and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me." Here the ultimate Deſign of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s praying for the Unity of the true Believers ſeems to be the Salvation of the World. So that it is evident enough that Nothing can be concluded from this Chapter, or Prayer, againſt the Reſtoration; but much is here ſaid in its Favour, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> has evidently prayed for all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for his Apoſtles, Verſe 9 to 20 Secondly, for them alſo that ſhould believe on him through their Word, Ver. 20. Thirdly, for the World in general, Verſes 21 and 23. This is a ſufficient Anſwer.</p>
               <p>I have heard two contrary Extremes given as the Meaning of the ninth Verſe, both equally contrary to Senſe, Reaſon, and Scripture. The firſt is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed for all that ever ſhall be ſaved in thoſe Words; "I pray for them: I pray not for the World, but for them which thou haſt given me, &amp;c." Now if the whole for whom the Saviour died were intended in that Verſe, why did he ſay, "Nei her pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l believe on me through their Word? And that the World may know that thou haſt ſent me?"</p>
               <p>The other nonſenſical Opinion that I have heard advanced, is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed in the ninth Verſe for the whole World of Men, but not for the Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d of Sin. But according to that Notion, he prayed in the twentieth Verſe not only for all Men, but for all Sin that ſhould believe on him through the Word of all Men; and finally for all the World of Sin; that it might come to know and believe that GOD had ſent <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been objected by ſome, that as the Scripture ſays, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 11, "He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill;" there never can be an Univerſal Reſtoration, nor any Alteration in the States of thoſe who ſhall be found in their Sins, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to judge the World. This is thought to be the ſtronger, as it is found in the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Rev.</hi> and is ſoon after followed by a Deſcription of thoſe that ſhall have no Part in the holy City. Verſe 15th. "For without <hi>are</hi> Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a Lye."</p>
               <p>Chap. xxi. 8. "But the Fearful and Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:017441_0056_0FA11DA7B1E302E8"/>
and Idolaters, and all Lyars ſhall have their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone: which is the ſecond Death."</p>
               <p>Nothing unclean can enter into the holy City. "And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any Thing that defileth, neither <hi>whatſoever</hi> worketh Abomination, or <hi>maketh</hi> a Lye: but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life." Verſe 27.</p>
               <p>As thoſe that are found unjuſt, and filthy, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come, cannot enter into his Kingdom, they muſt have their Part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone; their Portion muſt be with Unbelievers, where there is Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth: they muſt be filthy, and unjuſt ſtill, notwithſtanding <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Coming; i. e. they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo, till they are purified by gradual Proceſſes; for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Kind is performed in an arbitrary Manner.</p>
               <p>But this can by no means intend that they ſhall remain <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi> to all Eternity; ſince that would contradict many plain Paſſages of Scripture, and defeat God's Deſign of making "all Things new." All therefore that can be fairly drawn from the Text is, that many ſhall be found <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come, and ſhall remain ſo, and not be immediately cleanſed. Too many vainly imagine, that tho' they live in wilful Sins, yet when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come, whether by Death, or Judgment, they ſhall be inſtantly cleanſed.</p>
               <p>But ſuch will find their great Miſtake; they will find the Truth of theſe Words. "He that is unjuſt, let him be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill;" to their Sorrow. Wherefore it behoves all to ſeek here in this Life for a true Cleanſing in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and not dare to live in Sin, as many do, and vainly hope for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous Sanctification in the laſt Moments of Life; for no ſuch is to be expected.</p>
               <p>As for this Paſſage being the greater Objection, on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it's ſtanding in the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> I ſee no Force at all in that, as the Scripture is not written in the Form of a Syſtem, but the ſeveral Truths of the Goſpel are diſperſed about through the Whole. But if any will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the Order in this Chapter, they may find an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, given in the moſt free and univerſal Manner, without any Exception, in the 17 Verſe, in theſe Words, "And let him that is athirſt, come; and whoſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely."</p>
               <p>None can be ever happy till they have a Deſire after the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:017441_0057_0FA11DA8718F83E8"/>
Fountain of Life; and whenever this is the Caſe, they ſhall be admitted to it freely.</p>
               <p>The Bible ends with a Bleſſing, after all the Curſes; "The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>be</hi> with you all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Alpha, ſo will he be Omega. He is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and he will be the End; He is the Firſt, and he will be the Laſt. See <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 8, 11. xxi. 6. xxii. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt reign till all his Foes are conquered, till all ſhall own him Lord, and all become his willing and obedient Subjects; then (and not till then) ſhall he deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, and be ſubject to him, that put all Things under him, that God may be ALL IN ALL.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured (I truſt) in the Spirit of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to anſwer all the Objections uſually brought from the Scripture againſt the Reſtoration of all Things. How well I have ſucceeded, I leave to the Reader to judge.</p>
               <p>I have aimed at the Glory of God, and the Welfare of Mankind; and I truſt, this Teſtimony of my Conſcience will ſupport me, under all the Reproach, Oppoſition, and Contempt, I may meet with on the Account of my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all with the following Lines, taken from Mr. Pope's univerſal Prayer,
