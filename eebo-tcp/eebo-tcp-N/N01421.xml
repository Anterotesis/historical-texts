         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>There is a Voice of</hi> GOD <hi>unto the Children of Men; Yea, a</hi> MIGHTY VOICE: <hi>And therefore a Voice Mightily to be hearken'd to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Entertainment, I Suppoſe, would not have been Unprofitable, if I ſhould have Enquired, <hi>What is the Voice of GOD, and what is it that the Mighty Voice of our GOD Speaks unto us?</hi> You are all aware, That in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which is the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, we have the <hi>Mighty Voice</hi> of God, Speaking to us, in the Plainneſt Manner that can be. Our JESUS who <hi>Spake as never Man Spake,</hi> did never <hi>Speak,</hi> in the Dayes of His Fleſh among us, but, <hi>GOD Uttered His Voice,</hi> in the moſt familiar Way that can be imagined. But there is alſo the <hi>Voice</hi> of GOD in all the Oracles of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> GOD inſpired the Writers of theſe Oracles, and there is a <hi>Mighty Voice of GOD</hi> in the Inſpiration. Where the <hi>Goſpel</hi> comes, <hi>The Great Trumpet is blown,</hi> and there is a <hi>Mighty Voice</hi> of GOD, in the <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> of that <hi>Jubilee.</hi> Sirs, It would be Well, if you would be Prevailed upon, When you <hi>Take up</hi> the <hi>Bible,</hi> and Open it, then to think, <hi>The Mighty Voice of GOD is now Speaking to me;</hi> And when <hi>Qualified Preachers</hi> Open the <hi>Bible</hi> unto you, then again to think, <hi>The Mighty Voice of GOD, is what I must now give ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Heed unto.</hi> Methinks, You ſhould be alſo aware, That in the Dictates of our <hi>Conſcience</hi> we have the <hi>Mighty Voice</hi> of GOD unto us. The <hi>Principle</hi> in Man, which acts in a Way of <hi>Judging</hi> on him, as <hi>Under the Judgment of GOD;</hi> tho' the Dictates of that <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> are a Sort of <hi>Whiſpers,</hi> yet there are alſo <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in them: <hi>It cryes with a Loud Voice, as when a Lion roars!</hi> Oh! that Men were more fearful of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001688_0004_0FB52A84D5D395E0"/>
               <hi>Rebelling against the Light,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Voice</hi> of a <hi>Principle,</hi> which, O raſh Man, if thou put continual Sleights upon, will One Day <hi>Tear thee to Pieces, and there ſhall be none to deliver thee.</hi> Yea, I will ſay unto you, <hi>Sound Reaſon</hi> is always the <hi>Voice of GOD.</hi> When ever any Maxim, or Demand of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto us, We have GOD Speaking unto us. My Brethren, If you will <hi>Shew your ſelves Men,</hi> and <hi>Hearken to Reaſon,</hi> You may fill your Lives with <hi>Acts of Obedience</hi> unto GOD. Whatever you ſee to be <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Conform to it, from this Conſideration, <hi>Tis what GOD Calls me to!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then, You muſt be as much aware of this; That there is a <hi>Mighty Voice</hi> of GOD, in all the <hi>Works</hi> of His Hands. All His Diſpenſations are <hi>Speaking Diſpenſations.</hi> The Works of <hi>Creation;</hi> There <hi>is no Speech nor Language, Where their Voice is not heard.</hi> All the <hi>Creatures</hi> of GOD are ſo many <hi>Teachers</hi> to us. <hi>Aſk them now, and they ſhall teach thee;</hi> Yea, the <hi>Muteſt</hi> of them <hi>ſhall declare unto thee.</hi> The Works of <hi>Providence</hi> too; <hi>Stand ſtill, and Conſider theſe Wondrous Works of God;</hi> That is, To <hi>Hear</hi> what they <hi>Speak</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. The <hi>General Providence</hi> of GOD, which <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves</hi> and <hi>Governs</hi> the World, has a <hi>Voice</hi> to all the World; The <hi>Wheels</hi> of it make a <hi>Noiſe</hi> in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But ſo too has the <hi>Special Providence.</hi> There is a <hi>Voice</hi> of GOD unto us, in what we ſee befalling of <hi>Others.</hi> The <hi>Rewarding</hi> of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and the <hi>Puniſhing</hi> of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> has alwayes a <hi>Voice</hi> in it, unto all the Spectators of it. But — much more in what we feel befalling <hi>Our ſelves.</hi> Do we meet with <hi>Agreeable</hi> Things? <hi>I Speak unto thee in thy Proſperity, ſaith the Lord.</hi> — Oh! but what follows? — Do we meet with <hi>Deplorable</hi> Things? Now, <hi>Hear

            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Sum</hi> of the <hi>Voice,</hi> even the <hi>Mighty Voice,</hi> You cannot but be aware, and appriſed of it. It is that of the <hi>Angel</hi> with the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel, Saying with a Loud Voice, Fear GOD, and give Glory to HIM.</hi> 'Tis,
<q>O <hi>Acknowledge</hi> the Glorious GOD in all Your Wayes; Make it the <hi>Chief End</hi> of your Lives, to Render and Procure, continual Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of His <hi>Glories.</hi> Place your Bleſſedneſs, in the Enjoyment of Him.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS the <hi>Voice.</hi> No Doubt, I might have gone on Profitably, to have told you, <hi>How and Why the Mighty Voice of GOD is Mightily to be hearkened to?</hi> To have told you, That to Study the Mind of God in His <hi>Voice,</hi> and to <hi>be,</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> what is therein called for, is to Hearken to it. And then, to have told you, that ſince 'tis the <hi>Mighty Voice of GOD,</hi> there need no other <hi>Argument</hi> for its being <hi>Mightily Hearken'd to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>— BUT it is another Entertainment, That I have under the Impreſſions of GOD, and with His Aſſiſtences, Prepared for you.</p>

¶ THE <hi>Deſign</hi> which I Propoſe this Day to Proſecute, is, That the <hi>Voice</hi> of the Glorious GOD, even His <hi>Mighty Voice,</hi> in the <hi>Later Diſpenſations</hi> of His Providence towards this Land, may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, be Underſtood, be Complied withal.</p>
            <p>WHEN the former <hi>Long War,</hi> which our Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Barbarous <hi>Enemies</hi> made upon us, was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, there was an <hi>Eſſay</hi> to make ſome Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Obſervable Things</hi> that had occurred in it: An <hi>Eſſay,</hi> which God and His People approved of.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER <hi>Long War</hi> is now finiſhed; A <hi>New Peace</hi> hath been ſtruck up, in our Borders: And it is Time to Conſider the <hi>Voice</hi> of our God unto us, in the <hi>Obſervable Things</hi> that have therein Paſſed over us. For, <hi>O my Dear People,</hi> While thy God has been <hi>Striking</hi> of thee, He has been alſo <hi>Speaking</hi> to thee; And it is of the Laſt Conſequence, that His <hi>Voice</hi> be Wiſely hearkened to; A Total Inadvertency to the <hi>Voice,</hi> will have a Conſequence which we may juſtly tremble at; — If to be <hi>Puniſhed yet Ten times for our Iniquities,</hi> or with more than <hi>Ten Years</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions repeared upon us, be a thing to be trembled at.</p>

            <p>FROM ſuch an <hi>Holy Undertaking,</hi> we muſt not be diſcouraged, by the Deriſion of a few Fooliſh, and Flaſhy, and Prophane Creatures, (no more to be valued than the Dirt of a <hi>Street</hi>) who Scoff at all <hi>Sermons</hi> of an <hi>Hiſtorical Importance;</hi> that is to ſay.

            <p>WHEREFORE, Having this Opportunity, of Seeing the <hi>Elders</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> here aſſembled, I call upon you, <hi>Stand Still, that I may Reaſon with you before the Lord,</hi> Concerning the <hi>Righteous Acts</hi> which He hath done among you, and His <hi>Mighty Voice</hi> in thoſe <hi>Acts,</hi> which He Expects you to take a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> and a <hi>Religious</hi> Notice of.</p>
            <p>GOD forbid, That a People of our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Original,</hi> ſhould be ſo abandoned by the <hi>Spirit of Piety,</hi> as to be Inſenſible, that there is a <hi>Voice</hi> of the Glorious GOD unto us, even a <hi>Mighty Voice,</hi> in the Things which He has diſpenſed unto us, during our <hi>Long War,</hi> with the <hi>Eaſtern Salvages,</hi> and the bloody <hi>Papiſts</hi> that have inſpired them and abetted them. Verily, Such an Inſenſibility would but bring us within the reach of that flaming Thunderbolt; Pſal. XXVIII. 5. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the Works of the Lord, nor the Operation of His Hands, He ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi> I again ſay, <hi>God forbid!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then, the <hi>First</hi> Thing, Whereto your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is demanded, is; That the <hi>Voice</hi> of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious GOD, even His <hi>Mighty Voice,</hi> in the <hi>Long War</hi>

OUR <hi>Mariners</hi> and our <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> diſtinguiſhed with ſo many <hi>Deſtructions</hi> upon them, ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider their Peculiar Obligations to have their Ears Liſtening to the <hi>Voice</hi> of GOD. <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, Let him hear, What GOD now Speaks unto him.</hi>

AND yet, I Wiſh, the <hi>Wounded Chaldeans,</hi> may not riſe up Once more to inflict <hi>Grievous Wounds</hi> upon <hi>Us.</hi> To Prevent more Deſolations, I would with all <hi>Humility,</hi> but with all <hi>Importunity,</hi> moſt Vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with moſt Preſſing Inſtances, beſeech the Government, That all due Methods may be taken, for the Upholding of <hi>Religion</hi> in the Plantations of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as they ſhall be going on.

            <p>I have reckoned up, in this <hi>War,</hi> near an <hi>Hundred Times,</hi> that <hi>Evil Tidings</hi> have been brought in unto

BUT by ſuch means as theſe, the Enemy, have hardly above <hi>Once,</hi> been able to do any thing to Purpoſe, in all their Enterprizes. They have <hi>gone round about the City, and made a Noiſe like a Dog:</hi> By'nd by they have <hi>Returned,</hi> and <hi>Wandred up and down for Meat,</hi> and <hi>grudged</hi> becauſe they were <hi>not Satisfyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD <hi>Speaks</hi> to us in this; <hi>Oh! Trust Me: Oh! Love Me; Oh! See what it is to be under My Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW <hi>Favoured?</hi> — When the rich <hi>Store-Ships</hi> bound for <hi>Canada,</hi> and fill'd with Inſtruments of Death, have been taken by our <hi>Fleets;</hi> and the moſt Capable and Reſolved Perſecutors of theſe Colonies, have been Killed aboard them.</p>
            <p>HOW <hi>Favoured?</hi> — When <hi>Privateers</hi> infeſting our Coaſts, have by Storms, <hi>[Fulfilling thy Word, O our God!]</hi> been Shipwreck'd on them. Or ſome of our Neighbours, Eſpecially from One Helpful Iſland of our Neighbourhood, have with Sudden and Valiant Exploits, made them repent of their appreaching us.</p>
            <p>HOW <hi>Favour'd?</hi> — When we not only laid Waſte many <hi>French</hi> Settlements, where the <hi>Indians</hi> had been Harboured and Supplyed; but anon their Citadel, with their whole Country, fell into our hands; and that <hi>Jericho,</hi> having been <hi>Comteſſed Seven Dayes,</hi> fell before us. I Speak <hi>Literally</hi>

               </gap>nough in that Circumſtance!</p>
            <p>HOW <hi>Favoured?</hi> — In the Many and Ready Aſſiſtences, which our Brethren of the Neighbour
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001688_0025_0FB52AAC97543E88"/>Colonies, have Lent unto us. Our GOD <hi>Speaks</hi> this unto us in it, <hi>Be Tender of One another! My Colonies, Love and Live as Brethren. I will have no unbrotherly Emulations among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND certainly the Aſſiſtences that we have given to our Neighbours, — Our Brethren in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> will certainly in all Things do the part of <hi>Our Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW <hi>Favoured?</hi> — In that altho' the Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Debts</hi> we have Contracted, One would have thought, muſt have broke us, yet we find our ſelves able to diſcharge theſe Ponderous <hi>Debts;</hi> Yea, our <hi>Debts</hi> have rather Enriched us, by affording a <hi>Fund</hi> for the <hi>Circulation of Credit,</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>HOW <hi>Favoured?</hi> — When in the midſt of <hi>Our</hi> Charges, and Loſſes, and Various Troubles, we have been mov'd and help'd from Above, to Expreſs our Charity for our Friends in the <hi>Caribbee-Iſlands,</hi> and ſend ſome Taſte of our Bounty to them in <hi>theirs.</hi> Let not Ignorant Strangers abuſe <hi>New-England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they Out-do that Poor Country in the Things, that every One muſt Confeſs to be Laudable.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time, Some Servants of God have had the <hi>Unſpeakable Satisfaction</hi> of Expreſſing and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Bounties, for <hi>Odd People,</hi> among whom it has been a General Practice and Pleaſure, to be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly and Venemouſly Railing at them. — <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them; They know not what they do!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND how <hi>Favoured?</hi> — When under all the <hi>Creepling Diſadvantages</hi> of the Country, We ſee the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001688_0026_0FB52AAE15A7F9D0"/>
               <hi>Metropolis</hi> of it, and of the whole Engliſh <hi>America,</hi> increaſe and flouriſh at ſuch a rate? Yea, we ſee the ancient <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Phaenix</hi> riſing out of its <hi>Aſhes,</hi> Moralized and Verified, O BOSTON, in thy riſing out of <hi>thine:</hi> Things done for thee, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port whereof will be thought a <hi>Fable,</hi> by them that have not ſeen them.</p>
            <p>SIRS, There is a <hi>Voice,</hi> yea, a <hi>Mighty Voice</hi> of our Glorious GOD unto us in all theſe things. He beſpeaks our <hi>Thankful Praiſes,</hi> to Him, in all theſe things: This I am certain of!</p>
            <p>IT muſt not be Left unconſidered among the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> of our GOD, that we have all this while, Enjoy'd His GOSPEL, in the Privileges whereof we have been <hi>Lifted up to Heaven.</hi> Our GOD has fulfill'd that Word unto us; Iſai. XXX. 20. <hi>Tho' they Lord give You the Bread of Adverſity, and the Water of Affliction, yet thine Eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE of the Leaſt among them, is now doing his Part, that our <hi>Adverſity</hi> and our <hi>Affliction</hi> may be rendred Profitable to us.</p>
            <p>BUT, that our <hi>Matchleſs,</hi> and our <hi>Envy'd</hi> GOSPEL ſhall be continued unto us, do we ſee nothing like a <hi>Rainbow</hi> in the <hi>Britiſh-Heaven,</hi> to give us a <hi>Token,</hi> upon which they who <hi>dwell in the Wilderneſs</hi> may be leſs <hi>Afraid</hi> than a <hi>Cloudy Day</hi> may have ſometimes rendered them?</p>
            <p>YES, Unto our Inexpreſſible Satisfaction, we now ſee aſcending to the <hi>Britiſh Throne,</hi> A KING, for whom his NEW-ENGLISH People have continually
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001688_0027_0FB52AB055A277A8"/>Offered up their moſt Earneſt <hi>Vows</hi> to the GOD <hi>by whom Kings Reign,</hi> that they may ſee Him, and His Illuſtrious Family, in the Succeſſion runing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er them.</p>
            <p>A KING, Who cannot in any of His Dominions, have more Loyal, Faithful, and Hearty Subjects, than His NEW-ENGLISH People; who are by <hi>Principle</hi> as well as <hi>Intereſt</hi> rendred ſo.</p>
            <p>A KING, from whom we have all the Reaſon imaginable to Expect it, that He will not only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the <hi>Civil and Religious Liberties</hi> of a People who ſo many wayes recommend themſelves unto. His <hi>Royal Chemency,</hi> but alſo that He will Multiply unto them the Tokens of His <hi>Paternal Benignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY Brethren, You hear the <hi>Voice</hi> of your Glorious GOD, even His <hi>Mighty Voice,</hi> in the Changes of His Providence that have Paſſed over you. A <hi>Voice</hi> that ſpeaks this; <hi>Ah! My Poor People; How ſhall I give thee up: As yet, I cannot do it; I will not do it! Tho' I chaſten thee ſore, thou ſhalt not yet be given over to Death!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have diſcharged my Duty, and my Sermon ſhall be finiſhed, when I have brought you the <hi>Voice</hi> of your GOD, in that One moſt Intelligible and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable <hi>Articulation</hi> of it more; Pſal. LXXXI. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Oh! that my People had hearkened unto me, and walked in my Wayes? I ſhould ſoon have Subdued their Enemies, and have turned my Hand againſt their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; The Haters of the Lord ſhould have Submitted themſelves unto Him; but their own Time ſhould Endure for ever.</hi>

When the Fleet was come within Thirty Yards of their intended Prey, Ours fired upon them, which firſt Shot put them into Extreme Diſorder. The Indian Fleet again drawing up in Order of Battel, fired with ſuch Fury, as obliged ours to quit One of the Shallops; which about fifty of the Enemy Entred, and got the Mainſail a-Trip, before ours could get the other to Sail. Ours therefore get out their Oars; but the Enemy was as quick as they, and they joyned Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles on both ſides. Ours gaining on them, the Enemy got a dozen Canoes a head, with Fiſhing-lines, to tow

            <p>ON <hi>Aug.</hi> 20. 1708. about break of Day, an hundred and fifty Indians, with French Officers and Aſſiſtents,
