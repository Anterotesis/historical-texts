            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE GOSPEL is a rich and ſacred Treaſure, containing the glad Tidings of Salvation to ſinful Men, and wiſely adapted to promote their ſpiritual and eternal Intereſts. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>It is the Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek,</hi> Rom i. 16.</p>
            <p>To preach this Goſpel, is one of the greateſt and moſt important Truſts that ever was committed unto Men: And, to do it faithfully, ſo as to pleaſe, and be approved of, the Heart-ſearching GOD, is no eaſy Taſk. The Difficulties that attend this Work, and the many Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Unfaithfulneſs in it, render the Performance of it uncommonly hard, and require ſuperior Meaſures both of Gifts, and Grace. In both theſe Reſpects, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our Lord were eminently qualified for this
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007425_0003_102D84E26C99A210"/>
Office, being <hi>endued with Power from on high:</hi> And <hi>in nothing</hi> did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> come <hi>behind the very chiefeſt of them:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 11.</note> But the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD, <hi>which was beſtowed on him,</hi> for this <hi>Purpoſe, was not in vain; but he laboured more abundantly than they all</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 10.</note>, and was very ſucceſsful, <hi>cheifly</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom in ſpecial he was ſent: <hi>For he that wrought effectually in</hi> Peter <hi>to the Apoſtleſhip of the Circumciſion, the ſame, ſays he, was mighty in me towards the Gentiles.</hi> Gal. ii. 8.</p>
            <p>As to the extraordinary Efficacy and Succeſs of his Miniſtry, in particular, among the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he takes a thankful Notice hereof, in this his firſt Epiſtle ſo them, wherein he joins <hi>Silvanus</hi> or <hi>Silas,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and Fellow-Labourers, with himſelf. <hi>For our Goſpel,</hi> ſays he, <hi>came not unto you in the Word only, but alſo in Power and in the Holy-Ghoſt, and in much Aſſurance; as ye know what manner of Men we were among you for your Sake. And ye became Followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the Word in much Affliction, with Joy of the Holy-Ghoſt; ſo that ye were Enſamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</hi> Chap. i. ver. 5, 6, 7. For the Truth hereof he appeals unto them, Cap. ii. v. 1. <hi>For yourſelves, Brethren, know our Entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as a ſubordinate Reaſon of the Goſpel's being ſo ſucceſsful among them, he goes on to remind them, with what Fortitude and Zeal, Purity and Sincerity, it was preached unto them, ver. 2, 3. <hi>But even after that we had ſuffered before, and were ſhamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to ſpeak unto you the Goſpel of God with much Contention. For our Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not of Deceit, nor of Uncleanneſs, nor in Guile.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſevere and ſhameful Treatment, which they had met with juſt before, at <hi>Philippi,</hi> for preaching the Goſpel, they were not at all diſheartned, but rather ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to greater Courage and Fervency, at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007425_0003_102D84E26C99A210"/>
the Face of the like Oppoſition and Danger; knowing the Truth and Purity of their Doctrine; and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to preach, not ſo, as to ſooth the unreaſonable Humours, and gratifie the vile Luſts of Men, but to pleaſe and gain the Approbation of the Omniſcient, and Heart-ſearching GOD, whoſe Miniſters they were; and unto whom they were accountable: For ſo he adds in the Words of my Text, <hi>But as we were allowed of God to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel, even ſo we ſpeak, not as pleaſing Men, but God, which trieth our Hearts.</hi> And herein they acted as faithful Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus, and very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the great and important Truſt committed unto them, and are an Enſample to all who ſucced them in the ſacred Office of the Evangelical Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, in diſcourſing upon theſe Words, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>That the Goſpel is committed in Truſt unto the Miniſters of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſters of the Goſpel are a particular Order of Men, in the Chriſtian Church, appointed by Chriſt, to officiate in his Name and Stead, as <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> in it. They are mentioned as the precious Gifts of Chriſt, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on his Church, for their ſpiritual Benefit, when he left this World, and aſcended to the FATHER, Eph. iv. 8, 12, 13. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto Men.—And he gave ſome, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and ſome, Prophets; and ſome, Evangeliſts; and ſome, Paſtors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007425_0004_102D84E80CC38460"/>Theſe Miniſters, whether <hi>exraordinary,</hi> as <hi>Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> or <hi>ordinary,</hi> as <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> were <hi>ex Officio,</hi> intruſted with the Goſpel. <hi>But as we were allowed of God to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Text, ſpeaking of himſelf and his Fellow-Labourers. And, with Regard to himſelf in particular, he ſays of the <hi>glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God,</hi> yet it <hi>was committed to his Truſt,</hi> 1 Tim. i. 11. And all that ſucceed him in the Work of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, being regularly called, and ſolemnly ſeparated thereunto according to Goſpel-Order, are, in like Manner, <hi>put in Truſt with the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſpecially <hi>ſet for the Defence of the Goſpel,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>They are, in a particular Manner, intruſted with the <hi>Miniſtry of the Word:</hi> Hence they are called <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 1.</note>; whoſe ſpecial Buſineſs it is wiſely and faithfully to diſpenſe the <hi>Word of Life</hi> unto others, for their ſpiritual Inſtruction and Nouriſhment; <hi>warning every Man, and teaching every Man, in all Wiſdom, that they may preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Col. i. 21.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe by virtue of their Office, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments of the New-Teſtament: And, as

good <hi>Overſeers</hi> of the Flock and <hi>Rulers</hi> in the Houſe of GOD, to manage the Diſcipline, and apply the Cenſures of the Church, as Occaſion requires.</p>
            <p>In all which Reſpects, the Goſpel may be conſidered as a ſacred Charge, ſpecially <hi>committed in Truſt</hi> unto the Miniſters of it.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>What is implied in being allowed of God to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Phraſe, I apprehend, implies ſomething more than barely a Permiſſion, even an Approbation of Perſons for, and Appointment of them, unto the <hi>Miniſterial-Office.</hi>— That St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his <hi>Fellow-Labourers,</hi> of whom the Text particularly ſpeaks, were approved of GOD, as Perſons duly qualified for and authorized to the Work of the Miniſtry, which they employed themſelves in. And conſidered in Relation to Miniſters, <hi>in general,</hi> it may denote the ſame Thing. So then, in order to Miniſters being <hi>allowed of God to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel,</hi> they muſt be ſuitably qualified for, and authorized, or ſolemly ſeparated unto the Work of the Goſpel-Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They muſt be ſuitably qualified for this Work.</hi> In Order to which, it is requiſite,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they be Men of <hi>ſincere Piety: Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus—and prepared unto every good Work.</hi> This is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Miniſters, as for others, in order to their being true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and in a State of <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Acceptance</hi> with GOD.

            </p>
            <p>It is certainly a Matter of great Importance, that Miniſters be well-grounded in the Principles of Religion, and firmly eſtabliſhed in the Belief of thoſe great and weighty Truths of Divine Revelation, which they are to preach to others: How <hi>elſe</hi> can they be qualified for this Truſt? If they preach not <hi>the Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> they are likely to deſtroy, and not to confirm, the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi>— to ruin, and not to ſave the Souls of Men.

               </gap>m. iv. 12, <hi>But be thou an Example of the Believers, in Lord, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</hi> And verily, no Man is qualified for the Miniſtry, or fit to be employed in it, that is not of a blameleſs and good Behaviour: For a Preacher of Righteouſneſs to yield himſelf the Servant of Sin,—an immoral Miniſter,— one viſibly bad, yielding himſelf to unrighteous Practices and fleſhly Defilements,— is a meer Inconſiſtency and Abſurdity! To ſuch a One it may be ſaid, as in <hi>Rom</hi> ii. 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Thou therefore which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? Thou that preacheſt a Man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal? Thou that ſayeſt a Man ſhould not commit Adultery, doſt thou commit Adultery? Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacrilege? Thou that makeſt thy Boaſt of the Law, thro' breaking the Law diſhonoureſt thou God? For the Name of God is blaſphemed,— thro' you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it enough, that they be free from viſible <hi>Scandals;</hi> but they ſhould moreover be exemplary in their Life and Converſation, ſhewing themſelves <hi>Patterns of good Works,</hi> and cauſing their <hi>Lights</hi> to <hi>ſhine before Men, that they may ſee their good Works,</hi> and be induced thereby to <hi>glorify God</hi> their heavenly <hi>Father: For a Biſhop,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>muſt be blameleſs, as the Steward of God; not ſelf-willed, not ſoon angry, not give to Wine, no Striker not given to filthy Lucre; but a Lover of Hoſpitality, a Lover of good Men, ſober, juſt, holy, temperate.</hi> Tit. i. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Not that it is ever to be expected of any of them, that they ſhould be entirely without Fault, or perfect in any Chriſtian Grace and Virtue, in this World: For they are <hi>Men of like Paſſions</hi> and Infirmities, with others; and all reaſonable Allowances are to be made for them, as for
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007425_0006_102D84EDCD8040C8"/>
other Men, on the Score of humane Frailties, and the Temptations, both from within and from without, which befal them in the World. But I go on to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They muſt be authorized, or regularly called and ſeparated unto this Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meerly a Man's being qualified for, does not give him a Right or Authority, to execute the <hi>Miniſterial Office.</hi> In order to this, there muſt be a regular Introduction into it. <hi>Heb.</hi> v. 4. <hi>And no Man taketh this Honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that is called of GOD, as was Aaron.</hi> It is very aſſuming, and dangerous Preſumption, for any to thruſt himſelf into this ſacred Office!</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles received their Commiſſion and Authority immediately from Chriſt, the Supreme Head of the Church; As, during his perſonal Miniſtry on Earth, he gave them a temporary Commiſſion to <hi>the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> with this expreſs Command, <hi>And as ye go, preach, ſaying, the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand,</hi> Mat. x. 7; ſo, after his Reſurrection, he renewed and enlarged their Commiſſion, ſaying, <hi>All Power is given unto me, in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all Things whatſoever I have commended you; and lo, I am with you, alway, even unto the End of the World.</hi> Amen. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. 18, 19, 20. And them he ſpecially qualified for this Truſt, by conferring on them the <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> of the HOLY GHOST; and to them, and to the World, he gave abundant Teſtimony of the Truth of their Miſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> alſo, was immediately called and ſent by Chriſt, to preach the Goſpel: Wherefore he ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, (not of Men, neither by Man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, who raiſed him from the Dead,)</hi> Gal. i. 1. Nevertheleſs, he was, by the ſpecial Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, ſeparated unto the Work of the Miniſtry, by the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers at Antioch;</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:007425_0007_102D84EF8ADCFD98"/>
to whom, <hi>as they miniſtred to the Lord, and faſted, the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the Work whereunto I have called them. And when they had faſted and prayed, and laid their Hands on them, they ſent them away.</hi> Acts xiii. 2, 3. Hence, perhaps, it is, that he ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Rom. i. 1. <hi>Paul a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, called to be an Apoſtle, ſeparated unto the Goſpel of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we do not read of any, ſince the <hi>Apoſtolick. Age,</hi> that were immediately called and ſent by Chriſt, to preach the Goſpel: Nor has Chriſt, any where, intimated in his Word, that he would, in this Manner, ſend forth his Miniſters in Time to come. But he left it with his Apoſtles, under the Inſpiration of the HOLY GHOST, to ſettle the Order of the Churches, which they ſhould gather, and found, in his Name, and to order <hi>Elders,</hi> or <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> in them. And it is evident, that thoſe whom the Apoſtles choſe, and ſet apart to the Work of the Miniſtry, had Authority likewiſe to ordain others to it; particularly, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had: To the former of which, <hi>St. Paul</hi> gave this expreſs Charge, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 2. <hi>Thou therefore, my Son, be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus. And the Things that thou haſt heard of me among many Witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithful Men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo:</hi> And to the latter he writes, <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5. <hi>For this Cauſe left I thee in</hi> Crete, <hi>that thou ſhouldſt ſet in Order the Things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee.</hi> And this Power of Ordination, is (as it was doubtleſs deſigned to be) conveyed down in the Chriſtian Church; and thoſe who, according to Goſpel-Order, are called and ſeparated to the Work of the Miniſtry, may be ſaid to be <hi>allowed of God to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whatever Diſputes there have been and are, about the Right and Power of Ordination, and in whoſe Hands it is lodged; yet that there is ſuch a Power, ſomewhere in the Chriſtian Church, is generally allowed: And ſince we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007425_0007_102D84EF8ADCFD98"/>
find no Examples in Scripture, of any being ordained to the Work of the Miniſtry, but only by authorized Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, nor any particular Directions given, relating hereunto, but only to ſuch; we may, I think, ſafely conclude, that the Power of Ordination, if it be not abſolutely limited and confined to them, does yet in ſome ſpecial and peculiar Manner belong unto them; and that however particular Churches may have a natural Right to elect their own <hi>Paſtors,</hi> yet it is requiſite, that they ſhould be ſolemnly ſeparated to the <hi>Paſtoral Office</hi> over them, by the Paſtors of other Churches invited thereunto, with Faſting and Prayer, and Impoſition of Hands.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe who thruſt themſelves, or are thruſt by others, into the Work of the Miniſtry, in a diſorderly Way and Manner, which the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> do not direct to, or countenance, they are, in my Opinion, to be look'd upon and treated not as true Miniſters of the Goſpel; but as bold Intruders, the Authority of whoſe Miſſion, and the Validity of whoſe Adminiſtrations, want Proof.</p>
            <p>But I muſt proceed to ſhow,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That it greatly concerns thoſe that are intruſted with the Goſpel, to preach the ſame, not as pleaſing Men, but God, who trieth their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Illuſtration of this Point, I ſhall undertake to ſhew,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>How the Goſpel is to be preached ſo as to pleaſe, not Men, but GOD.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That it greatly concerns thoſe that are intruſted with the Goſpel, ſo to preach the ſame, not as pleaſing Men, but God, who trieth the Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew, <hi>how the Goſpel is to be preached, ſo as to pleaſe not Men, but GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007425_0008_102D84F14AE0B6B8"/>Now this evidently intends, that the Goſpel be preached by the Miniſters of it, with a ſpecial View, not to ſooth and gratify the vain Humours and Fancies of Men, or to court their Approbation and Applauſe, but to honour and pleaſe GOD, and to gain his Approbation and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Otherwiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did, and every Miniſter ſhould, ſeek to <hi>pleaſe Men,</hi> for their Spiritual Good, by becoming <hi>all Things to all Men,</hi> as far as is allowable and conſiſtent with the faithful Diſcharge of his Office; and endeavouring to <hi>pleaſe all Men in all Things, not ſeeking his own Profit, but the Profit of many that may ſaved,</hi> 1 Cor. x. 33.</p>
            <p>To preach the Goſpel in this Manner, is to preach it according to the Will of GOD, and as his <hi>Oracles</hi> direct. Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Purely and truly:</hi> And that both as to <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Matter;</hi> it muſt be the true and pure Goſpel. Jer. xxiii. 28. <hi>He that hath my Word, let him ſpeak my Word faithfully.</hi> As it is the Goſpel, and Nothing elſe, that is <hi>committed in Truſt</hi> unto the Miniſters of it, ſo this is what they are to preach in the Simplicity and Purity of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding to, or diminiſhing from it. They muſt not preach <hi>for Doctrines, the Commandments</hi> and meer Opinions <hi>of Men;</hi> but their Diſcourſes ſhould be taken from, and framed to the Goſpel-Model. Tit. ii. 1. <hi>But ſpeak thou the Things which become ſound Doctrine.</hi> This will pleaſe GOD, who is a Being of infinite Truth and Purity, however it may diſpleaſe Men, whoſe Luſts and Corruptions are hereby oppoſed and irritated,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Manner;</hi> it muſt not be handled <hi>craftily</hi> and <hi>ſophiſtically,</hi> to gratify the unreaſonable Humours and diſtemper'd Appetites of Men; but rightly divided and truly diſpenſed; — the Truths of it ſet in a juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Light, and ſincerely and faithfully urged, ſo as will be moſt likely to take Effect, and reach its true End. <hi>For
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007425_0008_102D84F14AE0B6B8"/>
we are not</hi> (ſays St. Paul) <hi>as many, which corrupt the Word of GOD; But as of Sincerity, but as of God, in the Sight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. ii. 17. <hi>But have renounced the hidden Things of Diſhoneſty, not walking in Craftineſs, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by Manifeſtation of the Truth, commending ourſelves to every Man's Conſcience in the Sight of GOD.</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>With all ſuitable Plainneſs and Clearneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is the Duty of Miniſters to explain and ſet home the Truths of the Goſpel, ſo it ſhould be their Concern, to ſpeak in a clear and diſtinct Manner, and to adapt their Diſcourſe and Language to the Underſtanding of Men, and the Capacities of their Hearers. <hi>We,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>uſe great Plainneſs of Speech,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 12. And Miniſters ſhould, in like Manner, in their <hi>Pulpit Diſcourſes,</hi> ſtudy <hi>Plainneſs of Speech;</hi> not, indeed, in Oppoſition to that which is correct, decent, graceful, nervous, and pungent, but to that which is obſcure, lofty and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, looſe and incoherent: Inſtead of <hi>darkening Counſel, by Words without Knowledge,</hi> and uſing Words of awful Sound, without any Meaning, and affecting an intricate Style, they ſhould endeavour, by plain and wholeſome Language, to ſet the Truths of the Goſpel, which they preach, in a clear, diſtinct and naked Light, ſo as they may not loſe their native Force and Efficacy upon the Hearts and Conſciences of Men; but that all may learn and underſtand them. <hi>And I, Brethren,</hi> ſays St. Paul to the Corinthians, <hi>when I came to you, came not with Excellency of Speech, or of Wiſdom, declaring unto you the Teſtimony of GOD,—and my Speech, and my Preaching was not with enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom, but in Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power: That your Faith ſhould not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of GOD.</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 1, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>With all becoming Confidence and Boldneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:007425_0009_102D84F3E2E699D0"/>As Miniſters are to ſpeak GOD'S Word, and in GOD'S Name, ſo they ſhould ſpeak with Confidence and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becoming the Meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts. They ſhould not be <hi>aſhamed of the Goſpel,</hi> or mealy-mouth'd in delivering the Meſſages of it, but declare them faithfully and couragiouſly, whether Men will hear, or whether they will forbear; not regarding the Perſons, or fearing the Diſpleaſure and Threats, and Ill-treatment of Men; but imitating the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Fellow-Labourers, who tells the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> Verſe 2, of the Context, <hi>But even after that we had ſuffered before, and were ſhamefully entreated, as ye know, at</hi> Philippi, <hi>we were bold in our God, to ſpeak unto you the Goſpel of God, with much Contention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>With Affection and Zeal;</hi> animated by a pure Love to GOD and Chriſt, and a tender Compaſſion to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>As it is the ſpecial Work of Miniſters, <hi>to teſtify the Goſpel of the Grace of God,</hi> and to unfold the Myſteries of <hi>Divine Love</hi> to fallen Men, in their Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt; ſo their Hearts ſhould be deeply impreſſed, and duly inflamed with this Love: And with this Spirit ſhould they preach the Goſpel; not out of <hi>Envy and Strife, but of Good-Will; not by Conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind;</hi> not ſeeking <hi>Glory</hi> from Men, but out of ſincere Love to GOD and JESUS CHRIST, and a holy Jealouſy for and Concern to promote the Honour of GOD and the REDEEMER. This is clearly intimated to us in that Queſtion, which our bleſſed LORD ſo often put to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him the Care of Feeding his Sheep and his Lambs, <hi>John</hi> xxi. 15. Simon, <hi>Son of</hi> Jonas, <hi>loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> And happy the Miniſter, that can, by the like ſolemn Appeal, anſwer and ſay as he did, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all Things; thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> ver. 17.

Tenderneſs, which the kind and benevolent <hi>Redeemer</hi> ſhewed to precious and immortal Souls, whom he dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſed with his own Blood, ſhould his Miniſters diſpenſe <hi>the Word of Life</hi> unto them; <hi>Travelling</hi> as it were <hi>in Birth for them, till Chriſt be formed in them;</hi> Labouring diligently and fervently among them; and willingly ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Time and Strength for the Good of their Souls, and promoting their Salvation. In this Manner, and with this Spirit did <hi>St. Paul</hi> preach the Goſpel: (See <hi>V.</hi> 7, 8, of the Cont.) <hi>But we were gentle among you, even as a Nurſe cheriſheth her Children: So, being affectionately deſirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Goſpel of God only, but alſo our own ſouls, becauſe ye were dear unto us.</hi> And the like extraordinary Affection and Zeal ſhould all Miniſters, in the Courſe of their ſacred Miniſtrations, exerciſe and diſcover towards the Souls, committed to their Care and Charge: So, as to be able to ſay as he did, Phil. i. 8. <hi>God is my Record, how greatly I long after you all in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

Offices, and Benefits — The Grace and Love, and other Perfections of GOD, ſhining forth in his Works, eſpecially in the Goſpel-Scheme of Salvation — The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Office of the HOLY-SPIRIT, and the Neceſſity of his Agency and Influence, in the Conviction and Converſion of Sinners, and forming them to a divine <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> — Mans Apoſtacy, Depravity, and Guilt — The Nature and Neceſſity of <hi>Repentance towards God,</hi> and of <hi>Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> in Order, either, to our being <hi>juſtified,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to a State of <hi>Peace,</hi> Favour and Acceptance with God, and enjoying the Comforts and Satisfactions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion here, or to our inheriting eternal Life hereafter.</p>
            <p>In a Word; all the Doctrines and Inſtructions, all the Councils and Warnings, all the Precepts and Duties, all the Promiſes and Threatnings of the Goſpel ſhould be carefully ſet in a true and juſt Light, and Men's Faith in, and Compliance with them urged and inculcated, and nothing kept back, thro' Deceit, or Fear of offending and diſpleaſing Men, which is neceſſary for them to know, believe, and do, in Order to their eſcaping the <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> and obtaining <hi>the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal Life;</hi> ſo as to be able, in the Review, to appeal to their Flock, and ſay, in the Words of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> Acts xx 26, 27. <hi>Wherefore I take you to Record this Day, that I am pure from the Blood of all Men: For I have not ſhunned to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you all the Counſel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus muſt Miniſters preach the Goſpel, if they would do it, <hi>not as pleaſing Men, but God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I proceed to ſhow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>it greatly concern thoſe, that are intruſted with the Goſpel, to preach the ſame, not as pleaſing Men, but God, who trieth their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In doing this, I ſhall confine my ſelf to what is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to us in the Words of the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007425_0010_102D84F7541DC7C0"/>The Goſpel is <hi>committed in Truſt</hi> to the Miniſters of it, which implies a ſpecial Obligation upon them to preach it faithfully. <hi>Let a Man,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God. Moreover it is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful,</hi> 1. Cor. iv. 1, 2. As this Truſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, not by Man meerly, but by GOD of whom they <hi>are allowed to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel,</hi> ſo it greatly concerns them, to diſcharge it to his Honour, Approbation, and Acceptance, whoſe Servants they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially are; and not to betray it, by an unfaithful Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, or ſeeking chiefly to pleaſe Men. <hi>For do I now perſwade Men, or God? Or do I ſeek to pleaſe Men? For if I yet pleaſed Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt,</hi> is the Language of our Apoſtle Gal. i. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> They are <hi>accountable</hi> to God for the Diſcharge of this ſacred <hi>Truſt,</hi> which is <hi>committed</hi> unto them: <hi>They watch for Souls, as they that muſt give Account.</hi> Heb. xiii. 17. They are intruſted with the Care of their own, and other's Souls for which they are accountable to GOD; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other, be loſt, thro' their ſinful Careleſſneſs, and Neglect: Which further ſhews the vaſt Importance of their not pleaſing Men, but GOD, ſo as to be able to give up their Account <hi>with Joy, and not with Grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what greatly adds to the Importance hereof, and makes it a Matter of infinite and everlaſting Concernment unto them, is, that herein they have to do with that GOD, <hi>who trieth their Hearts.</hi> The GOD, whom Miniſters ſerve in the Goſpel, and with whom they, as well as others, have to do, is no other than the omniſcient JEHOVAH, who claims it as his Prerogative to <hi>ſearch the Hearts, and try the Reins, even to give every Man according to his Ways, and according to the Fruit of his Doing</hi>

Diſapprobation of them, according as they have been <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> to him or not: Their being Miniſters of the Goſpel, will not prevent their being <hi>accurſed,</hi> and meeting with a <hi>heavy Doom,</hi> if they are of unſanctified Hearts and Lives, and have done the <hi>Work of the Lord deceitfully:</hi> How much ſoever they may have pleaſed, and gained the Applauſe of Men, they will be diſowned and rejected by GOD, with whom <hi>there is no Reſpect of Perſons, in the Day when he ſhall judge the Secret,</hi> as well as open Actions, <hi>of Men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Goſpel</hi>

                  <hi>Romans</hi> 11.10.</note>: However inſtrumental they may have been in ſaving other's Souls, they will loſe their own: Or however they may be able to plead in <hi>that Day,</hi> as we read <hi>many</hi> ſhall, Matt. vii. 22. <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name? And in thy Name have caſt out Devils?

            </p>
            <p>But if they have uprightly and faithfully preached the Goſpel, <hi>not as pleaſing Men, but God,</hi> and adorned it by a holy and well ordered Converſation, they ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and accepted of him, and ſhall receive <hi>a Prophets Reward</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, and be made to <hi>ſhine,</hi> with the <hi>Wiſe, as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and with them that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Star for ever and ever.</hi> Dan. xii. 3.</p>
            <p>The Words, thus conſidered, afford ſeveral uſeful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, ſuitable to the ſolemn Occaſion of this Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such as,</p>
            <p>The Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs in the Inſtitution of the <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry;</hi> not only in Regard to the ſpecial Deſign of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſpiritual Inſtruction and eternal Salvation of ignorant and ſinful Men; but alſo, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this Work to <hi>Men of like Paſſions with others,</hi> and ſo, Speaking to them, and carrying on his Treaty of

               <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with them, in a Manner beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to their Frame and Make, by ſuch <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,</hi> whoſe <hi>Terror does not make them afraid,</hi> and with whom they may freely and familiarly converſe, about their eternal Intereſt and Concerns, without any Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—</p>
            <p>The vaſt Weight and Importance of the <hi>Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> as it immediately relates to the Souls of Men, and their future eternal Intereſts, and the great Difficulty of performing it, in a right and acceptable Manner, ſo as to be <hi>unto God a ſweet Savour of Chriſt, both in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh.</hi>—A deep and awful Senſe of which made an Apoſtle, and may well make the moſt able and beſt qualified Miniſter, cry out <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe Things?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 11.10.</note>—</p>
            <p>The Care and Concern which Candidates for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhould uſe, in furniſhing themſelves for this ſacred and important Truſt, and acquiring all neceſſary and ſuitable Qualifications for it—</p>
            <p>The Caution incumbent upon Miniſters, to <hi>lay Hands ſuddenly upon no Man,</hi> and not to introduce into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry any, who are ignorant, or vicious, or in any other Reſpect, manifeſtly unqualified and unfit for it—</p>
            <p>The great Hazard and Preſumption, of weak, illete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and unqualified Men, diſorderly, thruſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into this, ſo ſacred, and tremendous an Office; and the ſinfulneſs of countenancing and Encouraging them herein—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> The Gratitude and Joy, with which People ought to receive the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who come to them in Chriſt's Name, bringing the <hi>glad Tidings of Salvation,</hi> and <hi>preaching Peace by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>—the ſingular Affection and Eſteem, which they ſhould ſhew to them, and treat them with, for their Work's Sake,—and the Reſpect and Submiſſion, which it concerns them, to yield to them, in all

their ſacred Miniſtrations, ſo as that they may prove <hi>a Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> and not <hi>a Savour of Death unto Death,</hi> unto their Souls—</p>

            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> To you <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> who are now <hi>to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel,</hi> by being ſolemnly ſeparated unto the Work of the Miniſtry in this Place,</p>
            <p>As it is, at your earneſt Requeſt, that I ſtand here your Monitor, on this ſolemn, but joyful Occaſion, ſo what has been ſaid, in the preceeding Diſcourſe. with a ſpecial View to your Inſtruction, may ſerve, in ſome Meaſure, to give you a Repreſentation of the Nature and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that great and difficult Work, which you are engaging in; and alſo to quicken you to a juſt Concern to perform it, <hi>not as pleaſing Men but God, who trieth your Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not, <hi>Sir,</hi> but you have been deeply pondering the Greatneſs, and the Difficulties of this Work, and the awful Conſequences of it, both to your own Soul, and the Souls of others, ſo as that it is, with much Fear and Trembling, ſelf Diffidence, and an humble Dependance on the Grace and Strength of the All-ſufficient <hi>Redeemer,</hi> you undertake it. It certainly behoves you to conſecrate yourſelf unto GOD, in this Service, under a deep and awful Senſe of the Solemnity and Importance of it, and your own Inſufficiency for it. And having received this Truſt, now to be committed to you, it will lie upon you to diſcharge it, with the utmoſt Integrity and Faithfulneſs, becoming a Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:007425_0012_102D84FB1C863F00"/>You will therefore, according to that <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation 1.

            </p>
            <p>You will ſee to it <hi>in the firſt Place,</hi> that your own Soul be formed and attempered to the Religion of the Goſpel, That you gain an intimate, experimental, and ſaving Knowledge of, and Acquaintance with thoſe divine Truths, which you are to preach unto others: Leſt, by any Means, when you have <hi>preached</hi> to them, you your <hi>ſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>You will faithfully warn the <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Impenitent,</hi> ſet before them their Sin and Danger, and endeavour, by all the powerful Perſuaſives of the Goſpel to bring them to Repentance, and to eſpouſe them to Jeſus Chriſt: Leſt they ſhould die in their Sins, and their <hi>Blood</hi> ſhould be <hi>required</hi> at your <hi>Hands.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In a Word, you will be careful to <hi>adorn</hi> and <hi>recommend</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> by a blameleſs and well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Converſation; <hi>giving none Offence in any Thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed; but in all Things approving your ſelf as a Miniſter of God in much Pattence. in Afflictions, in Neceſſities, in Diſtreſſes,—in Labours, in Watchings, in Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by Pureneſs, by Knowledge, by Long-ſuffering, by Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by Love unfeigned, by the Word of Truth, by the Power of God, by the Armour of Righteouſneſs on the Right Hand, and on the Left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for your Support, Comfort, and Encouragement, remember, that however weak and inſufficient you are, in your ſelf, for this Work; yet he, who hath called you unto it, <hi>is able to make all Grace abound towards you,</hi> in ſpiritual as well as temporal Regards; <hi>that you always having all Sufficiency in all Things, may abound to every good Work:</hi> In a continual Dependance therefore upon his Aid and Aſſiſtance, go forth, and <hi>ſtand,</hi> and <hi>feed</hi> both the <hi>Sheep,</hi> and the <hi>Lambs,</hi> of this <hi>Flock,</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Strength of the Lord.</hi>
