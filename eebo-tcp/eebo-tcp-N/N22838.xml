            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MANY have been much divided in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and various their conjectures, upon the cauſes from which the late fever took its riſe; which raged in Charleſton with ſuch malignancy, during the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of the preſent aera of 1796.</p>
            <p>Some of the gentlemen of the faculty alſo ſeem much divided in their opinions in regard to its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, as well as to the curative part, or treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſeaſe, and particularly ſo in reſpect to blood-letting.</p>

            <head>An ESSAY on FEVERS.</head>
            <p>IT will appear neceſſary in the firſt place to lay down the ſymptoms generally attendant on the fever alluded to, throughout its different ſtages.—And this end may be beſt accompliſhed by a detail of its various ſymptoms, by quoting the following caſe <note n="*" place="bottom">The patient alluded to was a man about forty-nine years of age, and neither of a plethoric nor groſs habit of body.</note> which came under the immediate eye of the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in the line of his practice; and at the ſame time, lay down the curative part and the regimen which he purſued.</p>
            <p>On Monday the 23d of Auguſt, 1796, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent complained of non-appetency, naucea and vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fulneſs, tenſion, and pain at the ſtomach; the viſcera tenſe and full; the tongue clammy and foul; the ſtate of the pulſe irregular and ſluggiſh; together with laſſitude and proſtration of ſpirits. Had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a gentle emetic of the Vin: Ipecac: &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim: and in the evening to a lenient purgative, both

of which reſpectively operated well, and in the courſe of the day ſupplied the diſeaſed plentifully with light attenuating and diluting drinks.</p>
            <p>24th. The ſymptoms (as above recited) ſeemed to increaſe; perſpiration became impeded; chill ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours were ſucceeded by fluſhing heats. The pulſe at times high and changeable; pains in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and between the ſcapula's, which extended ſeemingly under the plate of the ſternum to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and belly; the urine reddiſh and ſmall in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; purged freely, the ſtools of a darkiſh hue; had recourſe to antiphlogiſtics, and ſupplied plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with diluting and attenuating drinks.</p>
            <p>25th. The ſymptoms nearly the ſame as yeſterday, excepting that the pulſe roſe from ſeventy to ninety-eight; was changeable, and attended at times with a tremulous motion and great ſtricture. The tongue ſcruffed over with a thick yellow mucus, and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed on each margin with liſts of a darkiſh hue; the uvula and tonſils red and much inflamed; the head much engaged; the urine red and ſmall in quantity. Had free recourſe to purgatives and the antiphlogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic line, although no viſible abatement took place in any of the ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3"

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ea frequent; the head much engaged; general laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; the thirſt urgent; and petechiae appeared over the ſurface of the ſkin. This day had recourſe to the antimonial wine; purged freely; gave alſo the antiſpaſmodic medicines, and drank plentifully of light diaphoretic and diluting drinks.</p>
            <p>27th. The pulſe much lower at times, with an obſtructed tremulous motion, and again its vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quicker, in ſo much, that little dependence could be placed on their irregular ſtate. The head, at times, much engaged and diſtracted; the tongue dry and ſcruffed; the urine reddiſh; the heat of body much increaſed; the ſtate of the viſcera continued tenſe and painful to the touch. Had recourſe to free purgings; the antiſpaſmodic line; neutral ſalts, and gave plentifully of light attenuating and diaphoretic drinks.</p>
            <p>28th. The pulſe unequal and changeable, at times quick and weak; again ſluggiſh and tremulous; the heat of the body great, and the petechiae over the ſurface of the ſkin; the urine turgid and ſtill ſmall in quantity; the ſtomach and neighbouring viſcera
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030167_0005_0FE4F69237F06770"/>
tenſe and ſore to the touch. Purged copiouſly, and followed the ſame line as yeſterday was adopted.</p>
            <p>29th. The ſtate of the pulſe very irregular and unequal in meaſure; the heat of body great; the laſſitude and proſtration of ſpirits infinite; the urine turgid and ſmall in quantity, and the tongue dry and liſted; the head much engaged with delirium, and no remiſſion or intermiſſion appeared in anywiſe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative of a ſtate at this time; the antiſpaſmodic line purſued until about twelve o'clock, when the pain in the head increaſed over the coronal ſuture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> down to the ſphinoidals, and extended along the os frontis, ſo as to become intolerable, which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with delirium, &amp;c. At this time the pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came tenſe and tremulous, and at other times, quick hard and irregular; the viſcera continued hard, full and painful to the touch, although perfectly open. Now had recourſe to the cardiac and diaphoretic medicines, caſtor, camph. moſch. rad. ſerpent. virg. &amp;c. with plentiful draughts of light attenuating and diluting drinks, until about eleven o'clock at night, at which time a critical and moſt profuſe ſweat broke out, which continued for two hours, and relieved the pains of the head, delirium, &amp;c. The perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dried off, and returned in two hours after, and continued until half paſt five o'clock on Monday the 30th, which produced a favorable and perfect ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:030167_0005_0FE4F69237F06770"/>It is not unworthy of our attention to remark, that none of the ſymptoms in this fever had ever abated, but rather went on uniformly increaſing until about the time of the criſis being had, except a mitigation of the pains in the extremities, and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid intervals of thoſe in the head. The ſtate of the pulſe variable and uncertain, and at times very little or no dependence to be relyed on their ſtate. The tongue conſtantly ſcruffed over, dry and liſted; the heat of body great; the ſtomach and viſcera tenſe, and ſore to the touch; the urine turgid, reddiſh, and ſmall in quantity.</p>
            <p>In fine, every expedient was tried, and every mode adopted, which a regular line of theory might direct, or a judicious courſe of practice point out.</p>
            <p>From the recital of the above caſe, the ſymptoms of this fever (as alluded to) may eaſily be diſcovered, and in order ſtill to throw as clear a light as poſſible in this point, it may not be improper if we examine into the primary cauſes of fevers, and alſo into the ſtate of the blood, and its circulating powers; and how it may be actuated upon by blood-letting, and various other cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030167_0006_0FE4F69D19E4D478"/>At the ſame time lay down a regular line for the curative part and regimen moſt expedient to be adopted in this fatal diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The cauſes which principally may give riſe to this fever (as a learned author ſays) ſeems to be in ſome caſes owing to a plethora, ſuppoſed to owe its origin to a preternatural fulneſs and diſtention of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous veſſels from too great and increaſed a quantity of blood and juices in general.</p>
            <p>But upon a more minute enquiry it will appear to be owning to a ſuperabundant quantity of the fibrous craſſamentum, or more ſizy parts of the blood, in proportion to the ferous or thinner; which becomes difficult to be circulated through the ſmaller and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute capillary veſſels; or propelled from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the arterial into the venal ſyſtem, whence diſtention and dilitation of the arteries, an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to free, eaſy, and ready circulation of the blood, and an increaſed reſiſtance to the force and action of the heart are the conſequences.</p>
            <p>The curative part much depends on deplating the veſſels and attenuating the blood. This can beſt be effected by gentle and moderate bleedings, lenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> purgatives, the volatile and neutral ſalts, and plent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of diluting and attenuating drinks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030167_0006_0FE4F69D19E4D478"/>This malady may alſo originate from obſtructed perſpiration, or a ſtoppage of the cutaneous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by cold, which often proves to be the cauſe.</p>
            <p>To obtain that much deſired relief reſolution bids the faireſt, as our firſt attempt ſhould be to reduce the febrile impetus to proper and moderate bounds and to remove or diminiſh the cauſe of the diſeaſe by judicious blood-letting in the beginning, which ſhould be repeated as the urgency of the caſe may require, and the violence of the ſymptoms direct.</p>
            <p>Many cauſes may be aſſigned as the parent of this diſorder, and other claſſes of fevers.</p>
            <p>In every fever the pulſe becomes quicker than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the functions of the body more or leſs impaired or viciated. The cauſes of fevers will then be ſuch as by their irritation can quicken the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and excite ſpaſmodic conſtrictions in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the body; and thoſe may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into general and particular. The general or epedemic fevers may effect a whole family or city, and for the moſt part depends on putreſſent mias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, or infectious particles lodged in the air, or upon its manifeſt qualities, ſuch as heat or cold, moiſture or dryneſs, &amp;c.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>The particular cauſes of fevers, or ſuch as affect individuals only, may be referred to three claſſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1st. To purulent fomes from confined matter within the body, the conſequence of ſuppuration.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. To a putreſſent, acrimonious ſtate of the juices, occaſioned by putrid bilious fomes.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. To obſtructed perſpiration.</p>
            <p>From fevers of the firſt claſs, belong thoſe hectical and and colliquative. From the ſecond claſs, thoſe of the putrid malignant kind. From the third claſs or obſtructed perſpiration, acute, inflammatory, (according to the habit of body of the patient,) low nervous, rheumatic, and intermittent fevers.</p>
            <p>The curative indications in fevers in general may be thus reduced.—The firſt to correct and expel the cauſes which by its irritation it originated. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond will depend upon proper management and a juſt regulation of the powers of nature, keeping the febrile impetus within due bounds for the proper coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the febrile matter. The third will conſiſt in providing for the relief of the moſt urgent ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>The ſymptoms in fevers moſt frequent and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome are—In the beginning cold ſhiverings ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by fluſhing heat, nau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030167_0007_0FE4F69F03D2FD18"/>
anxiety, a diarrhea, petechiae, profuſe ſweatings, watchings, delirium, comatoſe affections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. Theſe being the effects, as that is abated will often ceaſe, but by removing and weakening the cauſe which produced them, we arrive at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate.</p>
            <p>The ſymptoms attendant on the preſent fever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on an inflammatory or ſpaſmodic affection of the ſeveral organs, a quickened circulation, or too denſe and viſſid a ſtate of the fluids.</p>
            <p>The cold ſhiverings ſtrongly indicate a ſpaſmodic ſtricture of the ſmaller or capillary veſſels; the heat that ſucceeds depends on the increaſed and quickened circulation, and ſometimes upon an inteſtinal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or putreſſent fermentation in the blood and juices.</p>
            <p>The heat is to be mitigated by abating its cauſe. If from an increaſed circulation, by evacuations and antiphlogiſtics; if from a putrid cauſe, by anticeptics and gentle diaphoretic medicine, ſuch as vegetable acids, neutral ſalts, bark, together with a proper cardiac regimen, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A nauſea and vomiting will be owing to either an acrimonious, putrid, bilious matter, collected in the ſtomach and prima viae villicating their coats and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritating to excretion, or ſlight convulſive motions
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030167_0008_0FE4F6A086074DF0"/>
excited in the ſtomach and neighbouring viſcera, by a determination of the febrile cauſe to theſe parts; and is beſt relieved by emetics, the antimonial and ipecucuanha wines, &amp;c. and afterwards by anodine and cardiac draughts.</p>
            <p>Anxiety may be occaſioned by any cauſe that may impede the circulation through the lungs, and prevent the free egreſs of the blood from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles to the heart. This will depend either on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory or ſpaſmodic affections of the lungs; when owing to the former cauſe the antiphlogiſtic regimen ſhould be adopted; but when owing to the latter, the warm cordial and antiſpaſmodic line ought then to be purſued.</p>
            <p>The petechiae or exanthemata which often breaks out on the ſkin in febrile diſeaſes, may be critical or ſymptomatic; in this fever they ſeem to be ſymptoms only, and neither leſſen or increaſe the diſeaſe, for as the fever abates the petechiae will gradually diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>Profuſe ſweating often proves injurious by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the patient and depriving the blood of its thinner or more aquaous parts; eſpecially in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, in weak conſtitutions or habits, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

            <p>Watchings or want of reſt in this fever is to be relieved by abating the cauſe of reſtleſneſs; the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and unuſual contraction and tention of the maninges and nervous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ibillae of the brain, or by adminiſtering thoſe medicines which allay irritation; opiates in various forms claim the firſt place.</p>
            <p>Delirium, if from inflammation, or too increaſed an impetus of the circulation, the antiphlogiſtic regimen bids faireſt and moſt expedient. If from ſpaſms and too languid a circulation, which in general is the caſe, it will be found neceſſary to keep up the circulation, and reſolve the ſpaſms by cordial, cephalic and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſmodic remedies, by bark, moſch, caſtor, cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, ſerpentaria and aſſafoetida, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Convulſions and twitchings of the tendons, the laſt ſtage in fevers, depend on ſome irritation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done the brain or its coverings, from preceding inflammation, ſuppurations, and the like, alſo on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weakneſs from innanition.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of delyria and pervigilia may prove the cauſe of convulſions alſo. Warm cordial ſtimulants,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030167_0009_0FE4F6A219D864E0"/>
moſch, caſtor, ſerpentaria, &amp;c. bid faireſt to anſwer the deſired end.</p>
            <p>This fever may be judged of from the conſtitution of the patient; a quick, full and tenſe pulſe, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, great heat and thirſt, and acute pains in the head, back and limbs, &amp;c. It naturally ſeems moſt expedient to lower the circulating powers, and to moderate properly the febrile impetus; this is to be effected by evacuations and antiphlogiſtics. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial wine proves ſerviceable when judiciouſly adminiſtered in the firſt ſtage of this fever; the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diaphoretics and neutral ſalts, with plenty of light diluting and attenuating drinks, to promote a gentle diaphoreſis; and about the ſeventh or eighth day a ſalutary criſis moſt probably may take place, by ſweat, turbid urine or looſe ſtools.</p>
            <p>But if at the latter end of this diſeaſe, the pulſe ſhould flag, the antiphlogiſtic medicines muſt be diſcontinued and a cordial regimen ſubſtituted: and if an intermiſſion ſhould happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or even a remiſſion, with gentle ſweats and a turbid urine, the bark ſhould be thrown in as our ſole dependence.</p>
            <p>It may appear worthy of atttention, that this fever was for the moſt part confined to Europeans and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030167_0009_0FE4F6A219D864E0"/>
tranſient perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had arrived here from different parts, or came from other parts or ſtates in the union. To all ſuch it proved moſt mortal; and where bleedings was moſt copiouſly had, ſtill leſſer advantages reſulted.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper in this place if we ſhould make a few remarks on the ſtate, courſe, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood, and at the ſame time endeavor to prove how far bleeding may prove uſeful or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let us obſerve, that it is from the blood all the other juices of the body are ſecreted, and leſt it ſhould coagulate or ſtagnate, is in perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through every part of the body; and that all its offices depend on the circulation of the blood, which cannot be ſuppreſſed for a few minutes, without being attended with the moſt direful effects. The blood, in its progreſſive motion, is conveyed from the heart to the arteries, to all parts of the body, and brought back again by the veins, into the ſinus venoſus; it is then protruded into the right or ſuperior auricle and ventricle; from the right ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the heart it is forced into the pulmonary artery, and after circulating through the lungs, is returned by the pulmonary vein into the left or
<pb n="14"
                   facs="unknown:030167_0010_0FE4F6A926D62B50"

inferior auricle and ventricle; from the left ventricle it is expelled into the aorta, by whoſe converging branches it is tranſported from the extremities of the ſmall arteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the naſcent or inſipient veins, through them paſſes into their larger branches until it arrives at their termination, the heart, from whence it is as before diſcharged into the arterial ſyſtem, again in a perpetual round to traverſe the body.</p>
            <p>The blood returning into the cavoe and pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary veins, and ruſhing into the heart by its cavities, will, in ſuch manner, ſtimulate and affect its ſenſible nerves and fibres, as to bring it immediately into contraction; if the blood ſhould become acrid, as from infectious miamata, an impeded excretion of the acrimonious perſpirable particles, an abſorbed purulent matter, &amp;c. by its increaſed ſtimulus, it will excite the heart to quicker motion or vibrations, febrile ſymptoms muſt take place; or by heat or exerciſe of body, which ratify the blood and cauſe it to be more determined to the heart; more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the cavities being diſtended, its contractions will be more frequently repeated, and the contained fluids expelled with more force, and circulated with an increaſed velocity through the body.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtole, or contraction of the heart is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed by its relaxation or diaſtole, for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030167_0010_0FE4F6A926D62B50"/>
the ventricles, by their action, having expelled the blood which they contained into the aorta and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary arteries, their componant fibres will loſe that tenſion and firmneſs which the moment before they were poſſeſſed of; at this time the contraction of the arteries begins:—For the blood being expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the heart, with a force conſiderably exceeds the reſiſtance they can yield, will dilate them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract their fibres, and may ſlightly ſtimulate their internal ſuperſicies: This their dilitation and the change, from a leſs to that of a greater capacity, thereby occaſioned, is called the pulſe, the diaſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of which is an expanſion of the artery beyond its natural circumference.</p>
            <p>The arteries thus diſtended and irritated by the ſtimulus of the forcibly impelled blood, from an inherent contractile power, which is natural and common to them, as conſiſting of circular elaſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fibres, are immediately conſtringed and return to their former diameter, by expreſſing a quantity of blood into the venous ſyſtem, proportionable to that with which they had been dilated beyond their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary capacities; and the arteries, by this means, being diſengaged from the wave of blood emitted by the ventricles, the diſtention and ſtimulus thereby
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030167_0011_0FE4F6AE76D15B10"/>
occaſioned, will ceaſe, till they are again overſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood protruded into them at each ſyſtole of the heart, in conſequence of which they are again excited to contract themſelves.</p>
            <p>And this alternate motion and contraction muſt continue, whilſt life and the circulation of the blood endure.</p>
            <p>From what hath been already advanced, it will appear, that from the pulſe may be had much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to form a judgment as to the circulating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; a full ſtrong pulſe will denote that the blood abounds in the body, and that it is expelled in large quantities at each contraction of the heart into the arterial ſyſtem; as on the contrary, a weak languid pulſe will evince that the blood does not exceed in quantity, nor is it circulated with too great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity through the body. A quick and ſtrong pulſe will argue that there is a diſpoſition to a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora, at the ſame time a ſtimulus to excite to more repeated contractions the circulating powers, as a quick and weak pulſe will prove that there is rather a deficiency in the quantity and conſiſtence of the fluids; but at the ſame time a ſtimulating acrimony, or a diſpoſition to irritability in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids themſelves, beyond the neceſſary bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030167_0011_0FE4F6AE76D15B10"/>The actions of the heart and blood-veſſels will variouſly affect the circulating fluids, as they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a greater or a leſſer degree of ſtrength and elaſticity.</p>
            <p>It is to theſe that we are indebted for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of chyle into milk, and at length into blood; and this will vary in its denſity and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of the ſyſtem of the ſolids, and the circulation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with greater or leſſer vigour.</p>
            <p>The ſtrong elaſtic veſſels act forcibly upon their contained fluids, whence a greater friction and attrition of the blood and veſſels againſt each other, an increaſed heat and diſſipation of the more watery particles, the craſſamentum is wrought up to a higher degree of denſity, and abounds in full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſerous parts.</p>
            <p>The blood and juices in ſuch conſtitutions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for this reaſon, more denſe, compact and viſcid, which will be manifeſted by examining the blood of a robuſt man who uſes much exerciſe, which always will appear of this kind.</p>
            <p>Even in diſeaſes in which the vital actions are too much encreaſed, as in ardent fevers and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030167_0012_0FE4F6AFFA0FB178"/>
diſeaſes the maſs of blood is ſoon rendered denſe and tenaccous, and covered with a phlogiſtic lentor.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, where the veſſels are too weak and the circulation lunguid, the fluids of the body cannot be ſufficiently acted upon, or wrought up to a degree of denſity and a proper conſiſtence, whence the blood has the appearance of a diſſolved watry fluid, not ſufficiently prepared for the ſtrength and nouriſhment of the body, or the purpoſes of the animal economy, nor circulated with a force ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preſerve and maintain the vital heat.</p>
            <p>And hence ariſes a petuitous lentor in the ſerum, which under theſe circumſtances is not ſufficiently attenuated, or its particles divided; whence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions in the veſſels, cachecxies and innumerable other complaints ſucceed. In diſeaſes likewiſe in which the vital actions are depreſſed, the pulſe is ſmall and weak, the heat of body leſſened, and the texture of the blood diſſolved with a ſuperabundant quantity of ſerum.</p>
            <p>To the circulation of the blood rightly and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably performed, we are indebted for life, health, and at laſt a gradual decay or old age. But if by
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030167_0012_0FE4F6AFFA0FB178"/>
any means the blood in its rotatory motion ſhould be impeded or diſturbed, it will become certainly the natural parent of diſeaſes and of death. So long as the blood and humours are circulated through the ducts and canals of the body, an animal will live, but no ſooner does the circulation ceaſe and become extinguiſhed, than death ſucceeds life. If the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation through every part ſhould be performed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, aequably moderately and agreeably, ſo long we remain ſound and healthy; but in every diſeaſe we find the circulation too much increaſed, decreaſed, immoderate or unequal; and morbific cauſes in a great meaſure is productive of diſeaſes, by diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and impeding the economy of the vital motions, and perverting the ſecretions and excretions.</p>
            <p>From what has already been advanced on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of phlebotomy, when it becomes uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and when it is to be avoided. For as the circulating powers may be variouſly affected by an evacuation of blood, as ſometimes in a plethora, where the veſſels are too much diſtended, a moderate blood-letting will greatly tend to a free and eaſy motion of the fluids. On the contrary, we know of no remedy that will ſo ſpeedily weaken the powers of nature and impetus of the circulation, and produce
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030167_0013_0FE4F6B18232CE20"/>
ſo immediate and univerſal a weakneſs. For as the influx of the blood into the cavities of the heart ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the cauſe which excites it to action (as before obſerved) it muſt follow that when the vital fluids is exhauſted, the quantity to be returned to the heart will be leſſened, therefore the ſtrength of its muſcular contraction will be impeded. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the arteries now not ſufficiently diſtended, will be abated; the circulating powers will flag, and may be reduced to any degree at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>As bleeding weakens and deſtroys the action of the veſſels and organical parts, upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it leſſens the heat of the body and the motion and impetus of the blood throughout the whole vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſyſtem. For as the friction and attrition of the fluids againſt the ſolids are a chief cauſe of heat in living animals, it is evident that by taking away the cauſe which excites the heart to action, the force and ſtrength of its muſcular contraction may be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any degree; and further, it may be ſaid with certainty, by blood-letting alone we may reduce the motion and impetus of the humours and give ſo great a check to life and the circulation, when too impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or beyond meaſure excited in acute diſeaſes, as to induce a general langour, and by procraſtinating
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030167_0013_0FE4F6B18232CE20"/>
the evacuation, can bring on a deliquium animi, of even death itſelf, by which both heat and motion will moſt effectually be ſtopped, and ceaſe.</p>
            <p>It will therefore appear evident what effects are conſequent to blood-letting, and thoſe can only be from the following:</p>
            <p>In a plethora, a moderate bleeding muſt tend to deplate and free the veſſels and organical parts when over diſtended, with a thick, denſe blood, by which means it promotes and increaſes the circulation of the fluids, the eaſy, free contractions of the arteries, and the elaſticity of the veſſels, at the ſame time conduces to the attrition, attenuation and motion of the blood; reſtores the natural and ready exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the body; depraved by a ſuperabundant quantity of humours, diſtending the veſſels and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circulation, and by thoſe means relieves in many and various diſeaſes, and produces many and great changes in the animal economy.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, bleeding will prove of all others the moſt ſpeedy and efficacious to weaken the action and elaſticity of the heart and arteries, and to lower the impetus of the circulation; for inſtance, in acute inflammatory diſeaſes, where the blood is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030167_0014_0FE4F6BA429AA810"/>
too rapidly and impetuouſly propelled, will afford an immediate and ſpeedy relief, but if profuſely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciouſly and unſeaſonably uſed, where there is neither a real plethora or increaſed impetus of the circulation, by lowering the vis vitae, will retard the cure of many diſeaſes, and at the ſame time relax the ſolids and leſſen the bodily heat; retards the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, diminiſhes the ſtrength, diſſolves and thins the fluids, and is productive of various evils, by the body becoming weak, infirm and cachectic. In fine, in all caſes from a relaxed ſtate of the ſolids, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſtate of blood and a weak languid circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, blood-letting ſhould be avoided, as increaſing all the ſymptoms and contrary to all the intentions of cure.</p>
            <p>Much hath been advanced on this ſubject, and it now becomes neceſſary in the laſt place to obſerve that in moſt ſeaſons, about the autumn of the year, fevers of the putrid and inflammatory claſſes, manifeſt themſelves in South-Carolina, which, according to the ſtate of the weather become more or leſs violent and prevalent. It would therefore be found moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable in perſons coming from Europe or elſewhere, not to adventure here during thoſe months, or any but from the middle of October until the firſt part of

June, as in a great meaſure they might become ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to the climate, and have leſs to dread from the ſudden and frequent tranſitions ſo common here.</p>
            <p>Tranſient perſons who come and ſtay but a ſhort time, have not that danger to dread, and thoſe who arrive here in future, would find it infinitely ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and beneficial to them, immediately on their arrival, to make the proper evacuations by emetics, cathartics, and other neceſſary evacuations or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according as the habits of body or conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſpectively, might ſeem moſt expedient.</p>
