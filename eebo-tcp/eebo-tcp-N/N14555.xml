            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the COMMITTEE of the third Preſbyterian Church in the City of Philadelphia.</head>
            <p>AT your requeſt, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the following Diſcourſe ventures abroad, in a divided world of cenſure and approbation. It was deſigned, by a ſummary ſurvey of the conteſt wherein our country has been engaged, to excite gratitude to God, in your hearts and my own, for his great goodneſs beſtowed upon us. If it's publication ſerve to promote this temper in the minds of any, into whoſe hands it may fall, the tribute of praiſe, that ſhall aſcend for the ſalvation ſhown us, will in part be yours. If it fail of this end, the fault muſt be aſcribed to the author, or the reader: For, ſurely, the ſubject loudly demands our warmeſt thanks to the ſupreme Diſpoſer of all events; who, by an admirable diſplay of his providential govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has done great things for us. And, if in ſome future day, when the leiſure hand ſhall be diſturbing the repoſe of ſome coſt by neglected papers, that may have ſtollen their way down ſo far, this diſcourſe may attract the curious eye, and detain the attention a few moments; and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, in any meaſure, to recal the ſcene of our conflict, with one ſentiment of gratitude to God, and a kind remembrance of thoſe who have borne the heat of the day, and thoſe who have aided our cauſe; I ſhall account it a greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than to have claimed a mountain of Peru or Mexico, as my own.</p>

            <head>A SERMON, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AN event of ſuch magnitude and importance, as that which has occaſioned our conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to day, accompliſhed in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, and with ſo ſmall a ſhare of difficulty in compariſon of what might have been expected, is one of thoſe occurrences in the kingdom of providence that command the admiration of every obſerver. And whilſt it affords an irrefragable argument (to convince even an <hi>Athieſt</hi>) that the MOST HIGH ruleth over the affairs of men, and raiſeth up, and caſteth down, at his pleaſure; demands alſo our warmeſt gratitude to that GOD, who has done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</p>
            <p>With a view therefore to aſſiſt in this delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice; permit me to invite your attention to thoſe emphatical words of the Prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66.8. <q>
                  <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing? who hath ſeen ſuch things? ſhall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? ſhall a nation be born at once? for as ſoon as Zion travailed, ſhe brought forth her children!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This paſſage, it muſt be confeſſed, has a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt reſpect to that happy period, generally termed the latter day glory; when the various nations of the earth, formerly ſtiled Gentiles, and yet in darkneſs, ſhall in a ſudden and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018451_0004_0FA76CB43259C928"/>
manner, be converted to the knowledge and obedience of Chriſt: And the Jews, ſo long rejected of God, ſhall by an admirable diſplay of divine power and grace, be gathered home from their diſperſion, as in one day; and being formed into a people in their own land, ſhall become the moſt remarkable and leading part of the chriſtian church, in activity and zeal for their God, and for JESUS THE SAVIOUR, their then acknowledged MESSIAH. The former of thoſe events appears deſigned, by the earth bringing forth in a day; and the latter, by a nation viz. the Jewiſh, being born to God at once. Both which, taken together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will conſtitute that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate of affairs, which the apoſtle terms life from the dead. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. 11.15.</note> But as the prophet has evidently in view to awake our attention to the hand of God, in his works of wonder among the children of men: and it is not without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in ſacred record, to accommodate paſſages to ſimilar events; <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Jer. 31.15.</note> the importance of that event we celebrate to day; and the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able interpoſition of the providence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo manifeſtly diſplayed therein, will I truſt, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently juſtify my applying the paſſage before us to the preſent occaſion. <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Matt. 2.18.</note> To which alſo, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with peculiar propriety adapted. For who indeed hath heard ſuch a thing? who, but a few years back, would have believed the report, had a prophet himſelf declared it? his creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, at leaſt, and marks of authority, had firſt been carefully ſcann'd with a critical eye. Who,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018451_0005_0FA76CB64EAF7DB0"/>
ſince time began, hath ſeen ſuch events take place ſo ſoon? The earth has indeed brought forth, as in a day. A nation has indeed been born, as at once. It has not been Iſrael's forty years of tedious wilderneſs journey; nor Rome's, or the United Belgic provinces, long continued ſcene of arduous, dubious ſtruggle: But almoſt as ſoon as our American Zion began to travail; and without experiencing the pangs and pains which apprehenſive fear expected; ſhe brought forth her children, more numerous than the tribes of Jacob, to poſſeſs the land, from the north to the ſouth, and from the eaſt to the yet unexplored, far diſtant weſt: That with great propriety, may we hail every friend of liberty, on this auſpicious day, in the language nearly following our text; rejoice ye, with America, and be glad with her, all ye that love her, rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourned for her. For thus ſaith the Lord, behold, I will extend peace to her, like a river, and glory, like a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream. Here then, as from one of thoſe hills from whence the tents of Jacob were viewed of old, let us look back, on what God hath done; and contemplate the proſpect he opens before us. And may he, in whoſe hand are the hearts of the children of men, inſpire every breaſt with a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of his goodneſs, ſo liberally beſtowed through the whole.—The Britiſh monarch had formed a deſign (for actions ſpeak louder than words) to reduce theſe ſtates, then Britiſh colonies, into abſolute vaſſalage. A venal Parliament had
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018451_0006_0FA76CB6C17E7A10"/>
approved the unrighteous purpoſe; and paſſed a decree to bind us in all caſes, both civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, to the obedience of ſuch laws as they might ſee meet to enact. Some have aſcribed this extravagant conduct to the ſame ſpirit of jealouſy, which once influenced the councils of Egypt againſt the houſe of Joſeph; left waxing too powerful, they might break off their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and purſue a ſeparate intereſt of their own. Pharaoh, indeed, might have reaſon to fear, becauſe Iſrael were an entirely different people; and in their religion and manners ſeparated far from the people of the land. But in the preſent caſe, though the court of Britain appear carefully to have copied the Egyptian model; and their meaſures have produced a ſimilar event; yet, as the people of theſe States were the ſame as the people of Britain, their religion and manners the ſame; and no diſpoſition to ſeparate from them had ever appeared: But an attachment, even to enthuſiaſtic fondneſs, had always obtained; it muſt have required an exorbitant ſhare of infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to have raiſed a ſuſpicion ſo high, as to produce the ſpirit and zeal that directed the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh cabinet. To raiſe a revenue, and bring America to bear her proportion of the national debt has been aſſigned as the motive. America, by centring her trade in Britain, contributed her liberal ſhare, nor had ſhe ever witheld her blood or her treaſure when requiſitions were made; that even malevolence itſelf had been nonpluſſed from thence to derive a plea, unleſs through a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018451_0007_0FA76CB9DF8FAE70"/>
mad deſire to take by compulſion, what would otherwiſe be cheerfully given. It ſeems therefore moſt probable, his Britannic Majeſty wiſhed to increaſe the power of the crown, ſo as to wreſt the very ſhadow of liberty out of the hands of all his ſubjects, and reign an abſolute monarch; and for this end began where he hoped, by bribes and craft, to cloak his deſign under the cover of Parliamentary ſanction. It may be, he deſired to urge America to arms; that being vanquiſhed (which ſeems to have been taken as a granted point) and her principal men, and all who ſhould dare to oppoſe his views, having either fallen in the field, or been executed as traitors, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to fly to ſome foreign land; the whole of the country, with the ſubdued, daſtardly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants that remained, might revert to the crown. This, with it's native conſequences of American lords and vaſſals, all at the monarch's pleaſure, muſt ſoon have weighed down the liberty of Britain. Or, perhaps he expected to intimidate into ſubmiſſion, by the appearance of a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined military force. This charity would fondly perſuade us to admit, as being the leaſt wicked of the two. And in that caſe, an hoſt of place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and penſioners, with their influence among a people, deſtitute of ſpirit and ſubdued by threats; though not ſo ſuddenly, would yet as certainly have produced the deſired effect: And finally impoſed the ſame humiliating terms on Britain herſelf. But whatever might be the motive, America was marked out, for ſervile
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018451_0008_0FA76CBB43869298"/>
ſubmiſſion, or ſevere ſubjugation: and the power of Britain employed to accompliſh the end. A day now roſe, lowering thick with dark and heavy clouds, A ſcene now opened, painful to the mind only to review. On the one hand, to reſign every deareſt birthright pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege; and bow down unconditional to foreign maſters, from whom we had nothing to expect, but ſovereign contempt, and heavy burdens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; who, by their remote ſituation, could neither ſee our calamity, nor partake in our ſufferings. Or on the other hand, to wage war with the moſt formidable power on earth, that had been for ages a terror to the nations; and had lately riſen into a ſtate of grandeur and glory far ſurpaſſing all her former greatneſs. A nation long inured to war: Her fleets commanding the ocean: Her troops numerous and veteran; and in martial deeds, famed as inferior to none: Her wealth immenſe: Her reſources many: And her pride and miſtaken ſenſe of honor prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to exert every nerve, to ſecure a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with her claims and demands. Hard alternative! to reſign liberty, or wage this hazardous war. And yet none other remained. America had her numerous huſbandmen, her merchants and mechanics; and her ſons of the learned profeſſions, and ſtudents in every ſcience. Her inhabitants were many: But untaught in the policy of courts and cabinets; and ſtrangers from the art of war: And divided into different colonies, under different forms of government,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018451_0009_0FA76CBC14F5F780"/>
had ſcarce ever communicated ſentiments on a ſingle point. Armies ſhe had none; nor a ſingle ſhip of war to protect her coaſt. Arms and ammunition had never been her care; and her money ſcarce ſufficient for common occaſions. Reſources 'tis true there were; but as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious metal lies hid in the unſought-for oar, they remained unexplored and unknown. In this ſituation, ſhall ſhe dare to provoke the vengeance of Britain? a ſtoical obſerver would have pronounced it madneſs. But LIBERTY was the prize. She choſe "FREEDOM or DEATH" as her motto; and nobly reſolved on war with all it's horrors; that at leaſt, her laſt expiring groan might breathe forth FREEDOM. Already had Britain planted her baleful banner on our coaſt; and her proud inſulting flag had poſſeſſed our harbours. Her oppreſſive edicts had gone forth; and her naval and military ſtrength were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to enforce obedience. As the careful mariner watches the heavy gathering cloud, and dreads the approaching ſtorm; America, with anxiety beheld, and waited the event. Prudence would have ſeemed to dictate an early reſiſtance to manifeſt hoſtile deſigns; nor ſuffer an avowed enemy to every privilege to entrench in quiet, and ſtrengthen themſelves in a capital town. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Boſton.</note> Nor was America blind to the meaſure: but that God, who ſo early eſpouſed her cauſe, that her innocence in the caſe, and her reluctance to arms, might be evident to all, witheld her from the deed; and left Britain, on LEXINGTON's ever-memorable
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018451_0010_0FA76CBDC3AFF458"/>
day, to open the ſcene of war. Quick as the flaſh of lightning glares from pole to pole, ſo ſudden did a military ſpirit pervade theſe then United Colonies; but now, bleſſed be God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated, eſtabliſhed States. The peaceful huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman forſook his farm; the merchant relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed his trade; the learned in the law diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their clients; the compaſſionate phyſician forgot his daily round; the mariner laid aſide his compaſs and quadrant; the mechanic reſigned his implements of employment; the ſons of ſcience ceaſed their philoſophic purſuits; and even the miſer half neglected, for a time, his gold and his gain, and the griping landlord his rents. All prepared for war, and eagerly flew to the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The delicate female herſelf forgot her timidity; and glowing with patriot zeal prompted the tardy to arms; and deſpiſed and reproached the lingerer that meanly loitered behind. Nor were thoſe of the ſacred order wanting to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when her civil and religious liberties were all at ſtake: But as became faithful watchmen, they blew the trumpet on the walls of our Zion; and ſounded an alarm for defence. From then, ſtandard was pitched againſt ſtandard; and the battle was fought with various ſucceſs, from the eaſt to the weſt, and from the north to the ſouth; and the field and the foreſt, the hills and the vallies, the ſhore and the inland parts, have all heard the ſhoutings of the warrior, and the clang of arms, and ſeen garments rolled in blood; and ſummer's ſcorching heat, and winter's parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018451_0011_0FA76CBE8ACF6138"/>
cold, borne teſtimony to American perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and valour. Nor was military proweſs only given. He that put of the ſpirit of Moſes on the elders of Iſrael, raiſed up ſenators<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and guided them in council, to conduct the affairs of his choſen American tribes; <hi>(a)</hi> and though like the Jewiſh congregation of old, the language of murmur and complaint has been heard in our land; and we have had our <hi>Korahs</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans,</hi> whoſe endeavours have been to weaken the hands of our rulers; depreciate their merit, and leſſen their eſteem in the eyes of the people; yet (I heſitate not to pronounce it) generations yet unborn will look back with wonder; and venerate the memories, and long perpetuate the names of thoſe who guided the helm through the ſtorm; nor ſunk diſmayed, whilſt ſo furious an <hi>Euroclydon</hi> of innumerable difficulties laſhed ſo ſore, and lay ſo long upon us; but have at length, by the good hand of our God upon them, brought the billow-beaten veſſel of public affairs ſafe into harbour. Theſe poſterity will admire and revere; and wiſh to have ſeen the day when thoſe men lived on the earth. A day, which commanded the attention of ſtates and kingdoms, far and wide. And as Joſhua's day arreſted the ſun in his courſe, the nations ſtood ſtill in ſilent ſurprize, to ſee the balance of war ſo nearly poized, between contending parties ſo unequal. Fondly, would the ſpark of humanity within have led them to aid the American cauſe. Their wiſh was all they durſt give: For they dreaded the omnipotent arm of Britain; nor dared to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018451_0012_0FA76CBF09D359B0"/>
awake her reſentment. The monarch of France alone was found, whoſe generous zeal for the rights of humanity inſpired him, beyond the power of every meaner conſideration. Solemn ties had bound him, to conſult the good of the people over whom he was placed: Nor could he have anſwered to his God, his conſcience, or his kingdom, to have involved the nation in the calamities of an arduous, hazardous war, had no proſpect of advantage riſen into view. God, who had early deſigned him for diſtinguiſhed honor; and raiſed him to the throne, to eſtabliſh his name and his glory, as laſting as the annals of time, as the PROTECTOR OF THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND, had therefore, by a firm decree, united the intereſt of America and France; that HIS MAJESTY might be juſt to his conſcience, his people, and his God, whilſt indulging the ardent glow of his magnanimous breaſt, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording to the diſtreſſed a vigorous aid: And his fleets and his armies were embarked in our cauſe. Let detraction therefore be ſilent, nor object the influence of intereſt, to fully the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deed. God has connected duty and intereſt, by indiſſoluble bonds; nor may either, of right, aſſume the name alone. Ancient preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, inſtilled by Britain, ſeemed to forbid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with a nation, we had long been taught to conſider faithleſs, puſillanimous, and cruel. The generoſity of France recovered the mind to judge by a candid ſcale. And as a mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe increaſed our acquaintance, the ſcales of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018451_0013_0FA76CBFC0FA4E20"/>
ignorance fell from our eyes; the miſt of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice vaniſhed: And America found herſelf united to the moſt enlightened civilized nation on earth; and rejoiced in an alliance, cemented, not by intereſt only, but the ſtrong additional bonds of cordial affection. An alliance, which may that God whoſe watchful eye guards the affairs of men, perpetuate unimpaired, while ſun and moon ſhall endure. The citizens and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of both nations embraced as brethren; and fought ſide by ſide, with united hearts and hands, in the then made common cauſe. Their only ſtrife was, who ſhould diſplay the nobleſt deeds; and render themſelves moſt worthy each other's eſteem. America's day, the morning of which had lowred with heavy clouds, began to brighten a pace; and it's hurrying hours haſtened their way to a noon tide glow. The juſtice of her cauſe; the influence of her great Ally; and the inſults and injuries experienced by other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from BRITISH ARROGANCE, procured her ſtill farther ſupport; and narrowed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the object of her wiſh. Britain ſaw, with indignation: And in firm alliance with every infernal power (for, from heaven ſhe dared not expect; nor would any on earth, Heſſe, Anſpach, and Savages excepted, afford her aid) ſhe reſolved on utmoſt vengeance: And as a Tyger in the foreſt, taken in the toiles, exerted her every effort. Nor need I here recount Monmouth, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by Catawba, or Eutaw, with the many ſore fought days on the land; or the briney ocean,

repeatedly ſtained with the generous blood of war, or the ravages that deſolated the ſouth; or the devaſtation and ruin that ranged along our coaſt; whilſt their ruthleſs ſavage allies, to the eternal infamy of thoſe who employed them, drenched the wide frontier with the warleſs blood of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs women and babes. Theſe deeds of Britain are written with the pen of remembrance on the minds of all. They are engraved, as with the point of a diamond on a rock, on the pillars of time; and handed down in the faithful hiſtoric page, ſhall long be read by ages yet to come. Nor ſhall Carolina or Georgia, New-York or Virginia, Philadelphia, Rhode-Iſland, or Boſton, be named, but grateful acknowledgments ſhall riſe of the kind deliverance afforded. And oft ſhall the traveller turn aſide to ſurvey the ſeat of Gloceſter and York in Virginia, and view the ſpot, ever to be remembred, where the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive event took place; and read inſcribed on the memorative marble, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">A marble Pillar appointed by Congreſs to be erected there.</note> the important victory there obtained. The inhabitant, inſtructed from father to ſon, ſhall bear him company, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the various parts of the ſcene. <q>On this point, the <hi>blood-ſtained</hi> Britiſh general, Lord Cornwallis, held his garriſon. Yonder the Great WASHINGTON &amp; Illuſtrious ROCHAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEAU made their firſt approach. Acroſs that rivulet, and through that valley, ran their firſt parallel; and where now that range of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſtands, they drew their ſecond.

                  <hi>Gallic Bravery:</hi> And there the Americans ſtormed and conquered. Here, encaved in the brow of the bank, the Britons met, to hold their dark and gloomy councils; in that part of the river the Charon was ſet on fire. And yonder, acroſs the water, the Generals <hi>Weedon</hi> and <hi>Choiſſey</hi> hemmed in the impriſoned Britiſh ranks. There the French and American troops formed a glittering lane: And on yonder plain the numerous garriſon piled their arms.</q>— The liſtening child, led forth in his father's hand, ſhall hear him relate; and repeat it over again to his little companions. And they alſo ſhall rejoice in that great event, which ſtruck Britain with terror and deſpair; and led on to that happy reſtoration of peace, for which, to day, we give thanks to our God. For, according to this time ſhall it be ſaid of theſe United States, what hath God wrought for them? Great indeed, is the ſalvation he hath ſhown! And great the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we are under to praiſe! For, had we failed in our juſt attempt to ſecure our invaluable rights, America's choiceſt blood had flowed in liberal ſtreams: And her moſt valuable citizens, throughout the States, had expired by halters and in gibbets. The daring patriot, whoſe zeal for his country had led him, with his life in his hand, to take a ſeat in the great council of the States, or in legiſlation, or adminiſtering juſtice; or, who had led in the field, in his country's cauſe: Theſe had been led forth the firſt, in haughty triumph, amidſt ten thouſand inſulting

ſcoffs, as the victims of inſatiable vengeance. Nor only theſe; but all who had dared to follow their councils, and abett the cauſe for which they contended; nor a ſingle character worth notice left remaining, that dared to breathe the language of freedom. And the paths of life had now been thin of the many virtuous citizens convened to day, throughout theſe States, to give thanks on this happy occaſion. America had been enriched indeed; and her ſoil made fat with the blood of her children. Made fat, not for the rightful owners; but to pamper the luſts of tyrannical landlords, ſharing the country among themſelves: The ſurviving former poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, only vaſſals at pleaſure, and ſlaves to their lordly maſters. This, my friends, is not a flight of fancy; or apprehenſive imagination run wild: It is founded in juſt obſervation; and what bitter experience would have taught, but taught too late, had our enemy prevailed. But bleſſed be God, with Iſrael of old we may take up our ſong; <q>bleſſed be the Lord who gave us not as a prey to their teeth Bleſſed be the Lord, the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped.</q> We cried unto him in the day of our diſtreſs. He heard our intreaties; and hath brought us forth into a large place; and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed our rights; and opened before us a glorious proſpect. May wiſdom be given, to eſteem and improve the invaluable bleſſing. Here has our God erected a banner of civil
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018451_0017_0FA76CC83226D630"/>
and religious liberty: <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Religious liberty, is a foundation principle in the conſtitutions of the reſpective States, diſtinguiſhing America from every nation in Europe; and reſting religion on its proper baſis; as ſupported by it's own evidence, and the almighty care of it's divine author; without the aid of the feeble, angry arm of civil power; which ſerves only to diſgrace the name and religion of Jeſus, by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the rights of conſcience.</note> And prepared an aſylum for the poor and oppreſſed from every part of the earth. Here, if wiſdom guide our affairs, ſhall a happy equality reign; and joyous freedom bleſs the inhabitants wide and far, from age to age. Here, far removed from the noiſe and tumult of contending kingdoms and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires; far from the wars of Europe and Aſia, and the barbarous African coaſt; here ſhall the huſbandman enjoy the fruits of his labour; the merchant trade, ſecure of his gain; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic indulge his inventive genius; and the ſons of ſcience purſue their delightful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the light of knowledge pervade yonder, yet uncultivated, weſtern wilds; and form the ſavage inhabitants into men. Here alſo, ſhall our JESUS go forth conquering and to conquer; and the heathen be given him for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and theſe uttermoſt parts of the earth, a poſſeſſion. Zion ſhall here lengthen her cords, and ſtrengthen her ſtakes; and the mountain of the houſe of the Lord be gloriouſly exalted on high.

Vice and immorality ſhall yet here, become aſhamed and baniſhed; and love to God, and benevolence to man, rule the hearts and regulate the lives of men. Juſtice and truth ſhall here yet meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and righteouſneſs and peace embrace each other: And the wilderneſs bloſſom as the roſe, and the deſart rejoice and ſing. And here ſhall the various ancient promiſes of rich and glorious grace begin their compleat divine fulfilment; and the light of divine revelation diffuſe it's bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent rays, till the goſpel of Jeſus have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed it's day, from eaſt to weſt, around our world. A <hi>day,</hi> whoſe evening ſhall not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in night; but introduce that joyful period, when the outcaſts of Iſrael, and the diſperſed of Judah, ſhall be reſtored; and with them, the fulneſs of the Gentile world ſhall flow to the ſtandard of redeeming love: And the nations of the earth, become the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour. Under whoſe auſpicious reign holineſs ſhall univerſally prevail; and the noiſe and alarm of war be heard no more. Nor ſhall there be any thing to hurt or deſtroy, or interrupt the tranquility of men, through all the wide domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of this glorious prince of peace. How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſcene! How tranſporting the proſpect! And how thrice happy they, whom God has honored, as inſtruments in the great work now brought to paſs, ſubſervient to theſe important

events! May the bleſſings of heaven ſurround them; and the honor and eſteem of a grateful country attend them through life. May the names and memories of thoſe, oh my country! who have planned your meaſures, and guided your councils through a wilderneſs of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable difficulties, and brought your affairs, by the bleſſing of God, to a happy concluſion, may they ever be had in kind remembrance. Errors and miſtakes may have been: But it is matter of wonder and praiſe, that whilſt tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unknown, a difficult and dangerous path, their miſtakes and errors have been ſo few. Surely the hand of God was in it, to guide and guard their way. And let THE ILLUSTRIOUS WASHINGTON, the Joſhua of the day, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the age; who, inſpired from above with every military endowment, to command the American arms; and great in the field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond example, retires ſtill greater, to the humble character of a private citizen, among the citizens of the States; let him live perpetual in the minds and the praiſes of all. Aid here, ye his highly honored fellow citizens, aid feeble fame with her hundred wings and tongues, to proclaim his worth: And let time, on his full and ever roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream, convey down through every age, the unſullied remembrance of the patriot, the hero and citizen combined, and deliver his name and his praiſe to the unbounded ocean of immortal eſteem. And from the commander in chief down to the faithful centinel, let the officer and

ſoldier who have bravely offered their lives; and nobly dared death and danger in the bloody field, on the horrid edge of the ranks of war, be remembred with kindneſs. Let their ſervices of hardſhip, toil and danger be never forgot: But may they ever experience a kind attention from their fellow-citizens; and a faithful reward from their country, whoſe rights they have ſo firmly defended. Let their military garb and character ever command eſteem. Let their wounds and their ſcars plead their cauſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate their foibles; and the reſidue of their exhauſted days be crowned with honor and eaſe. With theſe let alſo be joined in never dying remembrance, a WARREN, a MONTGOMERY, a BIDDLE embraced by the briney waves, a MACPHERSON and a LAURENS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the bloom of youth, fallen in the bloody field, in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's cauſe; with the countleſs train of MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TYRS for American freedom, who, from the ocean and the land, from priſon-ſhips and jails, have ſealed with their lives, their attachment to her cauſe. Theſe—theſe—number them not of the dead. They are enrolled in the liſt of glory and fame; and ſhall live immortal, beyond the power of death and the grave. Bind their brows, oh ye American daughters, haſte ye, haſte ye, bind their brows with never-fading laurel, and glittering crimſon wreaths; and let the evening ſong and noon-day recital perpetuate their deeds and their fame; while the ſilent tear ſtealing from the eye, ſhall teſtify how dear their memory

and how high their eſteem. And whilſt the curſe of Meroz remains on laſting record, for thoſe who witheld their aid, let the bleſſings of all reſt on every friend of liberty, who willingly offered himſelf, when his country's neceſſity called him to the field: And on all who have cheerfully borne and ſuffered in it's cauſe. Nor let our great and generous ally, who afforded an early and vigorous aid, be forgot. But let every American lip pronounce a "VIVE LE ROI," and every heart conſpire, "long may his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, LEWIS THE SIXTEENTH," long may he live, a bleſſing, and bleſſed, on earth; and late reſign an earthly crown, to ſhine in brighter glory, and wear a crown immortal, among the bleſſed above. And may his ſubjects ever be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced as brethren and deareſt friends who have fought our battles, and bled in our cauſe; and partiality here held worthy of praiſe. Nor may a due eſteem ever be wanting to the United Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland States, whoſe heart and endeavours were with us; or to the court of Spain for aſſiſtance afforded; but be generouſly paid to all who have aided to ſecure our rights. And whilſt, with a grateful ſenſe of their ſervices done, we pay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved honours to thoſe whom God has honored, to bear a part in the great work performed; let every heart adore the God of goodneſs in all: And every lip, and every life, proclaim his praiſe. 'Tis he, the ſovereign diſpoſer of all events, hath wrought for us: and brought the whole to paſs. It was he, who led his Iſrael of old, by the pillar
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018451_0022_0FA76CCF886E95A8"/>
and the cloud, through their wilderneſs jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; wherein they alſo had their wandrings; 'twas he the ſame, preſided over our affairs; directed our councils, and guided our ſenators by the way. 'Twas he, who raiſed a Joſhua to lead the tribes of Iſrael in the field of battle, raiſed and formed a WASHINGTON, to lead on the troops of his choſen States, to final conqueſt, and endued him with all his military patience, perſeverance, proweſs and ſkill; and admirably preſerved his life and his health, through all the danger and toil. 'Twas he, who in Barak's day ſpread the ſpirit of war in every breaſt, to ſhake off the Canaanitiſh yoke, inſpired thine inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, oh America, with an ardent glow through every rank, to aſſert the cauſe of freedom: And led forth the huſbandman and mechanic; with thoſe of every claſs, to offer themſelves undaunted in the daring conflict. It was he hid fear from their eyes, of either the ſuperior number or ſkill, of the powerful foe they roſe to withſtand. And from him came down that firmneſs and fortitude, that raiſed American officers and ſoldiers, beyond all former example, through hunger, nakedneſs and cold, to fight the battles of their country; and never forſake it's ſtandard. It was he breathed from above, and fired their boſoms, in the hour of action, to crop the laurels of triumph; or, having dearly ſold their precious lives, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace death, in all his glory, on the bloody field. And he only inſpired our generous
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018451_0023_0FA76CD0BA411DD0"/>
ſeamen with invincible firmneſs, to endure the horrors of priſon-ſhips and jails; and expire by famine and Britiſh barbarity, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the virtuous cauſe in which they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked. It was he, who raiſed up Cyrus, to break the Aſſyrian force, and ſay, <q>let Iſrael be free,</q> endued the monarch of France with an angel's mind, to aſſert and ſecure the freedom of his United American States. And, by him were the hearts of other nations diſpoſed to our aid. And he, and he alone, who ſaith to the proud waves of the ſea, <q>Hitherto ſhall ye come, but no farther,</q> reſtrained the councils and arms of Britain from improving againſt us many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and advantages, which evidently lay within the line of their power. Who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the critical night of retreat from Long-Iſland; the ſcene of retiring from New-York; the day of Brandywine; or the endangered ſituation of the arms of America, on Trenton's ever memorable night; and not be conſtrained to ſay, <q>if it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, if it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, our enemy had ſwallowed us up: The waters had overwhelmed us: The proud ſtream had ſwept us away.</q> But bleſſed be his name, our help was found in him, who made the heavens and the earth. It was God, who blaſted the ſecret deſigns of enemies and traitors againſt us. And, by an admirable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, brought forth into light, the dark and deep-ſtained villainy of an ARNOLD, curſed and

deteſted of God and men.<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxvii. 25.</note> And converted our repeated misfortunes and even miſtakes, into ſingular mercies, and peculiar advantage, that, not more manifeſt was his voice on Sinai; or his hand, in the affairs of his Iſrael of old; than we have ſeen the wiſdom, the power, and the goodneſs of our God, diſplayed through the whole of our arduous conteſt, from it's earlieſt period down: And may, with emphatical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, ſay, it is he THE ALMIGHTY GOD, has accompliſhed the whole, in every part; and by his kind care, and omnipotent arm, has wrought out our deliverance; caſt forth our enemy; beſtowed upon us a wide extended, fruitful country; and bleſſed us with a ſafe and honorable peace. And has brought the whole to paſs, in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time; and with ſo few difficulties attending, in compariſon of what we had reaſon to expect, that the eſtabliſhment of theſe United States, in the peaceful poſſeſſion of their rights and privileges, ſtands an inſtance of divine favour, unexampled in the records of time. Who does not remember the general language, when the war commenced? cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to pay one half of our property, to ſecure our rights. But, far from even the half of this has been required.

has proved the temporal ruin of many; and widows and helpleſs orphans been made a prey. Many of whoſe ſufferings might yet ſtill be greatly alleviated, by a due attention; and a ſacred regard to juſtice, and good conſcience directing affairs: Which muſt alſo, ſooner or later, take place; or the righteous God, who hates injuſtice, oppreſſion and fraud, be highly diſpleaſed; and his judgments be yet poured out on our land: As he afflicted Iſrael of old, for unredreſſed injuries to the Gibeonites among them. And his juſtice, and his power are ſtill the ſame. But, the price of our peace, taken on a national ſcale; compared with the advantages gained, and the number, by whom to be paid, ſcarce deſerves a name. That, in whatever point of light we view this great event, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſay, <q>it is the doing of the Lord; and marvellous in our eyes.</q> And to him be rendered the thanks, and the praiſe—<hi>not unto us; —not unto us;—but to thy name, O Lord, be the glory.</hi> For thine is the power, and the victory, and the greatneſs. Both ſucceſs and ſafety come of thee. And thou reigneſt over all: And haſt wrought all our works, in us, and for us. PRAISE, THEREFORE, THY GOD, O AMERICA,—PRAISE THE LORD, YE, HIS HIGHLY FAVOURED UNITED STATES.— Nor let it reſt in the fleeting language of the lip; or the formal thankſgiving of a day. But, let every heart glow with gratitude: And every life,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018451_0026_0FA76CD54FF74F90"/>
by a devout regard to his holy law, proclaim his praiſe. It is this, our God requires, as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our perſonal, and national good, and the glory of his great name conſiſt. And without which, all our profeſſions will be but an empty name. It is, that we love the Lord our God, to walk in his ways, and keep his commandments, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his ſtatutes and his judgments. That a ſacred regard be maintained to righteouſneſs and truth. That we do juſtice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Deuteronomy 30.16. Amos 5 24.
