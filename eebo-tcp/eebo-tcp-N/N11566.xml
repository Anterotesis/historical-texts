            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE MIDDLE LINE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have read with much attention the various political productions which have been offered to the publick, ever in hopes to find ſome middle line drawn, between the Rights of America, and the Claims of England; but moſt of the writers have contented themſelves with embracing wholly one ſide or the other: this may be the policy of nations at war; but where contending ſtates mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually deſire to enter into preliminaries of peace, each ſhould conſider what they in give up, and what they ſhould retain.</p>
            <p>An attempt to draw <hi>this line,</hi> I am ſenſible, is aſſuming a taſk, which may ſubject a writer to cenſure and reproach; and nothing ſhould induce me to hazard
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014616_0003_0F943392E8ADD180"/>
the undertaking, but an anxious wiſh to ward off the calamities advancing on this once happy country. If I ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to miſtake the means, I hope my countrymen will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it rather to the defect of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, than to the diſhoneſty of my hear. I love my country—my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul is in agony for her diſtreſs; and every nerve within me ſhall be exerted to ſerve her.</p>
            <p>There perhaps never was on earth a more happy people, than the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of theſe colonies, till the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate diſputes with England about taxation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouzed mutual jealouſies, and created mutual diſlikes. If we ſearch into the original cauſe of theſe diſputes, we ſhall undoubtedly find them to have ariſen from a miſtaken apprehenſion in the parliament of Great-Britain, that they poſſeſſed the ſame power over A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, which they exerciſed over the Engliſh nation; and of conſequence, that they had a right to diſpoſe of our property at pleaſure. This power might to them ſeem plauſible enough, as they undoubtedly thought themſelves oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to protect and defend the colonies in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014616_0004_0F943393A8538450"/>
common with the reſt of the empire, and therefore expected <hi>ſome contribution</hi> in return; and had they confined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ancient mode of <hi>requiſitions by the crown,</hi> we might yet have been a happy people; but they have now reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to the neceſſity, of entering into the merits of the connexion; and have ſtarted ſubjects, which, for the peace of both countries, ought to have remained untouched for centuries to come.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to take a view of our ſituation, <hi>independant of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns with England,</hi> as it may poſſibly point out to ſuch a connexion as is both reaſonable and politic, and which every American might agree to; and here I beſpeak the candid unprejudiced atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my readers.</p>
            <p>It were much to be wiſhed, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional freedom could be maintained without national force; but unhappily ſuch is the ſtate of mankind, that their ideas of juſtice are not ſufficiently ſtrong, to preſerve them from making inroads and encroachments on each other, and therefore the princes of empires ever find it neceſſary, to hold themſelves in readineſs to repel the depredations of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014616_0005_0F94339452DEE6F0"/>
their enemies; and the expences attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch preparations, are ſupplied by their ſubjects; that is, by thoſe who receive protection. This being the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſituation of governments, ſuppoſe we enter into a conſideration of our <hi>own ſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>America from its variety of ſoil and climate, can produce every <hi>neceſſary of life;</hi> and from a happy mixture of the popular form, in moſt of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is ſo tempting to foreigners, that they are daily adding to our natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: thus our numbers are become ſo conſiderable, that whilſt we remain in harmony amongſt ourſelves, we may defy the united force of all the powers of Europe, having ſo grand a barrier as the vaſt Atlantic; for though a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſtate might diſtreſs our ſea-ports by ſudden attacks, yet it would be the height of madneſs in any eaſtern nation, to attempt an invaſion of America with a view or retaining poſſeſſion. But as the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of life are not ſufficient to gratify the demands of elegance, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of taſte, and the pleaſures of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, we have recourſe to the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of trade to indulge them from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014616_0006_0F94339510A571B0"/>
reign climes; thus we have conſtantly floating on the ocean a large portion of our wealth; Should we recur to firſt principles, and inſiſt that we have an equal right with other nations, to an uninterrupted navigation to every part of the globe, I ſhould readily accede to the aſſertion; but as <hi>power</hi> and <hi>right</hi> are diſtinct principles in the political world, it is not ſufficient for us to prove the <hi>latter,</hi> without holding forth a convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argument of our poſſeſſing the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> The ſeas are undoubtedly the grand highways of the world, in which all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have an equal right to travel, and the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of this common element, are like the property of all: yet ſuch are the received maxims of power, that <hi>here</hi> one nation ſhall claim an excluſive priviledge to navigate a certain portion of the main, and <hi>there</hi> another ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a ſole propriety in the fiſhes of the ſea. Inconſiſtent as this may ſeem to the rules of that benevolent Being, who gave to man in common the <hi>fiſhes of the ſea,</hi> and the fowls of the air; it is not only claimed, but maintained. This being the ſtate of things, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes next a queſtion, how we ſhall
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014616_0007_0F943395C101B4A8"/>
ſupport ſuch a <hi>formidable figure,</hi> as may entitle us to ſecurity and reſpect, and enſure to us a tolerable ſhare of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges contended for, and enjoyed by other nations. It will probably be thought that nothing leſs than a well equipped navy can anſwer the purpoſe; for ſhould our property be detained in foreign prots, ſhould our ſhips be inſulted or plundered on the ſeas, ſhould our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men be impriſoned abroad, we ſhould have no way of redreſſing our wrongs, whilſt our ſtrength lay confined on our native ſhores. Admitting then the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a naval force, to ſecure to us the continuance of our trade; we are next to conſider, whether it would be moſt prudent for us to attempt the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a fleet, or to form an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with ſome naval power, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it might be to protect us. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that many conſiderations, which may be unneceſſary to mention, would induce us to prefer an alliance. Let us then take a view of the eaſtern world, and ſearch amongſt the various powers for ſuch a friend. As we are generally proteſtants, we ſhall certainly confine our ſearch to proteſtant princes. On
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014616_0008_0F94339707BE6FE8"/>
hunting the Continent, we ſhall find no naval proteſtant power of ſtrength ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for our purpoſe, except the States of Holland, whoſe attention is ſo wholly engroſſed by commercial purſuits, that <hi>great</hi> muſt be the provocation which would induce them to ſtrike an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power even in their own defence, and <hi>much greater</hi> muſt it be to induce them to yield to an American ſtate their aid. In the laſt war between the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and the French, they put up with the higheſt indignities, rather than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the benefits ariſing from a ſtate of peace. Let us then quit the Continent and turn our eyes to Britain; there we ſhall find the fineſt navy in the world, and ſhall recognize the inhabitants as our friends and relations, with ſimilar cuſtoms, ſimilar laws; in ſhort the very people we would wiſh for our allies; we ſhall find them capable of ſupplying us with almoſt every article of luxury and convenience, and in want of many of the raw materials of America; here then we ſhould probably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ix; but now comes the grand queſtion. We not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Great-Britain to enter into a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014616_0009_0F943399C751CF50"/>
firm, ſocial, commercial compact, which is to be reciprocally advantageous, but we have a further ſtipulation to make; part of our terms is a <hi>ſtipulation for the protection of our trade,</hi> this will of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence put them upon examining into the nature of the contract, and whether it is not <hi>mutually beneficial;</hi> ſhould they apprehend this to be the caſe, they might probably conceive that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted more than was juſt or equitable; for ſhould our coaſts be threatened with a fleet, or our ſhips trading with other nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be ſeized in their ports, what ſhould prompt the Engliſh nation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our injuries, or revenge our wrongs; ſo long as we could ſecure a ſafe navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for our ſhips to the harbours of England, they would readily receive us with friendſhip, and grant us whilſt there the protection of our perſons and property; and in the courſe of <hi>their</hi> trade with us, in <hi>their own</hi> bottoms, they would find their way to us under the guardianſhip of their cannon, againſt the combined forces of Europe. Thus would the matter ſtand at the firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuppoſing us to be an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:014616_0010_0F94339A49BDDDB0"/>
We are now to determine the point, whether we will confine our views of trade and protection to the Britiſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or take our chance with the various powers that navigate the ocean. We ſhould certainly ſtart at the thought of quitting a nation we once loved, and ſhould therefore demand of them <hi>on what terms they were willing to negotiate.</hi> Would it not be reaſonable to ſuppoſe they would addreſs us in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? The trade of your continent is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a deſirable object, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the dearer ties of blood and friendſhip; we would wiſh to preſerve it, and to become your cuſtomers for many of the articles of your export, and in return, we will ſupply you with the various manufactures of England; we will protect you in your trade to all parts of the world; we will defend your coaſts from foreign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. We will make <hi>your</hi> quarrels <hi>our</hi> quarrels, and obtain redreſs for every inſult you receive, with as much readineſs as if practiſed on our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but you muſt be ſenſible, that this can only be done by maintaining at ſea, a continual ſuperiority over our neighbours, both in peace and in war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:014616_0011_0F94339EF50E7948"/>
The fleets we conſtantly have equipped, the ſhips we are daily building and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, are attended with an immenſe expence; many of them will neceſſarily be kept perpetually in <hi>your</hi> ſeas, for the ſecurity of <hi>your</hi> coaſts, and many more always in pay, to ſail at an hour's warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: we think then, that you ſhould either ſit out a fleet ſufficient (at leaſt in part) for your defence, to join to the navy of England, or elſe to make us ſome allowance for <hi>your</hi> ſhare of the joint expence.</p>
            <p>I leave every candid diſpaſſionate Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican to determine on the equity of the propoſal, and whether we ſhould not expend infinitely more in an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant protection of ourſelves, than the Britiſh nation would require of us for our quota. This I take to be pretty near the true ſtate of the ſituation of affairs, between England and America, without looking into the claims of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, dependance, and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; tho' I cannot but think, that our beſt intereſts point out to us an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the ſupremacy <hi>of the crown of Great-Britain,</hi> I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean <hi>of the people of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014616_0012_0F9433A025DDAA20"/>
whom I only eſteem as our fellow ſubjects, without any kind of controul over us. But we will wave for the preſent, the conſideration of this part of the argument.</p>
            <p>As we have now unfortunately got into a diſpute on the ſubject of ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, I would hope we may fix the matter ſo inconteſtable plain and clear, that no future altercations may ariſe. Our natural right to independance is ſo evident, that no reaſoning of weight can be urged in oppoſition; how far we ought to give up a <hi>part</hi> of that for the preſervation of the <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> ſeems to be our preſent buſineſs to conſider. Precedents, law-caſes, and law-opinions, are entirely beſide the queſtion; tho' I could produce a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, I ſhall reject them all: it is a point of <hi>convenience,</hi> founded on a point of <hi>equity,</hi> that is now to be determined.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of America live for themſelves and not for any other nation under heaven, and to procure their own greateſt happineſs, ſo far as is conſiſtent with the natural rights of others, ought to be their principal object. I inſiſt, that if we can maintain our ground,

and protect our trade againſt the reſt of the world, I know of no law, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or juſtice, that ſhould induce us to capitulate for the full exerciſe of rights and priviledges derived to us from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but on the other hand, if our happineſs would be promoted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting ourſelves with ſome foreign power, I frankly give my voice for it; and if the terms of our connexion ſhould call for a contribution towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a fleet, maintained for our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual defence, I ſhould be far from eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a badge of a tributary ſtate, but quite the reverſe; we ſhould thereby have a degree of property in a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable navy, and ſhould have a right to <hi>demand</hi> their aſſiſtance and protection, when danger approached; ſhould this ever be refuſed, I grant it would be a ſufficient reaſon to withdraw our allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and look elſewhere for an honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alliance; but this I would willingly hope will never be the caſe, as the true intereſt of the Engliſh nation will ever be bound up in our intereſt.</p>
            <p>I would wiſh to be underſtood, that any taxes levied on ourſelves, by our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for this purpoſe, ought not to be

            <p>Hitherto an acknowledged ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation has taken place, handed down from father to ſon, and both countries were happy under the connexion, till within a few years paſt. It hath always been allowed, that the happineſs of the people was the true end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore whenever a ſtate has diverged from that point, it becomes the buſineſs, nay duty, of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, to bring about a reſtoration; and whenever they diſcover a tendency in ruling power, to deviate from the general good, they ought with reſolute firmneſs to remonſtrate againſt it. It hath long been a received maxim, that <hi>the king can do no wrong,</hi> I think we may with much greater propriety ſay, that <hi>the people can do no wrong;</hi> I mean the whole people collectively, for it is to be

preſumed, from that great firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſelf-preſervation, they will primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider their own happineſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when a whole people complain, we may be certain it is not without juſt foundation: now the whole of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of America <hi>do</hi> complain of an unjuſt uſurpation in their fellow-ſubjects of Great-Britain, with intent to wreſt from them a portion of their property. I will not pretend to ſay the Engliſh have done it either from a wanton diſplay of power, or diſhoneſt principles, but will call it <hi>falſe policy;</hi> that part which the intereſts of America might probably have induced us to act, they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themſelves poſſeſſed of a right to enforce on us, and thus have miſtaken both the right nad the means.</p>
            <p>On our part, in oppoſition to this uſurped power, we ſet up the <hi>priviledges of Engliſhmen</hi> and the <hi>natural rights of men;</hi> by the <hi>former</hi> we contend, that the principles of the Engliſh conſtitution, include no idea of taxation without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; and that as the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans cannot be repreſented in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they cannot with propriety be ſubject to their laws. This point is now
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014616_0016_0F9433A429E989B8"/>
ſo well underſtood, and has been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten handled, that it is difficult, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed needleſs, to ſet it in a new point of light: but when by the <hi>latter</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the unlimited freedom of human nature, and eſtabliſh our claims to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependance upon that ground, we ſhall ſwerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If one neighbourhood was attacked, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the aſſiſtance of the reſt of the confederates; and though this demand could not be made in conſequence of any natural ſuperiority on one ſide, or

Now ſhould we inſiſt on a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſeparation in government from the reſt of the world, upon the principles of a natural right to do ſo, we ought cautiouſly and carefully to inveſtigate the probable conſequences of such a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratation.

It is well known, that the preſent policy of Europe is not confined to the narrow limits of juſtice and right; the diviſions of kingdoms, and the acquirement of freſh territory, are now become the darling objects of crowned heads; and though the <hi>united</hi> force of America might be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the moſt formidable enemy, yet

there is too much reaſon to fear, that this continent has many changes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, before ſuch a permanent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed form of government takes place, as will be neceſſary at all times to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its inhabitants againſt foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions. Should we diſclaim all allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the king of Great-Britain, and ſtand on our own bottom, the very firſt ſtep to be taken, would be the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a navy, and this would take us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years to effect: during this period, our trade would remain unprotected, and muſt be carried on under many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages.

it will be beſt to conſider theſe queſtions ſeparately.</p>
            <p>The ſovereignty of England over the colonies, is what all the courtiers and court-writers contend for, inſiſting, that the Americans <hi>are the ſubjects of Great-Britain.</hi> Here I muſt obſerve, that they the generally firſt miſtake the connexion, and thence draw all their inferences. I ſhall, therefore, in the firſt place, deny that we <hi>are</hi> the ſubjects of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for if once we concede that point, every ſubmiſſive act on our part follows of courſe, as undoubtedly it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>governed</hi> to obey the legal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of the <hi>governors,</hi> otherways all government is a nullity, a mere ſound, and nothing elſe. The writers on this ſubject, have not perhaps conſidered the extent of the premiſes they have laid down.</p>
            <p>Great-Britain, <hi>politically</hi> not <hi>geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically</hi> ſpeaking, is only a collective name, for the inhabitants of England and Scotland, and the prince on the throne is ſtiled King of Great-Britain, &amp;c. Now the American colonies, having been diſcovered under the flag of an Engliſh prince they became a part of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014616_0022_0F9433AD92737320"/>
his dominions, and a number of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects quickly conſented to improve and cultivate the ſoil. Theſe men, whilſt they remained in the realm, conſtituted a part of the government, partaking of the powers of legiſlation, that is, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing a voice and intereſt in the choice of men, who were to make laws to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their lives, liberties, and properties; but when they quitted the Engliſh ſhores, they became deprived of the poſſibility of enjoying thoſe privileges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in law, equity, and reaſon, were from under the influence of any legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative acts, made ſubſequent to their departure. Senſible of this, the crown granted charters to the ſeveral colonies, impowering them to make laws for their own government; but with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, that they <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſhould not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but as nearly as may be agreeable to the laws of England.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> And this power of enacting laws, in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, has been ſo long allowed, and ſo repeatedly recognized by the Engliſh, that the right is eſtabliſhed beyond all <hi>reaſonable</hi> diſpute.</p>
            <p>It hath always been deemed one of the darling rights of the Commons, to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014616_0023_0F9433AE9A612898"/>
give and grant their own money; and ſo jealous are they of this privilege, that they will not ſuffer a money bill to be touched by the Lords, except to declare their aſſent or diſſent. Now if the <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>granting</hi> be ſolely in the Commons of Great-Britain, how comes it that they have invariably acquieſced to allow a right in the people of America, alſo to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>grant their</hi> money to the crown? If the power of enacting laws in the colonies, was intended to have been confined to their interious local con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, why have not the Commons of Great-Britain proteſted againſt the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the colony aſſemblies, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned his Majeſty to diſallow the acts? why have they permitted us to enjoy this right unmoleſted for more than a hundred years? The reaſon is evident, they knew that the power of <hi>giving</hi> reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſolely in thoſe who <hi>poſſeſſed.</hi> It was upon this principle they claimed it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and upon this principle they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it to us.</p>
            <p>If the colonies are ſubjects of Great-Britain, they muſt be bound by the laws of Great-Britain, be they ever ſo cruel or unjuſt; and even ſhould they paſs an
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014616_0024_0F9433AF4496F128"/>

Wild and viſionary as this may ſeem, what ſecurity have we, that they will not one day portion amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, our fair inheritances, and force us into their new claimed fields, like <hi>Guinea ſlaves,</hi> to till the ſoil? but here my heart recoils, and ſmites my guilty boſom,—fain would I caſt an impenetrable veil around my countrymen, and hide this horrid ſimile: but I truſt we are gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally removing the prejudices which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſavage cuſtom that prevails amongst us. I say what security have we, that ſhall protect us againſt their laws, when we have no voice in the framing them? we have none: we are degraded far beneath the rank of Engliſh ſubjects, we deſcend to the humiliating condition of <hi>dependants</hi> upon Engliſh ſubjects, and hold our lives and fortune but at their command. But happy for us, this is <hi>not</hi> our condition; we rank in legiſlation equal with the ſubjects of the realm; we are a part of the Britiſh empire, and only acknowledge ourſelves
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014616_0025_0F9433B001D47D98"/>

attempting every juſt and honourable meaſure for obtaining redreſs.</p>
            <p>We may here adduce an argument founded on their own laws, to refute the claim of an Engliſh legiſlation over the colonies. If the people of Great-Britain have ſuch a right, it is a <hi>perpetual</hi> right; but the preſent Engliſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of parliaments, therefore the people of Great-Britain, claiming a conſtant unchangeable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of government, uſurp a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power over the Americans, than the Britiſh parliaments have over their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents; it is of no import to ſay, that the parliament being re-choſen every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, <hi>we</hi> have the advantage of the change; it can be no other way agreeable, than is expreſſed by the Scotch proverb, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:startq">“</g>that change of de' els is blithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
               </hi> if members of parliament act inconſiſtent with their truſt, or betray the intereſts of the nation, their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents who will be the ſufferers, may put in other men; but with reſpect to the colonies, if an Engliſh legiſlation is granted over them, there can be no change, it is an Engliſh not an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican parliament that ever preſides; and whenever they can paſs acts, which will
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014616_0027_0F9433B17631B010"/>
not injure themſelves, it will become the policy of England to caſt as large a part of their own burthens on our ſhoulders, as they ſhall judge us able to bear; for certainly it muſt be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable to leſſen their own taxes by the increaſe of ours; and however much we might complain of the injuſtice, it would ſtill remain; as the nature of the caſe would admit of no remedy, in <hi>our</hi> power to apply; our law-makers would remain perpetually the ſame, without the <hi>voice</hi> of one American to diſſent, or the <hi>power</hi> to change the men who had abuſed us; men who would learn to eſteem us as part of the real eſtate of the nation, and being eternal judges in the diſpute, would proceed ſtep by ſtep, to diveſt us of every bleſſing of life. We muſt, therefore, ſtrenuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on an exemption from the controul of the <hi>people</hi> of Great-Britain. It is not merely as <hi>inhabitants</hi> of Great-Britain, that I object to the ſway; for I confeſs I would as ſoon truſt an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> as an <hi>American,</hi> with unlimitted power: there are no men on earth ſit to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with ſuch a power; and it is on this principle, that I contend for a <hi>total legiſlative independance.</hi>

the happineſs of the whole nation, muſt eventually include the happineſs of every individual; that influence or intereſt are poſſeſſed in a greater or ſmaller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree by the meaneſt inhabitant of the realm; that clamour, diſcontent and complaint, are engines which the lower order of the Engliſh can continually play off to advantage: on the other hand, that it becomes the conſtant intereſt of England, to ſave herſelf at our expence; that we have <hi>no means</hi> direct, or indirect to influence the election of a ſingle mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament: theſe, I ſay, are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which muſt naturally ariſe in every mind, and have been often handed forth to the publick.</p>
            <p>That the firſt ſettlers in America ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended themſelves from under the juriſdiction of <hi>parliament,</hi> by virtue of their charters, is very evident; as they began their ſeveral legiſlations, without ever addreſſing any of their laws, to that branch of the legiſlature for confirmation; the King's approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſſent, were all they expected: nor do I remember to have heard of a ſingle inſtance, of the parliaments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

them as their fellow-ſubjects, and ſeem to have conſigned them into the hands of the crown; it is true, the parliament early paſſed ſome reſtrictive laws, to which the crown aſſented, and of which the coloniſts complained: but if in ſome inſtances, they have ſubmitted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions from their fellow-ſubjects in England, ſhall we from thence infer, that ſuch ſubmiſſion becomes a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that ſuch precedent ſhall grant a revocation of every natural right of an American? If the encroachment of an unfriendly neighbour, beyond a boundary not certainly fixed, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to remain for a time unrepelled, ſhall the prior poſſeſſor be thereby for ever deprived of his property? and ſhall it give the intruder a right to proceed ſtep by ſtep, till he has ſeized upon the whole? or, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014616_0032_0F9433BC2E93E788"/>
ſtate of the connexion; for we have been told, that our agents were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
               <hi>good authority, that if we choſe to ſend over perſons to repreſent us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they ſhould be admitted to ſeats in the houſe.</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> here we have a full and ample conceſſion, from our opponents, of the point we have ſo long contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; I mean, <hi>that we are not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in parliament,</hi> otherwiſe it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to invite us to take our ſeats; and till that is done, it is evident they can have no right to bind us by their laws: for if we have a right to ſeats, we have a right to a voice; if we have a right to a voice, no act can bind us till that voice is given: if we had not an equitable right to ſeats in parliament, they who made the offer, could have no power ſo far to infringe the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as to tender it: hence it is clear, that they apprehended the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of parliament was unjuſtly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, till ſuch repreſentation took place; for the propoſal could only ariſe from a conviction of injuſtice, in the preſent ſtate of things: thus, I conceive, they have avowed our right to exemption. I formerly thought, before our diſputes with England began, that an American
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014616_0033_0F9433BE45CBDF18"/>
repreſentation was both eligible and practicable; but I am now clearly of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it would be highly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic. We have good legiſlations of our own; we have the ſame king they have; and it is properly <hi>his</hi> buſineſs, not <hi>theirs</hi> to confine each of us, by his negative, within our proper ſpheres.</p>
            <p>The charters granted to the ſeveral colonies, were all derived from the <hi>crown,</hi> and not from the <hi>parliament;</hi> the powers of legiſlation reſpecting themſelves, and the liberty of diſpoſing of their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have been invariably confirmed from time to time, by the king, through his repreſentatives, whether it were for the immediate ſervice of their own internal concerns, or in grants for the general uſe of the empire. Laws ſimilar to the laws of England, for life, liberty and property, have paſſed in all the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and have received the ſanction of the throne; and even the acquieſcence of parliament, if that were deemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their confirmation. Their laws not only bind their own inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but the ſubjects of every nation, when amongſt them, are entitled to their protection, and ſubject to their penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and even ſhould a member of the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014616_0034_0F9433BF01ADEA98"/>
Houſe of Commons commit a criminal action againſt the common law, he would be treated with as little reſpect as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt felon. This power over life, has often been recognized by the crown, in exertions of the royal prerogative, by ſpecial pardons. And in matters of property, decrees of every court on the continent have been repeatedly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though the appellants have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been non-reſidents in America: even the military have always ſubmitted to the laws of the land in which they were quartered, and have been tried, condemned and executed, without the power of the juriſdiction being ever called in queſtion; though they are a kind of diſtinct body, and in ſome caſes are veſted with a power over life and death amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>It hath been made a queſtion by ſome<note n="*" place="bottom">Author of Free-Thoughts.</note>, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>do any of your charters ſay, that you <hi>ſhall not</hi> be bound by laws made in Great-Britain?<g ref="char:endq">”</g> I will aſk a queſtion in my turn.

                  </gap>e ſhould not be bound to pay them?</hi> certainly it will be replied, that it was an unrighteous demand; and that where no rent was reſerved in the deed, none could be claimed: it is impoſſible that the parliament ſhould eſtabliſh a claim upon ſuch negative authority. But we are told that the charter of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, expreſsly reſerves the right of parliament; this is undoubtedly true, and did the Pennſylvanians eſteem their liberties as <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> encircled by the charter of the province, they are certainly bound by whatever acts a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh legiſlature may incline to impoſe; nay further, by the tenor of the 20th ſection, they are to be ſubject <g ref="char:startq">“</g>to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, cuſtoms, or taxation, rate or contribution<g ref="char:endq">”</g> of the king alone, provided the ſame be with the conſent "of the proprietary <hi>or</hi> chief governor," which is a ſtate of vaſſalage, ſo diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to every principle of the Britiſh conſtitution, that no king of England could grant himſelf ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; neither could any ſubject admit it, either on behalf of himſelf or others. There are certain liberties, eſſential to the conſtitution of an Engliſhman, which he cannot, by any joint act with the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014616_0036_0F9433C077F71E30"/>
king, diveſt himſelf of; there is no right ſo abſolutely inherent in the perſon of every ſubject of the crown, as that of being bound by no laws, but thoſe to which he has actually or virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. And tho' the firſt founder of Pennſylvania, and the early ſettlers, may have accepted a charter, in ſome part, derogatory of the rights of Britiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants; yet being illegal in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the preſent generation have an undoubted authority to claim their legal privileges, whenever they ſhall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked under colour of a charter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional in ſome of its parts: had the rights remained untouched, the charter might have remained unnoticed; but ſhould the Pennſylvanians conſent to the operation of clauſes, which would ſubject them to the controul of a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they never were concerned in the choice of, they would deſervedly be eſteemed aliens to the common weal of the empire, and enemies to the grand bulwark of Engliſh liberty. This may be termed declamation, by the friends of power, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut it is Engliſh conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reaſoning, and if the force of it be rejected, the nobleſt part of our long boaſted Magna Charta, drops to the

ground, and we return to that ſtate of diſpute and confuſion, which preceded its happy eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>If America was contiguous to Great-Britain, we ſhould undoubtedly have been connected in legiſlation, and in a courſe of years ſhould carry ſo large a majority into the Houſe of Commons, that the preſent high claiming iſlanders would be but as a trifling country in the mighty ſenate; is it poſſible then, that diſtance of ſituation, can ſo totally reverſe the ſyſtem of equity and natural right, as to perſuade the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that becauſe we ſprang from <hi>their</hi> loins, they are to have eternal ſway? they may <hi>wiſh</hi> it, but it is impoſſible they ſhould <hi>expect</hi> it?</p>
            <p>The writers in favour of parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power, aſk us, how it comes to paſs, that we pretend to the rights of Engliſhmen, and yet deny the power, which eſtabliſhed thoſe rights? for ſay they, the Bill of Rights, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in every Americans mouth, was not enjoyed by the Engliſh themſelves, till the reign of William and Mary, nor did they poſſeſs the Habeas Corpus act, till the reign of Charles the IId; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay they, the colonies ſettled prior

to thoſe bills, could not partake of them by virtue of inheritance, unleſs they grant themſelves under the ſupremacy of the Engliſh government. This might ſuit the chicanery of a court, but where we contend for the ſupport of the true end of government, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>the happineſs of the people governed,</hi> we ſhall not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to aſſert, that the Americans have a right to adopt at all times the laws of England, when ſuch laws ſhall appear productive of greater benefits to the people, than they before enjoyed; nor do we apprehend ourſelves bound to ſupport our independancy, by a train of law reaſoning; it is the good of the whole that is to be the perpetual object; were not this the caſe, how is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent family eſtabliſhed on the throne? how came the reformation to take place? how ſhall we ſupport the union of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland? In matters of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there can be no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent rule, than that which eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the greateſt good of the people; and though one party or the other may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves aggrieved, yet they muſt ſubmit, where the public ſafety can be no other way preſerved: even in matters of <hi>property,</hi> where the ſubject
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014616_0039_0F9433C8D407EA18"/>
can be litigated upon known and fixed grounds, the poſſeſſor is frequently obliged to ſurrender it, for the common benefit. 'Tis true, the <hi>publick</hi> will make him ſome recompence; but in doing this, <hi>they,</hi> and not the owner, ſhall judge of the value of the damage. Thus in the caſe between the colonies and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, even admitting a right of controul once <hi>did</hi> exiſt, it appears eſſential to the general good of the whole colonies, that England ſhould have <hi>no legiſlative power</hi> over them, as a ſubordination cannot exiſt, without too great power on one ſide, and loſs of liberty on the other. Now as government is not created for the emolument of the <hi>governors,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving a Britiſh parliament of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy they contend for, is no real injury; for ſuch ſupremacy, not being for the <hi>benefit</hi> of the parties, over whom it is claimed, the neceſſity of the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy ceaſes; otherwiſe it eſtabliſhes the doctrine of <hi>proper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y in government.</hi> Here I ſhall reſt this part of the argument.</p>
            <p>We come next to conſider their claim of <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
               <hi>an excluſive uncontroulable right to regulate the trade of the colonies.</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> Many of our political writers, have ſo far given up this point, that their opponents
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014616_0040_0F9433C9FA2B1530"/>
plume themſelves on the ſuppoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and thence infer, that a right to impoſe duties for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of trade, implies alſo a power in parliament, to decide the queſtion as they pleaſe; for the name of <hi>regulation,</hi> may be given to every duty, and the Americans have no way of proteſting againſt the impoſition, or judicially entering into the merits of the caſe; the words, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
               <hi>for the expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue,</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> may be left out in the preamble, and yet it ſhall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with all the force of a revenue act. We have been told that the great American agent, doctor Franklin, and the celebrated Pennſylvania Farmer, have both given up this point; perhaps they may: but, <hi>humanum eſt errare,</hi> every day caſts new light on the ſubject, and until the line ſhall be actually eſtabliſhed, and agreed to by the contending parties, in a firm and ſolemn treaty; it is our duty to ſtudy the argument, and adopt ſuch freſh ſentiments, as naturally and reaſonably ariſe in the purſuit. Let Engliſh ſtateſmen clamor for power, let a Britiſh parliament boaſt of unlimitted ſupremacy, yet the continent of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca will contend with equal fervency,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014616_0041_0F9433CA48C2CC40"/>
for the enjoyment of their rights as men. If England will conſent to treat with us upon an equality, we may poſſibly agree to ſurrender every thing, that is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in them to require. To enter into the minutia of this part of the argument, is not my intention; it comprizes too great a ſcope for the limits of a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet; to ſay what we ſhould ſubmit to, what we ſhould give up, and what we ſhould claim, in the various branches of our connexion, will be more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the buſineſs of the parties, who may be employed to ſettle the line: I only mean to touch on the principles, by which I apprehend we ſhould be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in tracing this important boundary.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, no point ſhould be inſiſted on by England, that was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to operate in their own favor, to the prejudice of America; unleſs where the general good of the whole empire, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally threw the balance into their ſcale; as would be the caſe, on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied the privilege of trading with the natural enemies of England; for ſhould we be able to trade to greater advantage amongſt French than with the Engliſh our being reſtricted in a traffic with France, would operate againſt
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014616_0042_0F9433CB0A4B3D18"/>
our own immediate intereſts, in favour of the Engliſh nation; but when we conſider on the other hand, that the French would thereby gain what the Engliſh loſt, and of conſequence would become richer by our means; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the whole empire ought to influence us to forego the immediate gain to ourſelves: but whatever ſtate is in commercial league with England, ought alſo to be open to America, both for imports and exports; the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ens of Ruſſia, and the ſilks of Perſia, ſhould by no means firſt be landed in England, if intented for an American market; nor ſhould the manufactures or trading articles of Britain, be loaded with any impoſt or duty, when ſhipped for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, more than other foreigners pay; for why ſhould we be conſidered as men not entitled to the general benefits of the empire, any more than the Engliſh themſelves, provided we unite <hi>our</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts with <hi>their</hi> intereſts, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute what may be a reaſonable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the expence, neceſſary for our mutual defence? That we do not bear an equal ſhare of the burthens of the inhabitants of England, in the variety of taxes they are loaded with, may be
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014616_0043_0F9433CBCFBA17B0"/>
very true, but it is alſo true, that we have internal taxes amongſt ourſelves, and pretty conſiderable taxes too, which are annually increaſing.</p>
            <p>Neither ſhould we be denied the uſe and immediate importation of Portugal wines, lemons, citrons, &amp;c. for a trade with Portugal being deemed beneficial to England, the argument militates e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually in <hi>our</hi> favour. If the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drink their wines with a duty on them, it by no means enforces a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>our</hi> paying a duty; <hi>that</hi> which they pay, is for the ſupport of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and if we in America ſhould deem ſuch luxuries proper ſubjects for taxation, we ſhall doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leſs derive ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from the ſame ſource; indeed in ſome of the provinces wine already pays a duty. The trade to the Eaſt-Indies, being at preſent limited to a company, who at their own expence firſt eſtabliſhed it, and not being enjoyed by the Engliſh nation at large, I preſume we ſhall not contend for the right of interfering in that branch, till ſuch time as the nation ſhall judge it expedient to open it to their ſubjects in common: whenever that is done, and it is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſteemed private property, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014616_0044_0F9433CC84C3DD28"/>
our right will inſtantly commence; and as this diſſolution of the Eaſt-India company's charter, will probably not take place, till ſome compenſation is made them by the nation, perhaps the Americans would not be backward in furniſhing their quota, to purchaſe the common right of trade in the eaſtern ſeas. I would wiſh us always to keep in view, <hi>a united intereſt,</hi> and that we may learn to think them inſeparable; for though time and the great changes of empires, may bring about mighty revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, yet ſo long as a happy connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion <hi>can</hi> be maintained, let every Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican endeavour to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Though the grand foundation of our claims in the preſent diſpute, is laid on <hi>natural liberty,</hi> as its ſureſt ground-work, yet we muſt ever be attentive to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical intereſts of the continent. It may be aſked, why a country whoſe claims to independancy are founded on <hi>natural right,</hi> ſhould chooſe to acknowledge themſelves ſubjects of a prince, at three thouſand miles diſtance, rather than eſtabliſh a head of their own? many reaſons may be offered in reply, but a few may ſuffice. In the firſt place, we are at preſent fixed in this ſtate; all our
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014616_0045_0F9433CD5055CB10"/>
governments are formed under this head; we have been ſucceſsful and happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and have found few or no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences from it; the government of England is ſo excellent a model, that moſt of the colonies think they could not ſubſtitute a better in its ſtead. A revolution in the form of a government, is too dangerous an experiment to be tried, except in caſes of the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; and there are few ſtates which do not chooſe to perſiſt even in a bad form, rather than riſque the conſequence of innovations. As the Americans are at preſent circumſtanced, they could no way unite themſelves to ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as in the crown of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to which they have been ſo long accuſtomed to confeſs allegiance; for ſhould they incline to have a crowned head amongſt themſelves, great and dreadful would be the diſſentions and confuſions, before they would agree to fix on the man. If a common wealth was to be aimed at, the jarring intereſts of the colonies, would long employ them in digeſting and ſettling their ſeveral claims and rights. We find in the moſt trivial concerns of life, that men often contend with great warmth and earneſtneſs: a
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:014616_0046_0F9433CF71C87DD8"/>
whole neighbourhood ſhall be at irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable variance on the trifling alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a road, when the ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſhall travel it in company with the moſt cordial friendſhip; and ſuch is the caſe in great changes, or revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in government; if the form be once agreed to, it is dangerous to touch it; and nothing ſhould tempt a people to riſque the publick tranquillity, but a firm perſuaſion that a change was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary. In the caſe of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, no change that I know of, could be propoſed, which ſhould induce us to unſettle our preſent happy form; a form under which we have lived till lately, like our firſt parents in paradiſe; peace and plenty were our portion, and the pleaſures of the golden age flouriſhed in our borders.</p>
            <p>To ſum up the whole: we have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that America has a juſt, equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and natural right to independance; that to ſupport this independance and protect her foreign trade, a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleet was neceſſary; that it might be more beneficial to the colonies to ſearch for a connexion with ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime power, than to attempt the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing one of their own; that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

European ſtates, England was the moſt eligible to negotiate with; that Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca might, conſiſtent with her own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, join in a certain proportion of the expences of a fleet, kept up for their mutual defence, and that common juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice required it; that parliamentary ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, was inconſiſtent with Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can liberty, and has no foundation in law or juſtice; that tho' we admit Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to paſs <hi>ſome</hi> laws to regualte trade, yet they ſhall only be ſuch as are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely intended for the benefit of the whole empire, and not for her own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advantage; that the Americans ſhall trade on an equal footing with the Engliſh; and laſtly, that it is the true intereſt of America, to continue under the preſent form of government, and acknowledge ſubjection to the <hi>crown</hi> of Great-Britain: how theſe ſeveral points are to be adjuſted and ſettled, will be a ſubject of much importance to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; ſhould we, on our part, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a diſpoſition to enter on the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, I have little doubt but England, on her part, will meet us half way.</p>
