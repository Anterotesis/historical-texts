            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SPEECH OF MR. MADISON, IN CONGRESS, JANUARY 14, 1794.</head>
            <p>HE began by obſerving, that he had expected, from what was intimated yeſterday, the ſequel of what was then ſaid againſt the reſolutions before the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee; but as there was a ſilence in that quarter, and no other member has riſen on either ſide of the queſtion, he himſelf would requeſt the attention of the committee.</p>
            <p>It had been much preſſed, that in the diſcuſſion of this ſubject, it ſhould be viewed in its commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations only. He was perfectly willing to meet every object that could be urged on that ground: But as he conceived it impoſſible to do full juſtice to the intereſts of the United States, without taking ſome collateral conſiderations into view; he ſhould be obliged, in the courſe of his remarks, to point at the political diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conduct of ſome of the nations of Europe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this country.</p>
            <p>The propoſitions immediately before the committee, turned on the queſtion, whether any thing ought to be done at this time, in the way of commercial regulations, towards vindicating and advancing our national intereſts. Perhaps it might be made a queſtion with ſome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in any caſe, legiſlative regulations of commerce were conſiſtent with its nature and proſperity.</p>

               </gap> individual ſagacity. He was perſuaded, that it would be happy for all nations, if the barriers erected by prejudice, by
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027258_0003_0FD3F2A677547D60"/>
avarice, and by deſpotiſm, were broken down, and a free intercourſe eſtabliſhed among them. Yet to this, as to all other general rules, there might be exceptions: And the rule itſelf required, what did not exiſt, that it ſhould be general.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this obſervation, he referred to the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation act of Great Britain, which, not being counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced by any ſimilar acts on the part of rival nations, had ſecured to Great Britain no leſs than <hi>eleven-twelfths</hi> of the ſhipping and ſeamen employed in her trade. It is ſtated, that in 1660, when the Britiſh act paſſed, the foreign tonnage was to the Britiſh as one to four: In 1700, leſs than one to ſix: In 1725, as one to nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen: In 1750, as one to twelve: In 1774, nearly the ſame. At the commencement of the period, the ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage was but 95,266 tons: At the end of it, 1,136,162.</p>
            <p>As another illuſtration, he mentioned the caſe where two countries happened to be in ſuch a relation to each other, that the one, by diſcouraging the manufactures of the other, might not only invigorate its own, but tranſplant the manufacturers themſelves. Here the gain would be a clear one; and the effect evidently conſiſtent with the principle of the theory.</p>
            <p>To allow trade to regulate itſelf, is not, therefore, to be admitted as a maxim <hi>univerſally</hi> ſound. Our own experience has taught us, that, in certain caſes, it is the ſame thing with allowing one nation to regulate it for another. Were the United States, in fact, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourſe with one nation only, and to oppoſe no reſtrictions whatever to a ſyſtem of foreign reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they would, of neceſſity, be deprived of all ſhare in the carriage, although their veſſels might be able to do it cheapeſt; as well as of the only reſources for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence on that ſide, where they muſt always be moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>. A ſmall burden only in foreign ports on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> veſſels, and a perfect equality of foreign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in our own po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> would gradually banish the latter altogether.</p>
            <p>This subject, as had been remarked on a former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, was not a novel one: It was co-eval with our political birth, and has at all times exerciſed the thoughts
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027258_0004_0FD3F2ABDE476760"/>
of reflecting citizens. As early as the year ſucceeding the peace, the effect of the foreign policy, which began to be felt in our trade and navigation, excited univerſal attention and inquietude. The firſt effort thought of, was an application of Congreſs to the ſtates for a grant of power, for a limited time, to regulate our foreign commerce; with a view, to controul the influence of unfavorable regulations in ſome caſes, and to conciliate an extenſion of favorable ones in others. From ſome circumſtances then incident to our ſituation, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from a radical vice in the then political ſyſtem of the United States, the experiment did not take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>The ſtates next endeavored to effect their purpoſe by ſeparate, but concurrent, regulations. Maſſachuſetts opened a correſpondence with Virginia and other ſtates, in order to bring about the plan. Here again the effort was abortive.</p>
            <p>Out of this experience, grew the meaſures which terminated in the eſtabliſhment of a government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to the regulation of our commercial interests, and the vindication of our commercial rights.</p>
            <p>As theſe were the firſt objects of the people in the ſteps taken for eſtabliſhing the preſent government, they were univerſally expected to be among the firſt fruits of its operation. In this expectation, the public were diſappointed. An attempt was made in different forms, and received the repeated ſanction of this, branch of the legiſlature, but they expired in the ſenate: Not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as was alledged, from a diſlike to the attempt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together but the modifications given to it. It has not appeared, however, that it was ever renewed in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent form in that houſe; and for ſome time it has been allowed to ſleep in both.</p>
            <p>If the reaſons which originally prevailed against mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſuch as thoſe now propoſed, had weight in them, they can no longer furniſh a pretext for oppoſition.</p>
            <p>When the ſubject was diſcuſſed in the firſt Congreſs at New-York, it was ſaid, that we ought to try the effect of a generous policy towards Great Britain; that we ought to give time for negociating a treaty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027258_0005_0FD3F2AD50A7E698"/>
that we ought to await the cloſe of negociations for explaining and executing the treaty of peace. We have now waited a term of more than four years. The treaty of peace remains unexecuted on her part; though all pretext for delay has been removed by the ſteps taken on ours. No treaty of commerce is either in train, or in proſpect. Inſtead of relaxations in former articles complained of, we ſuffer new and aggravated violations of our rights.</p>
            <p>In the view which he took of the ſubject, he called the attention of the committee particularly to the ſubject of navigation, of manufactures, and of the diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propoſed in the motion, between ſome nations and others.</p>
            <p>On the ſubject of navigation, he obſerved, that we were prohibited by the Britiſh laws from carrying to Great Britain the produce of other countries from their ports, or our own produce from the ports of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or the produce of other countries from our own ports; or to ſend our own produce from our own or other ports in the veſſels of other countries. This laſt reſtriction was, he obſerved, felt by the United States at the preſent moment. It was, indeed, the practice of Great Britain ſometimes to relax her navigation act ſo far, in time of war, as to permit to neutral veſſels a circuitous carriage; but as yet the act was in full force againſt the uſe of them for tranſporting the produce of the United States.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the laws of the United States al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Great Britain to bring into their ports, any thing ſhe might pleaſe, from her own or from other ports; and in her own or in other veſſels.</p>
            <p>In the trade between the United States and the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, the veſſels of the former were under an abſolute prohibition; whilſt Britiſh veſſels in that trade enjoyed all the privileges granted to other, even the moſt favored nations in their trade with us. The inequality in this caſe was the more ſtriking, as it was evident, that the Weſt-Indies were dependant on the United States for the ſupplies eſſential to them, and that the circumſtances which ſecured to the United States this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027258_0006_0FD3F2AFD8EA2C80"/>
advantage, enabled their veſſels to tranſport the ſupplies on far better terms than could be done by Britiſh veſſels.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate the policy requiſite in our commercial intercourſe with other nations, he preſented a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative view of the American and foreign tonnage em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the reſpective branches of it, from which it appeared, that the foreign ſtood to the American as follows:

            <p>It reſults from theſe facts, that in proportion as the trade might be diminiſhed with Great Britain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with other nations, would be the probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the American tonnage. It appeared, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that as the trade might paſs from Britiſh channels into thoſe of France, it would augment our tonnage at the rate of ten to one.</p>
            <p>The above calculation, he ſaid, had been made out on the documents of 1790, and on the amount of the tonnage <hi>entered</hi> in the ſeveral ports.

If this, which was liable to ſome remarks that might hereafter be made, was to be ſubſtituted, it afforded another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, diminiſhing the exceſs in favor of Great Britain, but augmenting it in favor of the United States in moſt of the other inſtances.</p>

Such a diſproportion, taking even the reduced one, in the navigation with Great Britain, was the more mortifying, when the nature and amount of our exports are conſidered. Our exports are not only for the moſt part, either immediately neceſſaries of life, or ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as neceſſaries to manufactures, neceſſaries of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and life to manufacturers, and muſt thence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſure market wherever they are received at all: But the peculiar bulkineſs of them furniſhes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age belonged to that nation, the policy which governs her navigation laws, would probably have given the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive carriage to her own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ttoms. It is equally in our power, if ſo ſelfiſh a principle ſhould be forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to ſecure to our bottoms the ſame monopoly; leaving to other nations with which we trade, the like excluſive carriage of their exports. The regulation would, to be ſure be mutually inconvenient; and, by forcing the veſſels of each party to return empty from foreign markets, be ſo far a tax on the intercourſe.— This effect, however, did not diſprove the power in general which the character of our exports gave us, over the carriage of them, nor leſſen the argument drawn from it. Examine it in relation to Great Britain. The bulk of her exports to us, compared with that of ours to her, is as nothing. An inconſiderable quantity of ſhipping would ſuffice for hers, whilſt ours can load about 222,000 tons: Including the articles ſhe exports from the Weſt-Indies to this country, they bear no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to ours. Yet in the entire trade between the United States and the Britiſh dominions, her tonnage is to that of the United States as 156,000, employing 9360 ſeamen, to 66,000, employing 3690 ſeamen. Were a rigid exertion of our right to take place, it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our tonnage to 222,000, and leave to Great Britain employment for much leſs than the actual ſhare now enjoyed by the United States. It could not be wiſhed to puſh matters to this extremity. It ſhewed, however, the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027258_0008_0FD3F2B281B3DA20"/>
was placed by foreign regulations, and the reaſonableneſs of peaceable attempts to meliorate it. We might at leaſt, in availing ourſelves of the merit of our exports, contend for ſuch regulations as would reverſe the proportion, and give the United States the 156,000 tonnage, and 9360 ſeamen, inſtead of the 66,000 ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and 3690 ſeamen.</p>
            <p>He here adverted to the diſcount of ten of ten per cent. on the duties paid by goods imported in American bottoms; remarking, thai it was not founded on the true policy of encouraging our ſhipping. It was not the <hi>imports,</hi> but <hi>exports,</hi> that regulated the quantity of tonnage.— What was imported in American veſſls, which would otherwiſe return empty, was, no doubt, a benefit to the American merchant, but could ſlightly only, if at all, increaſe the maſs of our tonnage. The way to effect this, was to ſecure <hi>exportations</hi> to American bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
            <p>Proceeding to the ſubject of manufactures, he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it preſented no compenſations for the inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the principles and effects of the navigation ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</p>
            <p>We conſume Britiſh manufactures to double the amount of what Britain takes from us; and <hi>quadruple</hi> the amount of what ſhe actually <hi>conſumes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We take every thing after it has undergone all the profitable labor that can be beſtowed on it: She receives in return, raw materials, the food of her induſtry.</p>
            <p>We ſend neceſſaries te her: She ſends ſuperfluities to us.</p>
            <p>We admit <hi>every thing</hi> ſhe pleaſed to ſend us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her own or alien production. She refuſes not only our manufactures, but the articles we wiſh moſt to ſend her; our wheat and flour, our fiſh, and our ſalted proviſions. Theſe conſtitute our beſt ſtaples for exportation, as her manufactures conſtitute hers.</p>
            <p>It appeared by an authentic document he had exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, that of the <hi>manufactured</hi> articles imported in 1790, amounting to 15,295,638 dollars, 97 cents. we received from and <hi>through</hi> Great Britain, 13,965,464 dollars, 95 cents.</p>

            <p>As to the diſerimination propoſed between nations having, and not having, commercial treaties with us, the principle was embraced by the laws of moſt, if not all, the ſtates, while the regulation of trade was in their hands.</p>

But the gentleman added nothing to alleviate the misfortune, when he adviſed us to make no efforts for putting an end to it. The evils reſulting from ſuch a ſtate of things, were as ſerious as they were numerous. To ſay nothing of ſudden derangements from the caprice

with which ſovereigns might be ſeized, there were caſualties which might not be avoidable. A general bankruptcy, which was a poſſible event, in a nation with which we were ſo connected, would reverberate upon us with a moſt dreadful ſhock. A partial bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy had actually and lately taken place; and was ſeverely felt in our commerce. War is a common event particularly to Great-Britain, and involves us in the embarraſſments it brings on her commerce, whilſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>If the queſtion be aſked, what might be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of counter-efforts, and whether this attempt to vindicate our public intereſts would not produce them? His anſwer was, that he did not in the leaſt apprehend ſuch a conſequence, as well becauſe the meaſure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded no pretext, being ſhort of what was already done by Great-Britain in her commercial ſyſtem, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe would be the greateſt ſufferer from a ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the trade, between thtwo countries it we ſhould force on ſuch a criſis.</p>
            <p>Her merchants would feel it. Her navigation would feel it. Her manufacturers would feel it. Her Weſt-Indies would be ruined by it. Her revenue would deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel it. And her government would feel it thro every nerve of its operations. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>He dwelt particularly on the dependance of Britiſh manufacturers on the market of the United States. He
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027258_0012_0FD3F2BA0243ECF0"/>
referred to a paper in Anderſon's hiſtory of commerce, which ſtates the amount of Britiſh manufactures at £ 51,310,000 ſterling, and the number of ſouls em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in, and ſupported by them, at 5,250,000. Supp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the United states to conſume two and a half mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Britiſh manufactures, which is a moderate eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the loſs of their market would deprive of ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence 250,000 ſouls. Add 50,000 who depend for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment on our raw materials. Here are 300,000 ſouls, who live by our cuſtom. Let them be driven to poverty and deſpair by acts of their own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what would be the conſequence? Moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably an acquiſition of ſo many uſeful citizens to the United States, which form the natural aſylum againſt the diſtreſſes of Europe. But whether they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in diſcontent and wretchedneſs in their own country, or ſeek their fortunes in another, the evil would be felt by the Britiſh government as equally great, and be avoided with equal caution.</p>
            <p>It might be regarded be obſerved, as a general rule, that where one nation conſumed the neceſſaries of life produced by another, the conſuming nation was depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the producing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>. On the other hand, where the coſumption conſiſted of ſuperflukies, the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nation was dependant on the conſuming one. The United States were in the fortunate ſituation of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both theſe advantages over Great-Britain. They ſupply a part of her dominions with the neceſſaries of life. They conſume ſuperfluities which give bread to her people in another part. Great Britain therefore is under a double dependance on the commerce of the United States. She depends on them for what ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conſumes: ſhe depends on them for what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.</p>
            <p>In proportion as a nation manufactures luxuries muſt be its diſadvantage in conteſts of every ſort with its cuſtomers. The reaſon is obvious. What is luxury to the conſumer is a neceſſary to the manufacturer. By changing a faſhion, or diſappointing a fancy only, bread may be taken from the mouths of thouſands whoſe induſtry is devoted to the gratifications of artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial wants.</p>

It was not, he obſerved, the prince who petitioned the manufacturers to continue to make the buckles, but the manufacturers who petitioned their cuſtomer to buy them. The relation was ſimilar between the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can cuſtomers and the Britiſh manufacturers. And if a law were to paſs for putting a ſtop to the life of their ſuperfluities, or a ſtop were otherwiſe to be put to it, it would quickly be ſeen from which the diſtreſs and ſuplications would flow.</p>

            <p>In time of war or famine the dependenee of the Weſt-Indies is felt in all its energy. It is ſometimes ſuch as to appeal to our humanity as well as our intereſt for relief.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027258_0014_0FD3F2C01149EB28"/>
And yet the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Smith) had conſidered it as a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or that we were allowed to ſend our proviſions in Britiſh bottomsand in theſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the Weſt-Indies. The favor reduced to plain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the mouth of their planters, would run thus:— We will agree to buy your proviſions rather than ſtarve, and let you have our rum, which we can ſell no where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elſe; but we reſerve out of this indulgence a monopoly of the carriage to Britiſh veſſels.</p>
            <p>With regard to revenue, the Britiſh reſources were extremely exhauſted in compariſon with thoſe of the United States.</p>
            <p>The people of Great-Britain were taxed at the rate of 40ſ. a head: the people of the United States at not more than 6ſ. a head: leſs than one-ſixth of the Britiſh tax.</p>
            <p>As the price of labor which pays the tax is double in the United States, to what it is in Great-Britain, the burden on American citizens is leſs than one-twelfth of the burden on Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed that Britain alone does not bear the whole burden. She levies indirect taxes on her Weſt-Indies and on her Eaſt-Indies; and derives from an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſence in her monopolizing regulations, an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible tribute from the whole commercial world.</p>
            <p>Still however the difference of burden in the two countries is immenſe.</p>
            <p>Britain has moreover great arrears of unfunded debts. She is threatened with defects in her revenue even at this time. She is engaged in an expenſive war. And ſhe raiſes the ſupplies for it on the moſt expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive terms.</p>
            <p>Add to the whole that her population is ſtationary if not diminiſhing, whilſt that of the United States is in a courſe of increaſe beyond example.</p>
            <p>Should it ſtill be aſked whether the impoſt might not be affected and how a deficiency could be ſupplied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he thought ſufficient anſwers might be given.</p>
            <p>He took for granted that the articles ſubjected to the additional duties would continue to come according to the demand for them: And believed if the duties were
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027258_0015_0FD3F2C174907390"/>
prudently adjuſted, the increaſe of the duties would ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the decreaſe of importation.</p>
            <p>Our country is able to import, and probably will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in proportion to our exports. Our exports amount, ſay to, twenty millions of dollars. If we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port leſs from one country we ſhall import more from another. If we import leſs of ſome things we ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port more of other things: and according to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports will be our revenue.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe Great-Britain to make the raſh and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable experiment of prohibiting all commerce with the United States: She does not conſume more than one-fourth of our exports; and we derive perhaps nearly half our revenue from the productions of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. In this point of view we ſhould at the worſt have three-fourths of our exports to pay for our reduced im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; and conſequently a balance of about five mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſpecie flowing into our country. The faculty which this would give to operations of revenue, togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the conſideration that the labor employed on one fourth of our ordinary exports, would be employed for internal purpoſes, might aſſure us that a judicious gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment would eaſily be able to provide the means of ſupplying the deficiency of impoſt.</p>
            <p>But it was ſuperfluous to enter into calculations of this ſort. He recurred to the utter improbability that ſuch a contingency ſhould happen. He was fully perſuaded, that the reſolutions, if agreed to, would not impair the revenue.</p>
            <p>It is objected, that Spain and Portugal, who are good cuſtomers to us, and the latter particularly friendly, having no commercial treaty with us, will come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the operation of the reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Several anſwers mabe given to this objection.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. They do not manufacture the articles in queſtion ſo as to be ſenſibly affected.</item>
               <item>2. They employ but little tonnage in our trade: Spain 2,689 tons only; Portugal 2,340 tons only: They are ſuppoſed to be little anxious to increaſe the foreign branches of their carrying trade, being content with the internal trade carried on with their own dominions. As
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027258_0016_0FD3F2C312AE41D0"/>
they have no navigation act within the purview of the reſolutions, they would not be expoſed to the retaliating clauſes on that ſubject.</item>
               <item>3. If friendly, they can be admitted to treaty on eqitable conditions whenever they pleaſe.</item>
               <item>4. They can eaſily be excepted, if thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, either by a general proviſo that the reſolutions ſhall not extend to nations having no navigation act ſuch as is therein deſcribed; or by providing that they ſhall not extend to countries ſouth of Cape-Finiſterre, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction familiar to the Britiſh ſtatute-book.</item>
            </list>
            <p>It is ſaid that Great-Britain treats the United States as wll as ſhe treats other nations, and therefore they ought to be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>If other nations were willing to bear unequal regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or unable to vindicate their rights, it was no example for us.</p>
            <p>But is it true that the ſame degree of reciprocity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts between the United States and Great-Britain, as between Great-Britain and other countries? He did not admit this to be the caſe. Where treaties exiſted, they ſtipulated in many inſtances, mutual and equal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of intercourſe. He gave an example in the treaty of Methuen, in which the admiſſion of Britiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens by Portugal was balanced by the admiſſion of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal wine, by Great-Britain. The treaty with France of late date, was another example, where a variety of reciprocal privileges and countervailing duties, were minutely provided for. Where no treaties exiſted or where they were ſilent, there were often legal regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reciprocating the regulations of Great Britain. He referred to the laws of Sweden and Denmark on the ſubject of manufactures a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> inſtances.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid Great-Britain treats us as well as other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions treat us. What nation he aſked, had ſuch a navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation act? What nation beſides, excludes us from a circuitous trade? What nation excludes us from carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own commodities in our own bottoms, where the carriage is allowed to her bottoms?</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that at leaſt Great-Britain treats us s well as we are treated by France, who will be favored by the reſolutions. This point was particularly labored yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027258_0017_0FD3F2C4823D8068"/>
by the gentleman from South-Carolina (Mr. Smith) who made a compariſon of thoſe two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the principal baſis of the diſcuſſion. As they were in fact the two countries which ſtood in the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant relations to the United States, the ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a pretty accurate view of their reſpective diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, regulations, and intercourſe with this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>On the ſubject of the diſpoſitions of France and Great-Britain towards the United States, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (Mr. Smith) was of a very different opinion, Mr. Madiſon obſerved, from that expreſſed in the meſſage of the Preſident. The meſſage informed the houſe, that France had generally manifeſted a friendly diſpoſition towards the United States, had granted advantages to their commerce, and had actually made overtures for placing it permanently on a better footing. While the language of the communications, with reſpect to Great-Britain, ſufficiently proves that there was no room for compliments of a like kind to that nation.</p>
            <p>He meant to ſhew, however, from a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, in what light the two nations ſtood to us; and for that purpoſe ſhould ſubmit to the committee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative ſtatement, as the gentleman had done, of their commercial policy towards us. He premiſed, however, that he could not follow the example of recurring to a period antecedent to the French revolution for evidence in relation to France. Mr. Smith ſeemed to think, that the order of things ſubſequent to that period, could not be regarded as a ſettled order. He (Mr.Madiſon) on the contrary, conſidered it as the only ſettled order. He hoped and believed, that the revolution was not a fugitive thing, as ſome might wiſh, but that it was irreverſibly eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and that the new republic would flouriſh for ever on the ruins of the ancient monarchy. He ſhould not, however, he ſaid, reject from his enquiry, what was done previous to the date of the republic in favor of the United States, becauſe it could not be reaſonably ſuppoſed that the diſpoſition of the nation would be leſs favorable now, than it was under the former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:027258_0018_0FD3F2C6C7692010"/>He then proceeded to a view of the footing on which the commerce ſtood with the Britiſh and French do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wheat and Flour.</hi> In France free, that is to ſay (under a duty of one-eighth per cent. as a cuſtom-houſe regulation, merely for aſcertaining the quantity imported.—This remark is to be applied to ſeveral other articles, which will be mentioned as free.</p>
            <p>In Great-Britain wheat and flour are prohibited, until the price is up at 6ſ3 ſterling a buſhel; which as to the United States, may be deemed a perpetual prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In the French Weſt-Indies, theſe articles are alſo free; and as he at firſt ſtated, by a general law which had been ſuſpended from time to time; but being told that he was miſtaken, the articles being prohibited by a general law, and free only by ſuſpenſions, he ſaid, that although his documents gave him other information, he ſhould leave the fact for further examination; adding, however, that it was not eſſential, as the actual practice and diſpoſition of France on this ſubject were chiefly to be regarded.</p>
            <p>In the Britiſh Weſt-Indies theſe articles were free, but in Britiſh bottoms only.</p>

the face of the earth, ſincerely friendly to the republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can form of government eſtabliſhed in this country.</p>
            <p>Of all the objections which Mr. Madiſon had heard ſuggeſted againſt the reſolutions, the moſt extravagant and chimerical was the idea of a war with Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in conſequence of them. He was at a loſs to ſay whether ſuch an objection were a greater inſult to the character of that nation or to the underſtanding of America. At the utmoſt the propoſitions go only to a reciprocity. They do not in fact go ſo far. On what imaginable pretext then can Great-Britain make was upon us. If we were no longer colonies, but indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtates, we ſurely can do what all independent ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es do, regulate our trade as may ſoit our own intereſts.— And Great-Britain can have the leaſt right of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to complain of it, becauſe it is her own example which we follow. If war therefore ſhould be made on us it would only prove a fixt predetermination to make it. And in that caſe pretexts more plauſible than any commercial regulations could eaſily be found or framed for the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The next ground on which he examined the ſubject was it's operation among the ſeveral parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It was admitted and regretted, that the immediate benefits and burdens would not be equally diſtributed among all the ſtates. More than a due ſhare of the former would flow to the northern diviſion: More than a due ſhare of the latter would fall on the ſouthern.— This was unavoidably produced by the unequal advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made in manufactures and navigation; and it was an inconvenience that had neceſſarily taken place in a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of other inſtances. It would be found, however, on a fair attention to the ſubject, that the inequality would be leſs than at firſt appeared.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to manufactures, the ſouthern ſtates were at leaſt equally intereſted in encouraging and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting a competition for our market, among different nations of Europe, inſtead of being ſo much in the hands of a ſingle one.</p>
            <p>The duty on the ſiner articles imported would fall on thoſe moſt able to bear it; and would be pretty equally diffuſed through the union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:027258_0021_0FD3F2CBB2984D10"/>The duty on the coarſer articles would be ſaved in proportion to the progreſs made in manufactures among ourſelves; and he was able to ſay, with great pleaſure, that thoſe carried on, not in public factories, but in the houſhold or family way, which he regarded as the moſt important way, were nearly, if not quite as far advanced in the ſouthern country as in the middle and northern. Virginia was proceeding with great ſpirit in this branch of induſtry. North-Carolina he underſtood was doing the ſame; and there was no reaſon why the more ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates would not avail themſelves of the reſource, eſpecially as they enjoyed ſuperior advantages in the article of cotton, a primary material for the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The exports would not be materially affected, unleſs Great Britain ſhould, contrary to all probability, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the benefits of the trade in them, and expoſe her Weſt-India iſland to the danger of famine; and in that Caſe, the inconveniences would not be local, but general.</p>
            <p>Even in the article of tonnage, the inequality at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though conſiderable, was not ſo great as he had imagined, before he examined the real ſtate of it. It appeared, from the official reports lately made on that ſubject, that the ſtates ſouth of Pennſylvania (which has about her due ſhare) have within one-third of their due quota. Georgia has more than her ſhare. South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina nearly her ſhare. North-Carolina has three-eighths below her ſhare. Virginia has about half her ſhare. Maryland has more than her ſhare. Delaware leſs than her ſhare.</p>
            <p>This computation is not, perhaps, very accurate, becauſe it is founded on the relative population of the ſtates. It ſhould rather have reference to the value and volume of the produce exported from the ſeveral ſtates: But as ſeveral of them carry on their trade through their neighbors, this rule of calculation would, in fact, be more uncertain than the other.</p>
            <p>Whatever be the rule, Virginia, he remarked, was the ſtate that appeared moſt deficient; her exports, both in value and bulk, being in full proportion to her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and her tonnage being more ſhort of that, than could be ſaid of any ſtate. He had every reaſon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027258_0022_0FD3F2CDB0FEA210"/>
to believe, that the great body of the people of Virginia would cheerfully concur in any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſacrifices that might be neceſſary to vindicate our public rights, and our commercial intereſts.</p>
            <p>It was a conſideration that ought to have great weight with the ſouthern ſtates, that a home market for their naval <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ores would be extended by every meaſure favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own navigation; and that they muſt ſoon begin themſelves to turn to effect their natural advantages for ſhip-building. Having the materials on the ſpot, they would not be long in imitating their northern brethren. North-Carolina was ſingularly favored in this particular. There was not a ſingle article uſed in the various compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts of a ſhip, which ſhe did not po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eſs, or could not raiſe within herſelf.</p>

               </gap> celerity for the tranſportation of her produce, was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atteſted by what they had effected before the revo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In two points of view, the ſouthern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly intereſted in promoting our navigation.</p>
            <p>Firſt—As they are, in ſome reſpects, the weaker part of the union, and have moſt wealth expoſed on the ſea, they have moſt need of that protection which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from extenſive marine reſources. The exiſtence of theſe will either prevent attack, or can readily be turned into the means of repelling it.</p>
            <p>Secondly—As they have ſo much valuable and bulky produce to carry to market, it is their intereſt to poſſeſs a conveyance for it, that may be as little affected as poſſible by the contingencies and wars of other nations; and particularly of Great Britain, a nation which is ſo frequently at war, and which has ſo diſproportionate a ſhare in our carrying trade. This ſubject, he ſaid, had been placed in ſo ſtriking a view by the Secretary of State, in a former report on the fiſheries, that he ſhould rely on the patience of the committee in reading the obſervations and calculations to which he alluded. He here read the following note at the end of that report;</p>

            <p>I had been aſked what ground there was for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that Great-Britain would be led by the meaſures propoſed, to change her policy towards the United states. He thought we had the beſt ground for relying on ſuch an effect.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that when ſhe apprehended ſuch meaſures would be taken, ſhe manifeſted a readineſs to admit a greater reciprocity into the commerce between the two countries. A bill for the purpoſe was brought into the houſe of commons by the preſent miniſter, Mr. Pitt, and would probably have paſſed into a law, if hopes had not ſprung up that they ſhould be able to maintain their excluſive ſyſtem. Knox, an under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, appears from a collection of papers publiſhed by him, to have been the chief adviſers in the cabinet, as Lord Sheffield was the great champion before the public, of this experiment.

plan of retaliating reſtriction—and, 3dly. That local intereſts and prejudices predominated ſo much among the ſtates, that they would never even agree in making an attempt.</p>
            <p>It is now thoroughly underſtood and admitted by the moſt biaſſed judges, that the Britiſh continental colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies cannot ſupply the iſlands: that as well as the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, they depend frequently for eſſential ſupplies on the United States. This calculation therefore has failed Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>The next has been completely deſtroyed by the change of our former frail confederacy, into a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is found to be adequate to all its national objeds. —This hope has therefore in like manner fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The only remaining hope that can induce Great-Britain to perſevere in the plan of conduct ſhe has adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the United States, lies in the ſuppoſed diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of reconciling their different intereſts and local pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicies. The preſent occaſion will decide whether this hope alſo ſhall be withdrawn from her; or whether ſhe is to be inſpired with freſh confidence in purſuing her own interests without a due reſpect either for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts or for our rights</p>
            <p>He could not but view the preſent as perhaps the final chance of combining the opinions and intereſts of the ſeveral quarters of the Union in ſome proper and adequate plan. If at a moment when ſo many occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences conſpire to unite the public councils; when the public mind is ſo well diſpoſed to ſecond all equitable and peaceable means of doing juſtice to our country; and when our commerce is ſo critically important to the vital reſources of Great-Britain, it ſhould be found that nothing can be done, he could foreſee no circumſtances under which ſucceſs was to be expected. To reject the propoſitions therefore, whilſt nothing better was ſubſtituted, muſt convey the moſt unfavorable impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our national character, and rivet the fetters on our commerce, as well as prolong other cauſes which had produced ſuch injurious conſequences to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He would not permit himſelf to apprehend that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027258_0026_0FD3F2D54B7F5C00"/>
ſuch would be the event of the deliberations of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
            <p>As it appeared, he ſaid, that moſt of the objections againſt the propoſed Reſolutions, had been made by thoſe who meant to combat them, and that a queſtion would ſoon be called for; it might perhaps be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould review thoſe objections, and aſſign the reaſons which induced him to continue in the opinion he at firſt entertained. He wiſhed it not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that he meant to examine every particular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in the courſe of ſo extenſive a diſcuſſion, had been oppoſed to the meaſure. The committee muſt have perceived, that ſome of them had been of a nature not to merit an anſwer; and that others had ſufficiently anſwered themſelves. He ſhould extend his obſervations to ſuch topics only as might be thought to need explanation, and to have an influence on the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Previous, however, to this general ſurvey of the ground which had been travelled over he ſhould ſo far preſume on the patience of the committee, as to recur to the original oppoſition made by the member from South-Carolina (Mr. Smith) and to take notice of ſome particulars in what had been urged by him, which were left unanſwered at the time.</p>
            <p>The gentleman had thought proper to introduce his diſcourſe with a very unmerited attack on the late Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, and to mingle with it a variety of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms on the facts and opinions ſtated in his report, on the ſubject under conſideration. The ſpirit and manner in which the attack had been made, and which could not have eſcaped the attention of the committee. would be left in that ſilence which may beſt expreſs the ſentiment they muſt have inſpired. He ſhould indeed have thought it leſs neceſſary to take further notice than he had already done, of the matter of the gentleman's remarks, if attempts had not been made, particularly by a friend of the gentleman (Mr. Ames) to give a weight to his ſtatements and inferences, which it would be ſhewn they did not merit: and if the taſk did not afford
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027258_0027_0FD3F2D7A167C9D0"/>
an opportunity of eludicating ſome particular points relied on, by the opponents of the reſolutions.</p>
            <p>It was made a charge againſt the ſecretary of State, that he takes no notice of the <hi>higher</hi> duty impoſed by Great-Britain on other foreign tobacco, than is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on American (the former being 3ſ6 ſter. a pound, the latter 1ſ3) whilſt he takes care to mention the <hi>high</hi> duty impoſed on the American; although the diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is in favor of the United States, and is againſt Portugal, a country in particular connection with Great-Britain; and although the high duty of 1ſ3 is immaterial to the United States, being paid by the conſumer of the Tobacco in Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>It was unfortunate for the gentleman that this charge is fallacious in every member of it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The diſcrimination is not in favor of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, either in its intention, or in its operation; not in its intention becauſe it was made in reference to this country, when it was a part of the Britiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and not in reference to us as Independent States; not in its operation, becauſe if the diſcrimination were aboliſhed, it would bring no rival of our tobacco into the Britiſh market. This is proved by the fact, that in other markets, as that of France, where no ſuch diſcrimination exiſts, the American tobacco is without a rival. It was well known that this and the other apparent favors to this country, were a remnant of the Old Colonial code, which having become a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Statute book, had not yet been ſtruck out of it.</item>
               <item>2. If the diſcrimination had no effect in favor of the United States, it could not for the ſame reaſon, be a prejudice to Portugal. If it were neceſſary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to go into the enquiry, more direct proofs could be given on this point.</item>
               <item>3. High duties do affect the United States which produce the article, though paid by the Britiſh conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They have a double effect: They leſſen the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity called for; and by leſſening the competition, they leſſen alſo the price. This was a truth that could need no comment.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:027258_0028_0FD3F2D8D71EC708"/>It was to be remarked however, that the zeal of the gentleman on this ſubject, was ſuch, that it had led him to extend the fallacy of his reaſoning to rice, the ſtaple article of his own State. This article pays a duty of 7ſ4 ſter. per hundred weight, but like the duty on tobacco, being paid by the conſumer, was ſaid to be of little concern to us.</p>
            <p>Call the price of rice 10ſ ſterling: the duty is 7ſ4. The whole claſs of people then, in Great-Britain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the claſs who cannot afford to eat rice at the price of 10ſ. and the claſs who are willing to eat it at 17ſ4 are prohibited the conſumption by the duty. Was this a circumſtance of no concern to the rice planters? The gentleman ſhould have been reminded of his error by his own arguments.</p>
            <p>As an apology for the duty impoſed in Great-Britain, he tells us it was meant to prevent the uſe of rice as a <hi>Subſtitute,</hi> for the bread-ſtuffs produced by Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain herſelf. Without the preventing duty then, rice would have been <hi>Subſtituted</hi> in place of wheat, in the opinion of the Britiſh Parliament, and the demand for it, in the Britiſh market, ſo far increaſed.</p>
            <p>As a merit in the Britiſh Weſt-India regulations over thoſe of France, it was ſtated by the gentleman, that rice in the Weſt-Indies is a common food; that in the Britiſh, the importation of it is free; in the French, ſubject to a duty, though an inconſiderable one. In Britain then, where there is a high duty, rice is not an article of common food; in the iſlands where there is no duty, it is a common food; and the advantage of the Britiſh Weſt-India market to us over the French, is, that the duty in the latter favors <hi>cheaper Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another proof of the diſpoſition of Great-Britain to favor the United States in the Weſt-India market, is the prohibition of all foreign rice but the American.— The ſame remark may be repeated here, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>mination in favor of our tobacco. It is an old colony regulation that has no effect whatever. What other foreign rice could be brought to the Weſt-Indies? Is it the Eaſt-India rice? that is prohibited
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027258_0029_0FD3F2DA3556C518"/>
by its diſtance. Is it the rice of Portugal? that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the laws of Portugal, and probably alſo by the lower price of the Carolina rice.</p>
            <p>The inference which the gentleman had drawn from the comparative regulations of Great-Britain and France on the ſubject of rice was ſo curious that it was worth a moment's attention.</p>
            <p>The facts, Mr. Madiſon obſerved, ſtood thus. In France the duty is 1-3 per cent. In Great-Britain 7ſ4 ſterling a hundred. In the French iſlands the duty is 1 per cent. In the Britiſh free with a prohibition of other foreign rice.</p>
            <p>As the duty of 1 per cent. is ſcarcely ſenſible, and the prohibition, as ſhewn, is merely nominal, the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the iſlands may be regarded as too immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to affect the compariſon.</p>
            <p>Paſſing to the two parent ſtates, the duty in France is 1-8 per cent.—The duty in Great-Britain, 50 or 60 per cent.</p>
            <p>Here then is nearly an equality in one part, and a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of 50 or 60 per cent. in the other part of the two dominions; and yet the gentleman could ſay, it was not eaſy to pronounce, whether the article of rice ſtands on a better footing in the ſyſtem of the one, than in the ſyſtem of the other.</p>
            <p>Another charge againſt the ſecretary of ſtate is, that his report calls the diſcriminating duties in Great-Britain in favor of American <hi>wood,</hi> ſmall, whereas they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and in ſeveral inſtances high.</p>
            <p>Mr. Madiſon ſaid he had not found leiſure to trace this branch of our exports into all the details neceſſary to decide in what degree the duties were ſmall or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and in what proportion the ſeveral dutied ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles went to Great-Britain. He obſerved in general that the greater part of our woods were exported to the Weſt-Indies, not to Great-Britain. That in the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods at leaſt the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ic nations were not rivals to the United States. It was known that Sweden and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark were ſo deficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> in Out that their public navies were ſupplied from Germany, and that the ſhip timbers of Ruſſia were tranſported a thouſand or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

miles from her interior dominions. The Fir, of which the Swediſh and Daniſh merchant ſhips were built, does not laſt more than ſeven or eight years, and could not therefore be a rival to the durable woods of the United States.</p>
            <p>He obſerved alſo that lumber, and particularly the ſhip woods of the country, were ſo precious and ſo ſure of being in demand, that they never could fear a rival, or need a foreign bounty. This was an article very different from ſuch as were an annual product of the earth, and as could be raiſed wherever the climate and ſoil permitted according to the occaſional demand. The foreſts that were to ſupply the ſhip yards were the growth of centuries, and where once deſtroyed, as they generally are in Europe, are rarely replaced at all, and never can become the rival to America, which enjoys them as the ſpontaneous gift of nature.</p>
            <p>To enhance the merit of the Britiſh regulations, the gentleman had told us, that wood was ſubject to a duty of 1 per cent. in the French Iſlands, and in the Britiſh free, with a prohibition of other foreign wood. This was of little conſequence. The duty was a trifle, and falling on a neceſſary article to be got no where elſe, probably was paid by the French iſlariders. And the prohibition was ideal, the American wood being the only reſource for the Britiſh market.</p>
            <p>The article of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> was admitted by the gentleman himſelf to be more favored by the French than the Britiſh ſyſtem, though he admits it with reluctance and diminiſhes the difference as much as poſſible. The caſe however is ſo clear, and the facts ſo palpable, that they ſpeak for themſelves. Under the French regulations, this important article of our commerce is ſubject to duties only, in Europe and the Weſt-Indies. Under the Britiſh, it is under prohibition in both. The amount of the whole export is 382,237 quintals of dry, and 57,424 barrels of pickled fiſh. Of this the French conſumption, is 252,171, quintals and 45,164 barrels; that is, nearly 2-3ds of the dry, and 4-5ths of the pickled fiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:027258_0031_0FD3F2DDCB6F0468"/>Here Mr. Madiſon, proceeding to the ſubject of whale oil, called the attention of the committee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the repreſentation and language of Mr. Smith as to the conduct of France, in inviting the fiſhermen of Nantucket to remove and ſettle at Dunkirk. Mr. Smith, he ſaid, had not only undervalued the monopoly of the French market granted to the United States, but had, by a mutilated quotation of a report of the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of ſtate on the fiſheries, changed the true aſpect of the attempt to draw away the Nantueket fiſhermen. The fact was, that although the conduct of France was very different from what was to have been wiſhed, as well as from what was contemplated by the marquis la Fayette, who had patrionized the intereſt of fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet that the project of tempting them to emigrate had originated in Great-Britain, and was a <hi>counter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> on the part of France. How the gentleman hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to omit the antecedent attempt of Great-Britain, and thereby exaggerate that of France, Mr. Madiſon did not undertake to explain: but it was the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, as the whole account of the tranſaction was contained in the ſame page of the report, nay, in the ſame paragraph, from which the gentleman had extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his information.</p>
            <p>Here he read the paſſage in that report and produced the Britiſh ſtatute, inviting the whale fiſhermen, by an offer of certain privileges, to emigrate to Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>A further charge againſt the ſecretary of ſtate is that in his ſtatement of the tonnage of the United States employed in the trade with the French and Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; he founds it, not on the <hi>actual number of ſhips,</hi> but on the number of <hi>entries.</hi> This charge was as ſingular as it was uncandid.</p>
            <p>The report ſtated the fact, that the American tonnage <hi>entering</hi> our ports from the ſeveral nations with which the United States traded, was ſo and ſo; and in this ſtatement, it purſued the official returns made on the ſubject. What more was to be required?</p>
            <p>In giving the fact, the Secretary impoſed on no one, In cauſe he ſtated the tonnage to be entry tonnage, as it really was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:027258_0032_0FD3F2DEE8F5AC08"/>He followed the beſt guide that exiſted, an official re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the proper offices.</p>
            <p>No return of the <hi>actual</hi> tonnage, as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>entry</hi> tonnage, had at the time, ever been made from any office, or called for by any act, of Congreſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt return ever made in the latter form, was called for ſince the Reſolutions on the table were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations might have reſtrained the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman from this unwarranted attack on the accuracy of the Report.</p>
            <p>But he ought at leaſt to have been ſure, that whilſt he was charging the ſecretary with following an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous guide, he was himſelf following one that was not erroneous. The examination of this point involved facts which merited the particular attention of the committee.</p>
            <p>The ſtatement of the <hi>entry tonnage</hi> of the United States in <hi>foreign</hi> trade for 1792, lately called for and reported, is 415,331 tons. The ſtatement of the <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual</hi> tonnage for the <hi>ſame</hi> year is 239,394 tons.</p>
            <p>On comparing theſe two quantities, it was evident that both could not be right. If the <hi>entry</hi> tonnage was no more than was ſtated, it was inconceivable that the <hi>actual</hi> tonnage cauld be as much as was ſtated. It would allow the veſſels in the European and Weſt-India trades together, but ſome what more than one voyage and a third a year. It could never be ſuppoſed, that this correſponded with the fact. How then was the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in the two ſtatements to be explained? Mr. Madiſon ſaid, as he did not know by what rule the actual tonnage was made up, he would form no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture on the ſubject. He hoped, and wiſhed that ſome gentleman more converſant with it, would ſolve the phenomenon. He did not call on the gentleman from South-Carolina, becauſe he moſt of all, muſt be puzzled to account for it; having ſtated that our veſſels in the trade to Europe make <hi>two</hi> voyages, and in the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia trade <hi>four</hi> voyages a year.</p>
            <p>Beſides the evidence contained in this compariſon of the aggregate tonnage in the two different forms, in
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027258_0033_0FD3F2E299DAC258"/>
which it had been reported, the exiſtence of error ſome where, and probably in the account of the actual ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, reſulted from a comparative view of our exports to the Britiſh dominions, for the two years of 1790 and 1792, and of the whole tonnage American and Britiſh employed in conveying them.</p>
            <p>In the former year, the exports were 9,363,416 dollars. In the latter, 8,269,495 dollars: the exceſs for 1790, 1,093,921 dollars.</p>
            <p>The entry tonnage, Britiſh and American, for 1790, was 273,580 tons.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh <hi>entry</hi> tonnage, for 1792, was 206,384 tons. The <hi>actual</hi> American tonnage, for 1792, was, according to the official ſtatement, 66,582 tons: which, turned into entry tonnage, according to the proportion of the whole actual, to the whole entry tonnage for that year, makes the American entry tonnage, in the trade to Great Britain, about 95,000 tons. Adding this to the Britiſh entry tonnage of 206,384 tons, the Britiſh and American together, for 1792, amounts to 301,384 tons; which exceeds the tonnage of 1790 no leſs than 27,804 tons.</p>
            <p>According to this calculation, which embraces the actual tonnage as ſtated to the houſe, there would be 27,804 tons more, employed in tranſporting 1,093,921 dollars leſs: making our tonnage to increaſe in that proportion as the employment of it decreaſed.</p>
            <p>There was a poſſibility, Mr. Madiſon obſerved, that the courſe of trade in the two years might be ſuch, that more of the veſſels employed in the exportations to Great Britain might be entered in 1790 as coming from ſome other country, than in 1792; but as there was no known circumſtance which authorized this ſolution, and as it ſeemed demonſtrable in general, that error exiſted ſomewhere in the ſtatements, and moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in thoſe of the actual tonnage, he concluded, that it ought to be referred to that ſource; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the guide followed by the Secretary of State, to wit. the entry tonnage, the only one he had to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, was not more inaccurate, than the actual tonnage would have been, which guided the member from South-Carolina.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:027258_0034_0FD3F2E510259738"/>Another poſition of the ſecretary of ſtate on which a charge is founded is, "that the <hi>greater</hi> part of what Great-Britain receives from the United States is re-exported." This poſition, Mr. Madiſon reminded the committee, related to Great-Britain, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Weſt-India iſlands; which formed a diſtinct branch in the ſecretary's report. How far it was liable to the exceptions taken againſt it, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from an examination of facts.</p>
            <p>To obviate criticiſms, Mr. Madiſon ſaid he would take for the baſis of his calculations, the ſtatement giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in detail by the gentleman himſelf, of the exports for 1790 to the French and Britiſh dominions; which though not extended to every item, approached ſo near to a full view of the trade, as to be adequate to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſtatement the exports to Great-Britain ſtand at 6,651,429 dollars: from which muſt be ſubtracted, for the compariſon, the amount of the ſeveral re-ex-portations as far as they can be liquidated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tobacco.</hi> It appears from an official document, that the tobacco exported to Great-Britain in 1791, was 67,286 hogſheads. A return for another year ſtates the quantity to be 52,505 hogſheads. It appeared from the revenue returns of Great-Britain, that the conſumption of this article amounted to 9,600 hogſheads. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion re-exported might then be reaſonably ſet down at four-fifths of the quantity imported.</p>

               <hi>Rice.</hi> To obtain the proportion of rice re-exported, we may take the medium quantity imported for three years immediately preceeding the revolution, which, according to a table in Anderſon's Hiſtory of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, was 486,543 cwt. By another table for the ſame period, the medium quantity exported was 349, 653 cwt. The difference marks the conſumption, and is 136,890 cwt. The quantity exported to Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the United States in 1792, was 58,978 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, equal to 294,890 cwt. Comparing the quantity conſumed with this quantity, it appears that more than half, though leſs than two-thirds, is re-exported—call

Here, then, it appears, that their exportations of the four articles alone, of Tobacco, Rice, Indigo, &amp; Wheat, are greater than the whole conſumption in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, of the articles imported from the United States, although the moſt uafavorable year has been taken, for the enquiry; and, conſequently, that the poſition of the Secretary of State, was well founded.</p>
            <p>If it were neceſſary to inveſtigate the full amount of re-exportations, ſeveral articles might have been added to the liſt, ſuch as Whale Oil, Ginſeng, Flax-Seed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nor would it be unfair, perhaps, to include the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive value of the articles, re-exported in the new forms givtn to them by art, A great proportion of what is ſent from the United States to Great-Britain, in a rude ſtate, is worked into articles of merchanize, and exported in the courſe of trade. Take for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the two articles of Pot and Pearl Aſhes, and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</p>
            <p>The amount of the export of the former to Great-Britain, is ſtated at 747,078 dollars; of which, if no part is re-exported in its unaltered ſtate, the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into Britiſh manufactures. Suppoſing one-third of theſe particular manufactures, to be exported, which appears to be nearly the general proportion, the value of Pot and Pearl Aſhes re-exported, is 249,026 dollars. The Indigo uſed in Great-Britain has appeared to be 379,064 dollars, one-third of which re exported as an ingredient in manufactures, is 126,354 2-3 dollars— Tneſe two items alone amount to 375,280 2-3 dollars; and with many others, might be added to the maſs of re-exportatios. But they are ſtated rather to throw light on the general character of our trade with Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, than to be relied on in the preſent caſe, which has been ſufficiently elucidated by moredirect and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple views of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Madiſon proceeded to apply the calculations he had made, to the queſtion diſcuſſed by Mr. Smith, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the comparative importance of the French and Britiſh markets to the productions of the U.S.</p>
            <p>By deducting the 3,501,067 dollars, re-exported, from the 6,651,429 dollars, imported into Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027258_0037_0FD3F2EB9F50EFF0"/>
he reduced her actual conſumption to 3,150,360 dollars, to which adding the 1,805,744 exported to the Weſt-India market, the whole Britiſh conſumption ſtands at no more than 4,956,106 dollars. On campar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this with the exports to the French dominions (which re-export none of any conſequence) to wit, 4,424,336, the ſubject took a very different aſpect from that which had been given to it.</p>
            <p>But there was, Mr. Madiſon obſerved, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the utmoſt importance to a fair view of this queſtion, which had been wholly overlooked by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman from S. Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lina, and which cut up his calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the roots. The re-exportations from Great-Britain were not only to be ſubtracted from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Great-Britain but in a great degree being made to France, were <hi>to be added to the value of her market</hi> to the agriculture and commerce of the United States.</p>
            <p>The re-exportation from Great-Britain to France, could not be accurately fixed by any documents to be had here. In general, they were known to be great. He would, he ſaid, confine himſelf to the two articles of Tobacco and Flour, of which he eſtimated the amounts as follow:</p>
            <p>The Tobacco exported from the United States, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be about 100,000 hogſheads. It is valued in the return of our exports at 4,349,567 dollars. It is known that France conſumes about 1-4 of the whole quantity exported, that is, 1,087,392 dollars. It appears, by the return of our exports, that the <hi>direct</hi> exports of this article to France, ſtands at 384,642 dollars. The <hi>indiract</hi> ſupplies then to France, not appearing in the returns of our exports, and to be added to them, is 702,750 dollars.</p>
            <p>Of the Flour and Grain ſent to Great Britain, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as above ſtated, 1-4 to have been there conſumed, which is probably beyond the truth, the re-exportation amounted to 815,880 dollars. It is well underſtood, that France was the market where theſe articles were finally conſumed. The account may now be ſtated.

            <p>Thus it appears, without taking into the account the other articles re-exported to France, that the market of that country for our exports, was worth to the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States nearly a million more than the market of Great-Britain—and yet the gentleman from South-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olina had repreſented the Britiſh markets as exceeding the French in the annual amount of between three and four millions; and had pronounced, without heſitation, that Great-Britain in reference to our productions, was <hi>a more important cuſtomer</hi> than France, almoſt in the <hi>ratio of two to one.</hi>

            <p>Mr. Madiſon returning to the Secretary's report ſaid, he hoped after what had been ſhewn, it would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to trouble the committee with further remarks on the ſubject. In diſmiſſing it however, he could not do juſtice to his own impreſſions, without declaring his entire confidence, that the report would be regarded by all diſcerning and unprejudiced judges, as one of the many monuments which its Author had left behind him, of the zeal, the talents, and the pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>otiſm with which he had diſcharged the duties of his ſtation; and that he had carried with him into retirement, a purity, both in his public and private name, which nothing that could be ſaid within or without the walis of Congreſs, could tarniſh.</p>
            <p>Having gone through the particular obſervations into which he had been led by the attack made on the report of the Secretary of State before the committee, he ſhould proceed, to a more general view of what had been urged by the opponents of the reſolutions he had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:027258_0039_0FD3F2EC01239488"/>
Among other things it had been alledged in the latter ſtages of the debate, that the friends of the reſolutions, had involved themſelves in inconſiſtency, by ſhifting the ground of argument from commercial to political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. In anſwer to this charge, he remarked, that if in any inſtance of his public life he was free from the charge of inconſiſtency, it was on the ſubject of vindicating our national intereſt, againſt the policy of Great-Britain towards us; that in all the public ſtations with which he had been honored ſince thp peace and on every occaſion which had occurred, his conduct had been marked by an adherence to this principle: that the reſolutions he had laſt propoſed were founded on this principle: that if in the firſt arguments ſupporting them, he had dwelt chiefly on commercial topics, it would be recollected that he kept the door open for political ones, if the turn of the diſcuſſion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them: that he had forborne to enlarge on the political ſides of the queſtion, becauſe he thought it defenſible on commercial grounds, and was willing to meet it on thoſe grounds, becauſe he did not wiſh to mingle, unneceſſarily, irritating ideas in the diſcuſſion, and becauſe he had ſuppoſed that every thing relating to the treaty of peace the Indians, the Algerines, the ſpolistions, &amp;c. were ſufficiently imprinted on every mind, and would have all the effects they ought to have, without being particularly enforced.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he could thus repel the charge of inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy brought againſt himſelf; it muſt be evident, he thought, how much room there was for retor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing the charge. In the early ſtages of the diſcuſſion, there ſeemed but one ſentiment as to the conduct of Great-Britain, at leaſt in a political view: the difference turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the queſtion, whether we could or ought to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract her conduct, In the latter ſtages of the diſcuſſion, palliations if not juſtifications had been multiplied and labored; not only with reſpect to her commercial policy, but with reſpect to the detention of the poſts, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gerines, and even the ſpoliations of our neutral commerce; on the unlawfulneſs of which our
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027258_0040_0FD3F2F01E6B75D8"/>
executive had grounded the remonſtrance and demand of indemnification lying on the table.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, he ſtated the inconſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe who maintained and thoſe who rejected the theory of leaving commerce perfectly free; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of rejecting this theory, and yet refuſing to meet reſtrictions one ſide with reſtrictions on the other; the inconſiſtency of condemning a commercial diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination between nations, as contrary to the wiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Great-Britain, and, claiming for Great-Britain the credit of making ſuch diſcriminations in favor of the United States: The inconſiſtency of predicting, that the meaſure would deſtroy the revenue, and inſiſting, that the dutied articles would continue to be imported from the ſame ſource, through more expenſive channels: The inconſiſtency of exclaiming againſt topics and remarks which may awaken the paſſions, and endeavouring themſelves to alarm our fears; of exhorting the committee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult its judgment alone, and ſubſtituting for argument continued addreſſes to the imagination.</p>
            <p>Particular pains, he remarked, had been taken to exhibit a picture of our national proſperity, which might flatter our wiſhes, and forbid experiments. It was readily admitted, he ſaid, that there were many features in the face of our affairs, which were proper themes of mutual congratulation, whether compared with the ſituation of other countries, or with our own, under other circumſtances. And it gave him much pleaſure to add, that the degree of proſperity we enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not to be excluſively credited to the change of our federal government, or to particular meaſures under it, according to the exaggerations of ſome, was yet ſo far, and ſo evidently the fruit of that change, as to do honor to the people of America in adopting it. He mentioned two innovations making part of the conſtitution, which muſt alone have had a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effect in meliorating the condition of this country, to wit: The prohibition of paper money or other violations of contracts, and the abolition of inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and rival regulations of trade, among the ſeveral
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027258_0041_0FD3F2EE2AF1AED0"/>
ſtates. But notwithſtanding the flouriſhing ſtate of our affairs, when viewed under certain aſpects, it was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain that there were others, which ſuggeſted very different reflexions.</p>
            <p>He then went into a review of the actual ſtate of our commerce, particularly in ralation to Great-Britain; and of the ſeveral injuries of another ſort, which that nation had ſuperadded to her commercial reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>He repeated what he had formerly maintained, that there was more of reciprocity in the footing of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between Great-Britain and other countries, and between other countries and the United States, than between Great-Britain and the United States. To prove the firſt point he remarked, that in ſome inſtances Great-Britain had treaties with other countries which defined and ſtipulated reciprocal privileges; in other inſtances, her reſtrictions were counter-vailed by laws impoſing reſtrictions on her. To prove the ſecond point, he remarked, that no other nation with which the United States carried on commerce, had a navigation act ſimilar to that of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the intercourſe between the United States and Great-Britain, there was, he inſiſted, a want of reciprocity throughout, that muſt ſtrike the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial obſerver.</p>
            <p>In the article of navigation this had been ſufficiently pointed out, and being admitted on all ſides, need not be repeated.</p>
            <p>In the trade between the two countries, our beſt ſtaples, wheat and flour, fiſh and oil, ſalted proviſions, which amount to conſiderably more than one-third of our exports, were ſhut out of her markets; whilſt all her beſt ſtaples, her woolens, her cottons, her manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of the metals, of leather, and of ſilk, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on moderate duties, and enjoyed in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a monopoly of our market.</p>
            <p>In the articles of ſuperfluity mutually admitted, there was nothing to compenſate the inequality in other caſes. Our tobacco paid a tax of four or five hundred per cent. our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fifty or ſixty per cent and our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

of every ſort would not be admitted if we were ever ſo able to ſend them. On the other hand, her ſuperfluities were received under duties, which in general did not exceed from ſeven and an half to fifteen per cent.</p>
            <p>In the Weſt-India trade, beſides the excluſion of our veſſels, whilſt her own were left free, there were a number of our productions which were not admitted into the market there, whilſt our laws refuſed nothing that was brought to the market here.</p>
            <p>He next turned, his attention to the injuries and loſſes we ſuffered in other reſpects.</p>
            <p>As he had not poſſeſſed himſelf of the evidence, he ſhould, he ſaid, leave it to thoſe who had, to ſhew how far the Indians were or were not ſpurred on to war againſt us, by the agents or partiſans of Great-Britain. It was a ſufficient ground of complaint, that the poſts were wrongfully detained; that the detention had a bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence on the ſentiments and conduct of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; and that the ſupplies for their warfare, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a trade, authoriſed by the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and protected by the poſts which of right were ours, and ought to be uſed for our defence. He combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this proceeding of Great-Britain, with the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſeizure of our veſſels under her inſtructions of the 8th of June laſt, obſerving, that whilſt on one ſide, ſhe violated the laws of nations, by carrying on a trade in contraband articles with thoſe at war with us; ſhe was on another ſide, violating the laws of nations, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting our trade with thoſe at war with her, in articles not contraband.</p>
            <p>The Indian war he obſerved, coſt us annually a ſum, exceeding by one million, the ſum that would probably be ſufficient for the defence of our frontiers, if the poſts were in our hands. The fur trade depending on the poſts might, he thought, be fairly valued at two hundred thouſand dollars more.</p>
            <p>The Algerine depredations appeared to have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lim. The evil therefore may at
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027258_0043_0FD3F2F2F89F29B8"/>
leaſt be charged to an unfriendly diſregard of our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, if not to a poſitive hoſtility to them. The pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary amount of this evil, cannot be rated at leſs than the expence of the armament propoſed as a remedy.— This is ſtated at ſix hundred thouſand dollars for the outſit; and he did not expect that the annual expence would average much leſs; to which may be added, at a very low computation, for inſurance remaining after the armament, two hundred thouſand dollars.</p>
            <p>The ſpoliations committed on our neutral commerce by Great-Britain, muſt be of conſiderable, though very uncertain amount; and the conſequential detriment to our trade in general from theſe interruptions and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, of a very great, though equally uncertain amount. In order to bring both within a ſafe eſtimate, he ſaid he would ſtate the former at the limitted ſum of one hundred and fifty thouſand dollars, and the latter at no more than four hundred thouſand dollars.</p>
            <p>In addition to the foregoing eſtimates he ſaid there was another item, which though of a different character, fell under a comprehenſive view of our ſituation; and being reducible to an amount tolerably definite, ought to find a place here. He referred to the ſtatement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted from a reoprt of the Secretary of State, which ſhewed that the loſs to the United States from a dependance on Britiſh bottoms for the carriage of their produce was no leſs annually, in time of war, than three million two hundred and fifty thouſand dollars, and in war and peace everaged, no leſs than one million three hundred ninety-two thouſand eight hundred fifty-ſeven dollars. Allowing about one third of this carriage for the reaſonable ſhare of Great-Britain (and for reaſons formerly derived from the character of our exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orts this was a full ſhare) the annnal loſs from the dependance might be called about one million of dollars.</p>

            <p>From this view of things, it was impoſſible to deny, that however proſperous the United States might be in ſome reſpects, they were in others laboring under vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of their rights and intereſts, which demanded the ſerious attention of the legiſlature. Beſides the unreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal footing of their commerce, and the indignities offered them, it was ſeen that they were burdened with an enormous extra expence, and involved in unjuſt loſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, amounting to more than three and an half millions of dollars a year; a tax nearly equal to the heavy one they had been obliged to impoſe on themſelves.</p>
            <p>Having taken this view of our ſituation, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider how far a remedy was compriſed in the reſolutions before the committee, by tracing the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble operation of them, it paſſed into a law. [In this ſtage of his obſervations, the hour of adjournment being nearly arrived, he ſat down, with an intimation that the ſubject would be renewed.]</p>
            <p>Reſuming the train of his obſervations, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to explain the remedial operations of his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Firſt. —They will make the Britiſh nation ſenſible, that we can, by juſt and pacific means, inflict conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which will make it her intereſt, to pay a juſt regard to our rights and intereſts.</p>
            <p>To enforce this tendency, he enlarged on the ideas he had formerly expreſſed in relation to the dependance of Great-Britain on the commerce of the United States and the obvious and eſſential dependance of the Britiſh-Weſt-Indies, on the ſupplies of the United States.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:027258_0045_0FD3F2F54922DE00"/>
On the latter ſubject, he entered into a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the member from Maſſachuſetts (Mr. Ames) who had argued, that the Britiſh regulation of the trade between the United States and the Weſt-Indies, was conformable to the pinciples of the Colony ſyſtem as eſtabliſhed by the commercial nations of Europe, and could not therefore be reaſonably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of. 2. That the Weſt-Indies could obtain ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from other quarters, and did not therefore depend on the United States; nay, that there was danger, by forcing theſe ſupplies into other channels, of our loſing that branch of trade altogether. 3. That the trade would hardly employ more than a dozen brigs, and was therefore not worth contending for.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the firſt argument of Mr. Ames, Mr. Madiſon undertook to ſhew, that Great-Britain had not purſued, but violated the principles of the colony ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. The true ſpirit of this ſyſtem, he ſaid, was to confine the trade between the parent country and the colony, to their own veſſels, and to allow as little trade as poſſible, between the colony and foreign countries; out when a trade with a foreign country became neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the colony, <hi>to allow the foreign veſſels the ſame carrying privileges allowed to their own.</hi> Colonies, he ſaid, were to be conſidered as parts of a common empire. The trade between one part and another, as between London and Kingſton in Jamaica, was to be conſidered equally an internal trade with the coaſting trade between London and Liverpool, or the trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween different ports of the United States: and might, if deemed expedient, be equally reſtrained to domeſtic bottoms. But when a trade was opened between a colony and a foreign country, the caſe was changed: the foreign country became a party, and had a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal claim to the uſe of its bottoms, as much in the trade with the colony, as with any other part of the empire to which the colony belonged. In ſupport of this doctrine. Mr. Madiſon referred to the example of every nation in Europe, except that of Great-Britain, which had American colonies. Denmark, Sweden, the United Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal, had
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027258_0046_0FD3F2F6BAF1E3B8"/>
their colonies, as well as Great-Britain; and ſome of them rigorouſly attached to the principles of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony ſyſtem: yet not a ſingle one of theſe nations had refuſed, whenever, a trade was permitted at all between the colonies and another country, to make the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage common to the veſſels of both the parties. Great-Britain alone had attempted a monopoly in ſuch caſes for her own veſſels. Her example therefore was an innovation on the colony ſyſtem, as well as an infraction of the rights of reciprocity.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the 2d poſition of Mr. Ames, he denied that permanent ſupplies of proviſions and lumber could be derived from any other part of the world than the United States: not from the northern parts of Europe, which either did not produce, or were too remote to ſend them: not from the ſouthern parts of Europe, which depended themſelves on the northern parts and on America: not from Great-Britain, which imported bread, for her own uſe, amounting one year with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the report of the committee of the privy council, to the ſum of near three hundred thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and pounds ſterling, and was certainly not an exporter of lumber: not from Ireland, which could not pretend to rival the United States in any article but that of ſalt proviſions; and this was ſo much dearer that a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition alone of ours, could gain a market for hers. The gentleman had relied on the capacity of Ireland to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her cultivation of wheat, ſo as to ſpare ſupplies of this article alſo. Such a revolution in her interior ſtate was not very probable. But he ought at leaſt to have remembered, that as the paſture lands of Ireland ſhould be turned into wheat fields, her export of beef would decreaſe, in proportion as the might be enabled to export bread.</p>
            <p>It was a waſte of time, Mr. Madiſon ſaid, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by minute enquiries, the poſſibility of ſupplying the Britiſh Weſt-Indies from the old continent, on terms that would not be worſe than abandoning them altogether. The truth was, that the gentleman (Mr. Ames) had, in this particular, gone beyond the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uguine advocates of the Britiſh policy, Mr. Knox and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027258_0047_0FD3F2F8562B56B8"/>
Lord Sheffield themſelves, who limited their ultimate hopes of ſupporting the Weſt-Indies without the aid of the United States, to the remaining poſſeſſions of Great-Britain on this continent. He would proceed, he ſaid, to ſhew what foundation there was for the opinion of theſe gentlemen, and the gentleman from Maſſachusetts, in favor of this reſource.—And he was able to give the moſt full and deciſive evidence in the caſe, by recurring to an authentic document of our own, from which it appeared, that the continental col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies of Great-Britain, inſtead of being able to furniſh the Weſt-India colonies, were themſelves dependant for the very articles wanted there, on the ſupplies of the United States.</p>
            <p>In the official ſtatement of our exports for the year as late as 1791, moſt of the articles ſent to the Britiſh continental colonies were of a ſort and an amount ſo directly to the point, that he hoped the committee would excuſe him for repeating them in detail. He ſtated them as follows:

            <p>Mr. Madiſon ſaid, that he ſhould not have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much of the time of the committee on this head, if the gentleman (Mr. Ames) had not attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive

the arguments with reſpect to Canada and Nova-Scotia, which had miſled Great-Britain in her politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal calculations and her preſent views.

               </gap>hors of the opinion, Knox and Sheffield themſelves, to abandon it, could not be heard without ſome ſurprize; and muſt be conſidered at leaſt as the fulleſt proof, that the gentleman had not given ſufficient attention to the preſent ſubject, to claim that weight which was in general due to his obſervations.</p>
            <p>Mr. Madiſon ſaid he was not leſs ſurpriſed at the 2d poſition of the gentleman from Maſſachuſetts, viz. that the Weſt-India trade could be carried on by a doz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en brigs; and conſequently, was not an object worth our purſuit. The plain anſwer to this argument was, to ſtate the fact, that the ſhipping entered in one year from, the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, was not a dozen brigs, but 107,759 tons.</p>
            <p>Beſides the immediate importance of this auxilliary reſource for our navigation, he remarked, that there were two conſideration which enhanced the value of the object: one, that as the Weſt-India articles could be brought cheaper in American veſſels they would come cheaper to American conſumers; the other, that as our ſupplies would at the ſame time be carried cheaper to the Weſt-Indies, the people there could afford to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the more of them.</p>
            <p>It had been urged, that the propoſed reſtrictions on the trade with Great-Britain would produce clamors
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:027258_0050_0FD3F2FD4577A880"/>
here as well as there, and that Congreſs might be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed recede, before the Britiſh Government would be under the neceſſity of doing ſo. To this Mr. Madiſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he was under no such apprehenſion. He thought more favorably of the good ſenſe as well as virtue of his follow citizens. On the ſide of Great-Britain it had been ſhewn there would be the greateſt diſtreſs, and the leaſt ability to bear it. The people there were not accuſtomed, like the people of the United States, to ſelf denying regulations. They would not have the ſame confidence in the juſtice of their cauſe. And it was particularly worthy of remark, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> people of Great-Britain would be diſheartened, and the government alarmed, by reflecting, that their loſſes from the ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of commerce into other channels, and not only of their manufactures, but manufacturers, to other places, would be permanent and irretrievable; where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s on our ſide, they would be temporary ſacrifices for durable and valuable acquiſitions.</p>
            <p>Secondly—The reſolutions would have the effe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It had been remarked by a member from Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts (Mr. Ames) that if as ſtated by a report of Mr. Jefferſon, Great-Britain was ſo often at war, her wars, by depriving us of her ſhipping, would ſoon have the wiſhed effect, of replacing it with American ſhipping. This reaſoning Mr. Madiſon ſaid, ſuppoſed what was contrary to prudence and probability. What merchants would build ſhips, which a peace, always more or leſs in proſpect, would throw out of employment; unleſs it were for ſpecial purpoſes, where the momentary gain might outweigh the eventual ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>It had been ſaid that our tonnage was proved by the official returns to be increaſing with an unexampled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity. To this Mr. Madiſon anſwered, That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ought not to be compared with other examples, but with our own natural faculties, and reaſonable
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027258_0051_0FD3F2FE364F7140"/>
expectations—that the increaſe of our population re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an annual increaſe of at leaſt five per cent; that an aſſumption by foreigners of American names, had probably increaſed the apparent quan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that the war, or preparations for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreign ſhipping, had probably alſo had ſome little temporary effect; that the principal cauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, was the extention of our trade with the French dominions, which ſome members ſeemed ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſecure and foſter, by meaſures which appeared to him beſt fitted for the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>He reminded the committee of an argument, which had, on former occaſions, been much preſſed by ſeveral mercantile members, for encouraging our own navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; to wit: that American veſſels, from a ſpirit of enterprize and a uniſon between private and public intereſts, would explore new fields of commerce, and new markets for our produce, which foreign carriers would leave unattempted. The trade to China, opened by American veſſels, had been often aſcribed to this cauſe. Mr. Madiſon ſaid, the argument ſeemed to be countenanced alſo, by the preſent ſtate of our Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean trade; which had ſince our independence, been confined by the Barbary corſairs to foreign bottoms. Previous to the revolution, when American veſſels could be the carries, the trade was very conſiderable. Since the excluſion of our veſſels, though the carriage of our produce is ſafe in Britiſh, and ſeveral other foreign veſſels, yet this branch of trade had withered as much as moſt others have grown. In 1790, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports cleared for the Mediterreanean, were but 21,726 doliars; and in the year following, the imports no more than 11,522 doliars.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Another effect incident to the propoſed meaſure, would be an additional encouragement to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic manufactures.</p>
            <p>A gentleman from Maſſachuſetts (Mr. Dexter) had ſaid, he could read no ſuch tendency in the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Mr. Madiſon thought it impoſſible to read the propoſitions with attention, and not perceive, that they muſt have the like tendency with the other means, by
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027258_0052_0FD3F302208B2570"/>
which manufactures had been promoted. If the duties already laid, were calculated to produce this effect, an increaſe of thoſe duties in any inſtance, muſt have a tendency to increaſe the effect. In anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that a change in the policy of Great-Britain, might put an end to the additional duties, and enſnare thoſe who ſhould proceed under the influence of them, he remarked, 1. That the ſame might be ſaid in ſome degree of the regulations now in force. A treaty with Great-Britain might ſtipulate changes which would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our manufacturers. But as there was a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that the intereſts of this claſs of citizens would in this caſe be attended to by the government; it might be expected, that equal attention would be paid to them, in any other caſe. 2. The progreſs of things in this country, and the probable acceſſion of foreign manufacturers, might be relied on to ſupport whatever undertaking ſhall have once got a footing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. The propoſed reſolutions would favor an advantageous competition and diſtribution of our trade, among the manufacturing nations of Furope. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it may he ſaid to be monopolized by one; ſo great is the diſproportion of its manufactures which come to our market. That this is an evil, has been admitted, and cannot be doubted. It expoſes us to the greateſt and moſt ſudden embarraſſments from the caprice, the paſſions, the miſtaken calculations of intereſt, the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptics, and the wars of a ſingle foreign country. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe embarraſſments are felt at the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it were poſſible to liquidate them into a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary ſtatement, it would be found that, in a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent view of our intereſt, there would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>conomy in making very conſiderable temporary ſacrifices, for the purpoſe of dividing our cuſtom among a number of competitors. It was not true, that Great-Britain alone can ſupply the manufactures we want. France, the United Netherlands, and ſeveral other nations, are capable of ſupplying us with a variety of articles, as well as the nations from which they now come; and, if invited to our markets by prudent encouragements in the firſt inſtance, will ſoon learn to faſhion their manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027258_0053_0FD3F3038D0C87C8"/>
to the wants and taſtes of this country. The policy of favoring particular branches of trade, even at ſome expence, in order to guard againſt the evil of depending on a ſingle one, was exampliſied by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Great-Britain herſelf. Although he viewed her diſcriminations generally, reſpecting us, in the light he had explained; yet, he thought it poſſible, that in the inſtance of naval ſtores and ſhip-timbers, it might be her intention to foſter a rivalſhip in a more diſtant quarter, in order to provide againſt a caſual privation of the ſupplies of a nearer quarter. Theſe articles are as eſſential to the marine of Great-Britain, as her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine is eſſential to her greatneſs. Were ſhe to have no reſource but in the Baltic, a war with the Baltic powers might be fatal to her. It may be wiſe in her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to keep open the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rican reſource, even at the price of a tax on herſelf. In this caſe, ſhe muſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with both the Baltic powers and the United States at the ſame time, before the ſupplies will be cut off.</p>
            <p>A member from Maſſachuſetts (Mr. Dexter) had not, Mr. Madiſon ſaid, been very conſiſtent in his reaſoning on the ſubject. He had contended againſt all attempts to excite a beneficial competition, on the idea that no competition could be beneficial which would not ſpring up of itſelf; and yet he had warned us againſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that Great-Britain, by exciting a competition againſt the United States, in thoſe parts of Europe, which moſt reſemble the infant ſituation of our country, might eſtabliſh new ſources from which ſupplies would afterwards ſpontaneouſly flow to her, without being ever again wanted from the United States. The ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark was applicable to the reaſoning of the other gentlemen who had repreſented the danger of exciting a permanent rivalſhip for the Weſt-India market, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Canada and Nova-Scotia.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. The plan of the reſolutions tended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilliate nations in treaty, or diſpoſed to be in treaty with us, into arrangements ſtill more favorably to our commerce. This argument had peculiar weight in relation to France. It had been ſaid, that Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was our beſt cuſtomer. The fact, he ſaid, was
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027258_0054_0FD3F304F9D16058"/>
that we were her beſt cuſtomer; but that France was our beſt cuſtomer. We conſume more of Britiſh manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures than any other nation in the world conſumes. France conſumes more of our productions, than any other nations conſumes.—He referred to the ſtatement he had before offered for proof of this. Her conſumption was alſo of the moſt, valuable kind; and, under favorable regulations, would be a very growing one. It conſiſted of wheat and flour, ſalt proviſions, and fiſh; articles which were not admitted by Great-Britain; and which, without the market of France, would, glut every other. Of our fiſh ſhe conſumed five eigths of the whole exportation. Her uſe of our live animals was another important conſideration. It amounted, in the liſt of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, to 352, 795 dollars, for the year 1791. In the ſame year, the Britiſh demand amounted to no more than 62, 415 dollars. The ſuperior <hi>proportion</hi> of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation we enjoyed in the French channels of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had already been ſhewn. In examining the policy of cultivating and ſecuring the French market, he ſaid it ought not to be forgotten, that the profits and revenue ariſing from the rum diſtilleries, depended on an article obtained almoſt, if not altogether, from the French dominions alone; and which was the only raw material of any conſequence imported into the United States. It was paid for alſo, as had been much urged on other occaſions by members on the oppoſite ſide, in the worſt fiſh, which could find a vent in no other part of the world. The molaſſes imported into the United States in one year, amounted to upwards of ſeven millions of gallons, more than one half of which went into the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts. He took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice alſo of the article of ſugar, as rendered of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance by our habits and our finances; and of which more than one half was ſupplied by the French Weſt-Indies. Out of 17, 142, 723 lbs. imported, 9, 321, 829 lbs. were received from that ſource. The reſidue came from the Daniſh, Dutch, and Britiſh dominions, in the following proportions, to wit: Daniſh, 2, 833, 016 lbs. Dutch 2, 707, 231 lbs. Britiſh 2, 280, 647 lbs. That ſtatement was taken from the imports of 1790, the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027258_0055_0FD3F306B865AEE0"/>
only year he had been able to examine on this point.</p>
            <p>It had been ſaid, Why grant privileges before a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grant ſhould be ſecured by poſitive ſtipulation? Why throw away, by a legal regulation, what ought to be the price of treaty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>le anſwered, that the legal regulations threw nothing away, as it was always revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: that in the preſent inſtance, it was only meeting the legal regulations of which France had ſet the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: that inſtead of being a bar to treaty, ſuch a courſe of proceeding, more than any other, would ſmooth the way to it, by explaining the objects, and eſtabliſhing a confidence, on both ſides—that it would be happy, if in all caſes, where treaties are in view, this open and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatory proceſs, could take the place of that reſerve and myſterious negociation, with which the parties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach each other. Were Great-Britain deſirous of forming amicable arrangements by treaty, he aſked what readier or more prudent ſtep could ſhe have taken for the purpoſe, than to have followed the example ſet her, by holding out in her laws, the ſpirit in which ſhe was willing to meet us in negociation?</p>
            <p>Having gone through theſe explanations, Mr. Madi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon entered into a view of the principal objections to the reſolutions propoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was ſaid they would diminiſh the revenue, and endanger the funds.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the public debt, his general ideas had been expreſſed by ſeveral who had ſpoken before him. He acknowledged that he had diſliked and oppoſed the modification given to it; but after it had received the ſanction of law, he had entertained no other wiſh on the ſubject, than that the debt might be honorably diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as faſt as the circumſtances of the country would permit. This he was well ſatisfied was the prevailing ſentiment of the great body of the people. He did not believe, that there was a ſingle ſtate in the union, or any conſiderable part of a ſingle ſtate, that did not acquieſce (where they did not approve) in the proviſions which had been made in behalf of the public croditors. At the ſame time, he was equally ſure, that it never was either meant by Congreſs, or underſtood by the public, that
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027258_0056_0FD3F308B6E65DF8"/>
in mortagaging the impoſt for their ſecurity, it was t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be an hoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age to foreign countries for our unqualified acquieſcence in their unequal laws, and to be worne, as long as the debt ſhould continue, as a badge of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal humiliation. The nature of the obligation could certainly import no more in favor of the creditors, than that the fund appropriated ſhould be applied, as far as requiſite, to their uſe; unleſs equivalent funds ſhould be ſubſtituted; nor more againſt the public, than that all deficiencies in the funds ſhould be made up, whether ariſing without, or in conſequence of, a change in the laws. If it ſhould happen, then, that in conſequence of any meaſure, dictated by the general good, the impoſt ſhould become inadequate to its object, all that could be exacted by the public creditors, would be ſome other proviſion that would ſupply the defalcation; and it ought not to be doubted, that the people at large, whoſe good was purſued, would readily ſupport whatever other proviſion might become indiſpenſible. He had made theſe remarks, however, with reference to an event, which he did not by any means admit to be probable. The more he had revolved the ſubject, the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it appeared to him, that a very operative addition might be made to the duties on the enumerate articles, without endangering the aggregate product of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations. And he entirely concurred in opinion with thoſe who had obſerved, that the greateſt injury which could be done to the claſs of citizens holding the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic paper, was to repreſent their interests as more to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> regarded than any national conſiderations whatever; and to oppoſe to the latter, even the moſt imaginary contingences to the former.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was objected, that the operation of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be more favorable, in ſome inſtances, to nations in treaty than was merited; and more unfavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in others, to nations not in treaty, than was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this abjection, he obſerved, that Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Pruſſia, two of the nations in commercial treaty, had but little intercourſe with us; would be in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>As to the nations not in treaty—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Denmark</hi> would not be affected. She had no navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation act, within the deſcription of the reſolutions; and could not feel the duties on manufactures. The whole of the imports from Denmark amounted in the year 1791 to 9,957 dollars only. Her iſlands alſo, with which the trade is carried on in our veſſels, depend for their ſubſiſtence on our market.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruſſia</hi> has little or no ſhipping in our trade, and it would not be effected if ſhe had; as ſhe has no ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation act. Her <hi>unwrought</hi> iron may come as before. Duck and ſheeting are the only two manufactures on which the reſolutions would ſenſibly operate; and with reſpect to theſe, as will preſently be obſerved, it would be eaſy to make ſpecial exceptions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Hanſe Towns,</hi> having no navigation act, would not be affected in that reſpect. Linens are the only articles falling within the propoſed enumeration; and might, if thought requiſite, be eaſily excepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> has little ſhipping in our trade; has no nagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation act, ſuch as is to be reciprocated; and would not be ſenſibly touched by the duties on manufactures. She alſo needs our exports, and will be influenced by that conſideration.</p>
            <p>It had been aſked, why Spain, againſt whom we had complaints as well as againſt Great-Britain, ought not to be equally an object of our regulations? He ſaid that ſuch a queſtion could be beſt anſwered when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications from the Preſident relating to Spain, ſhould be taken up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Portugal,</hi> like Spain, will not be affected in her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> our market. According to Zimmerman, Portugal does not raiſe within herſelf, more bread than will feed her three months in the year. It is certain that ſhe depends much on external reſources, and that occaſions are frequent when ſhe can find them no where elſe than in the United States.</p>
            <p>Mr. Madiſon ſaid, he conſidered theſe explanations as a ſufficient anſwer to the objection. He would add, however, that there were other anſwers, ſome of which had been before hinted, that would afford an option of modes for the exemption of nations not in treaty.</p>
            <p>Beſides the opportunity which ſuch nations have of removing all difficulties, by meeting us in liberal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they may be provided for; either by limiting every part of the meaſure to nations having a navigation act: Or by limiting it to nations within a geographical deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a practice familiar to the Britiſh code: Or by naming the nations to be excepted; a practice alſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to Great-Britain: Or by naming the particular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, to be excepted; a practice no leſs familiar to that nation.</p>
            <p>By ſome or other of theſe modifications the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee could be at no loſs to accommodate the plan, to their own ſenſe of propriety, and the public good.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. Madiſon took occaſion to remark, that much of the argument againſt the reſolutions, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from an inattention to their import, and would be anſwered by a ſimple explanation of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt reſolution, which was immediately the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of debate, decided nothing with reſpect to a diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination between different nations. It declared only, in general, that the ſituation of the United States re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſomething to be done, in the way of commercial reſtrictions and duties. And yet it had been combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many members, as if a vote in favor of it would involve all the enbarraſſing preferences which their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies could ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>The ſucceeding reſolutions on the ſubject of addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duties on manufactures, and of a variation of the ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage duties, were founded on a diſcrimination between nations in treaty, and nations not in treaty; but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027258_0059_0FD3F30D40DE5210"/>
as he had obſerved, of whatever modifications or exceptions, might be judged equitable orpolitic. The propoſed reduction of the tonnage of veſſels in treaty, had been ſuggeſted by the complaint made by France of the exiſting tonnage on her veſſels, as exceeding the burden impoſed by her on ours, as well as an unkind return for the commercial benefits of which the United States were partaking under her laws. At preſent the tonnage impoſed by us, on all foreign veſſels was the ſame. This would not ſeem to be right on any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, unleſs the tonnage impoſed on our veſſels, by all foreign nations, was the ſame, which was not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Whether the change he had propoſed, would be an amendment of the exiſting law, was a point to be examined. It was certainly a part of the plan which he did not regard as the moſt eſſential.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the reſolutions reciprocating navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation laws, it was evident, he ſaid, that theſe had no reference to the queſtion, whether a nation were in a treaty or not. They would operate equally, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there might be the ſame departure from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of reciprocity. If they ſhould bear on one nation particularly, it would be becauſe they ought to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It had been much inſiſted, that trade ought to be free to find its proper channels, under the conduct of merchant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; that the merchantile opinion was the beſt guide, in the caſe now depending; and that that opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion was againſt the Reſolutions.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er to this objection, he ſaid, it was obvious to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that in the very terms of the propoſition, trade ought to be <hi>free,</hi> before it could find its proper channel. It was not free at preſent, it could not, therefore, find the channels in which it would moſt advantageouſly flow. The dykes muſt be broken down before the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters could purſue their natural courſe. Who would pretend, that the trade with the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, or even with Great-Britain herſelf, was carried on under the preſent reſtrictions, as it would go on of itſelf, if unſette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed from reſtrictions on her part, as it is on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. Who would pretend, that the ſupplies to the Weſt-Indies, for example, would not flow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

bottoms, if they flowed freely? Who would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that our wheat, our flour, our fiſh, &amp;c. would not find their way to the Britiſh market, if the cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>els to it were open for them.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed to have been forgotten, that the principle of this objection ſtruck at every regulation in fever of manufactures, as much, or even more, than at regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the ſubject of commerce. It required the every ſpecies of buſineſs ought to be left to the ſagacity and intereſt of thoſe carrying it on; without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference whatever, of the public authority, He was himſelf, in general, a friend to this theory: but there were a variety of exceptions to it, ariſing out of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſituations; as muſt be admitted by all who would mingle practical with theoretic views; and as has been already decided by a number of our laws.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the mercantile opinion, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to pay all due attention to it. The mercantile claſs of citizens was certainly an enlightened and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable one. Their information ought always to be received with reſpect, and their intereſt protected with care. But it did not follow that their opinion, even on queſtions of trade, ought to be conſulted as an oracle, by thoſe who were equally bound to watch over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of every claſs or citizens, and over the joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the whole. There were conſiderations of different kinds which ſuggeſted caution on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>However intelligent and conſtant the merchant might be, in directing his operations, for commercial purpoſes, he might not be equally in the habit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining with theſe, the various other national objects which the Legiſlature might be bound to conſult.</p>
            <p>The intereſt of the mercantile claſs may happen to differ from that of another claſs; and poſſibly both may differ from that of the whole community. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it is, generally ſpeaking, the intereſt of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to import and export every thing: the intereſts of manufacturers to leſſen imports in order to raiſe the price of domeſtic fabrics, and to check exports, where they might enhance the price of raw materials. In this caſe it would be as imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oper to allow the one to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027258_0061_0FD3F3104F6C7C80"/>
judge for the other, as to allow either to judge for the whole.</p>
            <p>It may be the intereſt of the merchant, under particular circumſtances, to conſine the trade to its eſtabliſhed chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; when the national intereſt would require thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels to be changed or enlarged. The beſt writers on political oeconomy have obſerved, that the regulations moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfriendly to the national wealth of Great Britain, have owed their birth to mercantile counſels. It is well known, that in France, the greateſt oppoſition to that liberal policy which was as favorable to the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of that country as of this, proceeded from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which merchants had, in keeping the trade in its former courſe.</p>
            <p>If, in any country, the mercantile opinion ought not to be im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>citly followed, there were the ſtrongeſt reaſons why it ought not, in this. The body of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who carry on the American commerce, is well known to be compoſed of ſo great a proportion of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals who are either Britiſh ſubjects, or trading on Britiſh capital, or enjoying the profits of Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments, that the mercantile opinion here, might not be an American opinion; nay, it might be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the very country of which, in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance at leaſt, we ought not to take counſel. What the genuine American mercantile opinion would be, if it could be collected apart from the general one, Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon ſaid he did not undertake poſitively to decide. His belief was, that it would be in favor of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>It could ſcarcely be neceſſary, he ſaid, to add, that his remarks were not meant to be, as they were not in fact, the leaſt reflection on any part of the mercantile order among us. They only ſuppoſe, what in political rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings ought always to be ſuppoſed, that the prejudices of birth and perſonal intereſts will be a bias on the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It had been an objection to the reſolutions, that they might deprive us of the aid of Britiſh capital and credit, which were neceſſary to the proſecution of our commerce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:027258_0062_0FD3F311C4F69970"/>Mr. Madiſon did not admit, either that the effect would happen, or that it would be runious to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>Unleſs Great-Britain ſhould, of her own choice, put a ſtop to the commercial intercourſe with us, which, for reaſons before given, would be ſo much more hurtful to herſelſ than to this country, that it never could be preſumed; the reſolutions would operate only by abridging ſome of our importations, and by varying the channels of others. Her capital, as far as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite here, might continue to be employed here.</p>
            <p>On the general queſtion concerning our dependance on Britiſh capital and credit, he obſerved, that it could not be denied that more uſe was made of them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, than was either neceſſary or beneficial. Credit, when extended to conſumers, as was the caſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſouthern ſtates, was extremely injurious; as had been well explained by a member of Virgima (Mr. Nichols) and as he himſelf had equally witneſſed, When confined to merchants, it might, within certain limits, be an advantage; but it was not only his own opinion, but that of better judges, that the credit given to our merchants, was, at preſent, exceſſive and injurious.</p>
            <p>In order to form a very, preciſe judgment on this ſubject, it would be neceſſary, he ſaid, to calculate the amount of our own capital, and its proportion to the amount of our trade. This was a thing, he ſuppoſed, which could not well be done. If he had concurred in the doctrine, of which ſo much had been heard, both within and without doors, that a ſunded debt and banks of diſcount, were equivalent to active capital, he ſhould have a ready anſwer to the difficulty.

            <p>It is true, a part of both the public and the bank ſtocks, is in foreign hands; but with the moſt ample de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions on that account, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

light in which it had been painted; it would be more to his purpoſe, to obſerve, that there was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this country a real mercantile capital to a very reſpectable amount—that this was faſt increaſing with our increaſing population and wealth—that if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign capital of one country ſhould be withdrawn, the vacancy would probably, by degrees, be occupied by that of other foreign nations; that if it ſhould happen otherwiſe, there was reaſon to believe, that a reſtriction of our uſe of foreign credit, would be rather ſalutary than diſadvantageous; that in fine, as long as we had twenty millions of dollars worth of produce, wanted by other nations, and were willing take for it, twenty millions worth of what they wiſhed to part with, he was under no apprehenſion that the means of effectuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an exchange, would not be found. Both mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and capital would quickly be generated by ſuch a ſtate of things, if they did not previouſly exiſt.</p>

It had been obſerved by ſeveral members, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the alledged proportion of Britiſh manufactures conſumed by us to the entire maſs of her manufactures, that Great-Britain would never part with her naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion act, in order to avoid a loſs of four per cent, in the demand for her manufactures.</p>
            <p>To this objection he anſwered, that the compariſon ought to be of our conſumption, not with the entire maſs of her manufactures, but with the part entering into her foreign trade; and then the loſs would not be four per cent, but, at leaſt twenty per cent; that this would not be the only loſs ſhe would ſuſtain, if ſhe ſhould be unwiſe enough to ſtop the intercourſe between the United States and her dominions; that it had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn, that when, ſhe apprehended a reſtrictive ſyſtem on our part, ſhe was willing to prevent it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing her reſtrictive ſyſtem; that in times of war, when an adherence to that ſyſtem would diſtreſs her, ſhe frequently ſuſpends her navigation act; that at this moment it is ſuſpended in relation to the Weſt-Indies; that there could be little doubt if the temporary neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity were likely to be made permanent by firm and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious meaſures on our part, that the remedy, for it would be made permanent alſo.</p>

            <p>The principal reaſon given for this was, that the negociation between the ſecretary of ſtate and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh miniſter here, was ſtill depending. To ſhew that this reaſon was unſound, Mr. Madiſon went into an hiſtorical view of what had paſſed in reference to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial arrangements. Heread the meſſage of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, on the 14th of February, 1791, acquainting them, that ſteps had been taken to aſcertain the diſpoſitions of the Britiſh court on the ſubject, and that there was no ground for favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expectations. He ſtated that in conſequence of this communication, a committee was appointed, who reported that foreign veſſels ought not to be allowed to bring into the United States any articles not of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or manufacture of the country to which they belong, and that an additional duty of twelve and an half<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>red to the paſſages which related to this point, He read from the firſt letter of Mr. Jefferſon to Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 29, 1791, a paragraph requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Hammond "To ſay, whether he was authoriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conclude, or to negociate arrangements with us, which may fix the commerce between the two countries on principles of reciprocal advantage?" To this requeſt, Mr.Hammond, on the 30th of Nov. 1791, anſwered, "That the king was ſincerely diſpoſed to promote and facilitate the commercial intercourſe between the two countries, and that he was authoriſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to this government, his majeſty's readineſs to enter into a negociation for eſtabliſhing that intercourſe upon principles of reciprocal benefit. On Dec. 6, he wrote to Mr. Jefferſon in order to prevent miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that although he was not yet empowered to CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLUDE any definitive arrangement with reſpect to the commercial intercourſe, he ſtill meant it to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that he was fully authoriſed, to ENTER into a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goication for that purpoſe, &amp;c. The reply of Mr. Jefferſon on the 13th of Dec. informed Mr. Hammond, that he had laid letters before the Preſident, and was ready to receive a communication of his full powers, for entering into the negociaion, &amp;c. This was followed on the next day by a letter from Mr. Hammond, ſtating, That he had no ſpecial commiſſion, to CONCLUDE any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive</hi> arrangement upon the ſubject of commercial intercourſe—but that he conceived himſelf fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to enter into negociation, and the diſcuſſion of principles that might be the baſis of ſuch definitive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement —and that this opinion of his competency was founded on the inſtructions which were to regulate his perſonal conduct, and the general <hi>plenipotentiary</hi> character in which he had been ſent and received.</p>
            <p>This letter, Mr. Madiſon obſerved, cloſed the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence on the ſubject of commercial arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being juſtly conſidered by the executive as a final proof, that the powers of Mr. Hammond were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent, and irrelative to the object; and that it would be improper to open a formal negociation with him, under them. His inſtructions might be a rule and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027258_0066_0FD3F317F8D47640"/>
a warrant to himſelf, but not being even exhibited, could be no evidence of his authority, to the executive. And his plenipotentiary commiſſion in the ordinary form, could never be underſtood as relating to the ſpecial objects he propoſed to diſcuſs. According to the uſage of nations, a ſpecial commiſſion is, in ſuch caſes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways furniſhed and required. Mr. Madiſon was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that no ſovereign in Europe would liſten for a moment to ſuch a claim as that of Mr. Hammond, and that the Britiſh court would have been offended at ſuch an one from an American miniſter. He thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the executive had equally conſulted dignity and prudence, in ſilently dropping the ſubject in the manner they did, until Mr. Hammond ſhould receive and produce adequate powers in the accuſtomed form; as might reaſonably be expected, if his court was duly diſpoſed to meet the United States, in an amicable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of commerce by treaty.</p>
            <p>That the conſtruction put by Mr. Hammond on his powers, was inadmiſſible, appeared to Mr. Madiſon to reſult from the conſtruction itſelf. Either the general Plenipotentiary commiſſion was to be taken in the technical and limited ſenſe in which it is applied to the ordinary diplomatic objects of a ſtationary public min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter; or in a literal ſenſe, without regard to ſuch limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In the former ſenſe, it clearly does not extend to negociations for a treaty. In the latter ſenſe it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the <hi>concluſion</hi> of a treaty, and not merely to <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation,</hi> as Mr. Hammond explains and limits it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Madiſon adverted next to the ſtate of the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence relating to the treaty of peace. It appeared, he obſerved, that as long ago as the 29th of May, 1792, the Secretary of State had addreſſed to Mr. Hammond, a full explanation of our rights and demands, under that treaty—that on the 2d of June, Mr. Hammond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Secretary, that he ſhould tranſmit it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay for the conſideration of his court; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did forward it in the courſe of a few days; that on the 13th Nov. 1793, previous to the preſent meeting of Congreſs, Mr. Hammond was deſired by the Secretary, in purſuance of a charge from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027258_0067_0FD3F3193682DD50"/>
to let him know whether an anſwer could yet be given to the letter of May 29, 1792. Mr. Hammond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that it could not, but that he was confident t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay was to be aſcribed to the continuance of the cauſe alluded to in a former anſwer to a ſimilar requeſt.</p>
            <p>The cauſe alluded to, was the intereſting poſture of things in Europe, which it was ſaid, had diverted the attention of the Britiſh government to objects of a more preſſing nature; and this conſideration had been urged by ſeveral members, as an apology for the ſilence obſerved towards the United States. Mr. Madiſon thought very differently. The interval between the receipt of the letter written by the Secretary in May, 1792, and the acceſſion of Great-Britain to the war againſt France, had been ſufficient for the purpoſe of preparing and ſending the proper inſtructions to Mr. Hammond. Mr. Madiſon added, that the proſpect of being engaged in new controverſies of a more ſerious kind, inſtead of juſtifying an inattention to an exiſting one, ought to have quickened the efforts for a previous ſettlement of the latter. This is the courſe dictated by prudence, to nations as well as to individuals; and where a right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition concurs, it is the natural courſe.</p>
            <p>It had been mentioned as a further reaſon againſt the commercial propoſitions, at this time, that they might draw upon us the reſentments of the Combined powers. Mr. Madiſon could ſee no ground for ſuch an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. The Combined powers were pretty fully oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with France; they could have no pretext for concerning themſelves with us, in a caſe where we did not concern ourſelves with them; and there was the leſs room for imagining that the combination could miſconſtrue the meaſure into an offence againſt them, as two of the parties, Pruſſia and the United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, were in treaty with the United States, and are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored by the propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It was finally contended, that admitting our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to be ſuch as had been deſcribed, the mode pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was an objectionable one.</p>
            <p>Mr. Madiſon ſaid he had no predilections for the mode that could prevent his giving a ready preference
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027258_0068_0FD3F31D8071FBB0"/>
to a better, if a better ſhould be offered. And unleſs it ſhould be ſaid, that the Legiſlature ought to adjourn without doing any thing for the public relief, he thought it incumbent on thoſe who object to one propoſition to ſubſtitute another that would be leſs objectionable. By this he meant a propoſition not merely better in itſelf, but one that would probably be thought ſo, both withen and without doors; and be more likely to coincide with the ſentiments of every part of the union, as well as to conciliate a majority of voices in the public councils.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion, he ſaid, was whether any thing ought to be done. If this be decided in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as he preſumed to be the ſenſe of the majority of the committee; and if war was not in contemplation as of courſe was taken for granted; the next queſtion could only lie betwen negociation, and commercial regulation. Negocition it had been ſhewn was in no train, or proſpect, that could juſtify reliance on it. Commercial regulations alone remained. They would be pacific in their operation. They were the means beſt ſuited to the remper of our conſtituents. And he ſincerely belived, that, if judiciouſly framed, they would be more likely to anſwer the reaſonable purpoſes of the community, then any others that could be propoſed.</p>
