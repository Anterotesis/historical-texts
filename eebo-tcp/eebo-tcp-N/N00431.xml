            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To <hi>praise</hi> God, is to <hi>Acknowledge</hi> the perfections that are in Him; 'tis to <hi>Acknowledge</hi> the infinite Power, Wisdom, Goodness, Justice and Holiness, which are His Attributes; and this we are to do, <hi>In all our ways.</hi> We have received our Being for this End; and our Grand, our Chief Errand into the World, is, That our God may have a Number of <hi>Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders</hi> to be sensible of His <hi>Excellencies.</hi> When Mankind came first out of His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hand, He then said, as in Isa. 43. 21. <hi>This people have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my praise.</hi> In our Lower Little World, no Creatures can be found capable of Conceiving and Expressing those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of God, which are, <hi>The Glory due unto his Name,</hi> besides MAN; who is therefore not unfitly called, <hi>The High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest of the Creation.</hi> The devout psalmist once called upon all Creatures, with a Repeated Invitation, <hi>Praise ye the Lord;</hi> but they all reply that <hi>Man</hi> is to do it for them, and they all therefore conspire to offer the Notices of the Almighty God, unto <hi>Mans</hi> affectionate Contemplation.</p>

To <hi>praise</hi> God, is to Acknowledge in Him something <hi>Excellent,</hi> as 'tis said in Psal. 148. 13. <hi>Let them praise the name of the Lord, for His Name alone is Excellent;</hi> thus, when we Acknowledge an <hi>Excellency</hi> in all those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations which God maketh of Himself; then 'tis that we <hi>praise</hi> Him. Now the <hi>Praises</hi> owing to the God of Heaven from us are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not only by what He <hi>Is,</hi> but also by what <hi>He Does:</hi> indeed by what <hi>He Does</hi> it is that we come to Learn what <hi>He is.</hi> We ought to Acknowledge an <hi>Excellency</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of God; which is to Ascribe <hi>Glory</hi> to Him. The Language of our <hi>praises</hi> is to be that in Psal. 89. 6. <hi>Who can be compared, who can be Likened, unto the Lord?</hi> God should be truly <hi>Transcendent</hi> with us. We should appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that as the Name of our God is, I AM, so all other Beings are as meer <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Entities</hi> in comparison of Him; subscribing to that is Isa 40. 17. <hi>All are before Him as Nothing.</hi> We should apprehend the <hi>Being</hi> of God, so Independent, so Unchangeable, so Mysterious, as no other Being is; and with Dazzled Souls fall into such <hi>praises</hi> as to say, <hi>I cannot find out the Almighty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> The <hi>perfections</hi> that are in the <hi>

We are told in Isa. 28. 29. <hi>The lord of Hosts is Excellent in Working.</hi> Our <hi>praises</hi> of God, are in This to find the <hi>Reasons</hi> of them, <hi>He has done Excellent Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, We ought with many <hi>praises</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> which God has done for <hi>our selves.</hi> As the Psalmist call'd upon himself, in Psal. 103. 1. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my soul; and forget not all his Benefits;</hi> thus ought we to Reflect upon the many <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Kindnesses</hi> of the most High towards our selves, with <hi>praises</hi> too many to be Numbred, too Hearty to be ended. We ought to see something of God, in all our Circumstances, and upon all that happens to us, we are to say, <hi>The Lord be magnify'd!</hi> But there are some <hi>Excellent Things</hi> done for us,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000540_0017_0FA6B5B6F7165738"/>
by our God; Things which no Friend, no Hand, <hi>none else</hi> could have done for our Good; and <hi>These</hi> Things we should with suitable <hi>praises</hi> be particularly grateful for. It is the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to receive the Comforts of their Lives, with a <hi>Baruk Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> or <hi>Blessed be the Lord.</hi> We that are <hi>Christians</hi> may not suffer our selves to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by any people, in <hi>Thankfulness</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. It is related concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, in John 6. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Much more ought the more <hi>Excellent Things</hi> that are done for us, to be so Acknowledged. When God had heard a <hi>Prayer,</hi> there was that <hi>praise</hi> returned for it, in John 11. 41. <hi>Father, I thank thee for it.</hi> We ought seriously to think, What <hi>Answers</hi> of our <hi>Prayers,</hi> what <hi>Reliefs</hi> of our <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Woes,</hi> the great God has in an <hi>excellent</hi> manner favoured us withal; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of all should be, <hi>Lord, I thank thee for these Excellent Things.</hi> A good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> himself may smart by failing here.

                     <p>Secondly, We ought with many <hi>praises</hi> to observe the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> which God has done for <hi>Others</hi> as well as for our selves. Our

                        <hi>praises</hi> must not be confined unto those <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of God, which we our selves have been the Subjects of.

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bs</hi> to Him. A Soul that is <hi>Fill'd with all the Fullness of God,</hi> will be <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> with <hi>praises</hi> to Him for <hi>all</hi> his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. We should be like him that said, in Psal 139. 14. <hi>I will praise thee, for marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy Works.</hi> Whatever our God is <hi>Doing,</hi> we should upon the sight thereof be <hi>praising;</hi> and we should Acknowledge Him, in all those <hi>Excellent Things,</hi> which we see done in any part of the Universe. It was said in Psal. 40. 5. <hi>Many, O Lord, my God, are the Wonderful Works which thou hast done.</hi> God has done many <hi>Wonderful Works,</hi> and many <hi>Excellent Things,</hi> in which we our selves have not an <hi>Immediate,</hi> or at least not a <hi>peculiar</hi> share; but we should all render <hi>praises</hi> unto Him on the account thereof. It is mentioned as the priviledge of a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, in Psal. 112. 9. <hi>His Horn shall be exalted.</hi> What if one thing intended in it should be This? That as the <hi>praises</hi> of God were sounded by His People, in <hi>Cornets</hi> of old, so there were <hi>Exalted Horns,</hi> or <hi>Exalted Notes,</hi> which He would have their <hi>praises</hi> to be Raised with.

accommodate the Allusion; The <hi>Praises</hi> of God are to <hi>Sound High,</hi> in our Devotions. When we <hi>praise</hi> God for being <hi>Excellently Good</hi> unto our selves, we do well; but we are to <hi>Raise</hi> our <hi>praises</hi> unto an Higher pitch than so; they are to Expatiate upon all those things, wherein our <hi>God</hi> has exhibited Himself as <hi>Excellently Great,</hi> throughout the world Such <hi>Abstracted Praises</hi> are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Inclinations of every Godly man; he argues at that Rate, <hi>Great is the Lord,</hi> and therefore <hi>Greatly to be praised.</hi>

                     <p>We ought both to <hi>Sing,</hi> and to <hi>Spread,</hi> the <hi>praises</hi> which we owe unto the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> We are to <hi>Sing</hi> the <hi>praises</hi> due to God for the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> that He hath done. And if we keep close to the Text, we shall see two things here demanded of us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> There should be an <hi>Exactness</hi> used; in our <hi>praising</hi> of God. There should be in our <hi>Praises,</hi> as on one side an <hi>Amputation</hi> of all that is improper, so on the other side no <hi>Omission</hi> of any Article that calls for out me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. The charge given to us it That in Psal. 103. 2. <hi>Forget not all His Benefits.</hi> We should not <hi>Forget</hi> so much as <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Things,</hi> which we can Remember to be done by God. The skipping of <hi>One stroke</hi> in a Lesson, often spoils the grace of the Musick. So does the missing of <hi>One Thing,</hi> in a Commemoration of what God has done. We should be careful with an often, yea with a daily <hi>Examination,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our selves, about the Things for which God is to be <hi>praised.</hi> It is hardly convenient for a man to sleep at Night, until he have pondered, <hi>What New Excellent Things has been done by God this Day, that I should particularly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000540_0021_0FA6B5BC44F499B8"/>
praise Him for?</hi> And we should be careful that our <hi>Sorrows</hi> do not swallow up our <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> 'Tis often so, that as that worthy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of old could not eat of the <hi>Peace Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> which was a <hi>Thank-Offering,</hi> because <hi>She Wept;</hi> thus we can't <hi>praise</hi> God, because He <hi>Smiles</hi> us. We cannot see <hi>Excellent Things</hi> done by God, because we feel <hi>Terrible Things</hi> done to our selves. But this is our <hi>Folly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where we have <hi>One</hi> Trouble, we have a <hi>Thousand</hi> mercies of our own to be <hi>praising</hi> for. And if we were a million times more afflicted, than we are, yet the Lord might challenge our <hi>Praises.</hi> It was a great Speech of the Renowned <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There should also be an <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> used in our <hi>Praising</hi> of God. But of what kind? Far be it from us to plead for that which is properly <hi>instrumental Music</hi> in the Church of the Lord Jesus. Indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of our Lord, there was in the Church a Divine appointment for such a thing; and between the <hi>Neginoth</hi> and the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000540_0022_0FA6B5BD079F5EC8"/>
                        <hi>Nehiloth,</hi> I find, if I miscount not, sixteen or more kinds of <hi>Instruments</hi> for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it. But upon the Abolition of the <hi>Mosaic Pedagogy,</hi> we have uo order-for the continuance of this <hi>Temple Worship,</hi> by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it into our <hi>Synagogues.</hi> The Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church had it not, as even a <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells you; the Ancients often &amp; loudly declaim against it, and <hi>Aquinas</hi> himself about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, notwithstanding all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Bigottry, yet bestows none of the kindest Remarks upon it. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> themselves own, that <hi>Aliquid Figurabat,</hi> it was a <hi>Typical thing;</hi> and we having in the Tydings of the Gospel that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> which this was a figure of, ought not to <hi>Judaize</hi> by upholding the shadow in the presence of the <hi>Substance;</hi> nor ought we to bring into the House of God, a Troop of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers which the Lord Jesus never instituted. What Instruments are we then to <hi>praise</hi> God withal? we are all furnished with <hi>two</hi> at least.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Our <hi>Lips</hi> are to be employed in the <hi>praises</hi> of God. The Psalmist called his Tongue <hi>my glory.</hi> Our <hi>Tongues</hi> are then our <hi>glory,</hi> when we <hi>glorifie</hi> God therewith all. 'Tis a proper service for them; Hence the Apostle sayes, <hi>Therewith we bless God.</hi> It is <hi>Desired</hi> for the Saints in <hi>Psal.</hi> 149.6. <hi>let
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000540_0023_0FAB5BDB8181B80"/>
the High Praises of God be in their mouthes.</hi> And it is Resolved by one of them, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.21. <hi>My mouth shall speak the praises of the Lord.</hi> Hence the Apostle urges it, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>let us offer the Sacrifice of praises to God continually, that is the fruit of our lips.</hi> There were Offerings of many sorts, which God was <hi>praised</hi> withal of old; but <hi>our Lips</hi> are to be instead of the <hi>Calves</hi> and <hi>Lambs,</hi> and other <hi>Euchr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>tical</hi> Offerings that then were customary.</p>
                     <p>With our Lips we are to rehearse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the <hi>Excellent Things</hi> that have been done by God, especially when we are with bended <hi>Knees</hi> and lifted <hi>Eyes,</hi> presenting our selves before him. With <hi>mentioning</hi> what God has done, we are to do as he said, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.2. <hi>Every Day will I bless thee my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there is one Exercise of our <hi>Lips,</hi> which God is more peculiarly to be <hi>praised</hi> with; and that is <hi>the Singing of Psalms.</hi> In those <hi>Commands</hi> of God which require the <hi>praises</hi> of God, even in our Dayes, we have such clauses as those, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 95 1. <hi>O come, let us sing to the Lord, let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our Salvation.</hi> The New-Testament sufficiently inculcates this way of <hi>praising</hi> the most High; and if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Primitive Christians
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000540_0024_0FA6B5BFCF754A68"/>
hardly ever had a <hi>Feast</hi> without it. There are savoury <hi>Hymns,</hi> of an Humane Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which no doubt we may <hi>praise</hi> God by singing of. But <hi>Scriptural</hi> and <hi>inspired</hi> Hymns are those which we should principally thus put Regards upon. <hi>The Psalms of David</hi> are those which <hi>God</hi> is to be <hi>Praised</hi> by a Reverent, and Attentive <hi>Singing</hi> of. <hi>These</hi> were those, no doubt which our Savio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. Himself Sang, at the <hi>Passover,</hi> more than a score of Times, And the very <hi>Angels</hi> whose Melodies the <hi>Shepherds</hi> overheard of old, seem to sing out of the <hi>Eighty fifth Psalm.</hi> Hence when the Apostle says, in Eph. 5. 19. <hi>Speak to your selves in Psalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs;</hi> he alludes to the well-known Division of the <hi>Psalter. q. d.</hi> Go sing all the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Till we can <hi>mend</hi> them, never let us, leave them. He that shall <hi>sing</hi> those Blessed Psalms, and ordinarily spend at least one <hi>Observation,</hi> and one <hi>Ejaculation,</hi> upon every verse, as he goes along, will therein <hi>praise</hi> the great God, at no common rate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our L<hi>ives</hi> are likewise to be Employ'd in the <hi>Praises</hi> of God. We have <hi>Hands</hi> as well as <hi>Tongues</hi> for it; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there is that <hi>our Hand finds to do.</hi> The best <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is <hi>Thanks living.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Words</hi> of God are <hi>True,</hi> in the Notice which they have given us, <hi>That the Works of God are Great;</hi> and certainly no Age did ever afford In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>Greater</hi> than those which are <hi>Now</hi> the matters of Discourse and Wonder throughout the World.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Marvellous Things</hi> which at this Day strike the minds of Men with a just A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment, there are not many more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, than those of <hi>the late Extasies in France.</hi> Concerning, which we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Information;</p>
                  <p>That about the beginning of the Year 1688: a young Shepardess in the Province of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> fell into unaccountable <hi>Trances,</hi> wherein tho' the standers by, pull'd her, struck her, cut her and burnt her, yet it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to awaken her. In this condition, her custome was to utter many Divine things;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000540_0066_0FA6B5F47AE64710"/>
and though she could neither write nor read, nor could speak any <hi>Language</hi> but that of her Countrey, which has nothing of pure <hi>French</hi> in it, yet she now <hi>Pray'd</hi> and <hi>Preach'd</hi> at a most prodigious rate, and Sang <hi>Psalms</hi> after the manner of the <hi>French</hi> Protestant Congregations: and when Auditors that could thereby be edified, were present, she expressed herself, not only in <hi>French</hi> of a Dialect most Exact and Correct, but also having occasion to speak <hi>Latin,</hi> in the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Romish Superstitions,</hi> she did it with a distinctness that fill'd all the Hearers with Admiration. And though when she came out of her sleep, she remembred not what had befallen her; yet she had her wits thereby made more Sparkling and Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Those new <hi>French</hi> Apostles, the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> quickly did their utmost, for the suppression of this <hi>Rare Thing;</hi> but behold the event! It was not long before other persons fell into the like <hi>Trances,</hi> with <hi>Symptoms</hi> not unlike to those which had attended her; and the Number encreased unto several Hundreds of these <hi>Prophets,</hi> if I may call them so? where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They are People of all Ages and Sexes; but the greatest part of them are <hi>Boyes</hi> and <hi>Girles,</hi> from six or seven to five and twenty years of age; and persons very old; all of them the meaner sort of People: but of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies Exemplary for their good living; the whole affair being indeed so prodigious, that the most obstinate <hi>Saddu cees</hi> in the Kingdom confess it, <hi>A natural Distemper directed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to procure the Repentance of a sinful World.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>One part of it is, the <hi>Admonition</hi> of those unhappy persons that have provoked God by many notorious Miscarriages, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by <hi>Apostasie</hi> under the late Persecution.

man is able to resist their Words! And they make the <hi>Penitents</hi> now and then confess o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular sins, which they convince them of, though the Transgressors had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined these Faults impossible to be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

They do indeed foretell many Things of a more private concern; they foretell a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Things that must happen to themselves and their Friends: and the issue confirms the Prophesie. One of them being thrown into a Dungeon, said,. <hi>The man who sent her thither should within eight Dayes fetch her out,</hi> and it strangely was accomplished.</p>

But the Things of a more publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, are chiefly those which they foretel. The Gentlemen, who give us the History, tell us, that they judge it not yet convenient to publish a large part of the Authentick and sufficient Collections which they have made of these Prophecies. However, they have given us a Taste. In general, The Subjects of this <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> all agree in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, <hi>A Speedy Deliverance to the Church of God:</hi> and they declare, <hi>The Late Revolutions in England, to be the Beginning of that Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>They foretold a fresh Assault of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>France,</hi> and it had a very dreadful fulfilment; for after it Ensued a Terrible Storm of Outrage upon the Relicks of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism in the Desolate Kingdom: in one Article of which, there was a Massacre, of about four hundred people; but they foretold within how many Days the Persecution should be over; and they give hopes of a <hi>Protestant

                     <hi>THe Occasion which first produced the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermon, cannot be expressed in better Terms, that those which were used by the Worthy Gentlemen that were the</hi> Conservators of our peace, <hi>in their humble Address to Their Majesties, bearing Date, May 20th 1689.

                  <p>—Your three several Princely Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Encouraging the English Nation, to cast off the Yoke of a Tyrannical and Arbitrary Power, which at that time they were held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, have occurred unto the View and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the people in this Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves under alike (if not worse) evil and unhappy Circumstances with their Brethren in <hi>England;</hi> First by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously deprived of their Charter-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; Priviledges, without any Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Tryal, and under utter impossibilities of having Notice of any Writt served upon them; and then followed with the Exercise of an illegal and Arbitrary power over them, which had almost ruined a late flourishing Countrey, and was become very grievous &amp; intolerable; besides the growing miseries,
<pb facs="unknown:000540_0076_0FA6B5FF146920D0"/>
and daily fears of a total Subversion, by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at home, and Invasion by forreign force; the people thereby excited, to imitate so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heroic an Exemple, being strongly and unanimously spirited, to intend their own safeguard and Defence, resolved to sieze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and secure some of the principal persons concerned, and most active in the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the illegal and arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, set over them by Commission. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly upon the eighteenth day of <hi>April,</hi> last past, arose as one man, siezed upon Sr. <hi>E.

That the Governour, Deputy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Assistants, chosen and sworn in May 1686. according to Charter &amp; Court as then formed, would assume the Government;—</p>
                  <p>—the said Governour, Deputy-Governour, and Assistents, then Resident in the Colony, did Consent to accept the present Care and Government of this people, according to the Rules of the Charter, for the preservation of the Peace and common safety, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth further Acts of Authority, upon Emergencies: until by Direction from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there should be an orderly Settlement; which we hope will Restore us to the full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thereof, as formerly; notwithstanding we have, for some time, been most unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, and injuriously deprived of it.</p>
                  <p>That Royal Charter being the sole Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Encouragement unto our Fathers and predecessors, to come over into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and to plant the same at their own Cost and Charge.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas you give Us to understand, that you have taken upon you the present care of the Government, until you should receive Our Order therein, We do hereby Authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>It was in the time of our greatest</hi> Heats <hi>and</hi> Straits, <hi>and at a time appointed for a</hi> General Assembly <hi>of this great Colony, that the ensu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Through the Grace of God, the Sermon</hi> Then <hi>was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacceptable to some who desired the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it. But I gave not my full Consent unto their Desire, until now, they had an</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity <hi>(with their Renewed</hi> Im<hi>portunity) to join in with another Discourse which they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from me; and tho' the little</hi> Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>which were among us, when the Sermon was preached, are now so well Composed, yet I flatter any self with an opinion, that the things here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, will not, should not be judg'd</hi> Unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</p>

a Breach of</hi> Order <hi>in me, I have but one thing more to offer by way of Satisfaction for it. There was once a people in the world, with whom it was a Custome, That when men would Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate the Favour of the</hi> Ruler, <hi>they were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his own</hi> Son <hi>before him, as a</hi> Sight <hi>which would speak more than any Advocate. Instead thereof, that I may not want the Favour of my</hi> Countrey, <hi>how blameable soever they may count my freedome with them, I shall only present them with my own</hi> Father; <hi>whose cheerful Encounter with an hazardous Voyage unto a strange Land, and with innumerable Difficulties and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons these, for no other Cause, than that he might</hi> Speak FOR <hi>them, has at least merited oe Pardon for</hi> Mce, <hi>with whom he has for near two years now left both his</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Family, <hi>if I have transgressed by taking a Liberty of</hi> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing To <hi>them at the same time, the things which may promote our Enjoyment of the</hi> Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <hi>with us. Now, may</hi> Salvation be nigh unto us, <hi>and</hi> Glory dwell in our Land!</p>

irrefragable Demonstration prov'd, That not <hi>Ethiopians</hi> but <hi>Arabians</hi> are the <hi>Cushites</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Oracles of God. These <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> tho they have not been called <hi>Saracens</hi> (as has been thought) from their word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak,</hi> that signifies, <hi>to Steal;</hi> yet for their <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious</hi> Inclinations, they well deserved such an Etymology; they were a wild sort of men, that liv'd much upon the Rapin and Ruin of their Neighbours; and particularly, a <hi>Million</hi> of them now designed <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for a prey.

whole Army to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Design</hi> of it; and that is, to decclare both the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Use</hi> of their late Prosperity. <hi>The Lord is with you, while you you are with Him;</hi> or as the Vulgar Latin has it, <hi>Inasmuch as you have been with him.</hi> What follows, is but an Explication, and Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>this.</hi> He saw they were taken up with various Businesses and Contrivances; they had their Enemies under Hatches, and their minds were full of Thoughts and Cares, <hi>What to do next?</hi> But he calls them off to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> the <hi>Presence</hi> of God, as the cause of their coming off so well in their late <hi>Action,</hi> and <hi>above all things</hi> to <hi>obtain</hi> &amp; <hi>secure</hi> the <hi>presence</hi> of God, that they might come off as well, in in their future Enterprises.</p>
                  <p>I am therefore to call for your Attention unto this <hi>Faithful Saying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>DOCT. That <hi>The GOD of Heaven will be</hi> with <hi>a people while they are with Him.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>What is implied in that</hi> presence of GOD, <hi>which we are to be solicitous about?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:000540_0084_0FA6B606BA138DC0"/>
For Answer to this; There is a Threefold <hi>Presence of God,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Scripture of Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, God is <hi>Naturally</hi> present with all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He is an <hi>Immense Being,</hi> and no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be without him. The Apostle thus argued in the Court at <hi>Athens,</hi> in <hi>Act,</hi> 17.27. <hi>God is not far from every one of us.</hi> No, He is <hi>near</hi> us all, He is <hi>with</hi> us all. And <hi>Paul</hi> could have had the Gentiles themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing it; for besides what their <hi>Seneca</hi> did own, One of their own Poets had said, <hi>Jovis omnia plena.</hi> It is the Speech of our God, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, saith the Lord?</hi> Yea, <hi>That</hi> He do's. The Jews call God by the Name of <hi>Makom,</hi> or of <hi>Place,</hi> because all things are in Him; this is His Name in the Book of <hi>Esther,</hi> if I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it not. Whether we may count it <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>physical</hi> to speak of an <hi>Imaginary, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite space,</hi> beyond the utmost Selvige of the world, replenished with our God alone; yet we are sure that <hi>the Heaven of Heavens</hi> gives no limits unto His Being; and the Ancients were not mistaken when they said, <hi>Deus Ipse Sibi, et Mundus et Locus et Omnia.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so well say, That God is in the <hi>World,</hi> as we may say, The whole World is in <hi>God;</hi> &amp; we may say with the Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Whither shall I flee from thy presence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000540_0085_0FA6B60740A35868"/>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is <hi>Gloriously</hi> present with the Inhabitants of the Third Heaven. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens hath in it most intimate and marvellous manifestations of God. It is the <hi>Place,</hi> of which we may say, as tis said of that <hi>State,</hi> in Rev. 21. 23. <hi>The glory of God doth lighten it.</hi> There the blessed ones have God <hi>with</hi> them, so that they <hi>Alwayes behold His face;</hi> and they are <hi>satisfied with His like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for ever. When we come to Heaven, then as in I. Thes. 4. 17. <hi>We shall ever be with the Lord.</hi> So the Lord will be <hi>with us</hi> for ever. Heaven is the <hi>Throne</hi> of the Most High; He is there as a Prince in his Throne; the Great KING is in a manner very ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble residing there. To be there, is called in 2. Cor. 5. 4. A being <hi>present with the Lord.</hi> Hence unto the <hi>Heaven,</hi> and not unto a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> are we directed to make our <hi>Corporal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> or our <hi>Oathes</hi> before the Lord.</p>
                     <p>But Thirdly, God is <hi>Graciously</hi> present with His people, by being <hi>Favourable</hi> unto them. And this <hi>Gracious presence</hi> of God is that which a people ought to be concerned for. It lies in The <hi>Engagement of Divine Providence for the Welfare of such a people.</hi> God is <hi>with</hi> us when God is <hi>for</hi> us.</p>
                     <p>To particularize,</p>
                     <p>First, God is <hi>with</hi> a people by <hi>Directing</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:000540_0086_0FA6B60901CF6100"/>
of them. When <hi>Israel</hi> was to pass thro' the Wilderness, they had that encouragement, in Exod. 22. 15. <hi>The presence of God going</hi> with them. What was that? Why, They had a cloudy fiery <hi>Pillar</hi> miraculously Leading of them every step of the way; There was a wonderful Pillar which was a <hi>Cloud</hi> by day, and a <hi>Fire</hi> by night; the <hi>Lower</hi> part of which rested on the Tabernacle, while the <hi>Upper</hi> part was to be seen by the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Motions of this being managed by the Ministry of Angels, now <hi>God</hi> was <hi>with them,</hi> and <hi>He led them forth by the right way.</hi> A people are often brought into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Difficulties and Emergencies: but if God be <hi>with</hi> them, He guides them to a good Issue of them all. The <hi>Presence</hi> of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in His Directing and Inclining of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to such Actions, as may be for <hi>His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>their Safety,</hi> and such <hi>Methods,</hi> as may extricate them out of all Distresses. When God is <hi>with</hi> a people, He shapes their Counsels for them, and he disposes them to the Things that should be done. He supplies them with Apprehensions beyond the Reach and Verge of their own Wisdome, and He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ayes before them <hi>Invitations,</hi> and <hi>Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which as it were push them into <hi>the way wherein they should go.</hi> When the Jews were upon a <hi>Re-Assumption</hi> of the desireable things
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000540_0087_0FA6B60A252F4D68"/>
which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had deprived 'em of' they took a <hi>Right Way</hi> to dissappoint all that were desirous to interrupt them in it. We find in Neh. 4. 13. That while those Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises continued, they <hi>waited</hi> in a posture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thereunto; and when the danger was over, <hi>then they returned every one to his work.</hi> How came this to pass? 'Twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause GOD was <hi>with</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God is <hi>with</hi> a People, by <hi>Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them. 'Twas the promise of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His people, in Isa. 43. 2. <hi>When thou passest thro' the Waters, I will be with thee, and thro' the Rivers, they shall not overflow thee.</hi> On which Text, blessed <hi>Bilney</hi> after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation so sweetly paraphrased, that his Friends caused the whole Sentence to be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written on their Tables. A people may be ready to be swallow'd up, by a stormy, gaping Ocean of Troubles, but if God be <hi>with</hi> them, they shall escape clear of all. The <hi>Presence</hi> of God is a Defence, a Refuge to the people that are partakers of it. It was said unto <hi>David</hi> in <hi>2. Sam.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>I was</hi> with <hi>thee, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight.</hi> When God is <hi>with</hi> a people, He distracts and confounds their enemies, and He troubles <hi>those</hi> who trouble <hi>them.</hi> A people who have God <hi>with</hi> them, are too strong for all the <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of their enemies; no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000540_0088_0FA6B60A3A5E17C8"/>
no Desolation, shall make such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple miserable; they are the <hi>Jacob,</hi> unto whom in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>Behold, I am</hi> with <hi>thee, and I will keep thee, saith the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God is <hi>with</hi> a people by His <hi>Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Succeeding</hi> of them. When <hi>Joshua</hi> had a vast Undertaking in hand, it was said unto him in <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Be of good Courage, for the Lord thy God is</hi> with <hi>thee, whither soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou goest.</hi> q. d. <hi>God</hi> will <hi>Assist</hi> thee, and <hi>succeed</hi> thee, in thy undertakings. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of God will carry a people comfortably through all that they take in hand. If they have <hi>Canaanites</hi> to subdue; if they have <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments</hi> to obtain or preserve, the <hi>Presence</hi> of God will prosper them in doing all. It was said unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> in I. Chron.22. 11. <hi>My son, the Lord be</hi> with <hi>thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God.</hi> Thus, if the Lord be <hi>with</hi> a people, they shall <hi>prosper</hi> In all their Affairs; in every <hi>Expedition,</hi> they shall come off with Satisfaction; and they shall not miscarry in any of their <hi>Applications.</hi> This is the <hi>Presence</hi> of the Lord.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Presence</hi> of God with <hi>a people</hi> in His <hi>Outward Providence,</hi> has a diverse <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> from His Presence with <hi>His</hi> People, in the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> As tis well

observed by the great <hi>Owen,</hi> in a Discourse unto the Parliament, <hi>These two</hi> are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully distinguished. We must not reflect on the Stability of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> for what Variety and Soveraignty we may see in <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Dispensations,</hi> toward this and that people in the world. This matter seems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>2. Sam.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Tho' my house be not so with God, yet He has made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure. David</hi> had promises for the prosperity of his <hi>House;</hi> He had also the <hi>sure mercies</hi> of the Covenant made over to him in the promises of God. These promises had now a different Establishment; The <hi>Sure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the Covenant, were unto him more <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Immutable;</hi> but the prosperity of his <hi>House,</hi> we find under another Law, and subject unto a dreadful Alteration.</p>
                     <p>To bring these things into the case before us.</p>
                     <p>God has in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That He will be <hi>with</hi> His people. This we read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</hi> The <hi>Alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God,</hi> who is HEE that answers our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, Let them be what they will; the <hi>Unchangeable</hi> God, who is a HE still, whatever He was to the Saints of old; this God hath <hi>said</hi> [and how much better is this <hi>Autos E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He hath <hi>said</hi> it, and this] with multipli'd <hi>Negatives,</hi> in the Original, heaped one upon another, <hi>I will not,</hi> I will not <hi>leave thee, I will not, I will not,</hi> I will not <hi>forsake thee.</hi> Well, but <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>with</hi> a people in His <hi>outward</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence just after the manner therein observed.</p>
                     <p>This Two-fold <hi>Presence</hi> of God;</p>
                     <p>First, It has a Diverse <hi>Foundation.</hi> When we look on the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> there the <hi>Sins</hi> of one are explated by the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of another; and so, God comes to be <hi>with</hi> His people, for whom the Atonement is thus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. Thus tis said in 2. Cor. 5. 25. Christ was <hi>made sin</hi> [or a Sin-offering] <hi>for us, that we might become the Righteousness of God in Him.</hi> Now come to <hi>outward Providence,</hi> and there you see other measures taken. Here God is <hi>with</hi> a people, according to those Terms, in Ezek. 18.20. <hi>The Soul that</hi> sinneth IT <hi>shall dye; one shall not bear the Iniquity of nother.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi> It hath a Diverse <hi>Continuance.</hi> When we look on the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> there God hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

you see tis otherwise. God is <hi>with</hi> a people for a while; and upon <hi>their</hi> misbehaviours and provocations, He changes the Tenour of His Dispensations to them. Tis with them, as it was with that family, in <hi>I. Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>I said indeed, that thy house should walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me forever; But now the Lord sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Having praemsed this I must now affirm, <hi>God is</hi> with <hi>you, while you are</hi> with <hi>Him.</hi> We need only reflect on the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> for an Instance of it. That whole History, which almost fills the Bible, proclames nothing more than this; it loudly declares, That while a people are <hi>with</hi> God, God will be <hi>with</hi> them; but that He will be very Terrible in His <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Dispensations</hi> towards such a people as do <hi>forsake</hi> Him.</p>

Things incumbent on them, if they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>Presence</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>First, A People should be <hi>with</hi> God, by <hi>Communion [With] Him.</hi> This tis to be <hi>With</hi> Him; There are Certain meanes of <hi>Communion</hi> between God and us; and <hi>these</hi> we must be continually approaching to Him in. We are <hi>With</hi> God, while we are at <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> before Him; hence in our Context here, it immediately follows, <hi>If you</hi> seek <hi>the Lord, He will be found of you,</hi> While we do <hi>seek</hi> Him, we are <hi>with</hi> Him. The Psalmist was a man much in prayer, and therefore he could say as in Psal. 73. 23. <hi>I am continually</hi> with <hi>thee.</hi> A people much in <hi>Prayer</hi> may say the same, <hi>We are continually</hi> with <hi>the Lord.</hi> A People that will <hi>pray</hi> upon all occasions, a people that will <hi>pray</hi> over all Businesses, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that will retire into the Mount for <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>er</hi> (and <hi>Easting</hi> too) at every turn; that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is <hi>with</hi> the Lord. And the whole <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of God must be, diligently, graciously, faithfully frequented by a people that would be <hi>with</hi> Him. We are <hi>with</hi> God, when we are at <hi>His House.</hi> A people should support &amp; esteem, and use all the <hi>Ordinances of God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. The <hi>Church</hi> of God hath His very special Presence in it; the Name of the Church is that is Ezek. 48. 35. <hi>Jehovah Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> the Lord <hi>is there.</hi> We should all be <hi>there</hi>

too, and <hi>there</hi> give those Encouragements which are due to the Institutions of God; So shall we be <hi>with</hi> the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A people should be <hi>with God</hi> by <hi>Activity</hi> [For] <hi>Him.</hi> To be <hi>For</hi> God is to be <hi>with</hi> God. It was once the Summons giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in Exod. 32. 26. <hi>Who is one the</hi> Lords side? <hi>And all the Sons of</hi> Levi <hi>gathered themselves;</hi> they were <hi>with</hi> God in doing so. Tis a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons given to the world in every Generation, <hi>Who is on the Lords side?</hi> They that obey the Summons are <hi>with</hi> the Lord. A people full of Contrivances for the Interest of God, are <hi>with</hi> Him. A people should set themselves to advance the <hi>Glory</hi> of God; they should own His <hi>Truths,</hi> and His <hi>Wayes;</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw all about them into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the same. A people should propound the <hi>Glory</hi> of God as their cheef <hi>End</hi> and the main <hi>Scope</hi> of all that they do; and they should think much of no <hi>Cost,</hi> no <hi>Pains,</hi> nor (tho, as a Martyr once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself, <hi>tho every</hi> hair <hi>on their heads were a life</hi>) should a Thousand <hi>Lives</hi> be dear unto them, in the promoting of it. Then are they <hi>with</hi> the Lord; they are <hi>so,</hi> when God can say of them, as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 10. <hi>Ye are my</hi> Witnesses, <hi>saith the Lord, and my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A people should be <hi>With God,</hi> by
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000540_0095_0FA6B61159510C70"/>
                        <hi>Behaviour</hi> [Like] <hi>Him.</hi> To be <hi>Like</hi> God is to be <hi>with</hi> God. They that are <hi>with</hi> Him, do not <hi>walk contrary</hi> to Him. God and we should be <hi>One.</hi> A people should have the same <hi>Designs,</hi> the same <hi>Desires,</hi> which the Written Edicts of Heaven declare to be in the blessed God; and not only so, but the same <hi>Vertues</hi> too. Is God <hi>Holy?</hi> Thus a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should not <hi>bear with them that are evil.</hi> Is God <hi>Righteous?</hi> Thus a people should abhor all <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Oppression.</hi> Is God <hi>Merciful?</hi> Thus a people should be disposed unto all fair acts of <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Kindness.</hi> Then they will be <hi>with</hi> the Lord; and, <hi>O that this people were so</hi> with <hi>Him!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the USE to be now made of what has been delivered.</p>
                     <p>Let us all now, <hi>Be</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> that God may <hi>Be</hi> with <hi>us.</hi> I suppose, whatever else we <hi>differ</hi> in, we generally <hi>concur</hi> in that wish, I. King. 8. 27. <hi>The Lord our God be</hi> with <hi>us, as He was</hi> with <hi>our Fathers, let Him not leave us nor forsake us.</hi> O that we might all as much concur in an endeavourous Resolution, <hi>to be</hi> with <hi>God, as our</hi> Fathers <hi>were</hi> with <hi>Him; not to leave Him, nor forsake him.</hi> There is as much of <hi>New-England</hi> in this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as can well be reach'd by the voice of <hi>one</hi> Address; tis indeed, the best part of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000540_0096_0FA6B611B993AF60"/>
                        <hi>New-England,</hi> that is, at least <hi>Represented</hi> in this Assembly. As the great Council at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> satt near the Temple, thus the whole Convention of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> is here come into the <hi>House</hi> of God this day: Wherefore I take the boldness to say, <hi>Hear ye me</hi> Asa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Benjamin. The <hi>Cheef Sinner</hi> and <hi>least Preacher</hi> among all your <hi>Sons,</hi> now takes a Liberty to mind you, <hi>That God will be</hi> with you <hi>while you are</hi> with <hi>Him.</hi> Now that we may be all of us inspired with a <hi>Zeal</hi> for this <hi>great thing</hi> this Day,</p>
                     <p>Let us Consider, First,</p>
                     <p>How <hi>Desirable,</hi> How <hi>Necessary</hi> a Thing it is, that we should have <hi>God with us.</hi> Truly, This is the <hi>Unum Necessarium</hi> of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing is more <hi>Desireable,</hi> for us, than the <hi>Presence</hi> of our God. The Jews have a Fable of their <hi>Manna,</hi> That whatever any man had a mind to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ast, he presently found in the Manna a Savour &amp; a Relish of it. It is very true of this Blessed <hi>Presence;</hi> all manner of <hi>Blessings</hi> are enwrapped in it. There is a multitude of Blessings which we are desireous of; but they are all contained in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive thing: It will give every honest man, all that he wants. <hi>This</hi> will extricate us out of all our <hi>Labyrinths;</hi> This will set all things to rights among us; This will

wonderfully carry on all the <hi>Salvations</hi> which have been begun for us, by the <hi>God of our Salvations.</hi> If Christ, if God be aboard, our little Vessel will not sink in the gaping, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, formidable <hi>Waves</hi> now tossing of it. Well did the Apostle say, in Rom. 8. 31. <hi>If God be</hi> for <hi>us, who can be</hi> against <hi>us?</hi> Thus, If God be <hi>with</hi> us, we have <hi>All</hi> for us. <hi>One GOD</hi> will weigh down more than <hi>ten Worlds.</hi> If we have the <hi>Presence</hi> of that God, Who <hi>made</hi> and <hi>moves</hi> the Universe by a <hi>Word;</hi> if we have the <hi>Presence</hi> of that God, Who can <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Create</hi> our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, <hi>O most Happy We!</hi> We may then join in such Triumphant Acclamations as that in Psal. 118. 6. <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>is on my side, I will not fear; what can man do unto me?</hi> We may then defie, even the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> it self, for, <hi>Cur met <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Add to this; Nothing is more <hi>Necessary</hi> for us, than the <hi>Presence</hi> of God. We are undone, thrice, and four times <hi>Undone,</hi> if we have it not. Methinks I hear the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD with a voice more awful than that of the loudest Thunder, saying over us, as in <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Wo to them when I depart from them.</hi> And <hi>Wo</hi> to us indeed; we are in a most <hi>woful</hi> estate, if it come to <hi>that!</hi> How can we endure the mention of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our most importunate Deprecations, <hi>O our God, leave us not!</hi> We can have a prospect of nothing but horrible Disorders, Agonies and Vexations, if we lose the <hi>Presence</hi> of our Lord: We ly open to no less than a fearful Dissipation, and more than all our <hi>late Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors</hi> would rejoice to see brought upon us. We have lately been complaining of <hi>Burdens,</hi> that were grievous to us; but I may warn you of our danger to feel one Burden more, which will infinitely exceed them all; tis that in Jer. 23. 33. <hi>What Burden? I will even</hi> forsake <hi>you, saith the Lord.</hi> Behold a <hi>Burden</hi> that will sink us into a bottomless <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biss</hi> of Calamities! The <hi>Presence</hi> of GOD, <hi>This</hi> is no less than the very <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> We are <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>gone,</hi> if <hi>that</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.

But in <hi>Compliance</hi> with it, Let every man seriously now enquire of himself, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Mark what I say, That man who does not suspect himself, of having a share in the <hi>Sins</hi> which have driven away from us the <hi>Presence</hi> of our God; <hi>That man,</hi> I may safely affirm it, is one of the principle <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi> of this <hi>Israel;</hi> I do without any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple say it, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Let us all then Examine our selves, and set upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> of our own Hearts and Lives, and the <hi>Renewing</hi> of our Covenants with the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, both the <hi>Objects</hi> in which, and the <hi>Authors</hi> from whom we have endured our Calamities, <hi>those</hi> are enough to indigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what <hi>Sins</hi> they are that have exposed us thereunto. Let me in two or three instances use of plain dealing with you, agreeable to my
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000540_0105_0FA6B61AC9F2C890"/>
station here this day.</p>
                     <p>What have been the <hi>Objects</hi> in which we have been afflicted? Our <hi>Fruits</hi> have been blasted; &amp; were <hi>they</hi> not abused in the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Sensuality? Our <hi>Lands</hi> have been threat'ned; and were not <hi>They</hi> the Idols, for the sake of which we have offended GOD, and almost Renounced all that was <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Good?</hi> The most happy and easy <hi>Government</hi> in the world, was changed with us, into what has by the most impartial men been confessed to have become <hi>Intolerable;</hi> Why, Did not men despise the <hi>Best</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and procure <hi>other things</hi> to be set over them, because they endeavoured to make <hi>Loggs</hi> of what they before enjoyed? To pass on, Were we not in the late unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Extortions of the <hi>Law,</hi> invited to consider, Whether our needless Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Litigious Contentious <hi>Law-Suits</hi> formerly amongst us, were not as <hi>Scandal</hi> thus chastised? Were we not in the late unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Injuries, Abuses, and Exactions of them, that under the pretence of the <hi>Excise</hi> carried on very outragious Villanies, put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Considering, Whether the <hi>Multitude</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> of <hi>Drinking-Houses,</hi> in the midst of us, had not once been a <hi>Stumbling-block of our Iniquity!</hi>

Again, What have been the <hi>Authors</hi> from whom we have been afflicted? Our Molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations have risen very much from <hi>Indian</hi> Hands. And Alas, have we not very much <hi>Injured</hi> the <hi>Indians?</hi> I do not mean, by taking from them <hi>Their Land;</hi> For it was Hardly possible they should be more fairly dealt withal than they have been in that particular; but by <hi>Teaching</hi> of them, <hi>Our Vice. We</hi> that should have learn'd them to <hi>Pray,</hi> have learn'd them to <hi>Sin.</hi> Endeavors for their Conversion have by many people been blown upon; but there have been wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>English,</hi> who have taught them to <hi>drink,</hi> yea, and to <hi>curse,</hi> and <hi>swear;</hi> things which they knew not the meaning of, till they came to <hi>School</hi> unto such <hi>White Pagans</hi> as some that wear the Christian-<hi>Livery</hi> among our selves. And have not we also <hi>Followed</hi> the <hi>Indians?</hi> The Indians are Infamous, especially for Three Scandalous Qualities: They are <hi>Lazy Drones,</hi> and love <hi>Idleness</hi> Exceedingly! <hi>They</hi> are also most impudent <hi>Lyars,</hi> and will invent Reports and Stories at a strange and monstrous rate; and they are out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>Indulgent</hi> unto their Children, there is no <hi>Family-Government</hi> among them. But, O how much do our people <hi>Indianize</hi> in every one of those <hi>Abominable things.</hi> We must repent of these our miscarriages, or else our
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000540_0107_0FA6B61C37D12388"/>
God will take up that Resolution concerning us, <hi>I will even forsake them, saith the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let not <hi>Sin</hi> be <hi>With</hi> us, and <hi>God</hi> will be so. Tis the purpose of our God, in Josh. 7. 12. <hi>I will not be with you except ye destroy the Accursed Thing, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> Let us then <hi>Destroy</hi> that <hi>Accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Especially, Let us take heed of the <hi>Sins,</hi> which at this Time, we have a peculiar Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to. It was complain'd in <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was discovered.</hi> It has bin <hi>thus,</hi> but God will not be <hi>With</hi> us, if it still be <hi>thus</hi> among our selves. Our good God, the <hi>Lord our Healer,</hi> is now <hi>Healing of</hi> us: O let us not now be impatient patients, lest that our blessed <hi>Physitian</hi> deal hardly and roughly with us. <hi>Impatiens agrotus</hi> crudelem <hi>facit Medicum.</hi> Let us now no more discover <hi>Revengefulness</hi> against them that have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ill</hi> of us. Let the <hi>Law,</hi> and not the <hi>Sword</hi> measure out their due unto them. No more discover an <hi>Unthankfulness</hi> unto them that have deserved <hi>Well</hi> of us. Requite them not with <hi>Censure</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> for their unwearied pains to preserve our <hi>Peace.</hi> No more discover a Contempt of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> who set themselves faithfully to <hi>Declare the

whole Counsil of God,</hi> and to <hi>Lift up their voice like a Trumpet in shewing us our sins.</hi> They are all agreed (I hope) as one man to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> studying of your Well-fare; but if they are unjustly ill-treated with you, the great God, whose Messengers they are, will take notice of it, and say, <hi>Ye have despised Me!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And O let us no more Discover such a Spirit of <hi>Lying</hi> as we have made our selves worthy to be reproved for. We find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> that said in I. King. 22. 22. <hi>I will go forth, and I will be a</hi> lying <hi>spirit in the mouth of all the prophets.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the same Devil has been suing for a License to <hi>go forth and be a</hi> Lying Spirit <hi>in the mouth of near all the people here:</hi> I would to God, this Devil were in a <hi>Shorter Chain!</hi> I beseech you Let not this Land have that Character, <hi>A Countrey full of Lies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But of all our Errors, There is none of such dangerous and threatning Consequence as the <hi>Contention</hi> which we are too prone to break forth into. We are too much a <hi>Contentious,</hi> and that will soon render us a <hi>Wretched</hi> and a <hi>Ruin'd</hi> people.
