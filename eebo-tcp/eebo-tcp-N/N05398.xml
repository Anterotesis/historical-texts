         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AND WHEREAS, through the Unskilfulness which so generally prevailed formerly in this Government among Persons pretending to be Scriveners, or to have some Understanding in the Law, sundry Lands have been devised to the Children of the Testators, without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Word <hi>Heirs,</hi> or any other Word, by which, in Construction of Law, such Devises could be understood to be any other than Estates for Life, though it has been well known that the Intention of the Testator has been otherwise; and therefore, by constant Usage, the Children of such Testators, claiming under such Devises, have held the Lands as Estates of Inheritance, and have sold, and devised the same accordingly: And other Testators and Scriveners, for Want of a due Understanding and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Nature of Devises, and Distinction between Words which make an Estate in Fee-simple, and Fee-tail, have devised Lands to their Children, and their Issue, or their Heirs or Issue of their Bodies, or to them and their Children; when it has been known that all that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Testator was no more, than that the Lands should go to his Child or Children, and their Heirs; and yet the Devisees, for Want of being truly informed of the legal Construction of such Devises, have, as soon as they had Children, conceived themselves to have a good Right
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:006835_0112_0000000000000000"/>
to devise or sell the Lands so devised to them, and have disposed of the same accordingly; and oftentimes when it hath happened that such Devisees have died, but have not sold such Lands in their Life-time, and have left Issue, who in Construction of Law were really the Heirs or Issue in Tail, such Issue, from a Belief of their having an Estate of Inheritance in the Lands so devised to them, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, or for a valuable Consideration, sold or mortgaged the said Lands.</p>
               <p>AND WHEREAS the former Assemblies of this Government, considering that rough and unimproved Lands were of very little Value, and that if Persons having any Right or Title to Lands within this Government, should neglect to take Possession, or claim the same in a reasonable Time, and by that Means, Persons being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Claim of such Owners, should purchase the same Lands for a valuable Consideration, of other Persons, who have had the same surveyed to them, or of Persons pretending to be the true Heir or Heirs of the first Owners of such Lands, and such Purchaser should afterwards, at a great Expence of Labour and Money, render the same Lands of considerable Value by their Improvements, and die, and leave the said Lands to their Children: It was therefore provided by a Law of this Government, above <hi>Thirty</hi> Years ago, that <hi>Seven</hi> Years quiet Possession of Lands within these Counties, which were first entered on upon an equitable Right, should give an unquestionable Title to the same, excepting as in the same Act is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: And the People of this Government generally trusting to the Equity of that Law, and the Provision therein made for quieting Men's Possessions, many honest Persons, ignorant of the Titles of Lands, have purchased Lands and Tenements within this Government under the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances before in this Act mentioned, which Purchases have been made <hi>bona fide,</hi> and for a valuable Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Purchasers, and those claiming under them, have hitherto continued in the peaceable and quiet Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the said Lands, without any Claim made by any Persons pretending Right or claiming the same as Heirs or Owners, or Heirs in Tail, Remainder or Reversion; and many of the said Lands so devised and sold as aforesaid, have been taken afterwards in Execution, and sold for the Payment of the Debts of the Persons to whom they have afterwards been sold, and others of the said Lands have been taken into the respective Loan-Offices of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
