            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>repreſentations one would be tempted to think, that if malicious and buſy devils <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>id but ſtay in their own country, mankind would be as harmleſs as lambs, and every ſpecies of wickedneſs be ſoon baniſhed from our then agreeable world.</p>
                  <p>Others there be who fall into the oppoſite extreme, and with all their power endeavour to clear the Devil of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thrown upon him; whether he hath retained them as his advocates I pretend not to ſay: but they tell you that he has no hand in all the wickedneſs committed under the ſun; that it is impoſſible he ſhould have any influence on the minds and manners of men. Nay, ſome go farther ſtill, even doubt of his very exiſtence, and are confident that all their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ariſeth from another quarter.</p>
                  <p>My mind, I muſt confeſs, was long agitated between theſe widely different opinions: now I verged towards the one, now towards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> extreme; and for a long time continued in ſuch p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inful ſuſpence, that I would have given
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:027249_0003_0FD3CE346E007958"/>a world to have been ſatisfied in a matter of ſuch vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in human life. But at length I obtained a full and moſt convincing diſcovery of this very intricate affair; and let who will deny it, I am perfectly ſatisfied that, however juſtly the guilt of men may be charged on their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, infernal ſpirits do exiſt, and are fully employed in forwarding their wicked deſigns and purpoſes. Yea, I have learned ſo much of the art and addreſs of diabolical ſpirits in this matter, that as I ſhall, I truſt, avail <hi>myſelf</hi> much of the very ſingular diſcovery, ſo, from a principle of benevolence to mankind, I think myſelf fully juſtified without further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, in communicating it to the public.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that not far from my humble cot, there is a widely extended, moſt tremendous and gloomy VALE, firſt formed, as is ſuppoſed, by ſome dreadful earthquake, or ſome other remarkable convulſion in nature. The confines of this valley, on the outſide, are every where nearly level with the ſurface of the ground, but the precipice within is to the laſt degree horrible, inſomuch that few have had fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>de enough to approach it. The ancient bards very juſtly called it HORRIDA VALLYS, and we from them, the Vale of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. This horrid vale has long been ſuppoſed, by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous vulgar, to be the haunt of infernal ſpirits; and ſome people imagine that it is the only place on earth where they freely converſe about the dark deſigns of their mal-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiration.</p>
                  <p>My curioſity continually prompting me, at laſt conquered my native timidity, and I reſolved, if poſſible, to find an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this unfrequented, unknown, and dreadful place.</p>
                  <p>But many months, I may ſay ſome years, were ſpent in this fruitleſs ſearch, and I deſpaired of ſucceſs. At length, however, having entered a very large and unfrequented wood, one ſide of which led to the very edge of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice; as I walked a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urlongs down a gradual deſcent, gloomy beyond whatever I had ſeen before, I came to a huge rock, all overgrown with ivy and moſs. It had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:027249_0004_0FD3CE40F7D20230"/>of an ancient ruin, ſomewhat in the form of a pyramid; the bottom occupied a conſiderable ſpace, and the ſpiral top was hardly concealed by the higheſt branches of the tall and aged oaks which ſurrounded it. Near the ground, by chance, I diſcovered an opening almoſt ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aked up with baleful hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loc and night<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hade. At firſt I thought that this could be no other than the cave of ſome ancient Druid; but approaching it, and having with much to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l cleared away the noxious weeds, I found, what I had long ſought for, an entrance into the dreadful ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity.</p>
                  <p>Here my reſolution almoſt failed me, and I was at the point of relinquiſhing the long projected enterprize. At length I recollected myſelf a little, and reſolved to deſcend into the place, though, as I thought, not much leſs horrible than hell. The paſſage, a little within the entrance, led downwards, almoſt in a perpendicular direction; but its ſtraitneſs, and the natural uneveneſs of the rocks that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, rendered my deſcent more practicable and ſafe than I at firſt expected. Down, however, I went, fathoms I know not how many, ere I found myſelf at the bottom, and from an eaſy opening entered the <hi>gloomy vale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Looking up, I ſaw rocks upon rocks projecting over my timo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ous head; and I perceived myſelf to be within the moſt hideous incloſure that ſure ever mortal eyes beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld. The vale being ſolitary and gloomy as death itſelf, I ſaid in my heart, ſurely if damned ſpirits are permitted to viſit the earth, this muſt be their rendezvous, and two to one I ſhall ſee ſome of them. I therefore obſerved carefully my retreat; and by ſeveral marks on the rocks which formed it, I hoped that, on any emergency, I might be directed to the entrance of the cave, by which alone I could return to the ſociety of mortals.</p>
                  <p>I ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound that my precautions were far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary; for I ſaw, by the feeble light which glimmered in the place, a form moſt frightful making directly towards
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027249_0005_0FD3CDAC66224C70"/>me. My heart bounced in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>error, and ſwift as a hare preſt by ſanguine hounds, I ran to my little ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. No ſooner had I entered it, but the fiend ſtalked up to the very door of it. The hair of my head ſtood upright, the blood run down my back as cold as Greenland ice, and I looked upon myſelf as a dead man; having often heard of miſerable wretches being torn in pieces by the talons of mercileſs infernals. But as the hideous form attempted not to penetrate into the cave nor ſeemed at all conſcious of my being there, I recovered myſelf a little, and reviewed it with leſs apprehenſion of danger. At length, he eſpied another of his clan, to whom he called, and with whom he held the following dialogue, which made ſuch an impreſſion on my mind, that I afterwards recollected the moſt part of it, and here preſent it to the worthy reader. The name of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as I afterwards underſtood, was AVARO, and that of the other, FASTOSUS.</p>

But as in former times ſhe had piped to mens, and none of the worſhippers of the Beaſt would dance; ſo now ſhe mourned to them, but none of them would lament. She ſtretched forth her hands all the day long, but none of them would attend to to her; the venerable pope, father of the world, having publiſhed a decree, that none of them ſhould ſuffer her under their roof, nor adminiſter the leaſt comfort to her in her calamity, under pain of the Rack, the Gibbet, the Wheel, or Fire and Faggot.

                     <p>BEING acquainted with the appointment, I choſe to wait for their coming, but was ſo alarmed at what I had heard and ſeen, that I lurked cloſe in my retreat, not daring to attempt any diſcoveries. At the time appointed I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them walking up the valley; and as they drew near,</p>
                     <p>FASTOSUS ſaid, Yes, Avaro, I aſſure you there was great joy in the court of Verſailles on account of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and that both among the French and Engliſh ladies: the latter of whom are the humble ſervile imitators of the former; which tends ſo to chagrine ſome, and give plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to others of them; that by this means contentions run very high among the French ladies. One part complains of the Engliſh as no more than the apes of the French; theſe are they who would monopolize all the finery to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; therefore their cenſure of the Engliſh ladies is not to be regarded; the others boaſt of their ſuperiority, and are not a little proud of their dominion over the fair Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; who, they ſuppoſe, dare not attempt to introduce ſo much as the pattern of a head-dreſs, till it hath had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to drop this for the preſent, Avaro I ſhall be glad to hear the ſtory you mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted</p>

                        <p>It was this, ſir, There was a gentleman in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, a ſteady member of the holy Roman eatholic church, who died lately, and as ſoon as dead, his pious relations made his death known to their reverences the prieſts, in order to procure their good offices in behalf of their depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend, whoſe ſoul, it was upon no ill ground feared, was hardly while enough for heaven, and would therefore be obliged to call at Purgatory, for an effectual cleanſing, are be could proceed further on his journey.

This being their ſole intent, it was unanimouſly agreed to refer themſelves to my direction, and an interview in the apartments of the principal was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted. Being at that time in the neighbouthood I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately granted their petition, and preſented myſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in the principal's chamber; a place very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to me. The reverend old father was no ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of my arrival, than he aroſe from his ſeat, fell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before me, to do me humble greeting, withal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the moſt grateful ſenſe of my care and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in coming ſo ſoon to their aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Humble ſalutation paſt, the principal addreſt me in the following learned manner: "Worſhipful Prudence," for that is the name I am known by among them, "we have an affair of great importance to lay before you; and with the profoundeſt humility will we thank you for your advice."</p>

I do not know, indeed, but our great lady, whom we ſerve, might be ſatisfied with half the ſum; but we thy ſerzants are not ſo eaſily pleaſed. It is our pious deſire to procure as much of the young man's eſtate, as by any means we can, for our own private uſe; as none of us can tell what we may want before we die. Beſides, we do not know but ſo large an eſtate devolving anincumbered upon him, may be the means of ruining the ſoul and body of the inexperienced youth. Now, we, as the holy guardians of his ſalvation, think it needſſary, for the good of his ſoul, to cut off as much as we can of the fuel of his luſts: well knowing how dangerous riches are to the laity. Thus, great patron, I have revealed the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intent of our venerable brotherhood; and, lovely ſpirit, if thou canſt by thy advice ſerve us in this matter, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee to do it; for our eyes are to thee, and our hearts are open to receive thy inſtructions.</p>

                        <p>Six or eight months afterwards, go to the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man again, and tell him that you laid out his laſt money to the beſt advantage, that with it you procured half a dozen of the beſt orator's in heaven, to plead his father's cauſe; who, by their fervent ſupplications, had at laſt prevailed; that the old gentleman was delivered from his torments, and was led in triumph to the gates, to be diſpatched immediately for glory. But, as his unlucky ſtars would have it, juſt as the porter opened the gate, there came up the ſoul of a mendicant friar whom the old gentleman had in his life time unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beat, and now openly accuſed him of this almoſt unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable crime: on which account he was remanded back to more exquiſite torments than ever. Tell the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that this unhappy accident cauſed ſuch grief to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that there is hardly any one of them able to ſay Ave-Maria; and that ſome of them intend, as ſoon as their ſtrength will admit, to go to Jeruſalem, to try if by any means they can procure his deliverance at the holy croſs or ſepulchre.</p>

Be ſure thus always to find out ſome impediment or other to the old man's releaſe; you may bring him often to the gates, but if once you let him go through, all your hopes are over from this quarter.

The advice that I give, in general, is, that by all means he take care to keep up his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the conſciences and liberties of mankind: and the ſame advice I give to the clergy in general; hence eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parſon attempts to reign within his own diſtrict, deſpotic and ſupreme over the conſciences of the people, who are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged under pain of damnation to honour him as the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary of heaven, and the arbitrary diſtributer of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and curſes. I adviſe his holineſs at all events, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his infallibility beyond the ſcriptures of truth, and his ſupremacy above the laws of God or man. This ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I whiſper in the ear of my clergy in general, who, to a man, agree that the ſcriptures ſhall not paſs with toleration, unleſs it is dreſt in the garb of their interpretations; as ſuch, and only as ſuch, it is impoſed on their pariſhoners. The good old vicar never contradicts any thing I ſay, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027249_0027_0FD3CE600CA17D70"/>he knows at the ſame time, his pretenſions to be a cheat; but to the utmoſt of his power follows the directions of his adored Faſtoſus; and never did mortal man ſhew more implicit obedience to the monarch of darkneſs.</p>

The patriarchs and cardinals are ſure to prove loyal to the pope, and of conſequence to us, from a hope which I have inſpired every one of them with, of one day aſcending the papal throne himſelf. The loyalty of the arch-biſhops is inſured by the hope of a cardinal's hat, and their right reverences the biſhops, are ſure to remain inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive animals, in hope of attaining, in ſome future period, the archi-epiſcopal dignity. The ſame device runs through all the other ranks of the clergy, and thereby they are all

                        <p>Employed, do you ſay? never fear me. I have not been idle, I aſſure you. Do you ſuppoſe that I can pick up no game in Britain in this golden-age? If you do, you are greatly miſtaken. It is true that ſome of the late kings of England have been my avowed enemies, and as far as in them lay have expelled me the kingdom. But be they as vigilant as they will, I find opportunity of breaking through the fences which they have reared againſt me: when you may be ſure if I cannot get great, I pick up ſmall game; of which I can only give you a very ſmall ſpecimen at preſent. In one place I perſuaded an ambitious child to poiſon, or otherwiſe kill, an old cumberſome parent, who will not die without violent meaſures. I prevail with a rogue to diſpatch his woman, and her brat, to preſerve his own reputation and eſtate. In a third, I ſtir up an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027249_0029_0FD3CF41B63DB248"/>ſervant to kill and plunder his maſter; and frequently I can prevail with one gentleman to kill another in a duel, on ſome punctilio of falſe honor. And ſometimes, I perſuade the deſpairing wretch to lay hands on himſelf, deſtroy his own miſerable life, and by doing ſo enter upon another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more miſerable. Then I take to my heels, and am followed with a hue and cry all over the nation. But thank you, I am two ſwift for them all: I never give them time to ſay, "Cradelis is here." But they often ſay, "theſe are the tricks of that horrid devil, Crudelis."</p>
                        <p>Yeſterday I was attending a duel, which I myſelf ſtirred up, (as I ſuppoſe you know that all duels are of my inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſo it was here, I perſuaded the gentlemen combatants to fight with ſword and piſtol, hoping that both would have fallen in the action. But though my deſign was good, as ill luck would have it, it miſcarried, and only one of them bit the ground; however, I am not without hope that the other will be hanged for the murder, and if ſo, then I have my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. I aſſure you, gentlemen, I uſe my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to throng the nether regions. O my brother deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers! I could tell you ſuch ſtories as would make you bleſs yourſelves, and adore the prince Crudelis. Theſe are but trifling things, thrown in to whet your appetite againſt the next opportunity.

I was never wont to conſider you as a religious devil, much leſs did I think that you aſſumed to yourſelf any of thoſe diſtinctions, which divide the profeſſedly Chriſtian world. I thought formerly that, the great Faſtoſus had dwelt only in king's courts, with people of ſoft raiment, and occaſionally wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the nobility and gentry, at their country-ſeats. What the devil, Faſtoſus, a papiſt too?</p>

                        <p>In reality, Avaro, (to make uſe of a human phraſe) your ignorance is enough to provoke the very devil. Do not you know yet, that if I were not Jack of all trades and religions, I could never maintain my ſway over men as I do. I have very great concern in religions matters, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, and that among more denominations than ſome people like to hear of. Sometimes I am among the Pagans worſhipped a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Very frequently I have the honor of filling the papal chair, then I am adored under the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble names of Pious, Innocent, Benedict, &amp;c. accounted the univerſal paſtor, head of the church, and father of the whole world. Occaſionally, I ſit as judge in the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive tribunal, where Concupiſcentia and I are adored as divinities. Now I am an holy muſſulman, and ſtiled, his reverence mufti Muly Alab. Then, before you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, I am ſhut up in a cloiſter with the nuns and friars, whom I make more proud of their pretended chaſtity than a thouſand ſaints of their real graces; on ſuch occaſions, I am known by the name of the venerable matron Humility.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027249_0031_0FD3CF44AF82EEF0"/>It happens alſo, that I am obliged to metamorphoſe myſelf into a capuchine, or a Palmerian friar, and in that ſhew of ſelf denial I beg my bread from door to door; by theſe means I teach the fantaſtical devotees to be more proud of their awkard form, and voluntary humility, than a wiſe carl would be of all his landgraviate. Anon, I change my ſtation, and find myſelf an abbot of a convent, where my depending prieſts and brethren worſhip me under the name of the holy father. Then, very ſoon after you'll find me attending the worthy confeſſor in his viſitation, when to be ſure I perſuade his ſelf-conceited reverence that he is well nigh as pure as the moſt holy mother pope Joan, a fortunate lady, who a few centuries ago became head of the church, and mother of the whole world. The hermit, in his cell, on the mountains of Ararat, frequently offers his adorations to me, and for my part, in return for his obſequiouſneſs, I am in no wiſe ſparing of my exalting influence. I perſuade the world-abdicating wretch that, his ſolitary reſidence in that holy aſylum, far more than merits a manſion in heaven, and at his peril that he ſtir not one foot from thence, to go down into an ungodly world: the mountain top, or a cell in the deſart, being the beſt place imaginable in which to merit everlaſting glory. The worthy hermit admits my doctrine to be true, his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite paſſion is gratified, and he obeys implicitly my direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

If he gets to a diſtance remote enough from the reſt of mankind, he can repoſe the greateſt confidence in his own heart; and thereby proclaim his folly to all the world. I aſſure him that, if he will remain during his life in his cell, when he comes to die he will have holineſs ſufficient for himſelf;

He aſſerted that by the works of the law no fleſh living ſhould be juſtified; but you and he believe that by the works of the law a man may be more than juſtified. Yea, that by obſerving of things no where commanded in the law, ſuch as forſaking ſociety, counting beads, and mumbling prayers, he may, not only juſtify himſelf, but help another to juſtification.</p>

                        <p>Ay, Avaro, the hermit believes ſo, but for my part I believe no ſuch thing. I know better, though I thus delude him. But to paſs on with my ſtory, I can tell you, I have a good deal of employment among your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, couſin, and with them I work wonders of compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generoſity. I meet with many who never had the heart to perform one virtuous, benevolent action whilſt health continued; who, when they perceive that they muſt come to a reckoning in the other world, are very aſſiduous to have their accounts balanced aforehand. I perſuade them to leave a maſſy ſum to this hoſpital, to the other pariſh, or to certain meeting-houſes. When I thus direct the will of devotees, one leaves gold enough to build a chapel for our lady, a ſecond doth the like for St. Peter, and a third for St. Dominic. But in general they are moſt fond of ſaints of their own rearing, the greateſt part of whom are now made conſtellations in the nether ſky, and courtiers to the prince Belzebub. Aſk you me, Avaro, what end the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator has in thoſe pious legacies? I tell you, by this time he ſees the manner in which he got and kept his money, has not the leaſt endency to ſave him from deſtruction; and he knows but one way to avert the impending judgment, that is to leave his ſo and ſo gotten money for the good of the church, and that, he is told, never fails to ſanctify e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very meaſure taken to procure it. Some of thoſe deluded teſtators are not without hope that, in ſome future period,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027249_0033_0FD3CF47B1569998"/>their names will be enrolled in the pope's bible; and their ſhrines adored in the Chriſtian pantheon, at Rome, where all the gods of the papal hierarchy are enſhriued.</p>

                     <p>THE way being clear by the departure of Faſtoſus and Avaro, I came out of my lurking place, in order to make what diſcoveries I could in the valley, which I now knew to be a rendezvous for thoſe evil ſpirits, who ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have enſlaved mankind. I had not gone far, before my alarmed imagination transformed every thing I ſaw into a devil; the croaking of the raven was as dreadful as the voice of an hobgoblin; and the ſhrieking of the owl as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible as the roaring of Appollyon. Every diſtant buſh ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear the aſpect of ſome devouring fiend; ſo powerful was the influence of my imagination. Curioſity, however, had ſtill the aſcendancy over my fears; and I wandered from place to place, ſeeking for ſomething new. At length, I ſaw at ſome diſtance, a tall gigantic form, ſlowly moving towards me: a form nearly as huge as the ſteeple of St. Cuthbert's church, at Dulmenſis. Every time he contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his extenſive cheſt, he darkened the air with the breath which iſſued from his expanded noſtrils, as pillars of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I think I was hardly ever ſo much, and never more careſſed than I am now.

Greatly am I beholden to a certain company for inſtructing the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern world in the learned arts of violence, rapine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: not to dwell however on the converſion of the pagans to the vices of nominal Chriſtians; much improvement has been made even in Chriſtendom itſelf, of which take the following inſtances out of many that might be given.</p>

But you know, father, that I am no ſcholar, therefore improprieties in my ſpeech are not at all to be wondered at.

                        <p>Really, fir, I obtained help from a quarter whence there was not the greateſt reaſon to expect it. I mean from the parſons, the ſpiritual guides of the people. It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus: the parſons of the kirk quarrelled among themſelves, and divided into two parties. One of which forſook their mother kirk, and very ſolemnly delivered up the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the devil; on the other hand the reverend gentlemen who abode in the kirk, in the like ſpirit of devotion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up the ſchiſmatics, parſon and people to Belzebub. Belzebub, who you know is never backward in receiving a gift of this kind, finding that all the Preſbyterians in Scotland were thus in full tale made over to him, laid his hands upon as many of them as he could conveniently reach, and made ſuch uſe of them as greatly aſſiſted my operations. Little was now to be heard in the palpit except railing, ſcolding, calling ill names, and toſſing anathemas, from one party to the other: thus while they went on bandying curſes, we went on perſuading the people that religion is a farce, and that true happineſs conſiſts in preſent gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this doctrine readily affecting the heart and ſenſes, was eagerly received, and my government eſtabliſhed.</p>

As to my original, I can tell you that I am well deſcended; of royal lineage, I aſſure you. Great Belzebub himſelf begat me, and my ſiſter Ignorantia, on Eve, the mother of all living on earth.

But my conſtitution being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together earthly, it was found by experience that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal air was too hot for me, and that I could not live within the confines of the damned.

It is your province to counteract moral principles, not interfering much with things divine, and my province to oppoſe truth rather than promote immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore I ſhall inform you how it comes to paſs. Know then, that what a man is when he dies, ſuch he is in the eye of the moral law to all eternity; for death caſts the dye, and the ſame poſture in which the tree falls it muſt lie for ever; but with unbelief they never more agree. For inſtance, many of them whilſt on earth could not be prevailed on to believe that there is a God, but in hell they are feelingly convinced of the truth of this doctrines. Now they believe that there is a terrible God, and that they are fallen into his dreadful hands. Search hell through all its corners; ranſact every furnace in the fiery world, and you'll find never an atheiſt therein.

Other's, whilſt health and ſtrength continued with them, ſuppoſed God was only jeſting, when he threatened the ſinner with the vengeance of eternal fire, but now they are in hell, enduring their vengeance, they verily believe that he was in earneſt.

                        <p>How it elates my mind, to hear my dear Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator expreſs a deſire after inſtruction! I will inform you as far as I myſelf have known. My kingdom, which is indeed extenſive, was eſtabliſhed as follows: as ſoon as I was born, I began to call in queſtion the truth, goodneſs, and authority of the Almighty, and in every reſpect ſet myſelf to oppoſe the eternal, by contradicting every word which he ſpake to man.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, when God ſaid to man, "Thou ſhalt not eat of the fruit of ſuch and ſuch a tree." Although then in my infancy, I ſtepped up to man, and thus interrogated him; hath God indeed ſaid ſo? Are you ſure of it? Are you not miſtaken, think you? You muſt needs have miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as God had ſaid, "In the day you eat thereof you ſhall ſurely die." I addreſſed myſelf to man after this manner. Die too! nay, you ſhall not die. That is only an empty threatening, to keep your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in awe; for God doth very well know that if you eat of that precious fruit ye ſhall be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

By theſe means I brought over man to my obedience; thus I eſtabliſhed my intereſt upon earth, and hitherto I have maintained it, With ſafety may I ſay that my good friends, both parſons and people to this day, love me as their lives, and at any time ſooner take the bare word of the adored Infidelis, than the word and oath of the God of Heaven.</p>

Thus it is, my dear Impiator, I reign almoſt univerſally over mankind, and they perceive it not. Many thouſands of thoſe good people who believed nothing of my exiſtence, and who, in their own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had believed well all their days, have I conducted very ſafely down to the dark abodes of ever-growing anguiſh.

                        <p>Then I proceed. My kingdom doth not conſiſt of all the land known by the name of Impiety-Real, as ſome geographers alledge, ſeveral provinces being made over by treaty, to my uncle Faſtoſus; ſuch as the provinces of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, Legality, Preſumption, and Formality. I reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, only, over the land called Impiety-Enormons, and in our country the laws are as black as the bottomleſs pit, for there, iniquity is eſtabliſhed by authority. As to the reſt of my kingdom, it was like all the branches of Belzebub's government, accompliſhed by ſubtilty and guile. For man conſidered ſimply as a creature, could never have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to my ſway; for this reaſon I was put to my ſhifts, to find out ſome proper method for introducing my regal power.</p>
                        <p>So violent was the oppoſition to it, that my brain was put to the utmoſt torture, and after all I ſhould have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return to my native country, with my finger in my mouth, had it not been for the timely aſſiſtance I received from my worthy friends and relations. My good old moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who you know hath an excellent hand at a dead lift, by means peculiar to herſelf, kicked up ſuch a duſt, as almoſt put out the eyes of one of the moſt vigilant and formidable of my numerous adverſaries; a captain, from whoſe hand I had much to fear, his name was Intellectus; from that time to this, he hath been incapable of diſcerning my deformities, and the danger to which men are expoſed by my dominion.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027249_0045_0FD3CDAA956CB5F0"/>And what makes very much for me, the old gentleman can hardly be perſuaded, but his eye-ſight is now as good as ever it was. I need not tell you the advantages that reſulted to me from thus his deception. At the ſame time my worthy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Faſtoſus, came up to the ſecond, a ſturdy chief, whoſe name was Volens, as tradition ſays, and he gave his back a moſt dreadful wrench, inſomuch that he has never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his former poſture. I myſelf took a po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſwallowed the bait, and ever ſince has called bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweet, and ſweet he hath called bitter.</p>
                        <p>This triumvirate being thus diſabled, I found my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt extremely eaſy, and without any ſtruggle on the part of the reſt, I confined them to inceſſant labour and drudgery, in the different parts of my extended territories, where they are as content as poſſible with their condition, many of them believing they are ſtill in the garden of paradiſe.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. There is the canton of drunkards, out of which I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all my courtiers, and officers in general. This canton has ſeveral communications with all the other parts of my dominions, and this we call the royal-canton.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is the ſwearers canton, a ſet of people the moſt unaccountably fooliſh of all my ſubjects; but a people very profitable to our government.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is the canton of thieves, to which all pilferers,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027249_0046_0FD3CDE417201EC8"/>robbers, gameſters, and deceitful dealers belong. A very populous and ſplendid canton this is.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is the liars canton: theſe are a people poſſeſſed of two tongues; a people who have very much of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of great Belzebub, and a very populous and polite can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton it is alſo.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. There is the canton of Sabbath-breakers, here there is hardly room enough for the inhabitants, they are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly numerous.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. There is the adulterers canton: this is a very dark place; ſeldom viſited by the rays of the ſun. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators cohabit with them.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. There is the murderers canton: the darkeſt and moſt miſerable place in all my dominions, yet for all that, it is very well peopled. For here are ranked not only thoſe who cut one another's throats, like the Alexanders, Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes, Philips, Louiſſes, &amp;c. but alſo oppreſſors of every ſort, cruel huſbands and wives, diſobedient children, who break their parents hearts: falſe friends, back-biters, and calumniators: indeed all who wanton in the unhappineſs of their fellow creatures, like corn-factors and carcaſe butchers: ſo that you ſee here are many inhabitants, and that too of conſiderable figure.

                        <p>By what you ſay, honored ſir, I perceive that, whereſoever idleneſs prevails, it is not among us, for we have no reſt day nor night, but go about plotting the deſtruction of mankind.</p>
                        <p>For my own part, I aſſure you, I have had but little reſt ſince I ſaw you laſt; and ſo very fond are mankind of my counſels, that I expect but very little reſt for the time to come. You know I was going to ſecrete a bag of money in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, when you and I met. This was no ſooner done than I was waited on by a parſon, who had his eyes upon a good living, with a view to receive directions about obtaining it. And he was followed by a tradeſman, who had a deſire to make a profitable break of it; but begged direction how he might do it honourably; I referred him to the goddeſſes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidia and Fallacia for inſtructions, as they more immediately preſide in that department.

As ſoon as he had done his duty to me, he very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly laid the matter without reſerve before me.

                        <p>Being both ſeated in my client's great parlor, the good man addreſſed Mr. Falſhood thus, "My beſt friend, Mr. Falſhood, you and I are engaged as opponents in this ſuit; both of the gentlemen are reſolute, and will bear a good deal of fleecing; you know what I mean, ſir.

                        <p>Mr. Falſhood replied, "It will never do, good ſir. It will never do, to bring it to a ſpeedy iſſue; that is certain. But I'll tell you what we will do. You know that you have the worſt ſide of the cauſe, and if I act the part of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, you will ſoon be obliged to give up: but I ſhall

But as you, Avaro, are of excellent uſe to my operations, I ſhall ſtand upon no diſtance, but avoid all ceremonies with you. Underſtand me then, when God almighty had created all the hoſts of heaven, every angel was perfectly pleaſed with his ſtation; the moſt ſolid and joyous contentment reigned among, and united the etherial inhabitants, who were, in thoſe days very numerous. No one ſo much as wiſhed his ſtation altered. No one thought himſelf capable of higher felicity and perferment than he enjoyed. The adventurous Satan himſelf, though he has not been bleſt with one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſt ever ſince I was born, before that time poſſeſſed all the ſublime and refined pleaſures, his exalted capacity was capable of. And well might he be pleaſed with his ſtation, ſeeing he was a mighty prince among the angels, next in greatneſs to the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And a mighty prince in heaven he would have continued, had he not afterwards become a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for omnipotence. As for me I was not born then, but I have heard old Satan my father, with flames of malice and indignation darting from his eyes, tell how the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony exiſted among the hoſts of paradiſe; till it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that a declaration was made from the lofty throne, that the Son of God was predeſtinated at a time appointed, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a nature inferior to that of angels; and the moſt high commanded that, in that nature all the angels of God ſhould worſhip the Son, even as they worſhip the Father, and that
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027249_0054_0FD3CE42E85C5A08"/>all ſhould ſubmit to the government of the man whom God delighted to honour.</p>
                        <p>At this inſtant I was begotten in Satan's alarmed breaſt. And cried out, 'Tis enough that ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The great archangel's voice was heard, his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was approved of, the ſtandard of rebellion ſet up in heaven, and many millions of angels, whoſe natures I had changed, joined it that day, and fell into the depths of bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs perdition.

                        <p>True I do ſay ſo, and I will not quit an hair's breath of my juſt prerogative. God never did, nor ever could make any ſinner, either angelic or human. Mind well what I ſay, for I perceive you are dull of apprehenſion, and but of a ſhallow judgment. It was not I, but God who made them creatures. God created them in a holy, pure and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtate, and endowed them with powers to preſerve their primitive ſtation, in the upper ſkies: but it was I, not God, who from angels of light transformed them into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of darkneſs. The very moment I was conceived, I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them from light to darkneſs; from holineſs to ſin, from glory to diſhonour; and thus, though not as creatures, yet as devils they are wholly of my formation.

                        <p>Well, couſin, you have fairly laughed me out of my reſentment, by the droll conduct of your parſons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, what I ſaid, Avaro, I will maintain. It ſhall never be ſaid that the devil. Faſtoſus, did at any time eat his words; but I will condeſcend to explain myſelf. Without me, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub would be none other than an angel; but mixing myſelf with his angelic faculties, I render him a perfect devil; the ſame I do with all the reſt of my infernal ſubjects. Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub himſelf is but a titular prince; 'tis I who inſtigate him, that am the great devil of all. To tell you more, it is I who formed hell itſelf, as a place of puniſhment. Such is the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and equity of his nature, that God never would, nor could, inflict any puniſhment without my intervention. He was ever guided in all his works by his own perfections, and therefore could never have puniſhed ſinleſs beings: all beings would have remained ſinleſs, but for me; ſo in making ſin, I made the puniſhment of it. For if once ſin is introduced, puniſhment follows of courſe; it being as natural for ſin to bring forth puniſhment, as it is for the ſun to ſend forth light and heat.</p>
                        <p>No being poſſibly can be a devil, but that being who is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and governed by me, every being thus poſſeſſed and governed, whether angel or man, is a devil. But for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions ſake, we aſcribe only the plain name of fiends, to the angels whom I govern, and to men and women under my
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027249_0058_0FD3CF6C6EF98EF8"/>dominion, we give the names of devils incarnate, becauſe they i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>habit bodies of fleſh. The difference in the ſtature of devils is not, that one is leſs deviliſh than another, but their being poſſeſſed of more noble endowments, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive qualities than others. So you ſee the devils of quality among us, are more intelligent, more ſubtle, and crafty than devils of a vulgar race. The reaſon why Belzebub is head over all the infernal tribes alſo, is not becauſe he is more depraved than his adherents, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was originally created in a more glorious ſtation, poſſeſſed of endowments more exalted, and bleſt with more extenſive natural powers. As ſuch, being once depraved, he is capable of excelling his fellows, as far in diabolical at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, as at firſt he excelled them in their heavenly ſtation. The ſame rule holds good, through the varicus ranks of my ſubjects. Were you to aſk me, why it is that devils without a body, are capable of exceeding in ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, thoſe ſpirits who are embodied? I would anſwer without heſitation, "Not becauſe the one is leſs vicious, or one whit leſs depraved than the other, but for the following two very good and ſubſtantial reaſons;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Although I reign and rule in the heart of every one of them, yet whilſt they are in the body, they are laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular reſtrictions by the Almighty; ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do all the evil which in their hearts I prompt them to do: and therefore they cannot be ſo much like Belzebub in their actions as they would be. Fear and ſhame, very often prevent people from gratifying their impious and unclean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, when a love of virtue, and the fear of God, are abſolutely out of the queſtion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe the natural powers of man are very far inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the powers of infernal ſpirits. The more extenſive a man's natural capacity, the nearer he may arrive to the ſtature of Satan, if unreſtrained by the grace of God. Hence a crafty and learned pope, is by far more like the devil than
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027249_0059_0FD3CE2338389FB8"/>an ignorant ſwag-bellied friar. Yea, Avaro, the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the capacity of either man or devil may be, as it makes him capable of the higher degrees of wickedneſs, even ſo in proportion to the natural abilities of both ſhall the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted be. No wicked being is ſo capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hence one Hume, one Voltaire, is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more capable of being uſeful to us, than fifty H—w—ds, or even five times the number of popiſh prieſts. You may take this as a general maxim, that the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged ſoul muſt be the moſt tormented, if not ſaved.</p>

Here you ſee, child, that although he was believed by his apoſtles to be God over all; the papiſts have found out a way to put him under the command of his virgin mother. Not only ſo, but they have put him under the command of St. Ann, reputed by them to have been his grandmother, as may be ſeen in that famous prayer, approved and authoriſed by the doctors

                        <p>Then I begin with the canton of ſwearers, the moſt fooliſh and unaccountable ſet of people upon the face of the earth. This canton is divided into two provinces, both which are full of people: in the firſt province dwell the falſe ſwearers; and the profane ſwearers, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                        <p>The province of falſe ſwearers, is divided into three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, the firſt of which is inhabited, by knights of the poſt, a ſet of gentry who get their living by giving eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in cauſes to which they are perfect ſtrangers. Theſe knights commonly make their court to the c—k of arr-ings, whom they know is beſt capable of finding them employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is not a great many years ſince, a gentleman walking in the ſeſſions-houſe, in the Old Baily, was accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of theſe knights with, "Pray, ſir, do you want a witneſs? Sir, I'll ſerve you as cheap and as well as any man." Gardiner, biſhop of Wincheſter, formerly was a mighty protector of this order of knights: and at this day
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027249_0066_0FD3CF771B414F68"/>our good friend, the father of the world, his worthy inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, and not a few right reverend prelates, are head men in the diſtrict of falſe ſwearers. Many a good Chriſtian, has been brought to the ſtake, or gallows, by their aſſiduity, both among papiſts and pagans; and more eſpecially the former, who are far from being ſo honeſt, as the latter; and not by half ſo conſiſtent.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond diſtrict is inhabited by the mercenary ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This is a race ſuppoſed to be deſcended from the knights of the poſt; and to be ſure there is a great likeneſs betwixt the two. The mercenary ſwearers will buy a piece of goods for five ſhillings, and as ſoon as a buyer preſents himſelf, tells <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The dealers in horſes, drovers, and butchers, are ſingulary dextrous at this kind of ſwearing. In this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict, it is a prevalent opinion, that a man is not fit to live in the world, unleſs he can ſwear to a lie.</p>
                        <p>The third diviſion is inhabited by the fooliſh ſwearers, a people the moſt remarkably ſtupid, of any under the government of hell; ſome of them are ſo accuſtomed to it from their infancy, that they do not ſo much as know when they ſwear, and are as deſtitute of deſign in the practice, as the parrot when it ſcolds the chamber maid, or as many good people when they ſay their prayers at church. Others ſeem to have ſuch a low opinion of their own probity, that they imagine no one will believe what they ſay, unleſs every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is uſhered in with an oath in the van, and confirmed by another in the rear. Gentlemen of family, fortune and faſhion, are ſtationed in this claſs, and are extremely dextrous here. Nor are the officers of the fleet and army leſs learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or devoid of thoſe embelliſhments. The greateſt part of the Engliſh officers indeed, marine and military, eſteem a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027249_0067_0FD3CE30ACA81930"/>man not fit to carry a muſket, unleſs he can ſwear an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred oaths in a quarter of an hour, without any qualms of conſcience.</p>
                        <p>The Britiſh army ſo far excels in this fine art, that they can fairly curſe the French off the field of battle, without ever ſtriking a blow; ſo terrified are the French at the oaths of the Engliſh. Aye, father, I aſſure you, that this hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic practice, is now ſo prevalent among the baſeſt of the multitude, that I could pick you out a low lifed boatſwain, who will vie with an admiral; and a dwarfiſh drummer, who will ſwear with a lieutenant-general, for any money.

And a very worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful canton it is too, for numbers of very reſpectable corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and many juſtices of the peace reſide in it.</p>
                        <p>I have often laughed, to ſee a delinquent brought before a magiſtrate, and by him be obliged to pay two ſhillings for every atteſted oath, when the magiſtrate himſelf, had not manhood enough to maintain converſation for ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, without being guilty of profane ſwearing.</p>

They are capable of no influence, but that of patriotiſm, ſo long as unprovided for; but the moment their happy ſtars make them placemen, they forget their parriotiſm, drop their enmity to venality, and ſeek noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much as their own emolument, leaving the publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

<note n="*" place="bottom">If an ingenious mechanic ſhould die for filing a ſingle guinea; an extravagant youth be hanged without mercy, for putting you in bodily fear, on the highway; or a vain girl in the prime of life be executed for ſtealing a few yards of lace, and others plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nation of thouſands with impunity, it ſhows that there muſt be a defect ſomewhere.</note> Thoſe gentlemen having no principles, above

                        <p>Another claſs of gentlemen thieves, are our officers by ſea and land, who impoſe upon their king and country, by falſe muſters: and in a very peculiar manner thoſe who make their own fortunes, (no matter whether in the Eaſt or Weſt-Indies) by the fatigue of their men, who are left to remain in their original penury: theſe, together with the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the army, agents for regiments, &amp;c. are all ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here.</p>

                           </gap>he ſecond ſubdiviſion is peopled by what we call the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable thieves. A prodigious populous place is this. Here dwell legions of attornies; vermin, who for five ſhillings worth of labour, will charge their clients near the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pounds; and very conſcientiouſly take pay, for wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perverting and defeating a juſt cauſe. Here you may find gentlemen, who can procure witneſſes to ſwear juſt as you would have them, and pack a jury that can give a clear verdict, over the belly of the moſt conſiſtent evidence. Such a jury hath, ere now, ſaved a noble neck from the deſerved cord, through the all-ſubduing power of money. To this famous diviſion, belong the tradeſman, who will take more from an unſkilful buyer, than he knows in his conſcience his goods are worth: a thing very common among dealers. Alſo the wealthy gentleman, who, in buying will take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the indigence of the ſeller, and pay, if he can, leſs than the real worth of what he buys; this practice is now ſo very near to univerſal, that tradeſmen deal with one another, for the moſt part, as if they were all known
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:027249_0071_0FD3CF802ABA4350"/>to be rogues and cheats, and he is the beſt tradeſman, that can beſt guard againſt the villainy of his neighbours.</p>
                        <p>Here dwells the careful tradeſman, who if a man once owes him five pounds, would write down five pounds ten ſhillings. This method is ſo much in vogue, that many people dare not truſt their names on the tradeſmens books. As for my friend, ſir Rodger Latepay, he has had ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it, that his word is in danger. In this faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diviſion, dwells the tradeſman, who, conſcious that his own capital is expended, ſupports his luxury and grandeur, at the expence of his dealers; and many ſuch there be in town and country. The avaricious farmers, manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and houſholders, who make their ſervants, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanies, work under their uſual wages, from the prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

All of theſe, ſir, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> very faſhionable people.</p>
                        <p>The third diviſion is that of holy thieves. That is, men whoſe theft is in holy things. By holy thieves, I mean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy men, ſuſtaining holy offices. Such is he, who enters into orders, merely for the ſake of a good living. All who climb over the wall, and come not in by the door, are thieves and robbers. Thieves, becauſe they ſteal the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prieſts; for having no right to the ſacerdotal function, their participation of the altar, is ſacrilegious theft. Robbers, becauſe they make havock of the church, and deprive God's children of the food allowed them by their heavenly Father. Here dwell ſhoals of popiſh prieſts, and very conſiderable numbers of proteſtant clergy, of various denominations, as well as the total ſum of pagan and maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan muſties. His holineſs the pope of Rome, is indeed
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:027249_0072_0FD3CF816CAD64A8"/>preſident in this diviſion, for he ſteals the prerogatives of God, and applies them to his own private uſe.</p>
                        <p>The fourth diviſion in the canton of thieves, are thoſe whom we call the ſporting thieves. Such are card-players, cock fighters, horſe-courſers, and gamblers of all ſorts. I know of none of my ſporting ſubjects, but what will win if they can, either by upright, or inequitable means. Therefore with us it is an eſtabliſhed maxim, that the true gambler is the certain thief. Here too you may find princes, nobles, ſpiritual and temporal, and judges of every rank. Ha! ha! ha! how have I been ready to ſplit my ſides with laughing, to ſee an archbiſhop lay aſide his mitre, and take up a pack of cards; and the ſacred judge, after having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>The fifth diviſion in the canton of thieves, is inhabited by what we call fantaſtic thieves. A very contemptible canton this is with ſenſible people. Yet fooliſh as they are with their noſtrums, they make it appear, that there are people more fooliſh than themſelves, for they pick the pockets of the neighbouring cantons very cleverly. Here dwell your Daſſies, Godfries, Stonghtons, Fluggers, Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, James's, Turlingtons, &amp;c. Here the famous Mr. Mountebank is preſident, and Mr. Ardrew Arc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The ſixth diviſion conſiſts of plain honeſt high way men. Honeſt, when compared with many of the others, for when they are about to rob a man, they very honeſtly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Oh! Tyburn, Tyburn, thou haſt long groaned for ſuch men as theſe!</p>
                        <p>Here too are many venerable prieſts, who, by pretended pardons, diſpenſations, &amp;c. play the pick-pocket to great advantage. Much could I ſay about this claſs of veterans in the thieving trade, were I not afraid of exciting their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, which would be very detrimental to my deſigns, as they lead the conſciences of the laity, juſt which way they pleaſe.</p>

                        <p>Ay, ſir, a thouſand times, and I can tell you that, ſome of the greateſt of names are enrolled in the annals of this canton of thieves. There are the Grecian and Roman heroes, almoſt in general, particularly great Alexander, and Julius Caeſar. There is Tamerlane, there is Kouli Khan, there is Philip of Spain, and there is L—s of France, who has as good an inclination to thieving as any body. Poor gentleman, it is not half a century ſince he put forth his hand, to pick the pocket of George king of Britain, but he got his ſingers moſt woefully bitten, before he could pull them in again. But what is bred in the bone will never be out of the fleſh; therefore as the Engliſh did not take care, effectually to ſecure themſelves when they had it in their power, they muſt expect further experience of French theft.</p>

                        <p>One would have thought that, the Engliſh have had ſo many inſtances of royal theſt, from that quarter, that they would have effectually prevented future danger-from thence. Nor are our good friends the Spaniards leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the thieviſh practice than their neighbours; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Peru and Mexico, thoſe once opulent and populous
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027249_0074_0FD3EBF1CC6274B8"/>kingdoms, which now belong to them in the ſame manner, as the purſe of gold belongs, to the highwayman, who took it from the gentleman he murdered.</p>

                        <p>Ay, ſir, great thieves are abundantly more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to mankind, than thieves of a dwarfiſh ſize; tho' fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tyburn, and the places a-kin to it, ſeldom have the honor of uſhering them into the other world.</p>
                        <p>The third canton is the liars canton, a people with double tongues, and of the nature of an otter, amphibious; the great Belzebub himſelf is grand preſident here, but is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by two famous deputies, namely the artful Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and the good old gentleman at Rome. Of the two the latter is moſt in favour at court, becauſe, as Belzebub ſays, he is ſo very much of his own image; although it muſt be owned, Mahomet bears a very great reſemblance. All the holy fathers, my lords the inquiſitors, with their aſſiſtant familiars. All the venerable patriarchs, and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cardinals, reſide in the metropolis near the exchange, in the principal ſtreet, which is a ſtraight thoroughfare to hell. The biſhops of both ranks, are ſtationed next to them, and greatly facilitate the journey of paſſengers. The very populous ſuburbs are inhabited by the ſons of St. Ignatius; than whom, none are more excellent at the arts of lying and evaſion; and here too are abundance of friars of every order, who though leſs crafty than the jeſuits, are very diligent in the great work of deceit. In this country, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs and learning have arrived at the greateſt perfection, here are abundance of courtiers, and ſtateſman, beſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſls and deiſts, highly eſteemed by our people, for their learning and ſenſe.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027249_0075_0FD3EBF3462E7948"/>as a willow, and will turn any way with the application of a purſe of gold, a place, a penſion, or a peerage. When it ſerves their low and baſe purpoſes, you will find them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, but if the good of the nation claſhes with their ſiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter views, you may find them traitors, either to church or ſtate, or to both. Of this claſs were Bonner and Gardin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, zealous Proteſtants in the days of Edward the ſixth, and bloody papiſts in the reign of his ſiſter of ſcarlet memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To this claſs alſo belonged Sharp, the archbiſhop of St. Andrews, for it was not conviction but gold, that changed his ſentiments, from preſbtery to prelacy. All the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which my lords, the biſhops of England had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, made no more impreſſion upon him, than an arrow would have made upon a rock of flint; but when his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty came in a rhetorical manner, to preſs him home with a heavy purſe of gold, a coach and ſix, and a biſhopric, he was quite confounded, and had not a word to ſay for mother kirk of Scotland. Such court arguments as this, ſir, ſtop the mouths of many a patriot; lord C—m is a recent proof of this. Such was the force of his elocution, that it could gain battles, ſubdue ſtates, reverſe laws, and make placemen tremble, till he was unhappily confounded by a place, a penſion, and a peerage; and now, poor gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he has nothing left to gratify his ambition, but the melancholy reflection of what he once was.</p>
                        <p>There is another herd of court liars, (excuſe the phraſe, ſir, becauſe it is the common opinion, that of all vermin, court liars are the moſt deteſtable) who fawn like a ſpaniel upon every prince, that aſcends the throne, in order to ingratiate themſelves into his favour, thereby to make ſure of their own emolument. If the manners of the prince are ever ſo diſſolute, they careſs him as their moſt wiſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable monarch. Tho' he were as much of a daſtard as Sardanapalus, they will perſuade him that, he may vie with Hector for magnanimity. If he is a drunkard, or glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, they will flatter him with his temperances or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027249_0076_0FD3EBF50AA3E850"/>his luxury as a princely virtue, very becoming a royal perſonage; even if one half of his ſubjects be famiſhing for want of bread. Some of thoſe court liars will tell their prince, that it is no crime at all for him, to enter his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's territories, and murder twenty or thirty thouſand of his ſubjects, tho' there is really no cauſe given on their part, for the hoſtile invaſion. Some ſuch villains precipitated Louis of France into a war with Britain, which would infalliably have proved his ruin, had he not been well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended by ſome people near St. James's.</p>
                        <p>A truly patriotic courtier is a ſtrong pillar to the throne, but court liars, are the deſtruction of that prince whoſe ear they govern.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion, that a prince has need either to be a very wiſe man himſelf, or to have very honeſt men about him. Happy is that nation who has a wiſe and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Another right reverend courtier tells his prince, that it is allowable enough in him, on the Sabbath, after the irkſome

But if I become a moraliſt now, you'll ſuppoſe I act out of character. However, many have exhauſted all their wit and good nature upon the court liars, they are ſtill the ſame, they lie as faſt as ever for the ſake of money, eſtates, high places, &amp;c. therefore ſome people call them mercenary liars.</p>
                        <p>But many of the inhabitants of this canton are leſs ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and will very freely tell lies for a penny gain; amongſt thoſe are the travelling tradeſmen, who carry their ſhops upon their backs.

Reverend, becauſe in holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and liars, becauſe they tell my lord biſhop, that they are moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to take upon them the office of a deacon whereas they are moved by the hope of a good living, not knowing that there is ſuch a being as the Holy Ghoſt; and deeming it enthuſiaſm to profeſs to be moved by him.

                        <p>The fourth canton is, that of Sabbath-breakers, which is a very populous, polite, and opulent canton indeed. The far greater part of the nobility, and other gentlemen of rank and fortune, reſide here: they are too well bred to worſhip God on Sunday, in public or private.

                        <p>There is my good friend, my lord Time-lagg, a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the firſt diſtinction; he is ſo taken up through the week with contriving how to provide for himſelf, and his creatures, that he is in no condition to go to church on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, but chooſes ſome convenient part of it for an airing; either in the coach with my lady, or on horſeback with his conſin, 'ſquire Idle. Mrs Houſekeeper alſo is very cloſely employed in preparing tea and chocolate againſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.

The footman and my lady's woman muſt needs attend their maſter and miſtreſs, the coachman and poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion muſt guide the machine; the butler and groom muſt be within call, one to take care of the horſes, and the other to furniſh with claret or champaign; ſo that the miniſter is very little obliged to his lordſhip for finding him an auditory to preach to.</p>
                        <p>The London tradeſmen come up as near to his lordſhip's example as their circumſtances will admit of; their ſpirits are quite exhauſted with the fatigues of weekly buſineſs, therefore inſtead of leading their families duly to church, you may meet ſquadrons of them every Saturday night and Sunday morning, going to regale themſelves with a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's pleaſure, which conſiſts in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Then there is your Sabbath-day viſitors; very genteel people. The tea-table goſſips are much concerned here, and hear you may find hundreds of tables, the converſation of which is ſupported at the expence of the reputation of ſome abſent; for it muſt be obſerved that our goſſips are ſo abſolutely deſtitute of innate ideas, and are ſuch perfect ſtrangers to the affairs of civil life, that they cannot ſupport converſation five minutes at a ſitting, but by the help of ſlander. Hence ſome people have faid, that ſlander is the very ſoul of converſation. And ſure enough if you will pick out all the ſlanderous expreſſions from the converſation of our goſſips, you will have but a very ſcanty fragment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.</p>
                        <p>There are others ſo given up to indolence, that they keep great part of the Sabbath in bed, on a couch, or in the eaſy chair; theſe people are ſo exceedingly oppreſt with the weight of their own bodies that they can attend at neither church nor chapel, although active enough the other parts of the week; and yet they are good Chriſtians, and hope to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:027249_0080_0FD3EC00642A0A98"/>go to heaven when they die; and yet they ſeldom think of any thing, but living for ever, in order to which they eat, drink, and ſleep away the Sabbath. Theſe go by the name of lazy Sabbath-breakers, and all who are employed the whole morning, in preparing ſuperfluities for dinner, live along with them.</p>

                        <p>But there is another tribe againſt whom there is no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man law. I mean the thinking Sabbath-breakers; a careful, induſtrious ſet of people, eſteemed by all and known but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:027249_0081_0FD3CD8491CB5410"/>to church. No, he is quite uniform, try him, and you will find him all of a piece. Let the parſon chooſe what ſubject he will, the other ſticks to his text; ſo that it often happens when the miniſter thinks his auditory is collected, and the bulk of his pariſh appear at church, he is miſtaken, for the greateſt part of thoſe whom he thinks to be preſent are only there in appearance: their minds, their better part, being abſent on other occaſions.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, the parſon ſometimes thinks, that he ſees 'ſquire Folly and madam his lady, in the front pew of the right hand gallery: but he is miſtaken, for only their bodies are there, their minds are abſent. As for the 'ſquire, he is buſy chaſing the hare or fox, over all the hedges and ditches in his manor; and his lady is mentally at this ball, or the other aſſembly, or at this play, of the other opera; or perhaps ſhe is cheapening ſilks at Mr. Caut's, ſilk-mercer, on Ludgate-hill.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the merchant ſeems to be at church; however he is only there in body, his ſoul having ſailed in the good ſhip Bonaventure, to buy ſlaves on the coaſt of Guinea, or barter goods at Bengal or Malabar. The mercer, draper, and grocer, ſeem ſometimes to be there, but frequently it is an impoſition, for although their bodies may indeed be preſent, their ſouls are gone on a journey, to viſit their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers, or are left at home in the counting-houſe, balancing their books; examining their tradeſmen's bills, that they may know with whom they can deal to the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Perhaps iſſuing forth a capias againſt 'ſquire Latepay, a gentleman well known to thoſe dealers; or it may be, the ſoul is buſy, entering proteſts againſt certain extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant manufacturers.</p>
                        <p>As for the induſtrious farmer, you may well think, he has ſomething elſe to employ his mind, than either ſermon or prayers; for it muſt needs require much thought and forecaſt to determine right, where to ſow his wheat, where his clover, and what land to ſet apart for hemp; how to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027249_0082_0FD3CE45F978B908"/>diſpoſe of his young colt, and the grey horſe, who is in danger of loſing his eyes. And he, good man, hath found from long experience, that he can contrive better at church than any where elſe; and being willing to thrive in the world, he will let ſlip no opportunity proper for advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration.</p>
                        <p>But I can tell you, ſir, if the people ſo frequently put the cheat upon their parſon, he in his turn retaliates upon them; and many times when the congregation flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that, they ſee the parſon in and hear his voice from the pulpit, they are miſtaken, for it is only his body, his ſoul being attending the levee of this nobleman, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther biſhop, making his court for a fatter benefice. Theſe, ſir, are ſome of the thinking Sabbath-breakers.</p>
                        <p>Then there are the mad Sabbath-breakers, a ſet of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dregs of humanity, and yet by ſome means or other their impious practices are connived at, notwithſtanding interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all laws divine and human. Such are our pellet throwers in Yorkſhire and Durham, our foot-ball toſſers, who are ſound all over the nation; our leapers, runners, tavern-hunters, and all of every denomination, who exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves in any ſport on the Sabbath, are ſtationed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the mad Sabbath-breakers.</p>
                        <p>Laſt of all there are our religious Sabbath-breakers, a diſtrict that is formed of party zealots, and ſelf-ſeekers, both preachers and hearers. As for the former, their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is various, one man preaches the pope, another, preaches the councils, one preaches St. Dominie, another, St. Francis. One preaches epiſcopacy, like the great Sacheveral, another preaches preſbytery, as the only way of ſalvation. One preaches up mankind in general, and another preaches his own perſonal endowments in particular, but as for preaching Jeſus Chriſt, that is quite foreign to their purpoſe, and is therefore left to be performed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thus, ſire, you have had a view of the canton of Sabbath-breakers.</p>

Monſieur Friſſieur, who was our aſſiſtant, gave it as his opinion, that to come up to the very zenith of the mode, it was neceſſary ſhe ſhould bear an head as much as poſſible, in reſemblance to a ram without horns; and Mrs. Prude, my lady's woman, told us plainly, that Mrs. Pander, whoſe province it is to eſtabliſh female cuſtoms, had expreſsly declared, every lady worth above one hundred a-year, ought in a full dreſs to wear her boſom quite naked. My lady is adorned with excellent hair, but it will not ſerve her except it bear a look the moſt unnatural poſſible. Her ſkin, fair as alabaſter, we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to daub with patches, the colour of Belzebub's coat, as a token of her loyalty to the black prince of the nether regions.

Whether ſhe thought to endear herſelf more to him, by letting him ſee how well ſhe would reſiſt temptation, if any ſhould offer, or took it rather ill, to be under his tutorage, I pretend not to ſay; but mangre all his intreaties, ſhe would go forth, by herſelf, into a diſtant walk, to gather ſome delicious berries, for an innocent repaſt for her and her lord, at noon.</p>

He aſked her, if the reaſon why ſhe was ſo divinely beautiful, was not her feeding often upon the fruit of that ſo ſovereign a tree? The woman anſwered, "No, we have never ſo much as once taſted of it, but invariably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the command of our great Creator, who hath put us into this garden, and ſaid unto us, "Of every tree of the garden ye may freely eat, but the fruit of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of good and evil, ye may not eat, for in the day ye eat thereof ye ſhall ſurely die." To whom the ſerpent. "In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Did he really ſay ſo? Are you not miſtaken think you? Die too! why am not I dead then, I who have eaten of it ſo plenteouſly? No, no, you ſhall not die. That is only an empty threatening to keep you in ſubjection to him; for he very well knows, that the moment you eat thereof, you ſhall be like himſelf, knowing good and evil; no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be man and woman, but become gods."</p>
                        <p>The woman replied, "Aye, but my pretty creature, how ſhall I know that I ſhall be a goddeſs, if I ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to eat of that deſirable fruit." "Know! ſaid the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, you may eaſily know it, if you conſider that, if I, who was created only a brute beaſt, am by eating the fruit of this tree, exalted to humanity, you, who are more than half a God already, ſhall certainly, by ſo doing, be exalted to real divinity." With theſe words he injected into her boſom ſome ſeeds of my nature, which fermented to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that nothing would now ſerve her turn but to be dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Sagacious Belzebub, perceiving the uproar I had made in her mind, introduced all the train of real vices, which now infect the human ſpecies; ſubjected her wholly to his ſway, and ſhe as his inſtrument, could have no reſt till ſhe got her huſband's neck alſo faſt in Belzebub's yoke.</p>
                        <p>Thus was pride firſt introduced into the terrene creation, and thus was man ſubjected to my powerful ſway. Being brought forth in the heart of man, I arrived inſtantly at full growth, involved them in ſorrow, enveloped them in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                        <p>Why, Avaro, it was by the help of a ſhip, which he was taught to build. For this ſame Noah was the firſt ſhip-carpenter in the world, and although a prince, he was not above labouring with his hands. But it galls me to think, how the Almighty mixes mercy with judgment, for in this deſtruction which he brought upon the old world, he taught the new world the moſt neceſſary and uſeful art of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by means of which, he will ſpread the knowledge of himſelf over all the earth.</p>

I replied, "the clergy, the clergy, ſir, are ſo overgrown in riches, that they are hardly able to ſay an hoſpitable maſs for the dead, or even to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cheat and defraud people out of their money and ſouls as heretofore."

I was not afraid but my ſcheme would work to my mind, for I took him at the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Glad of ſuch an opportunity, he aſſembled the heads of the clergy, and demanded of them an exorbitant ſum, in the way of a free gift; a very genteel way of robbing the church indeed. The holy gownſmen, like dear children of their good Avaro, ſhowed themſelves as tenacious of their gold, as the paw of a lion is of its prey. They uſed every argument which prieſtly ſubtilty could invent; they lugged in both heaven and earth as protectors of their property; yea, they even told him that to command them to part with their money, was no leſs than robbing the Almighty, juſt as if the Almighty and them were partners in the trade of prieſtcraft. But clergymen have the advantage of all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in that, their cauſe is always the cauſe of God; although God, has in reality, nothing to do with them or it. They held both with teeth and hands, rather than generouſly to aſſiſt their ſovereign, though now become almoſt inſolvent. But you know the proverb, "The weaker goes to the wall;" and ſo it was with them. He being ſtronger than they, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and although their money came from their coffers

But I can aſſure you, the parting with it coſt them more real diſtreſs of ſoul, than ever the ſelling of their conſciences to obtain it had done. The ſorrow of the prieſts is for the moſt part a farce, but their ſorrow on this occaſion, was deep and unfeigned.</p>

And I am of opinion, that Louis having found the way to their neſt, he will take care, they be no more overgrown in riches.

                        <p>I will ſir, and you may obſerve that the fifth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is that of the adulterers and fornicators. Theſe are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into literal and myſtical. The claſs of literal adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and fornicators, are ſo faſhionable and notorious a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that a deſcription of them ſeems unneceſſary; and ſo very diſagreeable, that it would be offenſive to you. I ſhall therefore do no more than deſcribe their dwelling, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, ſire, that every individual of them is a very humble ſervant to your ſon Impiator. Their dwelling is on the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:027249_0097_0FD3EC1990E45B28"/>banks of a river, the ſource of which is in the court which runs through every part of the king's dominions, carrying the inhabitants along with it; and at laſt diſembogues itſelf in hell, where all adulterers and fornicators ſhall infallibly be tormented, as a proper counter-balance for their fleſhly pleaſures; where inſtead of women, they ſhall have devils; inſtead of wine, the ſulphurous liquid; and inſtead of beds of down, the boiſterous billows of Phlegethon.</p>
                        <p>Next to them are the myſtical adulterers and fornicators. By whom I mean, all that have any commerce with the whore of Rome, that old bawd with the ſcarlet gown: or in other words, all who have the mark of the beaſt, either on their foreheads, or their right hands, and ſuch who have this mark upon both.</p>
                        <p>By thoſe who have the mark of the beaſt upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, I mean the worthy preachers and hearers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian doctrine of the church of Rome; as alſo the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooped gentlemen, who believe with the charitable Italians, that there can be no true faith but that which they profeſs, nor ſalvation but in their community.

                        <p>By theſe who have the mark of the beaſt upon their right hand, I mean the practical papiſts; the whole bulk of the holy catholic church, and beſides them, all that do the works of the beaſt, after the example of that orthodox church.

In the firſt of which live the mental murderers, juſt upon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the country. They are a people, who, without juſt cauſe, are angry with their neighbours; this lambent flame they inwardly cheriſh, till revenge is begotten along with hatred, envy, and malice; with them, therefore, nothing is wanting but opportunity to deſtroy the reputation and life of the object of their hatred, with ſafety to themſelves; but very often it happens that their hatred and revenge deſtroy their ſubjects, ere they have an opportunity of avenging themſelves. The verbal murderers live next to them, in a very ſpacious country, becauſe they are very numerous. By the verbal murderers I mean, thoſe who withhold from the character of others, the good which they do deferve, and ſpeak of them the evil which they do not deſerve; or even the evil which they do deſerve, in a way, in which they would not wiſh others to ſpeak of themſelves, in like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.

Many you may find here, who, as the very worſt of ſelous, rob their wives and children of their legal property, to ſupport the moſt infamous ſtrumpets, who, like the horſe leach, are continually ſaying, give, give. Such men are ſure to find the truth of that ſaying. "A whore is a deep ditch." Here it is a very common thing to ſee the moſt virtuous women, ſo ill uſed by their murderous huſbands, that they languiſh and grieve under their affliction, till at laſt they die of a broken heart. No aſſaſſin ever better deſerved the gallows, than ſuch huſbands; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Among domeſtic murderers, live the parents who, for the ſake of an agreeable ſettlement, oblige their children to marry, with perſons whom they cannot poſſibly love. This lays a ſure foundation for certain murder, and brings the party to the grave in the moſt diſtreſſing manner.</p>
                        <p>But if covetous parents, would only conſider, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled marriage is worſe than a poiſoned dagger, pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, marriages are ſeldom happy, where the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not joined, prior to the matrimonial ceremony. Money may unite the perſons, but it cannot unite the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as appears in numberleſs inſtances: of which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate, dull and heavy huſbands, broken-hearted wives, frequent divorces, elopements, domeſtic quarrels, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided families, the natural effect of forced marriages are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
                        <p>There is yet another ſpecies of domeſtic murderers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at by the law. They are ſuch who, not only train up their children in idleneſs, but in luxury and wantonneſs. By theſe means, their ſpendſhrift ſons, if of high birth, are fitted to become robbers of the nation, when their own fortunes are ſpent; and if of middle life, they are fitted for the high-way, and conſequently for the halter. Nor is this method of training up, leſs fatal in its influence, on the female ſex, for it prepares them for the ſtews, or the ſuburbs of the ſtews, where gentlemens courtezans dwell, perhaps for theft, and then for the gallows. Idleneſs and luxury, is as rank poiſon to the mind, as arſenick is to the body. Many people indeed, lament the young gentleman's unhappy fate when he is going to Tyburn; but very few cenſure his parents, as the firſt cauſe of his untimely end, by the manner in which they brought him up. This is ſome comfort to us however, that though ſuch domeſtic murderers act with impunity from man, the law of God will take ſuch notice of them, as to bring them to hell, if their crimes are not repented of. To be ſure it would be more agreeable to us, to ſee them enter hell by way of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn: but the devil cannot always have his will.</p>

They never once deem it neceſſary to inſtill into their minds an early ſenſe of religion and virtue.</p>
                        <p>Many parents, if their children learn a little polite beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, do not much care whether they read the bible at all.</p>

I can tell you when ſuch a thing does happen, that we entrap one of the Nazarenes, it greatly encreaſeth the induſtry of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and bends them more than ever, under my yoke.

                        <p>No, ſir, I cannot ſay ſo. I'll tell you how the miſtake happens. We frequently have companies of thoſe who are called Nazarenes, it is true; but then the name and the nature, are two different things, all the world over. In order to bring true Chriſtianity into diſgrace: the great and wiſe Belzebub ſtirs up ſome of our country people, to put on the outward habit of the Nazarenes, join their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and travel with them, almoſt to the borders of the kingdom of Profanity, but not one of them can be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet a foot out of their own country. As thoſe people paſs along the road, in their own country, it is not much to be wondered at, if they do occaſionally try their hands at their old employments. But as for the real Nazarenes, I aſſure you, I very ſeldom meet with one, who has curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſo much as to view our land as he paſſes through it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when our ſubtile emiſſaries do entrap one, let me and my chivalry do what we can, we never detain him beyond a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time; when ſome powerful meſſenger is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="109" facs="unknown:027249_0108_0FD3EC2A8811A898"/>to do, make them faint under it; it would anſwer the ſame end: but, beyond all our power to hinder, Immanuel does ſome how, along with the ſtroke, convey ſuſtaining ſtrength. Yea, ſometimes, even makes the rod itſelf, in ſome reſpects, pleaſant, and at all times profitable to them. Ah! my ſon, we ſhall never be able to rob him of one of his own, for when he chaſtiſeth them with a viſible hand, he ſuſtaineth, and comforteth them with an hand inviſible.</p>
                        <p>But let us not be diſcouraged, nor yield the conteſt. Let us deſtroy whom we can, and let us diſturb, and diſtract the minds of thoſe whom we cannot deſtroy. Let us think of the great Belzebub, what atchievements he is daily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, notwithſtanding he groans in the yoke of eternal deſpair? And for your encouragement, my dear Impiator, let me tell you, ſuch is your care, to maintain a deſpotic ſway over your ſubjects, and ſuch is their attachment to your perſon and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that both you and they may be aſſured of warm lodgings in the palace of great Belzebub, as ſoon as this world ceaſeth to be the ſtage of action.</p>

                        <p>Sir, having already ſeen ſomething of its amazing effects, you may well believe it is very uſeful to me. By this partial glaſs, it is, I ſow contention, ſtrife, and diſcord, wherever I come. It is my cuſtom, when I begin my ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and intend to ſet people together by the ears, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:027249_0116_0FD3EC2B8E06BA90"/>each of them ſeparately; apply my glaſs to his eye, in the magnifying way, and as you ſee, it is ſo conſtructed, that it will turn any way. I turn it towards himſelf, by which he obtains a partial view of his own virtue and merit. Then I apply the glaſs the contrary way, and direct my dupe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his vices in the diminiſhing medium, by which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if not wholly, looſeth ſight of them. Having had ſuch a partial view of his own virtues and vices, the fool takes the former to be a thouſand times greater, and the latter a thouſand times leſs, than they really are; by theſe means he is ſo prejudiced, in his own favour, ſo far, that he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to quarrel with all who think not as well of him as he does of himſelf
<note n="*" place="bottom">A recent inſtance of this effect of ſelf-eſteem, the author met with in his neareſt religious connections, which he thinks meet to add to thoſe inſtances of more ancient date.</note>. Thus, I prejudice almoſt every man in his own favour, ſo far, that each looks upon himſelf as moſt worthy of general regard. From this, it is, that you may meet with a drummer who looks upon himſelf as more able to command well, than his colonel; or a catchpole, who deems himſelf fit for an alderman; and a ſcurvy attorney, who flatters himſelf, that he knows more than the lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the realm.</p>
                        <p>But for this prejudice in their own favour, you ſhould never hear of revolutions of ſtate, deſtructive wars, cruel aſſaſſinations, and domeſtic broils, amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſo grateful to us infernal ſpirits. 'Tis by this device, you will find one fool wiſer in his own conceit, than ten men who can render a reaſon. Yea, gentlemen, it is from the good opinion almoſt every man ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>h of himſelf, originally derived from the uſe of my partial teleſcope, that all diviſions and animoſities of every kind, and amongſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery people in church and ſtate do flow. Though indeed, the gentlemen concerned in religious contentions, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the world, that it is the glory of God, and the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the goſpel they have in view, in all their curſes and
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:027249_0117_0FD3EC5714D21018"/>anathemas, which they toſs and retoſs againſt one another; the vulgar take it for granted to be ſo, and therefore readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly join with their reverend leaders.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while, man being ſufficiently prejudiced in his own favor, I betake me to the following operations from whence all jealouſies, back-bitings, murmuring, evil-ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, &amp;c. ſpring. I put the diminiſhing end of my tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope to the eye of my dupe, and direct him thus, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the virtue of his neighbour. The inſtance of the oak, reduced to the moſt diminutive ſhrub, will convince you that a man's virtue will appear little enough, if at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, when viewed with my partial glaſs. So when the man with it examines the virtue of his neighbours, he is put to his wits end to find any virtue at all, juſt as you were to find out the oak: but he ſees, as he thinks, too much cauſe to conclude, that his neighbour is a very bad man. And if ſuch a thing ſhould be, that a man's virtue is ſo ſtrong, that it forceth evidence, even over the belly of prejudice, by its own native luſtre; its appearance is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from its reality, as the oak to the ſhrub, in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experiment.</p>
                        <p>Then I direct my diſciple to apply the magnifying end of the teleſcope, and to take an ample view of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's vices and deformity; and this he doth to the greateſt advantage; the two inſtances of a mole-hill transformed to a mountain, and a rolling ball to a revolving world, will convince you, how glaring any man's vices will be, when viewed with the magnifying end of my valuable teleſcope, Prejudice.</p>
                        <p>On obtaining this diſcovery, ſays my dupe, "Ah! how glaring his vices appear! when I ſought for virtue, I could not diſcern ſo much as the ſmalleſt of her traces in him; but now I ſeek for his vices, truly there is nothing elſe to be ſeen. Can this man be a Chriſtian? No, ſurely! If this be Chriſtianity, I will for ever renounce it." Thus, my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reverend uncle, I frequently perſuade people who are
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:027249_0118_0FD3EC5887DACDA0"/>really worthleſs, to deſpiſe, revile, and contemn thoſe who are in every reſpect much preferable to themſelves; to deny the character of virtuous men, even to the moſt virtuous of their day.</p>

                        <p>But for this inverting mirror, gentlemen, I could do but little againſt the children of men; for excellent as my teleſcope of Prejudice is, it would be altogether uſeleſs, but for the mirror: but by the help of this, the teleſcope per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth mighty deeds in favour of our government.</p>

By this mirror it is, that public or private reproof is not only rendered uſeleſs but even hurtful to the party reproved, and frequently prejudicial to ſociety. So very much are people given to examine all matters in our famous mirror, that it is almoſt impoſſible to point out one man in a whole county who hath wiſdom enough to bear reproof with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming patience. So that if it is an argument of folly, to turn away the car from reproof, or to harden the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt rebuke, theſe are brave days for folly.</p>
                        <p>By this wonderful mirror, I make even the preached word, not only uſeleſs to many, but offenſive to ſome: for inſtance, it ſometimes happens, that the preacher, as it is his duty, exclaims againſt drunkenneſs, at that inſtant I ſtep up to the drunkard, hold the mirror before his eyes; immediately he begins to view the parſon's conduct in a very uncharitable light, and as a guilty conſcience needs no accuſer, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it is himſelf that is aimed at. "Well, ſays he, I ſee how it is ſome ſpiteful perſon hath told him that I was drunk the other night, and he is wicked enough to expoſe me to all the congregation. Has he no faults of his own, that he can be ſo free in trumping up other people's failings? Cannot he preach the goſpel without railing againſt individuals?"</p>

                        <p>With all my heart, ſir. The firſt inſtance I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, was in the caſe of Cain and Abel. As for Abel, you know, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e was a rebel againſt our government, enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the banner of Immanuel, and bore arms againſt
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:027249_0122_0FD3EC62A9D9AB38"/>the monarch of darkneſs, to whom truſty Cain was firmly anached. Abel was well acquainted with the acceptable atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to be made by Jeſus of Nazareth, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to it, in all the ſervices which he offered to deity; his ſacrifices and ſervices were therefore the fruits of faith, and conſequently acceptable to God whom he ſerved. On the other hand, our friend Cain had no reſpect to the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Immanuel, but conſidered his ſervices as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving acceptance with the Deity, in virtue of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic excellence. Of courſe both him and his ſervices were rejected; for you know, whatever is not of faith, is ſin, and conſequently deteſtable to the Almighty. Abel offered his ſacrifice, and Cain preſented his gift; the one in faith, and the other without faith; the reſult was, Abel was accepted and Cain rejected.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as I was aware of this, and ſaw diſcontent viſible upon his countenance, I went up to Cain, and began to ply him with my inſtrument. "Let my lord Cain, ſaid I, try his brother's conduct in this faithful mirror; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he viewed it, and as he viewed, he ſaid, "Ah! now I ſee how it is,—he knew that a lamb, or kid, would be more acceptable to God than corn; he would not inform me, I ſuppoſe, leſt I ſhould ſhare in the bleſſing: Is this acting the part of a brother? I ſee now through all his pretended love, his whining advices, and hypocritical cant."</p>
                        <p>This wrought juſt as I would have had it. Then I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to view himſelf with my teleſcope, which he did, and thus exclaimed, "Why, I am a thouſand times better than my brother Abel! I have as much righteouſneſs in my one hand, as he hath in his whole perſon." Said I, "Now take a full view of your brother with this glaſs." He did, and as he looked, he ſaid, "My brother is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible creature I ever beheld. I wonder not now to hear him complain of his unworthineſs, as he does in his whining way." "Look again, I ſaid." Then ſaid Cain, "Why,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:027249_0123_0FD3EC3DF96AA390"/>Abel is ſo ſwelled with pride, that he cannot contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf." "Look farther," ſaid I: "Aye, replied he, I ſee what he aims at. He thinks I ſhall be his ſervant, and no longer his ſuperior as elder brother."</p>
                        <p>You know it is uſual for my worthy friends, Envy, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and Cruelty, to follow me in moſt of my enterprizes. It ſo fell out, at this time, that thoſe three diabolians were preſent, but none of them attempted to ſpeak a word, till Cain had viewed his brother Abel with my inſtruments, in a light the moſt diſadvantageous to him that could be. But Cain having obtained this view of Abel, up comes Envy and thus addreſt him: "Friend Cain, I am heartily ſorry for your diſgrace, and am grieved when I obſerve to you, that it is my opinion you will never be able to endure your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's greatneſs and proſperity, now he is accepted, and you are rejected. I am much miſtaken, if his ambition ceaſeth to operate, till he enſlaves you entirely under his yoke. I much fear that is what he aims at Now, my friend, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> you are the elder born, it is but reaſonable, that you ſhould be ruler; but for the elder to be ſubject to the younger, is what I would adviſe you never to ſubmit to." Then ſaid Revenge, if honeſt Cain will be ruled by me, he will make himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all the grief he has ſuſtained. To whom Cain. "I pray thee, thou ſweet ſpirit, which way ſhall I do it? Shall I burn his tents, deſtroy his flocks? what ſhall I do, to make myſelf amends?" Do, ſaid Crudelis, what ſhould you do? Knock him on the head at once: "Elſe, ſaid Envy, he will be an eye-fore to you all the days of your life."</p>
                        <p>Thus the matter was determined, and accordingly Cain took an opportunity one day in the field to murder him. In this inſtance, Abel's virtue and faith were conſidered as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious craftineſs; his ſincere aiming at the glory of God, and his ſelf-denial were by my inverting inſtruments interpreted pride and ambition. Deluded Cain revenged himſelf not according to reality, but according to his own jealous ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and groundleſs ſurmiſes.</p>

                        <p>To return to my ſtory. Young Joſeph, ſon of the deceaſed Rachel, was his father's favourite; and the fond patriarch, to evidence his diſtinguiſhing regard to him, clothed him in garments of many colours. This badge of affection ſat very uneaſy on the minds of his brethren, who, to a man, reſolved to teach future parents the folly of partiality towards their children; yet had conduct enough to bridle their reſentment,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027249_0125_0FD3ECBBB16D59D0"/>till a favourable opportunity ſhould offer. It was not many years, before an opportunity offered; for Joſeph had a dream, divinely inſpired, of which! made very ſuitable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He dreamed, "that he and his brethren were all reaping together in the field, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Young Joſeph, ſuſpecting no harm, in his ſimplicity told his dream to his brethren.

                        <p>At this time, I happened to make a viſit to them, and having the matter without reſerve laid before me, I requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to examine it with my inſtruments, as you know I am never backward when there is any hope of buſineſs.

"Vain youth, ſaid they, he can think of nothing, but being lord over his brethren: It is evident from his repeated dreams, his mind runs upon it through the day; for what people ruminate in the day, they are apt to dream of at night." Such was the ſenſe my mirror gave of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. Then ſaid I, Gentlemen, be pleaſed to ſurvey the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with this teleſcope, meaning Prejudice. They did ſo, and ſaid, "Did ever any body ſee ſuch an haughty preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous youth, as this ſtripling of a brother of ours is? It may be the young ambitions wretch feigned his dreams, the more eaſily to introduce his ſupremacy! He be our lord! Moſt he? His pride is boundleſs.

                        <p>Indeed! is it poſſible, that my lovely Impiator hath ſo far prevailed, as to make a reverend vicar drink till he is fuddled? Such a conqueſt as this makes greatly for our intereſt; for when the pariſhoners know, that the parſon himſelf was drunk in the week, they will pay little regard to his ſermon the enſuing Sabbath. Let him preach repentance, and reformation, with all the zeal he may aſſume, every heare will ſay in his heart, "Phyſician, heal thy ſelf." I always knew that you Avaro had large dealings with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the clergy, but not till now that my ſon Impiator, had obtained ſuch great power over them. What! and ſwear too: To ſee a parſon get drunk, or to hear him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely ſwear, would give joy to the devil himſelf, amidſt all his diſappointments.

Ah, gentlemen, were I but an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſpirit, I could tell you ſuch wonders, about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs of both prieſt and people, as would rejoice your hearts, and make you confeſs, that few devils have more aſcendency over mankind than myſelf, O! the young ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, who are training up for the miniſtry, are charming lads. It is but a few years ſince, a nymph, who had been under the tution of ſome of thoſe young clergymen, came to an overſeer of the poor of the pariſh, near a certain u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, and deſired to ſpeak with him. What is your will, ſaid he? I am with child, ſaid ſhe. I ſee that, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, but who is its father? Three gentlemen of — Hall, ſaid ſhe. What do you talk of three for, ſaid he, only one of them can be its father. Indeed, ſir, they are all three the fathers of my child, and are all willing to give ſecurity to the pariſh: and three very civil gentlemen they are, I aſſure you. I think, ſaid the overſeer, they have not behaved very civilly to you, ſeeing you are with child by them. O ſir, ſaid ſhe, they behaved very civilly to me, they got me to their room, and kept me there for above a fortnight, and all the while I ate with them, and ſlept with them, at free coſt.</p>

                        <p>I am ready to do any thing, that tends to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of our common cauſe; with a view to this I have already given Impiator ſome account of my birth and firſt enterprizes, and now for common inſtruction ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Having aſcended the throne of Infidelity, the firſt thing I attempted was, to lull men into a perſuaſion that I did not at all exiſt, and that there is no ſuch devil as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in being. When I could not ſo univerſally prevail in this as I wiſhed, I endeavoured to perſuade each of them ſeparately, that bowever Inſidelis might reign over others, for their part, he had no dominion over them. For, ſaid I, you have a good heart, and have believed well all your days. Although, as I ſaid before, I have conducted many of thoſe, who fancied they had believed ſo well in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, very ſafely down to the chambers of horrible deſpair, where they were very ſoon convinced, they had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved at all aright.</p>
                        <p>Then I endeavoured to perſuade the people, that the threatnings of God's law againſt ſin, ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a fancy, and, to ſtrengthen this doctrine, I thus preached: (for you muſt know, I have been a great preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in my time) "Look you, you timerous minded mortals; you may clearly ſee, that God hath created you, with all the paſſions and appetites that attend you, and can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he did this, with a deſign to prohibit the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them? No, ſurely! Could it be conſiſtent with the character of that God, whoſe goodneſs is unto all, and whoſe tender mercies are over all his works, to endow you with theſe paſſions and appetites, and then damn you for gratifying them? No, no, thoſe threatuings are exhibited only to keep your conſciences in awe; but never deſigned to be rigorouſly executed.—The law will make large allowances for the inclinations, paſſions, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the human nature; never ſear it. The ſoul that
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:027249_0130_0FD3EC69095B7E18"/>ſinneth need not to fear dying as the ſcripture has threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; and man ſhall not be curſed, though he continue not in all things written in the law to do them,"</p>
                        <p>Here, gentlemea, you may ſee my falacy, in dealing with mortals, for although all the faculties and paſſions of the ſoul were indeed eſſential to its creation ſtate, none of them were then irregular; none acted from i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Then I proceeded to perſuade them, that God had forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the earth, and took now no notice of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I perſuaded men that this world is the moſt certain good. A bird in the hand, ſaid I, is worth two in the buſh. Make ſure of this world, and never ſear for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Do you conſider this as your abiding place and build your neſt in its higheſt branches if poſſible. In this I ſucceeded ſo well, that every man by nature, and almoſt all by practice, look upon the preſent world as the chiefeſt good. Then it was that Avaro was born in our family, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>All this, you muſt obſerve, I did in diſguiſe, or rather in a ſtate of inviſibility; I dare not tell a man, when I wait upon him, that my name is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It is no manner of difficulty for me to lurk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived by them, in the corners of their dwellings: but I cannot poſſibly hide myſelf from Moſes the vicegerent of the Higheſt. He is a perſon of a moſt piercing eye, and can trace all the motions of ſpirit, therefore it comes to paſs that he and I, have frequent bickerings. Moſes being the perfection of light, and I the moſt conſummate dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is an eternal war proclaimed betwixt us, and we never meet but we are at daggers drawing.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes he comes knocking with a tremendous ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at the doors and windows of my lodging, as if he would lay the houſe in an heap of ruin, whilſt the people within, ſtart and tremble, at every thunder-clap of his ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Amidſt their conſternation you may hear him from without, call to them within, with a voice louder than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thunders, in the name of his auguſt Maſter, to bring forth the devil Infidelis, and all his train, to public execution. But I am always well befriended by the people of the houſe, who, for the moſt part, tell him that neither Infidelis, nor any of his train, live with them, and that his excellency muſt needs have miſtaken the door. They tell him, he would do better, to enquire at the houſe of Tom Drunkard, or Jack the ſwearer, where very probably, ſay they, that evil ſpirit may dwell.</p>
                        <p>This is often the beginning of a rupture betwixt him and them, for he is not to be ſo eaſily deceived; he ſhooteth his burning arrows, with deathly vengeance, in at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows againſt the people of the houſe, who I exhort, by all poſſible means, to reſiſt to the laſt extremity. Never did you ſee the warlike Corſicans exert themſelves with ſuch ardour in defence of their liberties, as my ſubjects in defence of my government.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="133" facs="unknown:027249_0132_0FD3EC6A9C8306C8"/>
Sometimes they ſo beſmear his heavenly face, with the filth they throw upon him, calling him ſevere tyrant covetous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, unjuſt villain, and the like, that he gives over the aſſault, and leaves them to my quiet poſſeſſion; then I take my ſeal, and ſeal them to deſtruction; for you muſt know, it is but in ſome places he exerts his unfruſtrable influence.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe obſervable, that, although my ſubjects will give Moſes a good character, while he keeps at a diſtance from them, every one, will ſight to the knees in blood, when aſſaulted by him, ere they ſubmit; ſo fond are they of my perſon and government, Sometimes it hath happened, that, by irreſiſtable force he hath broke open the doors, ſeized the people of the houſe by the collar, dragged them to the brink of a pit, called Deſpondency, into which he tumbled them headlong, and leſt them ſhut up in that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dungeon.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as he is departed, I go to work, and turn ſome neighbouring brook into the pit, with a deſign to drown them, or throw down earth, ſtones, &amp;c. on purpoſe to ſmother them; and ſo I continue to peſter, and diſturb them, till I am frightened away by the ſound of Immanuel's trumpet, as he himſelf approaches for their deliverance; for you muſt know, I cannot ſtand my ground, but take to my heels, when he appears. Many a time, do I hear my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf curſed for an helliſh brat, even by thoſe, who but very lately, would have riſked life and fortune, and with the greateſt bravery fought, in the cauſe of prince Infidelis: but as ſoon as they obtain a glimpſe of Immanuel's glory, they have done with my yoke, and I loſe their affection for ever.</p>
                        <p>However, as I cannot endure that rational ſcripture light ſhould ſhine in the hearts of men, I have often been puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled to find out proper methods to reſiſt the power of Moſes, for he is exceſſively turbulent ſometimes, and frighteneth my ſubjects into a pretended ſervice of his
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:027249_0133_0FD3EC6C06D999E0"/>Lord. In order to appeaſe him, the ſons of men agreed to build a temple, and dedicate it to the Moſt High; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſing to worſhip him, than be deſtroyed by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery of Sinai. Accordingly to work they went, and built a ſumptuous dome for divine worſhip, in order to ſtop the mouth of that never-ceaſing accuſer. Now, though I. things are likely to take an awkward turn with me; if this worſhip is not interrupted, I ſhall loſe many of my preſent ſlaves. So I put my plodding brain to the torture, in order to find out proper methods of prevention; and I can tell you, gentlemen, I went wiſely to work; you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that, Avaro, for you were my helper.</p>
                        <p>The eaſe was this. We prepared the image of a woman, fair and beautiful to the eye; the was inwardly made of clay, and outwardly adorned with the appearance of burniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gold; in her right hand was a regal ſceptre, titles of ſtate, and plumes of honour, &amp;c. In her left ſhe carried a heavy purſe of money, and a caſk of oriental jewels; upon her head was an imperial crown, ſtudded with ſparkling gems, which dazzled the eye of beholders, whilſt they read the following motto, which was written, in all languages, on her forehead; "I am the miſtreſs of the whole world." We ſecretly conveyed this image into one corner of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and placed it in ſuch a manner as to be ſeen of all who entered.</p>
                        <p>I ſoon perceived that the bait was ſuitably dreſt, and our idol had charms enough to attract the attention of the people. Ha — ha — ha, you would have laughed, till your ſides were tired, had you been there, to ſee how the ſlaves looked aſquint upon the idol, as they approached the altar of God. Aye, and in the midſt of their devotion, how they caſt the tail of their eye towards the place where ſhe ſtood. After their worſhip was over. O how they bowed and cringed, be before her ladyſhip; the very parſon himſelf did her humble reverence and many times embraced her in the moſt affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:027249_0134_0FD3EC6F63E164F0"/>manner. Then ſaid I, "A fig for Moſes and all his threatening, I have the ſlaves as faſt as ever."</p>

                        <p>No, no, he is none of your eaſy tempered people, I aſſure you: his eagle-eye ſoon diſcovered the cheat, and as ſoon did he reſolve on vengeance, as appeared by the event. Laden with burning faggots he came to the temple, and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like many thunders, he ſaid, the flaſhes of lightning burſting as he ſpake, "This people draweth near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; put away from among you that accurſed evil, and worſhip the Lord with your ſouls, as well as your bodies, with your hearts as well as your voices, or look for deſtruction even in the embraces of your idol."</p>
                        <p>This ſaid, he hurled his brands amongſt the people, and terribly diſturbed many of them; indeed it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alarming to ſee them ſo ghaſtly, and tremble at his fearful menaces. In their firſt alarm, they were for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the goddeſs out of the temple, for fear of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate deſtruction; but being a little recovered from their fright, the far greater part found ſuch relenting towards her ladyſhip, that they could not bear the thoughts of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her, believing ſtill, in deſpite of Moſes, that her comely preſence, was highly neceſſary, to render religion tolerable; and rather than part with her, they reſolved to part with the temple of God itſelf.</p>
                        <p>Some few of them indeed, were reſolute for her removal, deeming the urgent command of the heavenly accuſer, not at all unreaſonable, but their company was very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and their ſtrength inadequate to the enterprize: when they attempted to remove her, they could not ſo much as move her feet off from the pedeſtal; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the command was urgent, the far greater part of the people could not help, even in the midſt of their devotion: looking towards the idol, with an approving
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:027249_0135_0FD3EC73D4266AB0"/>countenance, and there ſhe ſtands to this day, adored by moſt, and a ſnare even to the virtuous and good.</p>

                        <p>Yes, Avaro, the times are not to be complained of; nor indeed have they been bad, for many hundred of years, if circumſtances are duly attended to. But to my ſtory. In proceſs of time, men became ſenſible, that, unleſs the heart was fixed upon God, in acts of religious worſhip, their ſervices could not be acceptable; but how to fix them they could not find. Being afraid, the reſult of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries might prove dangerous to my intereſt, if not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. I adviſed them to make to themſelves repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, in wood, ſtone, braſs, or iron, but rather of ſilver, or gold; alledging that the more valuable the metal, the more acceptable the ſacrifice would be.</p>
                        <p>The ſons of men no ſooner heard than approved of my ſcheme, and reſolved forthwith to put it into execution. Then ere you were aware every village was furniſhed with one or two god-makers, a ſet of artificers, from whom our preſent ſaint-makers in Italy, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. are deſcended; for modern times have not changed, but only given a different name to this craft, by which the popiſh parſons get their wealth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="137" facs="unknown:027249_0136_0FD3EC73D72EF3A8"/>
But, alas! having never ſeen the ſhape of God, at any time, they were obliged to form their images, in the mould of their own fancies, which being various, it came to paſs, that in one place, the inviſible Deity was likened to an old man, with a venerable long beard, graſping a bunch of reeds, which they called thunder. In another place he was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as half man and half beaſt; yea, ſo curious were the fancies of the artiſts that in one place God Almighty was made like a fiſh, in another like an eagle or hawk, and in another like a log of wood, and indeed ſometimes like a beaſt with four feet. So very briſkly was this trade carried on, that all who were able to buy, had in a few years, one or more god-almighties, of man's making, in their own houſes. The very ſame as our good friends the papiſts, have got almoſt every one, a ſaviour in his pocket or chamber. In the holy Roman church, you may find in every houſe, a Jeſus Chriſt of one kind or another, for there, there be many ſorts of Jeſus Chriſts, as golden Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts, ſilver Jeſus Chriſts, wooden and even paper Jeſus Chriſts, all made with as much craft as the ancient pagan gods.</p>

                        <p>That trade of ſhrine, making among the papiſts, is a good ſort of trade, but I can tell you it falls far ſhort of the craft of ſaint worſhipping, by which the prieſts get their wealth. Many a wooden ſaint there is in the holy church, which hath brought into the prieſt's treaſury above ſix times its weight in gold. And indeed the pagan prieſts reaped equal benefit from their gods, from whence we learn that prieſtcraft hath been the ſame in all ages.</p>

"We muſt not bow down to graven nor moiten images, nor in any wiſe worſhip them." My prieſts, according to my directions, anſwered as follows; "It is not the image which you worſhip, nor do you at all
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:027249_0137_0FD3EC750C8E4390"/>bow your knee to it; but being emblematical of the divine preſence, it greatly aſſiſts you in your devotion."

                        <p>Some few there were, rigid non-conformiſts, who inſiſted, that God muſt be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth; inſiſted that all idolatrous lumber ſhould be caſt out of the temple; by which the worthy clergymen of that age were ſo grievouſly galled, that they were forced, in a pious and tender manner, firſt to give up the heretics to the devil, and then put the fleſh to death, for the ſalvation of the ſoul: in the very ſame manner (and for much the ſame cauſe) as the holy Roman fathers excommunicated and burned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. But the devil knows to his ſad experience, that the church has not half the power the pretends to, for out of the vaſt numbers, which ſhe hath generouſly given to him, it is but a very few he hath been able to receive: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding both the pagan, papal, and other churches, have hereby ſhewn the good-will which all along they have borne to him and his intereſt.</p>
                        <p>Having fairly introduced idolatry, I tried, if poſſible, to lead men further off from their maker ſtill; and for this end I brought in gods and goddeſſes, a numerous train; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if any man was more remarkable than others, for murdering his neighbours, or for giving large gifts to the church, i. e. the clergy, I got him deified as ſoon as he died, and had worſhip offered to him, in the ſame degree with faint-worſhip in the church of Rome; for ſaint worſhip and hero-worſhip differ only in name.</p>
                        <p>Indeed it is but doing juſtice to ſaints, in the Romiſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, to obſerve, that the greateſt part of them obtained
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:027249_0138_0FD3EC7685487E48"/>their faintſhips, for murdering of princes, maſſacreing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, robbing their heirs, for the good of the church, or for raving mad enthuſiaſm. Well, I went on and proſpered, till I had brought all the world, a few individuals excepted, to worſhip the works of the maſon, carpenter, blackſmith, or founder. Encourage but any trade, and it is ſure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper: the god-making trade being univerſally encouraged, proſpered exceedingly; for in a little time there were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional gods, much the ſame with the ſeven champious of Chriſtendom; provincial gods; county-gods; pariſh-gods; and even houſehold gods, to the great emolument of the clergy.

Oh, it was a ſore trial, gentlemen. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, a very dear lover of men, having ſat on the circle of heaven, for near four thouſand years, with much relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mind, and longings for human happineſs, from thence beheld the dreadful havock I made in the world, rendering the whole poſterity of Adam the children of wrath. Often did he call to the inhabitants of the earth, to take me up and burn me for a witch but they were too much my friends to regard his advice: and indeed had they regarded, it would have been an undertaking ſuch as they could not execute without auxiliary ſtrength. He ſat long, and long, he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that there war no friend to help againſt ſo potent an adverſary; when at laſt he ſaw, there was none to help, he

                        <p>Alarmed at ſuch an unprecedented enterprize, I diſpatched our ſwift winged coutier with all poſſible ſpeed to hell, to inform my great father, and the infernal divan, of the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing event.

At this time there appeared one John Baptiſt, a zealous Nazarene and harbinger to Immanuel; he was likely to do great injury to our intereſt, therefore it was thought beſt to have him deſtroyed, which by thy means, Diſcordans, we happily accompliſhed in part. Perhaps, Diſcordans, you can give a better account of that affair than I, as you were more deeply concerned in it.</p>

                        <p>I do not know that uncle; but I am ready to tell you what hand I had in it. You all know the man, and a truſty friend of ours he was, as any in his day. You know he moſt inordinately loved Herodias, his own brother Philip's wife, and by the direction of our friend Concupiſcentia, he added inceſt to his adultery, by taking her to his bed. It was about this time, that this famous Baptiſt, the founder of the ſect called by his name, began his public miniſtry, and, fearleſs of man, exclaimed againſt all manner of uncleanneſs, for he was faithful to his commiſſion. Well, this ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere Baptiſt took occaſion one day in the following manner to reprove the tetrach for his lewdneſs; Herod, ſaid he, the God who made thee, hath for his own glory exalted thee to the tetrachical dignity, but far from ſtudying his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, thou acteſt moſt unworthily, and turneſt his goodneſs to thee into wantonneſs. Doſt not thou know that the ſame God who made thee ruler in Gallilee, hath ſaid, "Thou ſhalt not commit adultery," put her therefore away from thee; if thou doſt not, thou muſt expect that the Moſt High will mingle for thee the cup of his indignation."</p>
                        <p>I was then at the court of Gallilee, and did not fail to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Baptiſt's admonition to the moſt fatal purpoſes; I transformed myſelf into the likeneſs of a grave courtier, a form very familiar to me; went up to the king, and held my inverting mirror before his eyes, bidding him to take a full view of the matter thus: as my humble ſervant, he did as I directed, and immediately ſaid, "I perceive this field-preacher, this ſame Baptiſt, is an enemy to the Roman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and becauſe I am a friend to Caeſar he hath taken
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:027249_0141_0FD3EC798226B860"/>this advantage againſt me; doubtleſs to prejudiſe the minds of the people, either to the diveſting me of the tetrarchical power, or to the ſubverſion of Caeſar's government.</p>
                        <p>When I had brought him thus to miſconſtrue the honeſt deſigns of the Baptiſt, I held my partial teleſcope to his eye, through which he looked with great attention, and as he looked, ſaid, "What a preſumptuous wretch is this, to take upon him to reprove me? Me, who am his lord and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and can ſoon deſtroy both him and his father's houſe. Muſt Herod be reproved by this deſpicable fellow with the rough garment? Is it now ſo low with Caeſar's deputy, the tetrach of Galilee, that he muſt mildly bear the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of every ſnarling peaſant. No, it is inconſiſtent with our dignity, to let ſuch daring boldneſs paſs with impunity. If a courtier, or nobleman, clothed in ſoft raiment, had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a little liberty with me it might have been borne. But for this field preacher. This baptiſt, hah!"</p>
                        <p>By this time the great Revenge, that famous devil whoſe hiſtory is ſo tragical, thought it time for him to appear at court, and as ſoon as he judged it convenient, thus accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the offended king. "My lord the king, if your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuffer ſuch inſolence as this to go unpuniſhed, your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles will contemn you, every paltry prieſt will ſay, Yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der goes the inceſtuous Herod; aye, the very publicans and Herodians will alledge, that you are unworthy the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity you ſuſtain, and all will cenſure your puſillanimity, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch during inſolence paſs with impunity. Remember, my lord, that if wide-mouthed Fame ſhould, as is very likely, report the matter in Caeſar's ear, it is ten to one, but he will caſhier you, either for your reputed inceſt, or your want of magnanimity. Sir, for your honor's ſake, eaſt John into priſon." Herod was eaſily perſuaded, and John was committed to jail.</p>
                        <p>On mature deliberation, however, he was afraid of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to death, for he knew that the people had a good opinion of the renowned Baptiſt; therefore he lived in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

                        <p>Now there began a horrid ſcuffle in the tetrarch's breaſt. If he fulfilled not his oath, he thought he loſt his reputation with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I well remember theſe things, and the learned oration, which at that time, I made in the Sauhedrim,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:027249_0144_0FD3EC7E043ACF38"/>and now we are aſſociated in ſuch a friendly manner, I have a good mind to repeat it to you. You have it in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. "Hearken to me ye righteous teachers of the law; the virtuous governors of the Lord's inheritance, and I will unfold to you a juſt ſtate of the matter. You all know that the expected Meniah, ſhall deſcend from a virgin princeſs of the lineage of David; but is this the ſon of a princeſs? Is his mother a virgin, being the wife of a carpenter?" Here you'll obſerve how I led them off from the truth, by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appearances rather than reality; for Mary the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Jeſus, was actually a princeſs of the line of David, though obſcure, and actually a virgin when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, though after that the wife of a carpenter. Every circumſtance attending his birth, correſponded exactly with ancient predictions recorded in the Bible; tho' by the way, it was by no means ſuited to the expectation of the Jews. But to my very great mortification I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that, although the great men of the earth rejected him, the Angels of heaven deſcended to hymn their new born Lord. The conſtellations of the firmament, ſhewed forth the birth of the Meſſiah. Eaſtern ſages heard the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtars, and came to the city of Bethlehem, to offer oblations to the incarnate ſource of life.</p>
                        <p>So very clear indeed are the Old Teſtament prophecies, concerning this affair, that the generality of the Jews were, at that time in full expectation of the coming of Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah; therefore it required great addreſs ſufficiently to blind their eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and know him when he came, to which purpoſe my ſpeech was wonderfully adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "You know, and all the holy rabbins know, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued I, that Meſſiah ſhall come in power and great glory; ſhall break the iron yoke of Roman ſervitude from off your necks, and exalt the throne of David, his illuſtrious anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, high above the thrones of the kings of the earth, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his happy ſubjects dominion and great glory, ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:027249_0145_0FD3EC8203C170E8"/>to your government all thoſe who wiſh your deſtruction. Worthy aſſembly, ſaid I, you have choſen the great Faſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as your preſident and director; hearken therefore to me, and I will ſhew you my opinion, concerning your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Meſſiah, and his appearance among you. It is moſt probable, that when he comes, he will be born of illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parents, in the family of David; and when grown ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in years, you may expect to ſee meet in him, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of all great and good qualities. By his wiſdom and proweſs, he will rekindle the martial ſpirit of the Jewiſh warriors, leading the armies of Iſrael to glory and conqueſt, and his throne ſhall be exalted above all the kingdoms of the earth. You may therefore expect that when Meſſiah ſhall come to your deliverance, you ſhall ſee an illuſtrious prince, attended by a warlike retinue, breathing vengeance againſt your enemies. But can this be him? Could the Meſſiah, think you, find no body but poor ſhepherds, to be the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of his birth? More likely, if Jeſus had indeed been the Meſſiah, he would have made choice of your reverences for his heralds. Can it ever be ſuppoſed my venerable rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, that an obſcure perſon, attended by a few deſpicable fiſhermen, can have any legal pretenſions to the vacant throne of illuſtrious David? Or can it ever be thought that the ſon of a Galilean carpenter, attended by a few of the riff-raff of the people, is likely to reſtore the kingdom to Iſrael?</p>
                        <p>Beſides, continued I, let him be what he may, it would bring diſhonor on the princes of Iſrael, ſhould they ſubmit to be governed by the ſon of a mechanie.</p>
                        <p>Who knows but the coming of Meſſiah may be yet more glorious, and ye ſhall ſee the heavens open over your heads, he ſhall appear in the firmament guarded on right and left, by innumerable battalions of armed ſeraphs, with whom he may deſcend and ſtand upon the mount of Olives, before he ſhall make his triumphant entry into the holy metropolis of Jewry. Then ſhall he diſpatch his flaming ſoldiers,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:027249_0146_0FD3EC8417B04520"/>with full commiſſion to kill, deſtroy, and cauſe to periſh all ſuch ſtubborn Gentiles, who refuſe to ſubmit to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh empire, now become univerſal. Your enemies all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, great ſhall be your felicity and glory, for he ſhall reign among you in righteouſneſs, peace, and glorious proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, unto all generations.</p>
                        <p>To whom, my worthy rabbins, will he come, but to ſuch a generation of righteous men as yourſelves. Ye your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are witneſſes of your own righteouſneſs and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. None ſay longer prayers, none give alms more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly than you do. So great is your zeal for religion, that ye rob widows houſes for the good of the church. So pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous your example, that my life for it, it will be imitated by the clergy in after ages. Your wicked anceſtors fell very far ſhort of your piety, for they killed the prophets, and ſtoned them who were ſent unto them; but your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences, ſo far abominate their murderous deeds, that you build and beautify their ſepulchr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s. You may ſafely conclude, that you are the righteous generation to whom the Meſſiah will come. Thus I ſwelled their expectations ſo very great, that, when the real Meſſiah was actually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, they reviled him, as the worſt of Impoſtors.</p>

Great was the confuſion of the infernal brigades, when they ſaw their principalities ſpoiled, and Death and Satan ſo terribly handled: yea, ſo tremendous was their amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that to eſcape the avenging hand of riſen Immanuel, they retreated even to the nethermoſt depths of hell, and his ſcattered diſciples again reſorted to his erected ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. But the greateſt diſappointment and conſternation was, when we underſtood that after all our diligence and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exploits, we with our auxiliary prieſts, &amp;c, had done nothing, but what the hand and council of God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined ſhould be done; that by our ſeeming victory over Immanuel, he had for ever ſubdued us under his ſeet; and that all our hatred, envy and cruelty, was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed into our own boſoms; now deeper damned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I was much obliged to my good friends the Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Immanuel having in oppoſition to all the powers of darkneſs, finiſhed the work for which he came down to the earth; he triumphantly aſcended to his native heaven, to the primeval embraces of his eternal Father, and aſſumed all the enſigns of empyrean glory.</p>
                        <p>Soon after this the high feſtival of Pentecoſt drew on, and as I formerly attended at Jeruſalem, in the midſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands, who, according to the law, came up to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon that occaſion, not only from Indea, but from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions very remote.

But here was another ſhock my kingdom ſuſtained; for Peter the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, ſo very lately like a daſtard, impiouſly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lord with profane oaths, now filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſtood up in the midſt and clearly proved that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>eſus was the very Meſſiah, and upon this occaſion played off the heavy artillery of Sinia on the conſciences of my people, which was attended with ſucceſs ſo fatal to me, that no leſs than three thouſand were pierced through the heart at once, and fell on the field of action. Now it was that my evil apprehenſions were again alarmed, plainly perceiving that the artillery of the word was levelled againſt my perſon,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:027249_0156_0FD3EC90D040FAF0"/>and that the firſt end of the goſpel was the ſubverſion of my diabolical government. However, I drew up all the forces which I poſſibly could, in the hurry of that ſurprize, and had juſt time to give one general diſcharge, my ſoldiers cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out as they gave the volley, "Theſe men are drunken with new wine." It was but a poor oppoſition to doctrine ſo powerful, I allow, but it was the beſt that could at that time be made, for we were obliged to retreat in much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and leave the Chriſtian fiſhermen maſters of the field.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as we were a little recovered from the diſorder into which that unexpected misfortune had plunged us, I ſummoned a council of war, in which the ſelf-righteous Jews were the principal, next to our infernal train. I myſelf gave ſpecial orders, that ſome method ſhould be concerted effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to deſtroy the name of Jeſus; for, ſaid I, "If we let them alone all the people will believe in their doctrine." In this council it was reſolved, to raiſe an army of thoſe who were the greateſt adverſaries to the name of Jeſus, to whom orders ſhould be given to kill, deſtroy, and cauſe to periſh all who believed in this way, till the Chriſtian religion ſhould be baniſhed from the face of the earth. This army was raiſed, and the command given to Saul of Tarſus, at that time a mighty zealot for us, and who, for a ſeaſon, made dreadful havoc of all that believed contrary to the faith of the prieſts; for it ought to be obſerved, that the opinion of the prieſts, has been eſteemed true orthodoxy, and the only faith, in all ages or countries.</p>
                        <p>But here another ſad diſappointment and loſs beſel me, for as this ſame captain Saul was on his march to Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, to fight a pitched battle with the Chriſtians, it ſo fell out that Immanuel himſelf was taking a tour in the valley, to ſee how the pomegranates budded, and falling in with truſty Saul on his journey, unveiled his own perſonal excellencies to aim, and laid him under an immediate arreſt. As ſoon as

                        <p>Immanuel having the moſt tender regard for Saul, gave him a new name, written upon a white ſtone, appointed him one of his prime miniſters, and ſent him on an embaſſy to my ſubjects, to negociate a revolt from me.</p>
                        <p>You cannot conceive the aſtoniſhment the Jewiſh clergy were in, when ſwift-winged Fame arrived and blowed it abroad in every ſtreet, that Saul, who was formerly ſo zealous for our intereſt, was now become a ring-leader of the ſect of the Nazarenes, and was likely to do us more miſchief than all who had gone before him.</p>

However, to out my ſtory as ſhort as may be; after many hundred thouſands of the Nazarenes were ſlain, my ſubjects became weary of the war. By this time they ſaw clearly that perſecuting them to death only ſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their number and ſtrength: So that if thoſe reſtleſs devils, Malevolus and Crudelis, would have been quiet, they would gladly have dropped their weapons, and agreed to a ceſſation of hoſtilities with the Chriſtians.</p>

                        <p>Trying times indeed. For, notwithſtanding the fervent zeal of Malevolus and Crudelis, the many fore cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns they had ſerved ſo enervated their arms, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their principles remained implacable, they were even obliged to ſit down in deſpair of ever being able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the religion of Jeſus from the world.</p>
                        <p>But my fertile brain ſoon produced freſh devices; ſeeing many of my temples forſaken, and my idols without mercy thrown to the pavement, I began to think of other expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to impede the progreſs of Chriſtianity. I laboured to introduce Eaſe, and her handmaid Proſperity among the Chriſtians, not without hope, that when they were full they would forget their God. The better to favor this deep contrivance, I perſuaded the valiant Crudelis to ſcabbard his ſword for a ſeaſon, and leave the people of our hate to the poſſeſſion of their tranquility.</p>
                        <p>It was not long that this ſcheme had been put in practice, ere I began to reap the fruits of my wiſdom; for eaſe and proſperity wrought more to my advantage, than all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the devil Crudelis. When they were at eaſe
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:027249_0159_0FD3EC93C55BBFF8"/>from the laſh of perſecation, they were fooliſh enough to quarrel among themſelves, grievouſly bit, and devoured one another, the cauſe of their ſtrife for the moſt part being, who ſhould be the greateſt?</p>

                        <p>A very important queſtion, much canvaſſed, but never as yet reſolved. Had I been a clergyman inſtead of a devil, I had certainly been a great caſuiſt in this part of ſchool theology. Never was a point of doctrine more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboured certainly than this, and never were people more divided in ſentiments than about its reſolution, even from the great church of Turkey down to the ſmalleſt diſſenting congregation. The divines of the eſtabliſhed church in Turkey ſtands ſtifly to it, that Mahomed and themſelves ought to preſide over all the believing world. The doctors of France, Spain, and Italy, are as firmly perſuaded that pre-eminence is due to none but his holineſs and themſelves; and that all who are not of the ſame opinion, are certainly in a ſtate of damnation.</p>
                        <p>As for their reverences in England, though they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny no honour to his popeſhip, which really is his due, they will ſubmit to none as the leading prieſt but his Grace of Canterbury, and conſider that church which they are the pillars of, as the pureſt eſtabliſhment that the lower world can boaſt of. Others indeed there are who greatly queſtion his Grace's right to preſide, and therefore refuſe to bow to his mitre, and will have a pope of their own chooſing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to be enſlaved in their own way. Hence, although the reverend members of the aſſociate ſynod cannot in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſubmit to the corrupt governors of the kirk of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, all of whom they have long ſince recommended to the care of the devil, much leſs can they bow to a metropolitan, whom they call the image of the pope, they can very cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſubmit to the government of the reverend Mr. Adam Gibb; becauſe they themſelves had the pleaſure of chooſing him.

Thoſe revered-ladies, Proſperity and Eaſe, had not been long amongſt them, ere many who bore the Chriſtian name were deſirous of coming to terms of agreement with me; but upon this expreſs condition, "That in the treaty of amity betwixt them and me, it ſhould be ſtipulated, that they ſtill be called by the name of Chriſt, for it was now become ſcandalous to bear the name of another." This requeſt I thought reaſonable enough, and that to grant it would be no very great conceſſion on my part, therefore I readily agreed, and the treaty was confirmed. It is an invariable rule with me, that it is not very material whether a man is called a Chriſtian or not, provided I have but ſafe poſſeſſion of his heart: for names do not change the nature of things.</p>

                        <p>Yeſterday afternoon I was conjured up by Squire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>roadfield, to aſſiſt in the whipping of a poor man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to periſh with hunger, unluckily begged a morſel of bread at his door. But before I give you an account of the whipping, I ſhall firſt give your a ſpecimen of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's character.</p>
                        <p>Squire Broadfield is a gentleman and juſtice of peace. He is worth five thouſand a year, and that is enough to make him a gentleman, even if his father had been a beggar; to make him wiſe, though born a fool; learned, although a very dunce. Indeed, it muſt be owned, the principal part of his worſhip's education was had under Dr. Ringwood and Dr. Jowler, the celebrated tutors of his kennel. Their maxims he perfectly underſtands, and their virtues he has dopted; but five thouſand a year you know, makes the ſtudy of the kennel truly claſſical.</p>
                        <p>Talk you of Orpheus to him, his worſhip propoſes the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Ringwood to your conſideration. Do you admire the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:027249_0168_0FD3CDA8EEFF6710"/>ardour which flames in the Iliads; his worſhip ſays, no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic like the voice of Jowler. Tell him of the majeſty of Virgil, he'll bid you mind well the gait of his horſe, what a majeſtic creature he is. An emperor, ſays he, might be proud to ride ſuch another. Do you recommend the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſolid learning to him, he is in raptures about the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the chace. As yet he hath avoided the yoke of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; not that ever he was an admirer of continence, few gentlemen being more converſant with the fair ſex than his worſhip.</p>
                        <p>He keeps in his houſe a wanton train of overfed ſervants, the ſuperfluities of whoſe table would comfort the bowels of many indigent: beſides a pack of hounds, which devour more than ſerves to maintain all the poor in the pariſh work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. But this miſerable wretch who cannot work becauſe he is lame, and having no pariſh to flee to for relief, chooſeth to beg rather than ſteal, for which his worſhip ordered him to be ſeverely whipt by my good ſon the beedle, till be ſhall be made willing either to ſteal for a living or to die of hunger.</p>

                        <p>I am not certain that John Ketch, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of fatal character, had any hand in procuring the law for whipping beggars; but certainly it adds greatly to his revenue. Nor am I certain that it was made on purpoſe to drive vagrants from begging to ſtealing, in order more ſpeedily to eaſe the nation of ſuch a burden; but certain I am, it greatly helps to fill up the Tyburn chronicle. But what more, couſin?</p>

                        <p>As the poor lame fellow was confronted by the beedle, and was convinced of the reality of his worſhip's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent intention to have him well flogged; he fell on his knees, and implored mercy for God's ſake, and for Chriſt's ſake, &amp;c. promiſing that, if he might be forgiven this once, he would never return to theſe parts any more. He plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his indigence, his hungry belly, his lameneſs, his belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no pariſh, and every thing his fear could deviſe; but all ſerved only to harden the juſtice's heart the more. He ordered the beedle to take him away, and do his duty imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:027249_0169_0FD3EC384E709C08"/>The beedle ſignified to him as they drew near to the whipping-poſt, that he felt ſome relentings of heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; and that if he could only give him an handſome fee, he would favour him as much as his reputation would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. But, upon enquiry, finding that the old fellow was ſo wicked as to have no money, his heart became like braſs, and he reſolved to ply him throughly to the ſatisfaction of his worſhip.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly when 'Squire Broadfield and me arrived in company to ſee the ſport, there was the poor raſeal, whoſe poverty was his principal crime, tied to the poſt, and mangled with the cord, which the luſty beedle plied with nervous arm.</p>
                        <p>Oh! how his worſhip and me did laugh, to ſee the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, whoſe poverty was obſtinate, leaping, as his lameneſs would let him, and wrything his bloody back, as the whip was luſtily pryed about him by the ſturdy beedle; who, for his part, would rob, and ſteal, and do any thing, rather than be whipped by a truſty brother of the trade; yea, would act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>No, no, Impiator. I heartily wiſh there were ſuch a law, for then I would even quit my devilſhip to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come king of the beedles. If all beggars were to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the whipping-poſt, (as I know no reaſon why they ſhould not) perhaps his worſhip himſelf, and his reverence the parſon of the pariſh, would not eſcape a thorough drub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing. And yet, Crudelis, as my name is, I think the whip-beggar-law is very partial and unjuſt, as it lays hold on none but poor petty beggars, who would be content with bread, ſhins of beef, and table beer; whilſt others may with impunity beg, and obtain ſome thouſands a year of the nation's money.</p>

What are all the ranks of mankind, but ſo many beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars? Does not his reverence, the inferior clergyman, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do not the very members of parliament come hat in hand, and meanly beg of the corporation, having no conſciouſneſs of worth in themſelves? Do not the pliant courtiers ſue to the favorite for places of truſt for the ſake of the profit? Beggars all, beſides the ſtern patriot, a pelican which does not appear once in a century. But if their lordſhips, the noble beggars, and their honours, the gentlemen beggars, are to be conſidered as authors of the whipping-law, I ſhould have wondered indeed, if care had not been taken to exempt themſelves from its penalty.</p>
                        <p>The caſe ſtands exactly thus. If a gentleman, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant beyond his revenue, begs for a thouſand or two per annum, he ſhall not only eſcape with impanity, but obtain his ſuit, provided always, he will be the humble pliant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the miniſter; but if a poor helpleſs, low-born wretch, pinched with hunger, happen to beg a piece of bread in an interdicted place, he ſhall be exerciſed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>My nephew ſhall hear, if he will but have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle patience. The famous lady Proſperity and you, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had not been a very great while at Rome, before I found ſufficient encouragement to erect my office for vending ſacerdotal titles there; and I muſt own that for many years I had a briſk run of trade, till in fact the church had room for no more, from the great infallible prieſt at Rome, down to a Cumberland curate. The firſt introduction of this kind was a very brilliant medal, inſcribed with theſe five capital letters; P. A. T. E.

They were highly pleaſed with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, having never ſeen ſuch a thing before.

The great prelate heard with attention, and then rejoined, "Mighty Faſtoſus, if you will oblige me in this, you may depend upon me and all my ſucceſſors as faithful ſubjects; implicitly obedient ſervants to your highneſs, and your father Belzebub. Nor do I doubt but the reſt of the prieſts, for the ſake of power, will be equally loyal to you, and implacable enemies to Immanuel, therefore, your kindneſſes ſhall be gratefully returned on our parts."</p>

His principal care is not how he may aggrandize his family, but how he may beſt ſerve his king and country: for he lives not to himſelf, but to the public good. He adheres to ſtrict truth, is an utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to impertinent raillery, and perfectly deteſts the voice
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:027249_0179_0FD3ECACBB671F70"/>of ſlander. In his civil affairs, he does the ſame things to ſuperiors, inferiors, and equals, which he would wiſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in like circumſtances to do for himſelf. If at any time he is ſo unhappy as to give his neighbour juſt cauſe of offence, he is free and open in confeſſing his error, and ready to retrieve it to the utmoſt of his power. The title of His Honour is well becoming ſuch a man as this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his eſtate is great or ſmall, his birth illuſtrious or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.

                        <p>I am ſorry to ſay it, Avaro; but bad as the world is, there is ſtill many to be found, who with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety may be called men of honor: but it is well for us, they are moſtly of obſcure character. They cannot act the cringing knave, and vilely flatter their ſuperiors, in order to gain preferment. Their countenances, adorned with comely modeſty, cannot contend with the impudence of fools and rogues; therefore continue obſcure, even when the moſt worthleſs are exalted. But if a truly honorable man, ſhould by ſome miracle aſcend to an eminent ſtation, and be entruſted with public concerns, his country is ſure to have a nurſing-father, and not an accurſed ſtep-dame in him, as is often the caſe with other governors.</p>
                        <p>There is likewiſe, his reverence the parſon, a title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to many men, who lead very irreverend lives.</p>

                        <p>True, ſir, but it is the vulgar opinion that the reverence of the parſon does not depend upon his moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,

                        <p>I know it, Avaro, but it is a prevailing miſtake. Impoſition of the hands, even of an apoſtle, could never make any man reverend, whoſe doctrine is heterodox, or whoſe converſation is immoral, otherwiſe our friend Simon of Samaria might have been numbered among their rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Indeed, Avaro, were any man hardy enough to attempt it. I know of no ſubject more proper for ſatyr than the pretended reverence of the parſons. But he muſt be daring indeed, who would ſet himſelf to oppoſe the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox prieſts of the day, for that would be thought by many the very ſame as to oppoſe God Almighty himſelf, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body would cry atheiſt at him.</p>

                        <p>Very little, ſir; only that diligence, frugality and good huſbandry, go on as uſual. All heads plodding, and all hands active to get and to ſave; for getting and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is all the cry with them. I had a little matter to attend to laſt night, at the Swan-tavern, where there was a very reſpectable meeting of manufacturers, by whom ſome few things tending to promote emolument were conſidered. The firſt conſultation was, "How they might conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently leſſen the quality of their goods, that their profits
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:027249_0187_0FD3CD8BAAC40368"/>might be ſomewhat advanced:" in order to this a plan was propoſed by Mr. Dolus, a very great tradeſman, which was unammouſly agreed to by the reſt. The ſecond thing was to ſettle the prices, and come into mutual engagements, that no one ſhould under-ſell his brethren, which after ſome ſlight altercation was as unanimouſly ſettled. You muſt know, mankind are not ſatisfied with being oppreſſed by infernal tyranny; but to add to the devil's work, are got into the happy way of joining in combination to oppreſs and devour one another. Nor is this practice peculiar to any one ſet of men, but is common with dealers of every kind and denomination, from the opulent farmers to the dealers in coals and candles.</p>
                        <p>When this was done, a queſtion was put, How they ſhould finiſh a certain quantity of goods againſt a certain day then propoſed? For it ſeems they have large orders at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. To which one of them ſaid, he thought it neceſſary to advance the journeymens wages in order to encourage their diligence. But this gentleman's motion was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly rejected; as an unprofitable way of proceeding, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill ſuited to the growing demands of their ſeveral fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. It was then propoſed, that a ſmall premium ſhould be given to every workman who ſhould finiſh a certain quantity of goods in a limited time, then and there to be ſtipulated. But this was alſo objected to, it being alledged, that ſome method might be found, that would produce the deſired end, and yet ſave all thoſe unneceſſary premiums; which if given would introduce a very bad cuſtom.</p>
                        <p>At laſt an old gentleman, whoſe hoary locks ſhone as ſilver from under his weather-beaten wig, aroſe, and moſt judiciouſly addreſſed his brethren in the following manner: "Gentlemen, you all know that ſuch is the indolent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of journeymen, that in general let their wages be ever ſo good, they have no notion of obtaining more than will procure them a bare maintenance through the week, and a few quarts of ſtrong beer on Saturday night and Sunday.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:027249_0188_0FD3ECBD182248A0"/>Therefore to advance their wages, is the certain way to have them work leſs than they do at preſent. But let us leſſen their wages in proportion to our extraordinary call for goods; for by how much more we drop the prices of workmanſhip, by ſo much the more work ſhall we have done. A bare living they muſt have, let the prices be ever ſo low; and but a bare living they will have, if they are ever ſo high. If we advance the price, they work leſs, and if we drop it, they will, they muſt work more. I ſay then let us drop the prices."</p>

                        <p>Nor hath her neighbour, who is affected with a dun or yellow ſkin, leſs trouble and anxiety of mind, beſides her great toil of body. The waſte ſhe makes of waſh-balls, and the beſt recommended coſmetics, together with her own and her ſervants labour, in endeavouring to rub off the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tinct, is not to be conceived. But alas! it is labour in vain. All the comfort which remains for her, is derived from a black necklace, aſſiſted by two or three well diſpoſed patches, which ſhe hopes may in ſome meaſure over-cloud the hated yellowneſs of the adjacent parts.</p>
                        <p>So abſolutely fooliſh are they, that I have ſome ſubjects who ſay, "Ah me, why were my ankles made ſo ſtrong and fleſhy?

But certainly it is deemed to be ſo, and thoſe imperious dames, who have been favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their liking, do what they can to mortify thoſe who are leſs happy in their pedeſtals. Againſt this diſeaſe there is no effectual remedy. Small ſized ſhoes formerly gave them great hopes of relief, but alas! they generally made cripples of their wearers.</p>

                        <p>I have always obſerved, that, when people have applied to the artiſt, to have that mended which they think the Almighty hath marred, the puniſhment is connected with the crime, as a token of the juſt reſentment of a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, who hath left none of his works imperfect; and

                        <p>Another of my diſcipleſſes has got hair of a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der red, and ſuch is her folly, that it grieves her beyond meaſure. But with all my wiſdom I could never find out the reaſon, why red hair ſhould be any more ſcandalous, than yellow or flaxen locks: or how it is, that ſcarlet is held to be ſuch a courtly colour upon broadcloth, and yet ſo ſcandalous for a lady to have her head of a ſcarlet colour. But the lady herſelf is ſo apprehenſive of the ſcandal, that ſhe is obliged to exchange her native locks, with a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring barber, for a ſet of flaxen falſe-curls; theſe ſhe flatters herſelf will very well become the native fairneſs of her ſkin.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, indeed, to ſpare the natural crop, ſhe may blind the eyes of beholders with powder, which may help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the awful ſecret. The like expedient is uſed by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a coquetiſh diſpoſition, when to their great grief and inconſolable ſorrow they firſt perceive old age dying a white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon their temples. In order to prevent the world having any ſuſpicion that ſhe is advanced in years, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet procures a defence againſt the appearance of hoary hairs, and thus ſhe keeps herſelf as much as poſſible, from the belief that ſhe is growing old, till the deteſted wrinkles on her forehead betray the fatal ſecret, and then ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines faſter than other women, becauſe her grief gives ſwiftneſs to her decay. Another lady is exceedingly griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every time ſhe looks in her glaſs, becauſe, as ſhe thinks, her face is too much upon the fire to be deemed lovely; but ſhe comforts herſelf with the reflection that ſhe hath good features, and the great artiſt, when he finiſhed her has left a dimple in her chin. On the other hand, her couſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds a ſyſtem of agreeable features in her own countenance: but oh! the dejection of her heart, on recollecting the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

But alas her joy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently clouded with the melancholy conſideration, they are for ever gone.

                        <p>It is not altogether his hatred and malice againſt them, which excite him to perſecute them with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence: but it happened on a time, that Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub was by, when one of his heavenly heralds declared, <q>That in all the afflictions of his people Immanuel himſelf is afflicted.</q> And at another time he heard another ſay, <q>That Immanuel is touched with a ſenſe of human infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities;</q> nay, then ſaid he to himſelf, they ſhall not want for afflictions if I ſhould endure a thouſand hells. It will be a heaven of delight to me, to ſee my fiery darts bound off from the perſons to whom they are ſhot, and ſtrike him whom I have in the moſt perfect abhorrence.

But this was not the finiſhing ſtroke of my artifice, for when one generation paſſed away, you might always be ſure to find me with thoſe, who made their appearance next upon the ſtage of action. Hence I was found with the ſons of Jacob, and made them perpetrate deeds very unworthy of the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarchal character, and that even in the life-time of their father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The deſtruction of the Hivites by the ſword of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon and Levi, in revenge of Shechem's rape on their ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinah, was wholly by my inſtigation.

                        <p>That is true, couſin; but their firſt concern is not with Immanuel, but his holineſs the pope. Not about the favor of God, but that of his reverence the prieſt, who is thought to have all the orators of heaven under his influence. Therefore, thoſe that hope for favor with the inhabitants of heaven, muſt be very careful not to looſe the good graces of the parſon; for it is thought, that no man can meet with a cordial reception in the other world, but what brings proper credentials with him from the ghoſtly guide of his conſcience in this. But death is a wonderful inſtructor, and teaches the poor beguiled criminals, leſſons which they never thought of in life; and amongſt others,

                        <p>O yes, couſin Impiator; all are apoſtolical, if their own teſtimony is to be credited; all the Romiſh clergy are apoſtolical, and give it out that Peter the fiſherman was their great-graudfather. The church of Scotland is alſo apoſtolical, and the power of the twelve apoſtles is thought to have been transferred to the Scotch preſbytery. The independants are apoſtolical alſo, on account of the ſoundneſs of their doctrine and regularity of ſome part of their diſcipline. But both they and the north country clergymen labour under ſome diſadvantages; for the latter have loſt the deed of transfer, which conveyed the authority of the apoſtles unto the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the former are unhappy enough to be unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce either precept or precedent from the apoſtles for infant ſprinkling, which is notwithſtanding a foundation doctrine, and by them accounted Chriſtian baptiſm. The baptiſts; or as the independants and methodiſts reſpectfully call them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, you may be ſure are not leſs apoſtolical than their neighbours, having, beſides all the advantages claimed by the independants, the enjoyment of baptiſm according to the primitive inſtitution. So that no defect whatever, in point of a goſpel ſpirit, can hinder them from being apoſtolical.</p>
                        <p>Even Mr. Weſley and his preachers give themſelves out to be apoſtolical, notwithſtanding Mr. Weſley aſſerts that ſalvation is by works, which the apoſtle Paul denied. No contradiction whatever will hinder the teachers of the people from conſidering themſelves as apoſtolical. When I am uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attend the Sandemanian church after ſervice time, and divert myſelf with their playing at blindman's buff, I confeſs I could not eaſily gather from what part of the apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct they derived their warrant for this game; any more than for cards, ſkittles, attending plays and maſquerades, going to Vauxhall, Ranelagh, &amp;c. &amp;c. and yet this is the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:027249_0223_0FD3ED6168CE7110"/>only apoſtolic church in the world in its own eſteem, taken in its proper connections. However it is ſaid, ſome of the oldeſt pillars of the church having had their ſhins repeatedly broken, and the elders noſes having been ſmitten even to bloodſhed, they have laid aſide that dangerous play of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's buff, ſo very apoſtolical a few years ago, and have found out ways and means of becoming little children, leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and more becoming their infant capacities, by which they may ſpend the evening of every Sabbath.</p>

Moreover, I have heard him ſay, the archbiſhops and biſhops of the Engliſh church are the ſucceſſors of the arch-flamins and flamins, the eignitaries of the old Britiſh pagan church, prior to the days of Lucius. Now if they hold the honours and revenues of the pagan clergymen, how is it that they are apoſtolical? Is it becauſe the name is changed from flamin to biſhop, or how?</p>

They are lord biſhops; they poſſeſs great revenues; they are cloathed in ſoft raiment, and dwell in kings courts; they are too high, too polite, too dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to preach in a common aſſembly, or indeed in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than twice or thrice a y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the apoſtles were men of mean extraction, not Lords, not Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rends; plain Paul, Peter, James, &amp;c. they were contented if their revenues would purchaſe food and raiment for them; they ſeldom appeared among great men, in kings courts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than in quality of priſoners; they were willing to ſpend and be ſpent, in preaching the goſpel to all people, and on all occaſions; they had no carriages, no equippages; they

Thy miniſters preach for hire, friend, they take tithes and offerings from the people, and how can they then be miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt? I adviſe thee, friend Epiſcopalius, to conſider thy ways, and turn to the light within thee, then thy prieſts will let one ſhirt at a time ſerve their turn, and will no longer preach for tithes and offerings. Then ſhalt thou thyſelf be led to renounce the fartaſies of this vain life, and ſolicit neither for church nor ſtate preferment, but wilt content thyſelf with getting money in a way of trade, like our ſelf-denying brethren.

However, I have as much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what the papiſts, epiſcopalians, and every other ſect of profeſſors, diſcern ſo amiable and lovely in black, as to induce them to make it a canonical colour; and almoſt, if not altogether, eſſential to the miniſtrations of the word. No doubt they have heard that Belzebub is ſaid to be dreſt in raiment of the deepeſt black, and one would wonder they ſhould deſire their miniſters to be cloathed in the ſame uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, ſeeing they profeſſedly have declared war againſt him and all his principalities. Yet ſo it is, for any other than dark coloured cloaths upon a miniſter, would frighten an auditory out of their pews, and the beſt of ſermons would not be worth hearing, if the preacher were not inveſted in the ſacerdotal livery.</p>

But for me white would be thought to become the pulpit as well as black, and green would be as holy as grey. I call it whim, becauſe the greateſt of the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes, in ancient times, knew no colour which was more holy than the reſt; and the ſame cloaths in which the apoſtle Paul made his tents, ſerved him as canonical robes, in which he alſo preached the goſpel.

And in truth very few of them know any thing at all of religion, beſides that very imperfect form which they have adopted. But we are wiſe enough to keep our thumb upon that, for if the cheat were diſcovered, I am afraid they would be glad to embrace that part of the form of religion which they reject, in order to obtain the power of it, of which the far greater part of them now are deſtitute.</p>

                        <p>I can tell you, the quakers are liberally paid back in their own coin. And amongſt every fect of proteſtants hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto mentioned, you will find ſome who ſeldom or never look at the people called quakers but through my teleſcope. Were you by, when the quaker is examined by the reſt of the proteſtants, you would almoſt ſplit your ſides with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their partiality and unfair repreſentation. "Say they, the quakers religion lies all in their dreſs, ſpeech and money getting. Their religion lies not in the head, but in broad brimmed half-cocked hats —Not in their hearts, but in their coats.—Not in their actions, but in their tongues.— All their public meetings are calculated to promote the great
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:027249_0232_0FD3ED6D768C85F8"/>end of getting money and increaſing commerce; are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, but merely political."</p>
                        <p>By this you may ſee, that the quakers are abuſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied in their turn, as well as they abuſe and belie others. The above reflections are juſt enough when applied only to ſome, or to a great many of them, but will by no means hold as a general rule: ſeeing you all know, there is now and then a quaker who breaks away from his ſubjection to the god of this world; and deſpiting all that we and our ſable clan can do to prevent it, gets ſafe within the palace of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel. Moreover there are at thoſe public meetings ſome, though comparatively few, who have a truly religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in giving their attendance. From theſe things you may ſee my friends, that prejudice deals all in extremes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>That is a groſs miſtake, into which we have with great vigilance enſnared the poſterity of Adam. When a ſmall number only of any particular body of people, are found guilty of a certain evil, the crime is uſually charged upon the whole; and the precipitate injudicious concluſion is, "they are all alike." For inſtance, the Munſter baptiſts were once guilty of certain outrages, with which the whole lect of antipedobaptiſts are to this day very charitably calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated. And becauſe very many of the quakers are amazing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe to get money, and to keep it when it is procured, it is often ſaid they are all ſuch, and that Avaro is their lawgiver. Hey day, whether is the rule of moral equity gone, that the profeſſors of religion cannot ſet their eyes upon it? where is that candour and benevolence which the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion every where recommends, that you, conſin, have gained ſuch an aſcendancy over them?</p>

                        <p>By the inſtrumentality of theſe glaſſes, I got the preachers of ſalvation by grace traduced as Antinomians and the doctrines of the word of God beſpattered, as ſo many ſources of licentionſneſs. For inſtance, the preacher as his duty is, declares, "That ſalvation is not of works but
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:027249_0233_0FD3ED3689DD3CF0"/>grace," and may thus reaſon with the people. "You can do nothing that will recommend you to the favour of God; the Ethiopian may change his hue, and the leopard his ſpots, as ſoon as you, who are accuſtomed to do evil, can change your own nature, and learn to do well; for it is not of works of righteouſneſs which ye have done, or can do, that your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cometh, but merely by the calling of free mercy." I inſtantly clap my teleſcope to the eye of the legaliſt, and he exclaims, "What an enemy to good works, is this ſame wretched antinomian? According to him, we may as well do nothing, as ſtrive to procure the favour of God; may as well lead lives the moſt vile and profligate, as ſtudy to live righteouſly and holily; for according to this ſame preacher, our wickedneſs is as acceptable to God, as our moſt holy and virtuous living. Yea, more acceptable; for he declares, that harlots and publicans ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, ſooner than thoſe who do what they can to procure eternal life by their holineſs and good works."</p>
                        <p>Such is the language not only of the vulgar and ignorant, but of many who profeſs to know much of religion. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſelf-ſufficient Arminius is in the humour to try the doctrines of the goſpel in cry inverting mirror, and the preachers of them in my partial teleſcope, he very candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with great liberality beſtows upon them ſuch as the following reflections. "Theſe wretched Calviniſts repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the almighty God, as a partial and unmerciful being, who hides his goſpel and withholds his grace from men of virtue, wiſdom and prudence, whilſt he reveals himſelf to the moſt notorious tranſgreſſors. They ſay, that a man of a regular inoſtenſive life may periſh forever, when a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer like Manaſſeh, a polluted proſtitute as Magdalen, and a wicked oppreſſor like Zaccheus ſhall be ſaved. If this is true, then we had better live notoriouſly wicked, than ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, righteous and godly lives. What wretched, what dangerous doctrine is this? They make God to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin too; for they ſay that nothing comes to paſs,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:027249_0234_0FD3CD958A67ECD8"/>but by divine appointment or permiſſion. They talk alſo of ſome horrible decree, in which God is ſaid to have ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the things which are coming and ſhall come. No need of holineſs, if ſalvation is not of him that willeth; no need of diligence, if it is not of him that runneth, but to whom the Almighty ſheweth mercy. If God hath mercy only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom he will have mercy, and hardeneth whom he will, we may live as we pleaſe; for if to be ſaved we ſhall not be damned, what diabolical doctrine is this?

One man, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, will have it that Immanuel obtained his perſonality by eternal generation; another will have it to be by divine filiation; and another ſtill is content to believe him to be the only begotten of the Father, without attempting to explain how, or in what ſenſe he is begotten or filiated. All of thoſe three are firm in the belief of Immanuel's ſonſhip, his deity, and mediatorial capacity, as well as every doctrine of faith. And yet, ſtrange as it may ſeem, thoſe very men ſhall be ſo prejudiced againſt one another, that they cannot comfortably have fellowſhip together; but may even prove injurious to each others uſefulneſs: and it may perhaps be very difficult to determine which of the three diſcovers moſt of a goſpel ſpirit.

And a third is kept on the mount of enjoyment; his heart is kept warm by a ſenſe of intereſt, by which enjoyment he is active and lively in the work, a zealous promoter of practical godlineſs. All of which gifts ſeem to be eſſentially neceſſary to a goſpel miniſtry, and are all by the ſame ſpirit. And yet, would you think it, theſe very men ſhall treat one another as unfound in the faith in one ſenſe or other? The firſt is deemed a dead, dull and uſeleſs preacher, whilſt at the ſame time he is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

                        <p>Theſe quarrels are of great uſe to our government, as they fail not to reproach Chriſtianity, ſtumble the weak believer, and grieve all good men. But this is not all.

Theodorus heard Trebonius preach on a particular occaſion, found himſelf offended with ſome of his expreſſions, and thought it his duty to make the preacher acquainted with it as ſoon as poſſible. But as Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonius has too good an opinion of his own attainments eaſily to retract a ſaying, he vindicated not only the doctrine, but the mode of expreſſion. Theodorus was now more that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſuaded, that Trebonius was unfound in the faith, and was not ſatisfied with verbally defending the truths of the goſpel, i. e. his own ſentiments, but commenced a paper war with Trebonius. His apology for this ſtep was indeed artful, for he lugged in both Chriſt and religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to partnerſhip with him, and under their authority, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended authority, he did what he could to impeach the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, and mar the uſefulneſs of Trebonius.</p>
                        <p>When Trebonius read the performance, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aggrieved, and ſomething within him being deeply wounded he reſolved on retaliation.

<pb n="243" facs="unknown:027249_0241_0FD3ED242CAE1C40"/>of Chriſt nor the honour of religion had any concern at all in the ſquabble. However, having firſt ſet himſelf and his doctrine in a reſpectable point of view, he proceeded diligently to ſearch out and expoſe every blemiſh in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and in the end did as much for his brother as he before had done for him. Thus thoſe two champious for the goſpel, that is for their own honour, went on expoſing to the public, all they were acquainted with of each others weakneſſes and folly; never once ſuſpecting that by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each was expoſing his own want of wiſdom, and a true Chriſtian ſpirit. Mean while the friends of both were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly concerned, and in vain ſtudied a reconciliation between them.

From ſources of no greater importance than this, I aſſure you, moſt of the quarrels amongſt profeſſors ariſe. But when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is once begun, it is hard to ſay where it will end.

For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, about a century ago, the accurate Camillus preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an excellent ſermon at Potheina, which was heard by ſeveral of the people to whom Junius was paſtor; and they being greatly affected with the ſeaſonableneſs of the ſubject, and the practical manner in which it was handled, invited Camillus to viſit them, and preach in Junius's pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, not doubting but it would be altogether agreeable to their beloved paſtor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ll of the ſermon, when they came home they could not help making Junius partaker of their pleaſure. They expatiated largely upon the excellency of his method, the fertility of his illuſtration, and the propriety of his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, all of which they did not doubt but Junius would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire as much as themſelves. But this was not preciſely the caſe. Junius could not help being ſenſibly affected with what he had heard, but prudence forbid him to deny Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus his pulpit.</p>
                        <p>When retired, and reflecting on what had paſſed, he ſtrongly ſuſpected that his own honour was injured, by his

"My people, ſaid he, alledge they never heard ſuch an excellent ſermon as that which Camillus preached. 'Tis ſomething ſtrange, that this one ſermon ſhould affect them more than all my ſeven years preaching among them. I never heard them ſay half ſo much about any ſermon of mine. It ſhows a great want of affection and reſpect to me as their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, I conceive; and they ſhall hear of it at a time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient."</p>

                        <p>With Junius's leave I think he diſcovers a love of praiſe, which is by no means the offspring of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the judicious ſeldom think it prudent to ſay much in praiſe of any perſon to his face, how well ſoever they may be affected towards him; and that for two very good reaſons. (1.) Such commendation has not a little of the appearance of flattery, however ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere it may be in the party who beſtows it. (2) There are but few who are able to bear much commendation, without ſuſtaining damage by it. A man muſt be led deeply into an acquaintance with his own nothingneſs and inſufficiency, before he can bear to be praiſed and careſſed.

To his government they yielded themſelves implicitly, and almoſt adored the ground upon which he trod. With careſſes and ſavours they loaded him, till they had raiſed him to the very height of ſelf-ſufficiency and importance; from which they themſelves at laſt aſſiſted to caſt him down; and the contempt then poured upon him, pretty nearly equalled their former careſſes. After him they had another, of an almoſt contrary diſpoſition. He had but a very mean opinion of his own abilities, either for preaching or governing. He had ſuch conſtant acquaintance with the power of his own corruptions, that he was commonly low and depreſt in ſpirit. He never aſſumed any ſuperiority over even the meaneſt member, firmly believing himſelf to be the vileſt and moſt unworthy ſinner of the whole community; he ſtood in need of all encouragement poſſible, in order to hearten him for his work. Yet the ſame people who had deſtroyed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with unſeaſonable kindneſs ſuffered the later to drag on heavily all his days that from them he ſeldom or never heard of his word having been made uſeful. And I ſuppoſe muſt have ſunk under his diſcouragements, if ſtrangers who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came into the church had not been more free with him in diſcovering ſome degree of affectionate regard.

                        <p>Sir, Junius would have his own humour; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when the time came that Camillus made his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit any perſon attentive to Junius's behaviour, might eaſily find that his friend's room would to him, have been more agreeable than his company; notwithſtanding for decency's ſake, he forced himſelf to carry it to him with ſome degree of ſeeming civility: I ſay, ſeeming, for even Chriſtian people have not as yet learned, to be exactly on all occaſions what they ſeem. But Camillus is a ſagacious man, ſoon perceived Junius's coldneſs through all his formal civility and ſeeming deference. He began to queſtion with himſelf from whence this coldneſs might have proceeded? In what he might have given offence? But never dreams that jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy is at the bottom. Is he not offended with my doctrine? ſaid he to himſelf. What can be the meaning of this diſtant carriage of his? What have I done or ſaid that might give him umbrage? So Camillus reaſoned, but hit not upon the real cauſe. And as Camillus is ſomewhat fond of his own ſentiments, though a man inferior to few who are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good and religious, he could not help being in doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the orthodoxy of his friend.

                        <p>After all I aſſure you, at certain times I have hard work of it. I mean when Mr Submiſſion my avowed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and me happen to meet. This Submiſſion is one of Immanuel's own children, a very great peace-maker, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his buſineſs is directly oppoſite to mine; and although I hate him, I muſt ſay, he is one of the meekeſt perſons upon earth Never is he known to quarrel with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, except myſelf. And I confeſs, that in every ſcuffle hitherto, I have had the worſt of it; but I thank my ſtars, it is very ſeldom I meet with him. When we do meet, meek as he is, I am quite nonpluſſed, and am obliged either to flee, which I abhor, or to fall before him, which is yet a greater mortification to a ſpirit ſo noble as I am.</p>

                        <p>You have already heard how agreeable to his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs my inſtructions were, as alſo of the laws by which the whole ſyſtem of religion was inverted, and how the pious prieſt had inveſted himſelf with the perfections of deity. I knew that the introduction of this new Chriſtianity might be attended with ſome difficulty, therefore adviſed his holineſs, the father of the world, to deify ſome others as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but at the ſame time, leſt his ſupremacy ſhould be in any wiſe infringed, to take care that none ſhould be deified till after their death, and that only with an inferior rank of godſhip. He took my advice, canonized a vaſt number under the title of ſaints, and ordained maſſes to be ſaid to them out of his own newly compoſed bible: for the old bible in uſe amongſt primitive Chriſtians having its laws ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe of the pope, was by his authority made null and void, and Rome once the miſtreſs of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the mother of harlots? once more the ſeat of pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.

                        <p>In order to ſupport the Chriſtian pantheon worſhip, ſlaughter-houſes were built, and called holy inquiſitions; where every one who was known to deny the ſupremacy and in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>About a century after this, a very ſtrict enquiry after truth began, by the inſtrumentality of John Calvin and Martin Luther, two avowed enemies to popiſh wickedneſs. This revival of religion was very alarming to the prieſts of Rome, and very injurious to my government. His infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Holineſs inſtigated by the devil Crudelis, voted their immediate deſtruction by fire and faggot, by poiſon, aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination, or any way; for there is nothing dreaded by this ſame vicar of Chriſt, ſo much as the ſpreading of goſpel knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Theſe meaſures however I withſtood, having from paſt experience found, that coerſive meaſures are by no means
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:027249_0251_0FD3ECCF0E56B720"/>the moſt likely to reduce profeſſors of religion to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of infidelity; and I thought it better to ſend the devil Diſcordans to viſit them, with inſtructions to make them quarrel about the forms of religion, this I took to be the moſt likely method to invalidate the teſtimony of both, and to baffle and confound their followers. This was done, and they jarred exceedingly about circumſtantials; but do what we would, they ſpake of the doctrines which are abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, with perfect uniformity, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruſtrated our dark deſigns; and this fire of reformation ſo lately fanned, by degrees ſpread itſelf on the Continent, and in Great-Britain, where it aroſe in the days of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe.</p>
                        <p>The pope and me being loth to give up the government, we had always been accuſtomed to have in theſe nations, did what we could to ſtifie the reformation: but alas, it went on with rapidity in the days of Edward, and might have made greater advances than it has ever yet done, if luckily for his holineſs and me, that prince had not been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in early life. Mary being a princeſs juſt fitted to our turn, no ſooner aſcended the throne than I flew to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, accompanied by the devil Crudelis, reſolving at all events to cruſh with oppreſſion, all who rebelled againſt me and his holineſs. To this ſalutary purpoſe were tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the pope's arſenal, abundance of hempen cord and faggots beyond number, that we might oblige the people to renounce Jeſus Chriſt, and worſhip his Romiſh infallibility.</p>
                        <p>There were in thoſe days two luſty biſhops, right rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end tyrants in the devil, Bonner of London, and Gardiner of Wincheſter, who hearing of our arrival, came equipped in their prelatic robes, to do us greeting, and bid us welcome to the Britiſh ſhore.

                        <p>But when Immanuel beheld ſuch havock made of his church, and ſo many places bathed with ſanctified blood, his wrath took the alarm; in his judgment he cut down the zealous queen and her two truſty biſhops, and raiſed queen Betſy to the throne of England. Now the ſword of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was wreſted from the hands of the papiſts, and the good people of the church of England, did for the puritans what the zealous papiſts had done for them during the reign of queen Mary. This ſame queen Elizabeth, was a great zealot for high church, and a vigorous nurſe of epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but the Browniſts and other diſſenters, felt the full weight of her regal vengeance. I happily prevailed unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly with the divines of the eſtabliſhed church, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the more refined part of the popiſh ſyſtem; which thoſe men who were for a thorough reformation, both in doctrine and diſcipline, could not comply with; and for their non-compliance, we taught them that the arm of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy is every whit as heavy as that of popery, when it is exerted for the good of the church. And for my own
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:027249_0253_0FD3ECD2D48F5DE0"/>part I prompted their reverences, to coerſive meaſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very apprehenſive, that the reformation might have been carried on farther than it really was.</p>

"Well, gentlemen, ſaid I, do you intend to come to a thorough reformation then, and reduce Chriſtianity to its primitive ſimplicity?

Recollect, I pray you, how long your preſent profits and dignities have been enjoyed by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in your ſeveral ſees. Long before Chriſtianity was known in Britain; even beyond the ken of hiſtory, this nation was divided into the ſeveral biſhopricks and archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks by you enjoyed.

That were to ſhow, indeed, that proteſtant biſhops have leſs provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than pagan flamins. Yet, if you are determined to purge your religion from every relict of popery; your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, gentlemen, muſt be parted with, your revenues muſt be enjoyed no more, and how will this be reliſhed by you?" By ſuch ſenſible and ſeaſonable remonſtrances, I won great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the minds of their lordſhips, and in the iſſue it was reſolved, that rather than part with their dignities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, they ſhould ſubmit to many things which have no foundation in ſcripture.</p>

<pb n="256" facs="unknown:027249_0254_0FD3ECD4759A3E88"/>the diſtribution of the fore-mentioned medais. I went at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in my robes of ſlate, to deliver one of my archiepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palian medals to a certain prieſt; whom I inſtantly created "His grace and moſt reverend." He mumbled over to himſelf ſeveral times; "moſt reverend, his grace," view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the medal with the cloſeſt attention. It is—it is, ſaid he, a very ſoft and agreeable mode of addreſs. Moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend; his grace. Yes, my lord, ſaid I, it is very mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, and what I myſelf only am capable of compoſing. A mode of addreſs very becoming the dignity of an archbiſhop. Humble preachers, ſuch as Peter, Paul, Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But for a ſpiritual courtier, for the primate of a province, to proſtitute his name to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar mouths, would be highly unbecoming, would greatly eclipſe the honours of your elevated ſtation. "But worthy, ſir, returned he, you know this is a very cenſorious world in which we live, and ſome people may be wicked enough to ſuppoſe, that ſuch a title as, his grace, does not ſo well become a man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and I may be cenſured as ambitious."

Beſides, there is my lord duke enjoys the ſame title of addreſs with your grace; ſo that inſtead of being cenſured as proud and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, all ranks of people will revere you the more for it; eſpecially, as it will make you a fit companion for princes. The nobility will conſider you as their ſuperior, in as much as a ſpiritual duke is ſuperior to a temporal, ſo that in the church your ſeat will be next to the cardinals, and in the
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:027249_0255_0FD3ECD6F225AD50"/>ſenate-houſe, next to the prince himſelf. The gentry will faun upon you ſpaniel-like, in order to obtain preferment for younger ſons, and the vulgar will adore you as a demi-god.</p>
                        <p>I would farther adviſe you, to lay aſide preaching to the vulgar race, and apply yourſelf wholly to affairs of ſtate; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs called to it, may be once in ſeven years, to preach to the king and his nobles. "Ay, replied the the worthy prelate, but how ſhall I diſpenſe with the obligations I am under as a biſhop, to meditate on theſe things, to give myſelf wholly to the miniſtry of the word and prayer, yea, to be inſtant in preaching the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon?" Oh ſir, replied I, you need to be under no concern about that. "Surely, ſir, that is the duty of a biſhop, replied he." Yes, very true, ſaid I; the duty of biſhops, ſuch as were in the apoſtles days; ſuch biſhops as are appointed in the New Teſtament. But what has that to do with a dioceſan biſhop or an archbiſhop, of whom you yourſelf are the firſt. There were none of them you know in the apoſtles days; none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the word of God. And therefore the laws which bind ſcriptural biſhops to obedience, can have no manner of power over you as dioceſans; much leſs can a metropolitan, ſuch a biſhop as the apoſtles never thought of, be under any ſuch injunctions. Surely your grace muſt know that a lord biſhop, or a gracious metropolitan muſt have enough to do without preaching the goſpel. Yet if theſe things are not ſufficient to remove the ſcruples of your mind; and you ſhould ſtill have a notion, that preaching is a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on you, I can put you in a way to ſatisfy your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without abating any thing of your greatneſs.</p>
                        <p>"Pray, ſir, be ſo kind," ſaid he May it pleaſe your grace, replied I, it is neither more nor leſs than to preach by proxy, as people plead their cauſes in a court of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You know it is the ſame in effect, whether you preach in perſon or by proxy, ſo that your numerous flock have preaching enough.</p>

                        <p>Having ſecured both orders of popiſh biſhops, I took care to eſtabliſh deans, abbots, monks, friars, vicars, chaunters, prebendaries, canons, minor canons, &amp;c. &amp;c. From thence I proceeded to perſuade the higher orders of clergy, to encourage plurality of livings, well knowing that if a country vicar could but procure a fat and fruitful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, he would even imitate his betters, and preach as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as poſſible. I have often with great pleaſure obſerved, that if a benefice exceed two hundred pounds per annum, the poor vicar who enjoys it, finds himſelf very unable to preach, and is therefore obliged to hire a journeyman, to whom he leaves the bulk of his buſineſs. By theſe means we got curates introduced into the church; a ſet of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſold to ſlavery and inured to poverty, not for want of parts and learning, nor always for want of piety, but for want of what is far more neceſſary to preferment, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A journeyman weaver, watch-maker, or cabinet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, can afford a better table than many a gentleman, who lacks nothing but a patron, to make him equal to the very firſt of biſhops.</p>

Happily it juſt anſwered our deſire, and was not long before a ſharp conflict between the vicars and curates enſued; as it is not without a vein of drollery, I ſhall give you a ſketch of it. There was a certain vicar, who having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a living of about 800<abbr>l.</abbr> a year, called his curate to him one day, and thus addreſſed him: "Mr. Curate, I am now in a ſtation which will admit but of little preaching; I muſt therefore get you to take that part of the ſervice principally upon yourſelf; I am under the neceſſity of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neighbouring gentlemen, and aſſiſting them in their polite amuſements, as has been the cuſtom of my predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors for time immemorial; ſo that little of my time can be devoted to preaching or praying, and leſs ſtill to ſtudy and contemplation." Mr. Curate replied, "Indeed, Sir, I am but a poor bireling, whoſe ſcanty allowance is no way ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to labours ſo extenſive. I am reſolved, ſir, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſervices by my annual ſalary." The vicar's bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being ſufficient to raiſe him above preaching, and the curate's allowance ſo ſmall, that he could not afford to preach much, it ſo fell out between vicar and curate, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners could not obtain above twenty minutes preaching weekly, in return for their tythes, many dues and offerings. This you know was greatly to our advantage.</p>
                        <p>Another inſtance of altercation, between the vicar and curate, I well remember, which alſo was decided in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. "Hark you Mr. Curate, (ſaid a certain vicar one day to his journeyman) I expect you ſhall take the care of all the ſouls within my pariſh, upon yourſelf; as I have much buſineſs of a very different nature on my hands." "I take the care of them, ſir, (replied his curateſhip) what have I to do with them? I ſhall take no care of them, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you." "Well, but Mr. Curate, ſaid the vicar, I hired you on purpoſe that you ſhould take the care of them off from me." "Indeed, ſir, rejoined the curate, I will not, I am reſolved; do you think that for the ſcanty allowance of twelve ſhillings per week, I will put my own ſoul in the
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:027249_0259_0FD3ECDD5D652D50"/>place of your pariſhioners! No, ſir, let him take the care of them, who is beſt paid for ſo doing." "Then, ſaid the vicar, let my lord biſhop take care of them, for he is better paid than either vicar or curate." By theſe means the pariſhioners may go to heaven or hell, as moſt ſuits their inclination, provided always the fees are punctually paid.</p>

                        <p>Well, father, I really think thoſe curates were in the right; for as they receive but journeyman's wages for doing the drudgery of the buſineſs, it is unreaſonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more than journey man's labour from them. If they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the more ſervile parts of the office, for their ſcanty allowance, it ſeems but meet the vicars, who receive the far greateſt part of the profits, ſhould take the burthen of ſouls upon themſelves. If I am not greatly miſtaken, the far greater part of mankind, the vicars and high-prieſts alone excepted, are of the ſame opinion with me and the curate. However, that was all in the days of popery, and the church of England, hath ſince been bleſſed with a great reformation.</p>

The caſe was this: I ſet out one morning for Rome, to remove ſome ſcruples which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the mind of his holineſs, the father of the world; but paſſing by parſon Out-and-in's garden, I beheld the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend gentleman in his morning gown and velvet cap, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlow and penſive, to all appearance in a dejected manner. Charity bid me ſtop and relieve the thoughtful divine. At her command I ſtopped, and called: So—ho, Mr. Out-and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; how do you do? The good gentleman awaking as from a trance, erected his body into a perpendicular poſture, puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the ſnout of his cap from over his eyes, and finding it was me who called, inſtantly replied.

We have long been ſtudying how to ſuppreſs this fanaticiſm, and to promote the more conſiſtent doctrine of ſalvation by our own works, and the liberty and freedom of our own will to perform perfect righteouſneſs. It is intolerable, ſir, to hear men of virtue and piety, placed on a level with vile publicans and ſinners, who know not the law, and are therefore accurſed. Impious in the higheſt degree, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the benevolent Deity will not reward our good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to pleaſe him, by working out our own ſalvation, without truſting in the righteouſneſs of another."</p>
                        <p>To be ſure, ſaid I, to gentlemen of virtue and goodneſs, it muſt be very mortifying to ſubmit to be levelled with thoſe who work not, but believe in him who juſtifieth the ungodly. Very trying, indeed, to own one's ſelf to be an hell-deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner, when your own reaſon bears witneſs, that you deſerve the ineſtimable bleſſings of everlaſting happineſs, for your own perſonal goodneſs. What man of virtue and moral goodneſs, what gentleman of a clear head and good heart, like yourſelf, can bear to be told, that harlots and publicans ſhall enter the kingdom of heaven ſooner than you? I wonder not, my worthy ſir, that the preaching of ſalvation by the works of another, ſhould be a ſtone of perpetual ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and a rock of invincible offence to you. And this offence will never be removed, till we can ſo manage it, that this ſame book called Scripture, is made to truckle to the more conſiſtent dictates of human reaſon; by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the authenticity of doctrine ought to be atteſted, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondently of any records whatever, either ancient or modern.</p>
                        <p>I myſelf have beheld the preaching of the croſs of Chriſt, with a great deal of uneaſineſs; but for ſeeing the ſelf-righteous Jews break their bones by ſtumbling upon it, and the wiſe philoſophic Grecians turning merry-andrews, and laughing at it as ſooliſhneſs, I ſhould certainly have ſunk into deſpair: becauſe I was unhappy enough to ſee it prove
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:027249_0262_0FD3ECE596C63B10"/>both the power of God, and the wiſdom of God, to thoſe who felt themſelves actually in a periſhing condition. But my good Mr. Out-and-in, permit me to tell you, that whatever pain I endure on account of a preached goſpel, I can do nothing that will effectually prevent it, without the concurrence of the clergy. By the way, let me not ſo much as hint any defection of the clergy. No, ſir, I thank my auſpicious ſtars, by far the greateſt part of them are upon the right ſide of the queſtion. There are but few, very few, who preach thoſe enthuſiaſtic doctrines, with which the articles, homilies, and rubric are ſtuffed; very few who concern themſelves about what is, or what is not, the doctrine of the bible.</p>
                        <p>But, to the matter of your troubles, ſir, I apprehend they may be reduced to theſe two heads only: To ſuppreſs the growth of fanaticiſm on the one hand, and ſecure to yourſelves the patrimony of the church on the other. "Theſe are all, returned he, if we can but accompliſh theſe, we deſire no more." Then, ſir, if no more is aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, I ſhall put you in a way by which you may-accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh them.</p>
                        <p>Obſerve me then, my good friend Mr. Out-and-in, the firſt thing to be done, is, to draw as thick a vail as poſſible over the perſonal excellencies, grace, and righteouſneſs of Immanuel; for theſe, wherever they are preached, have a tendency to eclipſe all human glory, and greatly to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the profits of the altar; which you know are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal things that ought to be advanced. The holy trade of prieſtcraft can never proſper, but in proportion to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the doctrine of the croſs. Yet this muſt be done with caution, leſt the eyes of the people ſhould be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the propagation of your rational religion be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The important queſtion then is, "How you may retain the character and authority of Chriſt's ambaſſadors, whilſt at the ſame time you are labouring to extirpate the doctrine of ſalvation by his blood, from the rational world;
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:027249_0263_0FD3ECE95037E2D0"/>as you cannot expect to be ſo much regarded by the people, if ever you loſe your claim to ambaſſadorſhip. Of this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt be very cautious, and by no means declare yourſelves avowed enemies to the goſpel in ſo many expreſs words.</p>
                        <p>No, ſir, you muſt find out the moſt glorious names which poſſibly can be aſcribed to the Son of God, yet ſuch names as do not imply his perſonal divinity; theſe would ſpoil your ſcheme, and therefore muſt be rejected. For inſtance, you muſt not call him Immanuel, the mighty God, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father, God manifeſted in the fleſh, Jeſus Chriſt, yeſterday, to day and for-ever the ſame; Alpha and Omega, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe and ſuch like names muſt abſolutely be laid aſide, for they make directly againſt the rational ſcheme. On the other hand, you muſt be equally careful not to ſpeak ſlightly of his perſon, name, and authority, by barefacedly calling him, but a man like yourſelves, as Doctor Prieſtley has precipitately done; and by ſo doing betrayed the cauſe of rational religion into the hands of the orthodox, to be mangled and tortured after the manner of that wicked Shaver. In ſhort you muſt conſider, that the people are not all rational alike, and therefore a downright denial of the Godhead of Chriſt may be attended with very ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. Some people are ſirmly attached to the Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian creed, merely out of deference to the judgment of their anceſtors; and others are as firmly attached to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from an inward conviction of their divine propriety; ſo that without the greateſt care you may be baffled in your very firſt attempts to promulgate your rational religion.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, ſir, notwithſtanding you believe him to be but man like yourſelf, or at moſt but a dignified creature, you muſt of neceſſity, for fear of the populace, give him a kind of ſuffragan deity or deputed Godhead, like that of Mars or Mercury, in the pagan theology. Your friend Mr. Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a man of deep intelligence, has ſhewn you what may
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:027249_0264_0FD3ECE954333808"/>be done in this way; do you, my good Mr. Out-and-in, imitate the ſame Homer-like miniſter
<note n="†" place="bottom">Homer-like miniſter. Homer was a wonderful creator of gods and goddeſſes, and ſo was Mr. Whiſton, from his own account of the Trinity, which he makes to conſiſt of one uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and two created Gods.</note>. To be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, you muſt never omit when you ſpeak of him, to uſe great and ſwelling words of ſeeming reſpect, as if you had the moſt profound veneration for his perſon; call him the only Son of the moſt high God—the firſt-born, and moſt exalted of creatures—a being far above men and angels— under God, the great diſpenſer of all things, both in earth and heaven. Not a ſyllable of his meaſuring the ſeas in the hollow of his hand; of his meting out heaven with the ſpan; of his comprehending the duſt of the earth in a meaſure; weighing the mountains in ſcales, and the hills in a balance; or of his taking up the iſles as a very little thing. That is a deſcription of Jeſus, moſt adverſe to what you would have thought to be rational religion, which conſiders him as no more than a man like yourſelves; it is good therefore that ſuch deſcriptions ſhould never be quoted. By keeping cloſe to thoſe appellations which are proper to him, only as man and mediator, you will vail his real perſonal dignity, and in time your audience will quite forget all their old orthodox notions, concerning the proper deity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which at preſent are ſo very offenſive to you and your brethren.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When you happen to hear of any man, who is a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and diligent preacher of Chriſt crucified, as the only foundation of the ſinner's hope, you muſt look to it that ſomething be ſpeedily done, to prevent his ſucceſs, for ſuch a man is capable of being very injurious to us and our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional religion. His followers will conſider you as no better than birelings, mercenary prieſts, and enemies to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of ſalvation. Therefore you muſt, but always with the greateſt art, attack his character. Stigmatize him with
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:027249_0265_0FD3ECEBEC64D288"/>ſuch names of reproach as you think will be moſt likely to take with the vulgar. However you muſt be aware of touching his moral character, for that will be like the body of Achilles, invulnerable even to malice itſelf. His religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous character, becauſe leſs underſtood by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will be more eaſily injured, and therefore the moſt proper object of your attacks.</p>
                        <p>You may call him an enthuſiaſt, which is a name under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by very few; therefore the greateſt part of the people will conſider him as ſome outlandiſh monſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, and avoid him as they would ſhun the path of a crocodile. Or you may call him a methodiſt; this alſo is a name well calculated to excite popular abhorrence, as you know many would rather chooſe to be papiſts than methodiſts. Or you may call him an anabaptiſt, or fanatic. In ſhort you may dreſs him in what names you think will moſt effectually ſtir up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bait him as they would do a bull or a bear from the foreſt; and ſo far as your influence goes, you may totally prevent his uſefulneſs; which you know will be a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to the devil, and to rational religion.</p>
                        <p>But my good Mr. Out-and-in, take care that you be not too bare-ſaced in your ſlanders, as Doctor Prieſtely has been in his againſt the orthodox diſſenters. His zeal for rational religion is ſo furious, that it prompted him to rend the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, which ought by all means to have concealed his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred of the orthodox. This however he has thought proper to diſcover in ſuch a manner, that his word in a way of ſlander, will now ſcarcely be taken by any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo that even the rationals themſelves are aſhamed of his raſhneſs. But you, my friend, may avail yourſelf of his miſcarriage, and avoid the rock upon which he foundered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der full ſail, by conſidering that, amongſt the laity there are always to be found a diſcerning few, whoſe penetration may be too keen for a flimſy diſguiſe. Now, ſhould your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice be detected, your very reproaches would bring him proſelytes, as in the caſe of Dr. Trapp, of crabbed memory,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:027249_0266_0FD3ED05C54B1270"/>and the late Mr. Whitefield, Therefore let all your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches ſeem to flow rather from pity than malice. Do not fail to commend ſomething of the good that is in him; this will be an excellent cloke, from under which you may with the greater freedom ſhoot your arrows of calumny. For example, when his name is mentioned in company, you may ſay, "He is a good ſort of man, I believe; but I am ſorry for him, poor man, he hath imbibed ſad enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic principles. The poor weak, well meaning man would do good if he could, I believe, but is ſadly led away by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſtical notions." Sir, there are a thouſand ways of vending ſcandal with ſeeming pity, which ſome people are perfect maſters of; but your divines are too warm, and therefore their arrows fall to the ground before they inflict any wound at all.</p>
                        <p>I have known an important miniſter ere now, ruin the reputation of his neighbour with leſs then ten words ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thoſe too ſeemingly ſpoken in much pity. Oh ſir, there requites great art in ſcandalizing to purpoſe. Nothing gives ſuch a point to the arrow of ſcandal, as a ſeeming concern for the welfare of the party whom you want to ruin. I could recommend you to certain gentlemen in great eſtimation for religion and virtue, as the moſt accompliſhed in this neceſſary art, did not I know that you diſdain to learn from any inferior to myſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If you would invalidate the doctrine of imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, you muſt begin juſt here, and proceed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner. That it is a doctrine which muſt be brought into contempt, as you would wiſh to preſerve the honour of the creature, is clear to a demonſtration; ſeeing, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man is brought cordially to embrace it, his looks, Irowever lofty before, are brought down, and he lies at the feet of Jeſus, as a periſhing and loſt ſinner; which you know is inconſiſtent with the dignity of a philoſopher, or a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Chriſtian.</p>
                        <p>You muſt, my worthy Mr. Out-and-in, you muſt indeed,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:027249_0267_0FD3ECEBF19DA900"/>declare that man having received no damage at all by the fall of Adam, and coming into the world in perfect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, is capable of having a righteouſneſs of his own, which will juſtify him before an infinitely holy God. "Ay, but Mr. Rationalis, ſaid he, how ſhall I manage in this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are ſo many plain paſſages of ſcripture which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict me?" Do, my good friend! You muſt not mind that, if you intend to be a rational preacher. You muſt ſhew yourſelf a man, and leap over them, as many have done before you. Imitate the zealous Dr. Prieſtley, and like him, tell your hearers, that the ſcriptures do not mean what they ſay

                        <p>For your encouragement, permit me to aſſure you, that, however adverſe the ſcriptures may be to your rational doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, the populace will be very propitious.</p>
                        <p>You can never pleaſe men ſo well as by clapping them on the ſhoulders, telling them their hearts are good, that they need not doubt of getting ſafe to heaven, whether they believe in the Son of God or not. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As to the Holy Ghoſt, I would not have you abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refrain from mentioning him and his aſſiſting influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe your people read of him in your church litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſo very often. But be ſure roundly to aſſert, that it is mere enthuſiaſm for a man to expect to receive the Holy Ghoſt in theſe days; and let them ſolve the difficulty, how the thoughts of a man's heart can be cleanſed by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, whom they cannot receive, as they ſhall find opportunity. It ſeems I proved as a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer here, for he ſtopped me ſhort, and ſaid, "Let me ſee—I think I ſhould remember ſomething about the
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:027249_0268_0FD3ED0C17A5D928"/>Holy Ghoſt ſomewhere—Hum—If I miſtake not, it was relating to the office of ordination."</p>
                        <p>Yes, ſir, ſaid I, it was; you only profeſſed to my lord biſhop, that you were moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you the office of a deacon. That was all, ſir. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: "I believe it was ſome ſuch thing. But pray, ſir, was it rational in me, ſo to do, ſeeing I did not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that any man receives the moving influences of the Holy Ghoſt in theſe times?" Surely, ſaid I, it was. You know, ſir, no man can get a benefice without it in your way, and I pray you, who would not do as much as that for a good living? Why ſhould you have any ſcruple of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſeeing you have got ſome hundreds a year by it? I know many, very many, who did the ſame, ſir, who can hardly procure thirty pounds per annum. On my word you ſold your conſcience well. But for thoſe ſons of ſcience, they fooliſhly threw theirs away without the proſpect of any comfortable return. I aſſure you, a journeyman weaver can afford a better table, than many a clergyman of the rank of curate.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Once more; as the works of the Saviour of mankind muſt not be wholly omitted; ſhould you be aſked, What Jeſus did for his people?

                        <p>O ſir, replied I, we ſhall fit you in that in the moſt agreeable manner; then to the article of faith in the great God, add, "I believe in Jeſus Chriſt as a mere man like ourſelves, yet pious and holy. A man ſent of God, as a great teacher, whoſe buſineſs in life was to introduce a new mild law, commonly called the goſpel; becauſe God had altered his mind reſpecting the ſalvation of mankind, ſince his giving of the old law, which upon examination, and long experience, was found to be too ſtrict and ſevere, conſequently unjuſt and fit for abolition. Wherefore he raiſed up this ſame Jeſus Chriſt, a man like ourſelves, and ſent him to correct the errors which infinite wiſdom had fallen into, in giving what we call the moral law. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that when he obtained a perfect correct copy, he taught it to mankind, and called it the new law, or the goſpel. I believe that this good man actually did make ſuch correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, alterations and amendments in the moral law as he ſaw meet, notwithſtanding he poſitively declared, that "although heaven and earth ſhould both paſs away, not one jot or tittle of the old law ſhould fail, i. e. be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by any other law whatever. I believe that Jeſus Chriſt, this good man like ourſelves, having rendered the old law a perfect ſyſtem, and having taught it in its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſtate, died to confirm the truth of his doctrine, juſt as Cranmer and other good men have done ſince then. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve farther, that he continued under the power of death for three days, and then was raiſed from the dead, to ſhew that he was no impoſter, but was actually commiſſioned to amend the old law, which, prior to his correction, was
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:027249_0271_0FD3ECEE9DA07130"/>neither holy, juſt, nor good, as the miſtaken apoſtle thought it to be. Farther ſtill, I believe that in his exalted ſtate he is, as good Dr. Prieſtley obſerves, only a man like ourſelves, notwithſtanding the orthodox ignorantly worſhip him as Immanuel, God with them; God manifeſted in the fleſh; the true God and eternal life; the Alpha and Omega; the firſt and the laſt; and I know not what enthuſiaſtic titles, ſuch as that book called the bible aſcribe to Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the original ſtate of man, I believe, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam did not beget his children in the likeneſs which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bore, at the time of their being begotten, but in the likeneſs which he bore before he had ſinned; that although the fountain became polluted, the ſtreams continue pure and limpid; and although the root was depraved by tranſgreſſion, the branches and fruit are holy and innocent. So that there is no ſuch thing as orginal ſin in any ſenſe; nor have the poſterity of Adam any ſhare in the guilt of his tranſgreſſion. And whereas, the death of infants is frequently alledged by fanatics, and orthodox Chriſtians as a proof of original ſin. I do muſt rationally believe concerning thoſe that die in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, that either God in an arbitrary unjuſt manner mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them without cauſe; or that their death is occaſioned by ſome ſin of their own, committed either whilſt they were in the womb, or before they had being; for no man can die for the ſins of another, ſays your oracle, and yet it is clear that infants do die.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I believe that every man is poſſeſt of power, to juſtify himſelf by the deeds of the law, and to procure ſalvation by his own willing and running, contrary to the opinion of Paul, and the reſt of the orthodox; that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is obtained by works of righteouſneſs of our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, and not by the obedience and death of any perſon whatever; that the glory of our ſalvation ſhall redound to the abſolute mercy of God, and our own good endeavours to obtain it; and not unto Chriſt, whom the orthodox en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtically
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:027249_0272_0FD3ED0D48E09540"/>ſay, has loved them, and waſhed them in his blood, by which he has redeemed them to God out of every nation, kindred, people, tongue and language."</p>

                        <p>The very thing, in which their idolatry conſiſts, and is on a level with that of the ancient pagans. It was an inferior kind of adoration, which the antients paid to their heroes and common Deities, in compariſon of that, which they offered to Jupiter their great God, the ſuppoſed king and father of all the reſt. Mars and Mercury, for inſtance, were never conſidered as ſupreme, but as acting under the direction and delegation of Jupiter; as ſuch, and ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were adored and worſhiped; ſo that to diſtinguiſh between the worſhip of the Father as ſupreme, and that of his Son, as inferior and ſubordinate, inſtead of exculpating them from the charge of idolatry, doth actually enforce it.</p>

The great God, ſay they, hath given command that all the angels of God ſhould worſhip him, and that all men ſhould honour him; ſhall then our obedience draw upon us the reproach of idolatry?</p>

                        <p>So they ſay. But if they knew the ſcriptures, only half as well as you and me, who have laboured all our days to cloud their evidence, they would ſee that theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, inſtead of exculpating them from, do actually bring home the charge of idolatry upon them. God hath expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded, that, "Mankind ſhall have no other Gods before him," as objects of religious adoration, either by office or otherwiſe: And he would hardly have himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced another, of a different nature, and commanded all men to worſhip him; ſeeing in this caſe, one command would have claſhed with the other. This would have been
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:027249_0275_0FD3ECF18218C9F8"/>the ſpring of wild confuſion, and everlaſting uncertainty; for the two commands being diametrically oppoſite, no man could ever have known which of the two might be obeyed with ſafety.</p>
                        <p>Would we but ſuffer them to reflect upon the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they muſt unavoidably ſee, that their worſhipping of the Son of God, as merely delegated, with an inferior kind of worſhip, is abſolute idolatry. When the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten was brought into the world it was ſaid, "Let all the angels of God worſhip him," which they accordingly did at his birth. When he revealed himſelf to Iſrael, the Father gave command, that "All men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honoured the Father." That is with the ſelf-ſame honour, as is paid to the Father, on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his being one (in eſſence) with the Father.

                        <p>It is very obſervable, that in this county people never worſhip that to which they have already attained; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compaſſed their purpoſe, burn incenſe to the idol next in rank, and thus the worſhipper goes on, if death and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment do not prevent him, till he has worſhipped every ſhrine in the pantheon.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance, whilſt a curate, a vicarage is the idol; the vicarage obtained, it gives place to a prehend or deanry; which once enjoyed, they alſo in their turn give place to a hiſhopric; that to an archbiſhopric, which is the principal idol of the Engliſh. But in other countries there are idols of ſuperior rank, ſo that the moment an archbiſhopric is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained, incenſe ſmokes to a cardinal's hat; which alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, loſes its worſhipper, who is now converted to the worſhip of the triple crown, the great god and father of all the other idols.</p>
                        <p>Nor are the laity leſs devout than their reverend brethren, for one man worſhips univerſal empire, like Lewis of France and ſome others; but it is ſaid that George of Britain is an apoſtate from this religion. Another worſhips a crown and ſceptre, like the deſcendant of a certain bricklayer; and many adore the place of prime miniſter, chancellor of the kingdom, firſt lord of the treaſury, with every other place of honour and truſt in government. Some you ſhall ſee fall proſtrate before a ſtar and garter, whilſt others are all obedience to a coroner. The huſband lies in the duſt before "his honour," whilſt his wife in raptures adores "her ladyſhip." His lordſhip is bended to by one, and another pays all his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his grace.</p>
                        <p>In this country, you may find ſome men religious enough to worſhip a corporal's knot, or a ſerjeant's halberd.

                        <p>The belly is worſhipped by many, as the principal god, and ſo profuſe are they in their offerings, that its altar is ſometimes almoſt overturned, and the idol greedy as it is, is unable to bear the fruits of their devotion. The ſect of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, a very devout race, ranſack both earth and ſea to bring plenty of offerings to the idol; and that of drunkards, in no leſs devotion, pour on the wines in ſuch profuſion, that all the ſurrounding trenches are gorged to the brim. This ſame idol differs exceedingly from moſt other objects of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip; for when it has ſwilled to exceſs in the drink offering, it invites the brain to ſhare in the feaſt, to which it preſents every vapouriſh effluvia, whilſt it reſerves for its own uſe only the parts excrementitous. Moreover, this ſame belly is apt to reſent the profuſion of its worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſends forth the blueſt plagues, moſt chilling agues, burning, putrid, and malignant fevers, with all manner of acute and chronical diſtempers amongſt the worſhippers, and thus provides employment for gentlemen of the faculty: whoſe buſineſs, poſitively, would be worſe than that of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, but for the religion of belly worſhipping.</p>

                        <p>One inſtance of the many which I might produce, ſhall ſerve to exemplify the equity of the inquiſitors. When Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe was in its glory, there was one Bellarius, a foreign merchant, who in the courſe of buſineſs, had amaſſed great riches; and who, at the ſame time, was ſo circumſpect in all his ways, that even the eye of an emiſſary of the office, could find nothing, of which to accuſe him to the tribunal. Thus he lived in reputation and affluence for many years, to the great impatience of the holy inquiſitors, who could find no plauſable pretence, by which they might fang his ſubſtance with their rapacious talons.</p>
                        <p>Bellarius had an only child, a lady about ſeventeen. Her perſon was the perfection of ſymmetry, and her mind a copy of the pureſt virtue. By her they found means to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their purpoſes, and bring complicated ruin on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy parent. The family retired to peaceful repoſe, were one night alarmed about one in the morning, firſt by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a coach, and then by a ſmart rapping at the gate. Bellarius from within aſked, "Who is there?" Was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, the "holy Inquiſition" down ſtairs he run, flew to the gates in obedience to the dread tribunal, and opened to receive thoſe miniſters of darkneſs.

                        <p>Diſtreſſed and comfortleſs Bellarius remained at home; forſook all company, and converſed only with the various cogitations of his own foreboding mind. At one time he conjectured that his hapleſs daughter, in ſome inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent moment, might have blaſphemed other the wooden virgin Mary or the great high prieſt of Rome, or the holy inquiſitors, in which caſe he gave her up for loſt, and doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to fall a ſacrifice. Yet could he ſcarcely forgive the rigour of that religion, which had in ſuch a mercileſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner raviſhed her from his fond embrace.</p>
                        <p>It was not long after this an Armenian merchant, ſaid to be newly arrived in Syracuſe, called on him, under pretence of buying a large aſſortment of goods. Generous and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Bellarius, bid him welcome to his houſe during his ſtay; which he after ſome ſeemingly modeſt apologies thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted. The pretended Armenian perceiving Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius to eat but little at ſupper, now and then inadvertently to ſlip a ſigh, took occaſion to rally him in a friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if troubled with the hyp', adviſed him to cheer up and hope for better times.</p>
                        <p>Bellarius having but little reliſh for a jeſt, ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "No, ſir, the hyp' is not my preſent diſeaſe, neither

The friendly Armenian was now more importunate to know his grievance, that he might at leaſt ſympathize with him in his affliction. Little ſuſpecting that he was conflicting with prieſtly ſubtilty, he thought he might ſafely lodge his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the generous boſom of a merchant; he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſir, I ſuppoſe you are a ſtranger in Syracuſe; as ſuch let me adviſe you, as you value your life and liberty, to be careful of your words, and every part of your deportment during your abode, for this is a place of danger. I have, ſir, one only daughter, the perfect image of her lovely mother, whom I had the miſery to bury but a few months ago. I know not by what temptation, but my poor girl has ſaid ſomething diſhonourable either of the lady of Loretto, his holineſs the pope, or their lordſhips the Inquiſitors, for which ſhe is impriſoned in the holy office, and I ſuppoſe muſt anſwer it with her life.</p>
                        <p>Oh, ſir, I hope not, ſaid the Armenian, the lady's youth will interceed for her, and after ſome gentle admonition, your daughter will be returned to the houſe of her father.</p>
                        <p>Ah, ſir! rejoined diſconſolate Bellarius, I cannot but ſear, that her youth and beauty are the greateſt enemies and accuſers. Theſe are qualities capable of impreſſing the heart even of an inquiſitor. If this is the caſe, my poor daughter is already either dead or debauched. Or ſhould it happen, that any thing has been alledged againſt her religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conduct, there are inſtruments enow in the Inquiſition, and their lordſhips want not ſkill to uſe them; inſtruments ſufficient to make an helpleſs virgin confeſs that, which even never entered her thoughts: ſo that at all events, her death or diſhonour is enſured. No, ſir, it is not poſſible for me to hope for better, ſeeing the leaſt hint thrown out againſt the Inquiſition, is condemned as unpardonable blaſphemy.</p>
                        <p>It was not long after this diſcourſe, before the Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an feigned a neceſſity of going out; went ſtraight to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:027249_0289_0FD3ECFD44286078"/>and made information, being a jeſuit diſguiſed as a merchant, and that very night a coach was ſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct Bellarius to the cells of their dreadful priſon. Next day his effects were ſeized by order of the holy fathers, who now rejoiced that at laſt they had graſped the long wiſhed for prey. Confined in an abominable cell, he was greatly annoyed by vermin; and being divers times examined by torture, he died with grief for his daughter, who, as ſhe could never freely yield to the loathſome embrace of thoſe murderers, in a few months tired their patience. Then one of the ſanctified ruffians, firſt murdered her, and then burned her to aſhes in the dry pan. It is amazing, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to what lengths the luſt of money and women will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men.</p>

                        <p>I did ſo, ſir, and ſhall be ready farther to oblige you, if to give you a brief view of our corporation which like all other towns corporate, conſiſts of divers companies, will do it. The firſt of which is that of</p>
                        <p>The lawyers. A very wiſe ſet of gentlemen; who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the children of light in the art of money-getting, as far as any of the inhabitants of our territories; of courſe they are held in great eſtimation, as gentlemen of the firſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. In our city of Avarice, there is no knowledge deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any avail; no conduct accounted virtuous beſides that of money getting. He is always the wiſeſt, beſt, and moſt
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:027249_0290_0FD3ED1D01FC7410"/>virtuous man who beſt ſucceeds in the lucrative art, whether in law, or in trade, or otherwiſe. There was a time you know, when the law was as ſtraight, as clear, as a beam of light, and needed no expounding, ſo that every man was his own counſellor. But ever ſince the kings of England were kept priſoners under a guard, leſt truth ſhould become familiar to the royal ear, the caſe has been quite altered; now it is ſo full of pleas and demurrers, doubts and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. that it is a perfect labyrinth; dangerous for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man to enter. For in the lawyers company it is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule, that, whether the plaintiff or defendent loſe the cauſe, the lawyers on both ſides are ſure to be conſiderable gainers. Indeed, it is very ſeldom, but they manage the matter ſo, that all parties except themſelves are loſers, and if he who gains the trial, finds himſelf in the end to be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, how do you think it muſt fare with the wretch, againſt whom the verdict is given? If an houeſt man has a mind to purchaſe an eſtate ever ſo fairly, and pay for it ever ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, he will find it a difficult matter, ſo to ſecure his title, but if any ſucceeding heir be bred to the law; or heireſs be married to a lawyer, he may run a riſk of being joſtled out of his property, by ſome knaviſh quirk in law, without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance made either for the eſtate or its improvements.</p>

                        <p>Contumelius was a Yorkſhire gentleman, of diſtinguiſhed birth and ample fortune, but ſomewhat akin to the mad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian. His country-ſeat ſtood by the ſide of a lane, through which neighbouring farmers paſſed with their teams for time immemorial. But ſo much paſſing and repaſſing, of the whiſtling clowns following their waggous, at laſt proved
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:027249_0291_0FD3ED0025E98930"/>very offenſive to the worſhipful 'Squire, ſo that he reſolved to remove the intolerable nuiſance by blocking up the way. A gate was accordingly put up, and faſtened with a padlock, effectually to ſtop the clowniſh paſſengers from paſſing as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and turn them by a way conſiderably more diſtant.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the 'Squire's proceedings reached the ear of Mr. Loveright, a neighbouring farmer, he ordered his wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon to drive directly to the gate, and finding it lock'd, took an axe, which he had brought with him for that purpoſe, and to the great mortification of 'Squire Contumelius hewed it to pieces. His worſhip in a rage poſted to Mr. Deceitful, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eminent lawyer in the neighbouring town, for his advice. The worthy lawyer, finding this a proper occaſion of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own intereſt, adviſed the 'Squire to ſend for a writ, commence an auction againſt the farmer for his intolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence. In a few days the writ was ſerved on Loveright, who immediately waited on lawyer Deceitful, in order if poſſible to compromiſe the matter.</p>
                        <p>He no ſooner entered the office, than Mr. Deceitful took him aſide and thus addreſſed him, "I am heartily ſorry, my good Mr. Loveright, that I have been in a manner obliged, by his worſhip Contumelius, to ſend for a writ againſt you. But I aſſure you, ſir, in my opinion your ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by much the ſafeſt, and might I adviſe you, it would be to ſtand a trial, and by no means ſubmit to a compromiſe. Knowing the farmer to be a man of ſubſtance and reſolution, continued he, there is no bearing with ſuch an inſolent treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For my own part, Mr. Loveright, I would much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you had been my client, on the preſent occaſion, than the giddy 'Squire, but he firſt applied to me and inſiſted on my doing what I have done. If you pleaſe you may apply to my brother Falſhood, who is ſkilful as any man, and as honeſt as any lawyer I know. In the mean while, ſir, you may depend on me as your real friend, ready to ſerve you in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing conſiſtent with my reputation."</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="294" facs="unknown:027249_0292_0FD3ED1E8095E700"/>
As ſoon as Loveright was departed, Mr. Deceitful took horſe, and rode directly to the 'Squire's houſe; told him the farmer had been with him, heartily repented of his folly, and was very deſirous of coming to terms of agreement. But were the caſe mine, ſaid he, I would liſten to no terms of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, but puniſh his inſolence to the utmoſt rigour of law. The low-life fellow, having got forward in the world, has forgotten himſelf; and if ſuffered now to eſcape with impunity, he will be the peſt of the neighbourhood. Thus the worthy lawyer irritated both parties, till he had made ſure of an aſſize hearing, that, in the debate, he might likewiſe inſure to himſelf a ſum very conſiderable. For he knew very well, that if ever a difference falls into the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable maw of the court, it will never be diſgorged till all coſts of ſuit are amply paid off; for it is impoſſible for my mercenary ſcribblers to give any credit. Let them act juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or unjuſtly, they make ſure of their fees; and as the one party muſt neceſſarily loſe, both counſellor and attorney, take care to father the miſcarriage of the cauſe, on ſomething which the client has done, which he ought not; or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which he ought to have done: and not withſtanding all their fraud and deceit, both of them come off good honeſt lawyers. The</p>
                        <p>II. Company, and next in reputation to that of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, is the parſons company, which is alſo very flouriſhing and reverend. That you may not miſtake my meaning; by parſons I intend all in general, of every denomination, who are miniſters merely for the ſake of a living; more eſpecially.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. All who profeſs to my lord biſhop, that they are mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon them the office of a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, when in reality it is the hope of a benefice, by which they are ſtimulated; and who afterwards, in the courſe of their pulpiteering, tell the people that it is enthuſiaſm in any perſon, to expect to receive the Holy Ghoſt in theſe days.</p>
                        <p n="2">

2. All who, ſuſtaining the ſacerdotal character, lead men into ſin, or harden thoſe who are inſenſible, either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at the ſins of their people, or by being guilty of the like themſelves. Theſe gentlemen are pretty numerous.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. All who act rigorouſly towards their pariſhioners, in regard to temporal things, who evidently ſhew more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about tithes and offerings, than about the everlaſting welfare of their people.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. All in holy orders who, through covetouſneſs, idleneſs, or any other unjuſtifiable cauſe, with-hold from their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the ſtated miniſtration of the word and ordinances. Set a mark upon them, for they are all my diſciples.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Wherever you meet with a gentleman in holy orders, who is ſo far above the bulk of his auditory, that he will not condeſcend to converſe even with the meaneſt, about the ſtate of his ſoul, the work of the Spirit and way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſuch are idol ſhepherds, unnatural paſtors, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether devoted to the god Avaro.</p>

Yet I meet with many who with great warmth will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their own denomination by wholeſale, and deem it little leſs than blaſphemy, to ſuppoſe that they embrace any thing erroneous.

                        <p>The truth is, my parſons are ſcattered abroad, among all ſects of profeſſors; for the time is not yet come, that any one ſect can juſtly aſſert, that none of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have any other object in view but the glory of God, and the good of mankind. Nor will the time commence, before that important queſtion, "who ſhall be the greateſt;" is finally decided, which it is thought will be a great while firſt, ſeeing it hath already puzzled the ſchoolmen and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the church for ſixteen centuries back. But to return
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:027249_0294_0FD3ED2048751D88"/>to the parſons company, wherever you meet with a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who anſwers the deſcription I have given, you need not aſk him whether he is a churchman or a diſſenter. All you have to do, is to put Belzebub's mark upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and take aſſurance of him, that at a certain time, he ſhall not fail to viſit the nether regions, and take his abode in the infernal palace.</p>
                        <p>In this very populous company, there is great diverſity of ranks, even where there is an equality of genius; for ſome having ſcarcely finiſhed their apprenticeſhip, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into livings, and inſtantly commence rectors and tithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers. Others, for want of friends, are obliged much againſt their inclination to continue underlings all the length of a tedious life. I have ſeen a handſome parſon ere now, riding upon four or five ſteeples at once, and having more in expectation; whilſt his fellow ſtudent, could ſcarcely procure brown bread and Welch butter. And amongſt all the pluraliſts in my acquaintance, I know not of one that has got livings enow; but give, give, is ſtill their fervent prayer to my lord biſhop, or ſome other patron who has a benefice to beſtow. Many indeed think they ſhould be quite contented, if they had but one more benefice added to what they now enjoy; but I can tell you, could they come by another, there would ſtill be another wanting. It is much, now ſo many clergymen find themſelves uneaſy in the trammels, if they do not at laſt take it into their heads to perſuade the legiſlature, that a clergyman cannot preach in three or four churches at one and the ſame time. And that it is not perfectly conſiſtent, either with Chriſtianity or reaſon, that one clergyman ſhould have three or four liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whilſt another has none. Should it come to this, my company muſt be terrible ſufferers.</p>

                        <p>One would really think, if the cure of ſouls is as weighty a concern as ſome people make it, the parſons would not be ſo fond of pluralities; of adding living to liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pariſh to pariſh.</p>

Give an avaricious parſon the fleece, and you make fairies of the ſouls of the pariſhioners if you will. Many of them do very little of the prieſts office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides collecting the tithes and offerings; at which they are wonderfully dextrous. But as to preaching, they have no notion of it, and leſs ſtill of viſiting the ſick, were they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the jaws of death. I aſſure you, gentlemen, thoſe idol ſhepherds are of the greateſt uſe to our government. The intereſt of hell could not proſper as it does, were not we well befriended by many gentlemen in holy orders.</p>

What poſting to and from heil is there amongſt our fable brethren, when but one faithful and zealous goſpel miniſter ariſes in a nation? You may remember, when Luther and Calvin brake the chain of the pope and devil, lifted up the voice of the goſpel trumpet, which reſounded through the bowels of hell, and made the pillars of our infernal kingdom totter, what hurly burley we all were in? What deep conſultations in the divan? What diligence in action with our forces upon earth.</p>

<pb n="298" facs="unknown:027249_0296_0FD3ED21E3AAA550"/>identical perſons intended by the idle idol ſhepherds, and unfaithful watchmen, againſt whom ſo many curſes are denounced in ſcripture. The idle ſhepherds, you know, are ſuch who feed and adorn themſelves with the ſpoils of the flock, which is ſuffered to periſh unwarned, and to die for lack of knowledge. The idol ſhepherd is that lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prieſt, that downy doctor, who keeps at an awful diſtance from men of ordinary rank, and is too much of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to give himſelf any concern about the ſouls of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners.</p>
                        <p>Many of thoſe idol ſhepherds I know, who poſſeſs ſome hundreds, ay, ſome of them thouſands per annum, who will not ſo much as aſk one of their cure, whether he intends to go to heaven or hell at death, or whether he ſerves God or the devil; yet if a pariſhioner die, they will keep as pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating a look-out for their fees, as an eagle for his prey, and ſeize it with equal eagerneſs. Moreover, for the ſake of this ſame fee, they will own the deceaſed for a brother, which privilege was always denied him whilſt alive, unleſs he ſhould indeed have happened to be one of the fat of the flock, who was capable of yielding a double fleece.</p>

                        <p>It is the fleece, ſir, which my diſciples regard, and not the flock; how have I been diverted ſometimes, both at church and meeting-houſe, to hear the parſon, with an air the moſt ſupercilious and contemptful, railing againſt the moſt uſeful of God's miniſters, as enthuſiaſts, fanaticks, and methodiſts: ah! ſaid I to myſelf, what poor honeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils were thoſe of old, who confeſt Chriſt and his diſciples, and thus declared to the ſons of Sceva, "Jeſus we know, and Paul we know, but who are you?"</p>
                        <p>Sometimes I hear them crying with vehemence againſt the divinity of Immanuel; one making him ſome kind of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-angelic being, and another aſſerting that he is only a man like themſelves. Then ſay I, what a puſillanimous ſpirit was that ſame devil Legion, who, without receiving either tithe or offering, confeſſed Jeſus of Nazereth to be the only
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:027249_0297_0FD3ED049183F2A0"/>Son of God, to whom the ſcriptures aſcribe every divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. But theſe parſons are well paid for confeſſing him, and yet deny him with the utmoſt inſolence.</p>
                        <p>There is never a day but I hear ſome of this company charging the lie upon one text or other of the bible. One tells his people there is no ſuch thing as one being choſen to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more than another, but that the love of God is equal unto, and upon all men, whether Jew or Gentile, Turk or Pagan, Papiſt or Proteſtant; nay, then I ſay, maſter parſon, you are become a diſſenter from your own ſeventeenth arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. And, to ſpeak within compaſs, there are at leaſt a thouſand pulpits in the church occupied by ſuch diſſenters.</p>
                        <p>Then I hear others railing againſt thoſe who preach ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by grace; and at the ſame time aſſuring their people, that they muſt be ſaved by their own holineſs and good works. Very well, ſay I, then I have my deſire, for upon theſe terms they will never be ſaved at all. But ſtill I am at a loſs, how they dare ſo barefacedly give the lie to Paul the apoſtle, who taught the church, that "By grace they were ſaved, through faith, and that not of themſelves, but the gift of God." I hear many clergymen of the eſtabliſhed church, in entering upon the ſervice, thus addreſs the majeſty of heaven, "Lord cleanſe thou the thoughts of our hearts, by the inſpiration of the Holy Spirit;" and in leſs than an hour after, telling their pariſhioners, that it is mere enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm in any man to expect in theſe days, to be at all influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the inſpiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                        <p>So glaring the contradictions, which ſometimes they are guilty of, that I tremble with fear, leſt the people ſhould be convinced of the truth; but theſe are favourable times, gentlemen, very favourable; for the greateſt part of the people have ſomething elſe to think of when they go to church, beſides either preaching or prayer.</p>

In the days of yore, when luxary was but little in vogue, the frecholders were attended with fewer wants, and of courſe this company was leſs flouriſhing; but ſince theſe happy days commenced, in which people of quality are trained up in abſolute idleneſs and diſſipation; in which vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:027249_0299_0FD3CDA6AC0FE458"/>is of no account, and luxury, pride, and diſſoluteneſs, are arrrived at their zenith; the people of quality are amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly poor, and are attended with an undeſcribable train of neceſſities. What is very remarkable, their pride has grown in a perfect proportion to their poverty, ſo that now it is an eſtabliſhed law amongſt them, to look upon themſelves as of a different blood from the reſt of mankind.

                        <p>I went one day to the houſe of Sir Fop Mortalis, a very famous gentleman in the country, with a deſign to pay my devoirs to madam Mortalis, his lady; a gentlewoman who abhors to have the leaſt compariſon made, betwixt her and any perſon whatever of inferior rank. The chambermaid informed her miſtreſs, that good Mr. Prudence waited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, deſiring to ſpeak with her ladyſhip, if convenient; the lady ſoon deſcended, and compliments paſſed on either ſide, ſhe conducted me into her parlour, where ſhe and I had the following dialogue.</p>

                        <p>When I was laſt at church, I was ſurpriſed to ſee, as I thought, miſs Mortalis, your daughter, there; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that neither Sir Fop himſelf, nor any of his family, go often to any place of public worſhip.

What ſhould they do at church, ſeeing they fear no hell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not God, and believe not in the devil; as for heaven, Sir Fop is willing to leave that to the poor, and deſires no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er happineſs for himſelf and his, than is implied in an earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom."</p>

                        <p>Indeed, madam, the ſame ſcheme will produce very humbling effects, upon tradeſmen of every kind; though I dare not aſſert, that you will ever be able perfectly to ſubject to your ambition and avarice, that honourable body of merchants, whom you affectedly call cits. No, madam, I am afraid that nobility itſelf muſt give place to the public ſpirit of the merchant; yet even them you may greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure, and prevent their being of ſuch eſſential ſervice to their country, as otherwiſe they might be. But as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land trade, by racking your tenants in the manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, you may abſolutely deſtroy it. That you may ſee the utility of my ſcheme, I ſhall a little explain it to your ladyſhip.</p>
                        <p>If the farmers are racked to the utmoſt, they will be obliged to ſell the produce of their lands at an exhorbitant price, otherwiſe it will be altogether out of their power to pay the ſtipulated rent.

                        <p>By theſe means the farmer will find it very difficult to live, and of courſe will rarely viſit the mercer's and drap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſhops; and as for his labourers and workmen, they will find but little money to lay out in cloaths; eſpecially if their children be numerous, as the demands of the back muſt always give place to the louder calls of the belly.

The draper's goods, will lie upon his hands, unleſs indeed he is pleaſed to give credit to the poor; if the former, he will be ſparing of his orders; and if the latter, we ſhall ſoon have him a bankrupt, ſo that he will be effectually ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined.</p>
                        <p>You ſee, madam, that here we affect the manufacturer, equally with the farmer and ſhopkeeper; for when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail trade is ruined by the dearneſs of proviſions, the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturer will find little call for his goods; the iſſue of which will be, the diſbanding of many of his journeymen, and abridging the wages of the reſt. The diſbanded journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being incapable of finding employment, and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned the art of living like the camelion, on the air, will be drove to thieving, by which means America will be peopled, and Tyburn Chronicle rendered reſpectable.</p>
                        <p>As to the manufacturer himſelf, his capital being ſoon converted into manufactured goods, he will be obliged to ſell them under their value, that he may keep up his credit with the merchant, and be able to carry on a little trade, vainly hoping that times may alter for the better.</p>

                        <p>No, madam, I aſſure you, my ſcheme, if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially adopted, and executed with vigour, will put it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely out of the merchant's power. There is nothing can recommend the Engliſh manufacture at a foreign mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, but the price being inferior to that of other nations. Now, if an Engliſhman muſt pay twice as dear for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in his own country, as a Frenchman does in his, it

The conſequence of this is, the French manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer can ſend his goods to a foreign market upon better terms than an Engliſhman, and of courſe deſtroy all the foreign trade of the Engliſh nation. Thus, madam, I have pointed out a method by which, you people of faſhion, in order to ſupport your own grandeur, may ſuck the blood of all inferior ranks of people, and make the Britiſh ſubjects abſolutely ſlaves, even in a country which boaſts its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

                              <p>As we know not to whom we can apply, with any hope of ſucceſs, but to yourſelves; we muſt farther beg, that you will not only detect the theft, when you meet with it, but do as the worthy inhabitants of St. Giles's do on ſimilar occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that is, purſue the delinquent with a ſtop-thief, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thief. Indeed, gentlemen, it will not leſſen you in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic eſteem, ſhould you commence even literary thief catchers. Should it pleaſe you to comply with our requeſt, we doubt not but the ſtreets which lead to places of public reſort, will in a few years be lined with many authors, having aſſumed the more honourable employment of a beggar.</p>
                              <p>Thus the impoſts would be taken off from the ſtudious; real authors would preſerve their honour, no one daring to invade their right, for fear of expoſing themſelves to public infamy. Perhaps that moſt villainous of all practices may
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:027249_0311_0FD3ED8840562E80"/>put a ſtop to; we mean the vending of clowdy commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the Bible; few people, we ſhould think, would be fond of purchaſing ſuch books, after they are informed that moſt of the materials are ſtolen. Effectually to put a ſtop to this inquitous practice, we would recommend the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the above named Synopſis in Engliſh, and then every reader may take what human ſenſe of the divine word he pleaſes.</p>

                        <p>Indeed, couſin, I think the requeſt of that ſociety reaſonable enough, and ought to be granted; for as the world now goes, it is a difficult matter for a man to know to whom he is obliged for any profitable hint he meets with in the courſe of his reading. And flimſy as modern productions in general are, there is now and then a profitable hint to be met with. But when any thing of a recommendatory qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity happens to emerge from the teem-preſs; the whole race of catch-penny imitators, ſwarm about it, and gobble it up, then ſpue it out, as if it were their own. However, couſin, it muſt be owned, there are ſome of your mercenary ſcribblers who are much more honourable than others, and let the public know, that what they write is not the fruit of their own genius, but is borrowed from this or that reſpocta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble author, under pretence of making it more public, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its great excellency. They deſire not to rob the author of his honour: all they deem neceſſary, is a loan of his genius to ſupply the defects of their own, and to help them a little forward in the world.</p>
                        <p>But of all writers, commend me to polemic divines. Oh! it would be a pleaſure to the devil himſelf, to ſee with what dexterity they put off their own anger, under the name of zeal for God; juſt as the induſtrious tradeſmen of Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:027249_0312_0FD3EDAC61699AA8"/>do their manufacture for the coin of the nation. 'Tis amazing to think, how pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And I aſſure you it is not every divine, even of great parts, who takes time to diſtinguiſh between the glory of God, and his own reputation.</p>
                        <p>Next to this, I am delighted to ſee men of learning and religion, bickering each other about ſubjects, which the greateſt of all the apoſtles would not preſume to pry into.

The patriotic alderman is a leading man in this learned company.

                        <p>I allow, that in the darkneſs of paganiſm, the ancients had a religious deſign, in exhibitions of the ſtage; but what of that? They had likewiſe a religious deſign, in

I allow, farther, that in the days of monkiſh ignorance, thoſe blinking prieſts, made uſe of the ſtage to convey their inſtructions; but then it ought to be obſerved, that the ſame fathers were equally pious, and devout in perſecuting the beſt of men. So then, couſin, the one is as much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by ancient practice as the other.

                        <p>You muſt know, Leonora and Matilda have been intimate from their infancy, and as ſuch continued their friendſhip even to mature life; but when both became wives and mothers, I taught them to behave more inconſiſtently than they did when they were children. Matilda being quite fatigued with domeſtic concerns, an attention to which her mind is not very happily turned, reſolved one day to ſpend the afternoon with her friend Leonora.

                        <p>True, ſir, but the matter did not end here. Poor Matilda, being unable to bear the conceived ſlight, made free to call on Letitia on her way home, that ſhe might give a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vent to her turbulent paſſions. Letitia, being as deſtitute of innate ideas as ſhe is of fidelity, readily liſtened to the plaintive account, how Matilda had been ſerved; without heſitation approved her departure, kindly fanned the flame of reſentment, and at laſt adviſed her to let Leonora come to herſelf when ſhe ſhould find it convenient.</p>
                        <p>Matilda had not been long gone, before Letitia, who burned with impatience to have a little Tittle-tattle, went to Leonora, and ſet miſchief abroach with her alſo. She told her all the former had ſaid of her, and happily gave it ſuch a turn, as to render it very offenſive, notwithſtanding ſhe kept ſtrictly to the letter of truth. Some people are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably happy in talents of this kind; by their manner of repreſentation, they can turn things quite from their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral appearance, as I may perhaps ſhew you in ſome future conſerence. Leonora could not but think herſelf very ill uſed, and reſolved, weakly as ſhe was, that ſhe would be a ſlave to no body's temper.</p>
                        <p>When Matilda and Leonora met next time, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with mutual diſguſt, their compliments were dry and

Sometimes I adviſe a father to leave his daughter under the guardianſhip of an attorney, or an uncle to leave his eſtate to his minor nephew, under the care and inſpection of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, either of which is likely to be a lucrative job to the gentlemen of the law.

Thoſe gentry are all under my dominion; beſides a very great ſhare of my influence reſts on many others, who are grievouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with troubles which never happen; ſome are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ingenious, as to apprehend difficulties for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and offspring, for a great many years to come, as if the evil of the day were not ſufficient of itſelf.</p>
                        <p>Stop, Lunatio, ſaid I, there you touch me ſenſibly, I will not thus give up my careful ſubjects. True, replied he, but you and I may play into one another's hands. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I allow them to be yours, it is eaſy to ſee abundance of madneſs in their diſpoſition and conduct. What wiſdom, I pray you, is there in any man's burdening himſelf to day, with what may or may not happen a twelvemonth hence?
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:027249_0325_0FD3ED974907A928"/>Leſs ſtill in pretending to foreſee what may happen in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſeeing all future events are locked up in the council of the eternal mind.</p>
                        <p>From the thinking and careful people, we may deſcend to the young and frolicſome, who, eager to pry into the cabinet councils of deſtiny, are duped by daring pretenders to foothſaying and palmiſtry. As if a deſigning gipſy, or any other deceiver, could unriddle futurity by the lineature of the hand. There ought to be places provided in Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam for all the curious, who cannot be ſatisfied with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contents of to-day.</p>
                        <p>Wiſdom will always wiſh futurity to lie concealed, till occurring events diſcloſe the myſterious page; and moral goodneſs will never wiſh to intrude upon the ſecrets of the Almighty; but reſt perfectly ſatisfied with what is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>I would alſo have a place provided either in Bedlam, or St. Luke's, for all who, upon ſuſtaining loſs by thieves or otherwiſe, have recourſe to pretended aſtrologers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted conjurers. Every body beſides fools knows that the ſtars are dumb, and cannot ſpeak, or that their prophets do not underſtand the language of the luminaries. Beſides it has a frantic look to ſuppoſe that honeſt Jupiter and old crabbed Saturn, with their lucid brethren, have nothing elſe to do beſides ſtanding centry on this man's horſes, that woman's cloaths, the other girl's box, or the farmer's orchard. Indeed, if the ſtars have any other buſineſs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, beſides watching peoples moveables, they may happen to be buſy when certain robberies are committed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot give ſuch clear accounts of matters, as their petitioners might wiſh for; and I think none but mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would ſpend their money upon ſuch uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>You are all alike, for laying claim to my ſubjects, ſo that I cannot have the honour of my operations. There is my uncle Faſtoſus, who will ſuffer no-body ſo much as to ſpeak to him, unleſs he happens to be in the humour. He
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:027249_0326_0FD3EDB9D8EA6330"/>lays claim to the diſcontented, whom I could prove by a thouſand arguments to be my own diſciples. Diſcontent gives an emphaſis to every trouble and aggravates every pain. Would a wiſe man then<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> cordially cheriſh any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which is ſure to be the bane of his own happineſs if cheriſhed? To Bedlam, I ſay, with all the fretful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented.—Make haſte, provide cells in St. Luke's, for all who are uneaſy about their countenance, ſhape and complexion. A wiſe man will not be aſhamed of external deformity, any more than he will be proud of his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proportion. And yet Lunatio can have little honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to him.</p>
                        <p>There are people of property who ſink their rents, fall their timber, mortgage their eſtates, in giving grand enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments to hungry viſitants and hangers-on, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Timon of Athens, in order to be thought generous and great. Not once conſidering, that the neareſt way to eſteem is ſtill to preſerve the golden cord in the hand of the owner. Let all be once ſpent, the inſatiable hangers-on who croud the plenteous table, will drop off like leaves in autumn, and if the wretch retains the loving regard of Argus his dog, he muſt expect no more. Away with the fool to bediam. He ought to go no longer without ſhackles.</p>
                        <p>Parents there are, ſo doatingly fond of their children, that they ſtrip themſelves of heir poſſeſſions, in order to make them reſpectable in the world, long enough before their own lives are at a period; leaving their future ſupport to the good nature and mercy of the dear boy or girl, who it is thought are ſo well diſpoſed, as to be incapable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to thoſe who gave them being. But let the dear boy or girl once get the parents eſtate into their power, and they will give them occaſion enough to lament their folly, when every ſhilling received, ſhall come with a very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible frown. The language of which to the parent is, "I wiſh you were once in your grave." Such parents ought to be
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:027249_0327_0FD3ED999C1865E8"/>provided for at the public expence, and kept in ſome place of confinement like other lunaties.</p>
                        <p>Other parents, to avoid falling into that error, which they foreſee may be productive of great perſonal inconvenience; with an equal degree of madneſs flee into the oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. They can find in their hearts to part with nothing whilſt they live; they will find ſome plauſible pretext or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for which they will retain the ſole poſſeſſion of their goods and chattels; rather than give a ſuitable meaſure of parental aſſiſtance, will ſuffer the young people to begin the world, under all poſſible diſadvantages. Send ſuch parents to Newgate, I ſay, for they are worſe than mad.</p>
                        <p>You do me injuſtice again, Avaro, in claiming the ſole power to yourſelf, over parents, who will oppreſs their ſervants, over reach their neighbours, grind the faces of the poor, and ſell their ſouls to the devil, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure fortunes for their children. This is ſo far from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the end propoſed, in gaining the love and eſteem of the young people, that it has quite a contrary tendency. The greater the eſtate, the more impatient will the heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent be, to be put into quiet poſſeſſion for himſelf. The more there is dependant upon the death of a parent, the more eager will children be to have him out of the way. So eager have ſome been, that they have been obliged to uſe violence, in order to get the cumberſome old man out of the world. Deliver them up to me, Avaro, for they are all the children of madneſs. And yet Lunatio is deemed a fooliſh devil, and a ſon of idleneſs.</p>
                        <p>You are very prone to aſcribe to chance or accident, and other ſuch chimerical gentry, works, the honour of which is due only to myſelf. Ay, you are apt to conclude that there is even no madneſs in religion. Pride and covetouſneſs may prevail ever ſo, but you never think of madneſs. What leſs than madneſs is it to worſhip a wooden Saviour, or a Jeſus Chriſt of man's making? To adore a
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:027249_0328_0FD3EDBBA06F4C88"/>god that has been baked in an oven; or to pretend to eat the deity? I could open ſuch a field before you, as would make you wonder at the aboundings of religious madneſs.</p>
                        <p>Go with me to the chambers of the ſick, and ſee the works of madneſs there performed. The lady having over eaten herſelf at dinner, finding her ſtomach uneaſy, took a glaſs of brandy to help digeſtion, after that another, &amp;c. till ſhe is now very ill upon it. The phyſician is ſent for, and after feeling her pulſe, aſks her a pertinent queſtion or two, as, Do you feel an uneaſineſs at your ſtomach, madam? Does your head ach, madam? Have you a thirſt upon you, madam? You were taken ill after dinner, were you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?" He preſcribes a gentie purgative draught or two, to aſſiſt nature to throw off her load, after having thus learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of her diſorder. Now there's an inſtance of a three-fold madneſs for you. In the firſt place, although the food was rich and delicious, it was madneſs to eat, after na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid it was enough. Secondly, it was madneſs to pour ſuch a quantity of ſtrong liquor, into a ſtomach already glutted. And thirdly, it was madneſs to ſend for a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, ſeeing ſhe would be well enough by to-morrow noon, by which time nature unaſſiſted might have ſtruggled from beneath its burden. Shall I never have due honour paid to my operations?</p>
                        <p>This other woman before you, is indeed in a dangerous fever; but ſhe will have no aſſiſtance. It is only a deep cold ſhe has caught, and ſhe hopes to get better in a day or two, with care and keeping warm. By and by, when the ſymptoms of death are actually upon her, the phyſician muſt be ſent for in all haſte.—And when the ſever alone is more than nature can ſuſtain, ſhe muſt have the additional torment of ſwallowing medicines, even without a poſſibility of their being of the leaſt ſervice. Is there no madneſs in this caſe? Is it not madneſs to trifle with a diſeaſe in its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the only time perhaps in which medicine can afford relief? Is it not equally madneſs to torment the ſick, and
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:027249_0329_0FD3ED9AF8947388"/>and throw money away upon the doctor, when the diſeaſe is evidently beyond a remedy? And yet you would exclude me from having any ſhare in the government of mankind.</p>
                        <p>No, Lunatio, returned I, we do not exclude you. We ſhould even be glad to have a full account of your operations in ſome of our friendly meetings.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>LUN.</speaker>
                        <p>I could give you ſuch an account as would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you all, might the honours due to my operations be properly acknowledged. But I cannot ſtay now, having urgent buſineſs in the weſt end of a certain metropolis.</p>
                        <p>Pray, couſin, may a brother fiend be acquainted with it? ſaid I: he replied, you know, that almoſt the one half of the nation is in a ſtarving condition, and are as it were on the tip-toe of rebellion. Yet in a very great ſtrait how to act. They think it hard to famiſh amidſt plenty; to die of hunger whilſt the barns are full of corn, and the paſtures are well filled with cattle; whilſt their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors can afford to ſpend thouſands at a horſe-race, or in an evening's play. On the other hand, they think it hard to be ſhot at, by thoſe who are murderers by profeſſion; or to be hung up at Tyburn for ſeeking to procure bread for their families.</p>
                        <p>In this dilemma, the poor wretches are raiſing their voices to government, beſeeching their lawgivers to ſpare ſo much time from their own pleaſure and amuſement, as to take their wretched caſe into ſerious conſideration, that they may not die by artificial famine. What I aim at is, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade thoſe in power to treat their complaints with neglect, and themſelves as clamorous uneaſy, and turbulent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Inſtead of redreſſing their grievances, to threaten them with the ſtrict execution of the laws againſt rioters. If I am happy enough to gain this point, as I think I ſhall, we ſhall ſoon ſee the ſpirit of madneſs raving all over the nation, and even the wiſe will become fools.</p>
                        <p>Oppreſſion you know will make even a wiſe man mad. Therefore, when their oppreſſions can no longer be borne,
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:027249_0330_0FD3EDBCC10C3040"/>there will go forth a ſpirit of inſurrection among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that ſhall be followed by a ſpirit of murder, till all the riots are ſufficiently quelled, and the leading inſurgents puniſhed by death or tranſportation. Then will follow a ſpirit of emigration, and every one almoſt will wiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have been tranſported at the expence of government. At this very time, there are not leſs than five hundred thouſand families who are kept in their native country by nothing but the want of means to get cleverly out of it. Neighbouring nations will give all poſſible encouragement to the poor to ſettle with them; every opportunity will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to croſs the Atlantic, till the nation referred to ſhall become almoſt, if not quite depopulated.</p>
                        <p>Now, the madneſs of the ſcheme lies here. The true riches of a nation are its inhabitants, and the grandeur of the great depends wholly on the numbers of thoſe in inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſtations. In proportion therefore to the oppreſſions of the poor, will the nation decreaſe in its ſtrength. Every emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration from the mother country, will either increaſe the number of coloniſts, or ſtrengthen the hands of natural ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; of courſe the neglect of the preſent complaints will eventually be the entire ruin of the great men themſelves, and the tranſlation of the empire to another, and very diſtant ſeat. Yet after all, perhaps it will be alledged, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio hath no influence. But I ſhall raiſe myſelf an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal name, upon my own foundation. I deign no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with a grovelling ſpirit—adieu.</p>

                        <p>You know, ſir, they were a ſet of deiſts among the Jews, who, like the modern deiſts, did not believe that there are any angels good or bad, or ſhall be any reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:027249_0331_0FD3ED9E28DD8470"/>from the dead. I did not only perſuade the ſcribes, phariſees, and doctors of the law, to lay aſide judgment, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the love of God, in order to eſtabliſh their own tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: but wrought upon the Sadducees to prefer their own reaſoning to the plaineſt declarations of the word of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I aſſured them, that the well informed author of the book of Job, was under a deluſion, when he ſaid by the Holy Ghoſt, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I ſhall ſtand with him at the latter day upon the earth, and although after my ſkin worms deſtroy this body, yet in the fleſh I ſhall ſee God." I perſuaded them alſo, that the prophet Iſaiah was under the like miſtake, when he foretold, that death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory: as alſo Daniel who aſſerted, "that many, who then ſlept in the duſt ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to everlaſting diſhonour." Theſe, together with the teſtimonies of all the prophets, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them to reject, merely becauſe they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, nor account for it how the dead ſhould riſe.— This you know is the very reaſon why modern deiſts are pleaſed, under the ſame influence, to deny the whole ſyſtem of revealed truth.</p>
