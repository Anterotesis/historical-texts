            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MARTIS, 29 <hi>Die</hi> OCTOBRIS, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1765. In the House of REPRESENTATIVES.</head>
            <p>ACcording to the Order of the Day, there being a very full House, the following Draft, which had been laid on the Table was <hi>particularly</hi> considered, and thereupon <hi>Voted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas the just Rights of His Majesty's Subjects of this Province, derived to them from the <hi>British Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> as well as the <hi>Royal Charter,</hi> have been lately drawn into Question: In order to ascertain the same, this House do UNANIMOUSLY come into the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Resolves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That there are certain essential Rights of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution of Government which are founded in the Law of God and Nature, and are the common Rights of Mankindâ€”Therefore</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the Inhabitants of this Province are <hi>unalienably</hi> entitled to those essential Rights in common with all Men: And that no Law of Society can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Law of God and Nature divest them of those Rights.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That no Man can justly take the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of another without his Consent: And that upon this Principal the Right of Representation in the same Body, which exercises the Power of making Laws for levying Taxes, which is one of the main Pillars of the British Constitution, is evidently founded.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That this <hi>inherent</hi> Right, together with all other, essential Rights, Liberties, Privileges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, of the People of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed to them by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and by former and later Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That His Majesty's Subjects in <hi>America,</hi> are in Reason and common Sense, entitled to the same Extent of Liberty, with His Majesty's Subjects in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That by the Declaration of the Royal Charter of this Province, the Inhabitants are entitled, to all the Rights, Liberties, and Immunities of free and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to all Intents, Purposes and Constructions whatever.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the Inhabitants of this Province appear to be entitled to all the Rights aforementioned, by an Act of Parliament 13th of GEO. 2d.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That those Rights do belong to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Province, upon Principles of <hi>common Iustice</hi>; their Ancestors, having settled this Country at their <hi>sole Expence</hi>; and <hi>their</hi> Posterity, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly approved themselves most loyal and faithful Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:010065_0002_0F7C7567DE595D08"/>9. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That every Individual in the Colonies, is as advantageous to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as if he were in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and held to pay his full Proportion of Taxes there: And as the Inhabitants of this Province, pay their full Proportion of Taxes, for the Support of his Majesty's Government <hi>here,</hi> it is unreasonable for them to be called upon, to pay any Part of the Charges of the Government <hi>there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the Inhabitants of this Province are not, and never have been, represented in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi> And that such a Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>there,</hi> as the Subjects in <hi>Britain,</hi> do actually and rightfully enjoy, is <hi>impracticable</hi> for the Subjects <hi>in America:</hi>â€”And further, That in the Opinion of this House, the several subordinate Powers of Legislation in <hi>America,</hi> were constituted upon the Apprehensions of this <hi>Impracticability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the <hi>only</hi> Method, whereby the constitutional Rights of the Subjects of this Province can be secure, consistent with a Subordination to the supreme Power of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is by the continued Exercise of such Powers of Government as are granted in the Royal Charter, and a firm Adherence to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the same.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Resolved,</hi> as a just Conclusion from some of the foregoing Resolves, That all Acts made, by any Power whatever<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> other than the General Assembly of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, imposing Taxes on the Inhabitants are Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our <hi>inherent</hi> and <hi>unalienable</hi> Rights, as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>British Subjects:</hi> and render void the most valuable Declarations of our <hi>Charter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the Extension of the Powers of the Court of Admiralty within this Province, is a most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Infraction of the Right of Trials by Juries.â€” A Right, which this House upon the Principles of their <hi>British Ancestors,</hi> hold most dear and sacred; it being the only Security of the Lives, Liberties and Properties of his Majesty's Subjects here.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Resolved,</hi> That this House owe the strictest Allegiance to his Most Sacred Majesty King GEORGE the Third: That they have the greatest Veneration for the Parliament: And that they will, after the Example of <hi>all</hi> their Predecessors, from the Settlement of this Country, exert themselves to their utmost, in support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majesty's Authority in the Province,â€”in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the true Happiness of his Subjects: and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the Extent of his Dominion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordered,</hi> That all the foregoing Resolves be kept in the Records of this House; that a just Sense of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the firm Sentiments of Loyalty may be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Posterity.</p>
