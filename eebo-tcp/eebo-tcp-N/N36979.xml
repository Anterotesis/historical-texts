            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ENCOURAGED by the opinion of Friends, whoſe partiality for the Author has, perhaps, miſled their judgment, ſhe humbly ventures to preſent the following work to her fair Countrywomen. She truſts the heart of ſenſibility will not find it deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of merit. Imperfections it undoubtedly has—for what human performance is free of them? But, as it is her firſt public at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, not originally meant for the preſs, ſhe hopes the eye of criticiſm will be turned aſide, and ſuch allowances made, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour may authorize, and liberality ſuggeſt. Of one point ſhe is conſcious—that a good intention has guided her pen—and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be found in it, militating againſt the moſt rigid principles of virtue, ſhe hopes for indulgence at leaſt, if ſhe is not honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with approbation, or encouraged by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>

One evening Louiſa, accompanied by her younger brother Charles, was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the banks of the river, the ſun juſt ſinking below the horizon, the chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the birds, and the beauty of the evening, lulled her into a pleaſing reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſhe wandered ſhe knew not whither; nor did ſhe think of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety, till reminded by her brother of the diſtance they were from home; at that inſtant a beautiful little ſpaniel came up to them, and fawned on Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, then whining, ran into an adjacent thicket; ſhe immediately followed him, and perceiving a young man on the ground, to all appearance dead; who by his dreſs appeared to be a Britiſh officer.

During this converſation, Mr. Villars, had retired to the other end of the room, perhaps he had his emotion.—He was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy to have it in his power to be of ſervice to the wounded gentleman; but there was ſomething in the voice and manners of his friend, that ſtruck him ſo forcibly, he could not account for it; and his great reſemblance to a perſon we ſhall hereafter mention, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely abſorbed him in thought; when the young gentleman came to him, and begged he would accept the thanks of his friend, who was now able to ſpeak to him. Mr. Villars approached the bed, and Captain Bellmore (for that was his name) thanked him in the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:048426_0006_102547E5E7439ED8"/>greatly on his being quite tranquil. "Alas, ſir" returned he, "I am perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaſy on my own account, but very unhappy on my friends. Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave has left his camp in ſearch of me; and I fear reports will be circulated to the prejudice of his honor." Mr. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſtarted at the thought, and turning to Mr. Hargrave, (who ſat in a deep reverie) ſaid, "Can I, ſir, be of ſervice to you?" this was pronounced with ſo much tenderneſs, that Mr. Hargrave, before greatly prepoſſeſſed in his favor, now felt an emotion he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; bowing very reſpectfully, he ſaid, "his ſituation indeed required a friend:" —Mr. Villars told him it was late, and it was neceſſary Captain Bellmore ſhould reſt, begged him to join his wife and daughter in this little palour; promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Bellmore to do every thing in his power to ſerve his friend, he wiſhed him a good night.—Mrs. Villars and Louiſa roſe to receive Mr. Hargrave, and eagerly enquired after his friend. "He is much better, Ladies," ſaid he; and I hope, Madam (addreſſing himſelf to Louiſa) will in a ſhort time be able
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:048426_0006_102547E5E7439ED8"/>to thank you as his guardian angel. Louiſa bluſhed; and only courtſied. Mr. Villars then begged Mr. Hargrave to inform them the manner of his friend's being wounded, and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leaving the camp.—"He told them, the day before they had had a ſmart ſkirmiſh—that the party returned with an account of Captain Bellmore's being miſſing. A deſerter coming in ſoon after, informed them he was lying on the field, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived not quite dead.—I immediately applied for a flag to go in ſearch of him; but the orders was to march, and it could not be obtained. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer was newly put in, or this would not have been the caſe.—Diſguſted with the brutality of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, and a heart bleeding for my friend, I took the advantage of the night, and left the camp in ſearch of him—it was near morning ere I found him. Alas! how can I deſcribe my feelings on ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in ſuch a ſituation. I took him in my arms to a river not far diſtant, waſhed the blood from his face, and bound up his wounds with my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief. After drinking a little water,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:048426_0007_102547E1188D56E0"/>he ſeemed to recover: I ſaw a light at a diſtance, and endeavored to carry him to it; but I was deceived—it was only a vapour.</p>
            <p>THE morn arrived, but with it no gleam of hope; I had wandered the whole day, ſupporting my friend, I may ſay, carrying him; for he frequently fainted. I had at length brought him to the bank of the river, where Miſs Villars found him. He had loſt ſo much blood, and was ſo exhauſted with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to travel, that I thought he would have expired. He begged me to leave him, and take care of myſelf. —"My dear Harry," ſaid he, "I feel I cannot live—why will you endanger yourſelf—comfort my parents—farewell my friend."</p>
            <p>I HAD not time to tell him, I would never leave him, when he again fainted. I ran for water to the river, when at my return, to my inexpreſſible joy, I beheld Miſs Villars. Heaven had heard my prayer, and ſent relief when I had deſpaired of finding it.—Mr. Villars and the Ladies, highly recommended Mr. Hargrave's humanity. The form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

That as he was ever an enemy to diſſimulation, he would adviſe him to write to the general, and inform him of every circumſtance, and in the interim, to give himſelf up as a priſoner of war; he made no doubt of his being very ſoon exchanged."</p>
            <p>THE young gentleman very politely thanked him for his advice, and ſaid he would be entirely directed by him; then ſeparated for the night, but not to ſleep. Mr. and Mrs. Villars, though they ſaw ſomething in Mr. Hargrave that intereſted them very much in his favor, they wiſhed to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly acquainted with him. Miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars gentle heart was touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: the ſcene ſhe had been witneſs to, preyed ſo forcibly on her ſpirits, that ſhe could not ſleep.

Mr. Hargrave was ſo rejoiced at his friend's recovery, that he forgot his own ſituation, until re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded by Mr. Villars; who propoſed going with him to his commanding officer, whoſe quarters was not above twenty miles diſtance. The buſineſs was ſoon ſettled; Mr. Villars procured for them leave of abſence, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the great ſatisfaction of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bellmore, who was much more anxious for his friend than himſelf. After a few days, he was able to ſit up; he begged Mr. Hargrave would intreat the Ladies permiſſion for him to thank them in perſon, for the favors he had received: he complied with his requeſt. Mrs. Villars told him, ſmiling, "ſhe was happy his friend was well enough to ſee company; that they would do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the pleaſure of taking a diſh of tea with him that afternoon.—Louiſa ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more lovely than uſual; her dreſs, which was ſimplicity itſelf, added to charms, already heightened by the

At that moment, the little ſpaniel jumped on her lap, and licked her hands: Louiſa careſſed him, and mentioned his coming to her on the bank of the river, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diſtreſs he ſeemed in. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to relate the many obliging things that was ſaid:—the afternoon paſſed away in a moſt agreeable manner: they parted equally pleaſed with each other. Capt.

"Can you be ſerious—do you think, ſaid Capt. Bellmore, "if it was, as you ſuppoſe, I could be guilty of trifling with ſuch a girl."

One day, after a converſation of this kind, Capt. Bellmore went to walk in a wood ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining the garden.

"No indeed, I do not," ſaid ſhe with an artleſs bluſh; at this he led her back to the ſeat, and taking one of her hands which he preſſed with ardour to his breaſt, "will then my moſt adored Miſs Villars permit me a few moments converſation."

He ſaid he ſhould not eſteem either, unleſs he could have the honor of laying them at her feet.—Poor Louiſa had undeſignedly led to the ſubject ſhe moſt wiſhed to avoid; not that it was diſagreeable to her; but her father had taught her to believe, that marriages without the ſanction of parents, would ever be unhappy; and from the ſketches ſhe had heard from the gentlemen's converſation of Sir John Bellmore's family, ſhe had no hope of his conſenting to his ſons marrying without the lady was poſſeſſed of a large fortune, ſhe endeavored to again wave the ſubject; but the opportunity was too favorable to his wiſhes to let it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; he threw himſelf at her feet, and opening his heart, told her, "it was not in the power of riches, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make him happy without her, that he had no great reaſon to imagine his father would conſent to his marriage, but he hoped as he had pretty good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the army, to be ſoon independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent."—Louiſa had heard him pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently

At theſe words ſhe roſe and was leaving the arbour, but he prevented her; and intreated "ſhe would not drive him to deſpair, to tell him at leaſt ſhe did not hate him."—"hate you, Captain Bellmore. Oh, heaven!—"If you do not hate me, my angel, ſaid he, do not make the life you ſaved miſerable, by refuſing me to hope for the only thing that can make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable." Their ſtay had been longer in the arbour than either imagined, and juſt as he had done ſpeaking, they heard Mr. Villars and Mr. Hargrave return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from hunting; Louiſa then inſiſted upon going, "as her mamma would wonder at her long ſtay." After ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her promiſe to hear him on the ſubject again, he permitted her to go, and took a walk to the woods, while Louiſa returned to the houſe.

Hargrave going up to her in a gay manner, aſked, whoſe "hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py brows was to be crowned with <hi>that</hi> wreath:" but ſaid he, ſmiling, "what is become of the Captain, has he been making wreaths too?" "I—I—I don't know," ſaid Louiſa, ſtammering; Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave thought by her confuſion, all was out: giving her a ſignificant look (which Louiſa perfectly underſtood,) "I will go look for him," ſaid he, "he is grown of late ſo fond of roſeat bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and purling ſtreams, that I am poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively afraid he'll turn poet." So ſaying he left her, and went in ſearch of the Captain, whom he found ſitting on the bank of the river, ſo loſt in thought, that he approached nigh enough to ſlap him on the ſhoulder before he perceived him: "Come," ſaid he, "Mr. Villars is making a bowl of currant punch, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

"You're a ſad rattling fellow, Harry, but your heart is at eaſe." "And ſo may your's be," anſwered Hargrave, "or I am much miſtaken." "I have ſeen Miſs Villars," ſaid the Captain, "and have told her all my doating heart feels for her; ſhe heard me, it is true—but would not give me the leaſt hopes of ever being mine contrary to my parent's conſent:" "Ha! ha! ha!

The family were now ſummoned to dinner,—after the cloth was removed, Miſs Villars ſaid "ſhe had that morning received a letter from Miſs Sommers."

"Did you never ſee her after," ſaid Louiſa. "Never," returned he, "I was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent on a diſtant expedition, and it has not been poſſibly in my power to viſit that city ſince. "You did not tell Miſs Villars," ſaid Captain Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, "what effect the bright eyes of her friend had on you. Indeed you nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaw a poor fellow more in love in your life."—"Bellmore, you dream," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Hargrave.—"It is more than you did at that time," returned the Captain, "I poſitively believe you did not ſleep in a month."—"Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave was not very dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

After many obliging things ſaid on both ſides, it was concluded, they ſhould ſet out in a fortnight.—Captain Bellmore had no opportunity of ſpeaking to Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa for ſome days;—when one evening, the gentlemen requeſted her to walk—with her Mamma's permiſſion, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.

            <p>Mr. SOMMERS had one day invited Captain Bellmore and his friend to dine. Soon after they came in, Mr. Hargrave told Mr. Sommers, "he had letters from Lord Beauclair, which mentioned this drafts being paid, and hoped he had the ſame account." Mr. Sommers ſaid he had.—At the name of Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair, Eliza ſtarted, and changed color: In the evening, ſhe aſked Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave if he was any relation to him. "A very diſtant one," replied he, "but he has been a father to me." "Pray," ſaid Eliza, "is Lady Beauclair living." "She is," returned Hargrave, "but why, my dear Eliza, does the name of Lord Beauclair ſeem to affect you;" (for during this diſcourſe ſhe has often changed color,) "I have heard," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Eliza, "he had a daughter he uſed very unkindly, and I can't hear his name without emotion: do they know ſhe is ſtill living." "They do not," replied he. "I have heard the wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſeveral years ago to the Eaſt-Indies with her family; I have often heard
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:048426_0024_102548204C5CFE48"/>Lady Beauclair lament her, but her name is never mentioned before my Lord."—"Good God," ſaid Eliza, "and her only fault, was marrying a worthy man with a ſmall fortune."—"And is that a ſmall fault, my beloved Eliza," ſaid he, claſping her in his arms. "Tell me, I pray, if you know any thing of this Lady or her family; for be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though I have been taught to look on myſelf as the heir of Lord Beauclair, if ever I am ſo happy as to find Lady Maria, I ſhall willingly reſign my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions in her favor." "Your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is truly meritorious," returned Miſs Sommers. "You may perhaps find Lady Maria, or ſome of her family:" "Ah! Miſs Sommers," ſaid he, "rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or titles could only make me happy for being acceptable to you; and I am confident, you would not prize ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly retained."—After a long and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er converſation, they parted equally pleaſed with each other.</p>
            <p>Miſs SOMMERS was torn between love and friendſhip; ſhe knew Lady Maria Beverly; but was not at liberty to diſcover her; and if ſhe did, ſhe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:048426_0025_102548234970FE00"/>would deprive the man ſhe moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of immenſe riches; but friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and juſtice were predominant. She determined to write to her friend for permiſſion to diſcover her, which ſhe immediately did.—Mr. Hargrave rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Captain Bellmore the above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation—they both concluded, Miſs Sommers muſt know ſomething of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Maria; but thought it beſt not to preſs her farther at preſent, as ſhe might not perhaps be at liberty to diſcover her. Not long after this, Mr. Hargrave attended Miſs Sommers and her ſiſter, to ſpend the evening at Mrs. Hardy's. —Doctor Squills by accident dropt in, he ſaid he had juſt come from the priſon, and his feelings had not for a long time been ſo hurt. "A very decent woman was brought there ſome days before," continued he. "She is very ill, and I fear cannot live if ſhe is not removed to a more comfortable place:"—"pray what is ſhe charged with?" demanded Hargrave, "upon my word I cannot tell" returned the Doctor, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

He was no ſooner gone, than ſome of the company expreſſed great ſurpriſe, at what they had heard.—Captain Bellmore who had dropped in accidentally, briefly related his being wounded, and the diſintereſted behaviour of Mr. Hargrave; which he ſuppoſed had given riſe to the report that frightened poor Mrs. Carely.

Accordingly, as ſoon as the cloth was removed, Mr. Villars began as follows:</p>
            <p>MY father was the youngeſt ſon of an ancient family in Cumberland, of the name of Villars. My grandfather, at an advanced age, married a widow of ſmall fortune; ſhe had one daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother poſſeſſed of a great deal of art, ſoon made a match between her and my father's elder brother. She had great aſcendancy over my grandfather, and found means to withdraw his affection from his younger children.—My father and a ſiſter of twelve years of age, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:048426_0028_1025482D268C9760"/>ſent to a boarding-ſchool, and never allowed to come home. At my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's death, they found themſelves thrown on the world, poſſeſſed of a very few hundreds.—Miſs Villars took her father's uſage ſo much to heart, that ſhe died not long after.—She was in her eighteenth year when this melancholy event took place. My father who was of a lively turn, ſubmitted to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of fortune, and ſtrove to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: he had ſtudied the law, but did not pay ſuch ſtrict attention to it as he ought.—When he had entered his two and twentieth year, a brother of my grandfather's mother died, and left my father an eſtate near Bath, of ſix hundred pounds a year; with which he was to take the name of Beverly. He ſoon after married Miſs Louiſa Herbert, a very accompliſhed young Lady, with a fortune of ten thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>A YEAR after their marriage, I was born; and in two years more, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſecond addition to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the birth of a daughter.—Nothing material happened during our minority, until I attained my nineteenth
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:048426_0028_1025482D268C9760"/>year. My father paid the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to our education, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently lived to the extent of his income.) My mother often remonſtrated to little purpoſe; he was not of a diſpoſition to brook reſtraint.</p>
            <p>AT that age, I left the univerſity; my father intended me for the army, but my mother would never conſent to it; and was with difficulty prevailed on, to conſent to my making the tour of France and Italy, the enſuing year; which I did, accompanied by my friend Beaucamp, and his worthy father; who acted as governor to us both.—Whilſt abroad, I became acquainted with Lord Sidly, ſon to the Earl of Beauclair. He was pleaſed to profeſs the greateſt friendſhip for me; indeed it was amply returned;—and I ſhall ever ſincerely regret his loſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS ſtopped and wiped his eyes. "We ſtayed," continued he, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Lady Maria aſked for her brother; I told her "we had left him at the theatre; but if ſhe wiſhed, I would return and ſeek him." —"O, no!" ſaid ſhe, "do not leave me."—I preſſing her hand to my heart, told her, I would wiſh never to leave her;—her head was ſtill reclined on my ſhoulder.—At theſe words ſhe ſighed, and ſtarting, withdrew the hand I preſſed, ſaying, "excuſe me, Mr. Beverly, I have been exceedingly fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened." The coach now ſtopped, and I attended her to the parlour. Lady Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair aſked, "why they came home ſo ſoon, and what had become of Lord Sidly." I related what had happened. "I have cauſed a great deal of trouble to Mr. Beverly," ſaid Lady Maria; "he was ſo good as to carry me a conſiderable diſtance in his arms." I could only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her by a look, which I thought ſhe underſtood. The day following, the Hon. Charles Sidly ſet out on his trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. His departure afforded mutual concern, as he was to take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>SOON after this, I returned home, I correſponded with Lord Sidly, but dared not mention my beloved Maria, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the dictates of my heart. When the bathing ſeaſon came on, he wrote me, that he ſhould ſoon wait on Lady Maria to Bath, as ſhe was in ill health, and begged me to procure him lodgings; which I immediately did, and waited with impatience for their arrival. It was not long before I received a card with the welcome intelligence. I flew to their lodgings, Lord Sidly met me on the ſtairs, and expreſſed the greateſt happineſs at ſeeing me. Lady Maria aroſe as I entered; ſhe looked very pale and languid: I begged her to be ſeated, and told her, "I was grieved to owe the happineſs of ſeeing her, to ill health." Lord Sidly ſoon left the room;—I was thrown from my guard, and ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a more tender nature, than I had ever dared before: ſhe ſeemed much affected, but I thought not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.—In the evening, I attended my ſiſter Caroline to her lodgings.—They
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:048426_0030_1024A57E30370868"/>were equally pleaſed with each other; and the next day we went to the rooms. The Ladies prefered walking home; as it was but a very ſhort diſtance, Lord Sidly gave his arm to Caroline, and I offered mine to Lady Maria. We had not proceeded far, when ſhe ſaid, "you know not how unhappy I have been, Mr. Beverly, ſince you left us." She then told me, "that her Papa had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the addreſſes of Lord Winter; whom I knew was very diſagreeable to her: that he had given her poſitive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to prepare to marry him.—And had it not been for the interceſſion of her brother, who had prevailed on him to allow her a little time, ſhe ſhould e're this have been dragged to the altar." She ſaid, "ſhe would rather die, than marry that deſerted Lord, which ſhe ſuppoſed ſhe ſhould be obliged to do when ſhe returned." This was like fire to my brain; though I had no right to hope.

We had now reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the houſe: Lord Sidly inſiſted upon our ſpending the day with them.—My father waited on him the next day, and invited them to dine; they accepted the invitation. That and many more days we ſpent together. I was no longer maſter of myſelf: I declared my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without reſerve, and pathetically lamented my hard fortune; I had the pleaſure to find ſhe was not diſpleaſed: but would ſay, "O! Beverly, I am ſufficiently wretched, do not add to my diſtreſs, by making me think I am the cauſe of unhappineſs to you."</p>
            <p>THUS we had ſpent ſix weeks, when one evening at an aſſembly, we were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted by Lord Winter: he told Lady Maria, "he had juſt arrived from town; and as he did not know where ſhe lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he expected to have the pleaſure of meeting her there: and very careleſsly begged her to go down the next dance with him. She anſwered, "ſhe ſhould dance but little, and was engaged;" "who is the happy perſon that uſurps

               </gap> right," ſaid he, indignantly. "Very well my Lady, perhaps I may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to wait on you home neither?" —"Very probable, my Lord," replied ſhe. At that moment, the dance was called—as I advanced, ſhe aroſe and gave me her hand; ſhe trembled ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, ſhe could ſcarcely move. When the dance was over, ſeeing her very much flurried, I led her to a ſeat, and called her brother and Caroline to her. I told Lord Sidly, the ſight of Lord Winter had affected her ſo much, ſhe was near fainting.—"Lord Winter here!" ſaid he: "Damn him, he'll be the death of the girl yet."</p>
            <p>IN the courſe of the evening, Lord Winter had learnt, "I was the only one that had attended Lady Maria ſince her arrival at Bath: that ſhe ſpent the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of her time at our houſe; in ſhort, it was ſuppoſed, I was her favored admirer." He advanced, and addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to her, aſked "if he ſhould order his chariot."—She thanked him; but ſaid, "ſhe ſhould return with her brother;"—Lord Sidly gave him a card, and begged the favor of his company ſo
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:048426_0032_1025483AE427FB40"/>dine the next day: he returned a ſlight bow, and retired to a little diſtance, where he could obſerve who went into the carriage.—I led Lady Maria to the door; when Lord Sidly ſaid, "Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I muſt ſee you to-morrow morning." —I went accordingly, and learnt Lady Maria had been ſo ill all night, ſhe was not able to come down to breakfaſt. "I cannot conceive," ſaid Lord Sidly, "why my father inſiſts on ſacrificing the girl for riches."—"Oh! my Lord," cried I, "do you know no way to ſave her?"—He ſaw my emotion, but taking no notice of it, ſaid, "what can I do for her? can't you adviſe me?"—"I could, but"—"but what," ſaid he ſmiling, "I ſuppoſe you would adviſe me to get ſome clever fellow to take her out of his way."—"My Lord," ſaid I, ſtarting, "be not amazed, would not you like to aſſiſt me in preventing this match?"—"I would willingly loſe my life, to contribute to her felicity." "But if I'm not miſtaken, you muſt preſerve your life, to make her happy." "Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry," continued he, "I will trifle no longer. I have long ſeen the affection
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:048426_0032_1025483AE427FB40"/>between you and Maria; and with my parent's conſent, no man on earth I would as ſoon call brother—but as it is, I can't bear to ſee her wretched. I am ſenſible the blame will fall on me, but I am better able to bear it."</p>
            <p>I know not what I ſaid to him; my extacy may more eaſily be imagined than defined. I would have fell at his feet, and embraced his knees; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting me, he ſaid "if I acted like ſuch a crazy fellow, he would not truſt his ſiſter with me."—He then left me, to go to her, with whom he ſoon returned; and leading her to the ſofa, ſaid, Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Maria is quite chagrined at Lord Winter's not calling on her this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I have recommended an hour's converſation with you, to recover her ſpirits. So ſaying, he ſmiled and left us. "Brother!" exclaimed ſhe, with ſurpriſe: I flew to her, and folding her in my arms, told her what had paſſed between Lord Sidly and myſelf. We now gave a looſe to the moſt endearing ſenſations, and for a time forgot the many bars to our union.</p>
            <p>WE had been nearly two hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:048426_0033_1025483CC96113C8"/>when Lord Sidly returned; he ſeemed thoughtful, and walked the room ſometime without ſpeaking; then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, he ſaid Lord Winter had left Bath; that he had made particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries concerning me, and was heard to ſay, "Lord Beauclair ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his children's behaviour." "What is to be done, Beverly?" con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he.—I told him, "I thought no time was to be loſt; and begged him to let us ſet out immediately for Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land."</p>
            <p>IT was accordingly determined, we ſhould be off at four that afternoon. To prevent ſuſpicion, we were to go the firſt ſtage in Lord Sidly's chariot; he had ſent a truſty ſervant on, to provide a poſt-chaiſe. Lord Sidly and my ſiſter were the only perſons in the ſecret; I took all the money I had by me, which amounted to two hundred guineas.—I left a letter for my father, which I told Caroline not to give him, until the next evening, as we ſhould by that time be out of reach.</p>
            <p>LORD Sidly, at parting, put a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note of fifteen hundred pounds in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:048426_0033_1025483CC96113C8"/>hand; ſhe was very much affected, and ſaid, "O, my brother! what will you not ſuffer on my account." "If you are happy, my dear girl, I ſhall be amply repaid." About nine miles from Bath, we took a poſt-chaiſe, and Lord Sidly's carriage returned: honeſt John had provided relays at every ſtage, ſo that we were not obliged to wait a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We had travelled all night, but the next day, poor Maria was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, we were obliged to reſt ſome hours. We arrived without any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Maria bore the journey much better than I had expected ſhe would. We were immediately married, and took lodgings, as I thought it beſt not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn directly.</p>
            <p>THE report of our being eloped, did not ſpread in Bath, until the afternoon following our departure.—My father was extremely enraged; his proud ſpirit could not brook my being deſpiſed, as he was certain I ſhould be by Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair's family; and he made no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:048426_0034_1025483E622220F0"/>LORD Winter had no ſooner arrived in town, than he waited on Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair, and told him, it was currently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that Lady Maria received the addreſſes of Mr. Beverly, and Lord Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encouraged it. It is impoſſible to expreſs the rage of his lordſhip, on this information: he diſpatched a ſervant to his ſon with orders to return immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, without mentioning the cauſe—before he received the letter, the news of our elopement and marriage, had reached town;—Lord Beauclair's rage was now beyond all bounds;—he wrote to my father in the moſt approbious manner; and alſo to Lord Sidly, in which he forbid him ever to appear in his preſence; that he forever renounced Maria; and was determined never to hear any interpoſition in favor of either of them.</p>
            <p>LORD Sidly was extremely diſtreſſed on reading his father's letter; he did not think he would have carried his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch lengths.—He immediately ſet out for London. Upon his arrival, he went directly to his father's: when a ſervant ſaid, he had orders to tell him he
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:048426_0034_1025483E622220F0"/>had no home there.—He took lodgings near, and wrote to his mother in the moſt affecting manner.—After writing a third letter, he received an anſwer, by Suſan Artleſs, Lady Maria's maid.—This was much colder than he expected from her. She informed him, Lord Beauclair was determined not to ſee him: and begged he would never mention her diſobedient daughter to her; that Suſan ſhould be ordered to pack up her clothes and jewels, which ſhould be ſent to her; and deſired him to let her know, it was all ſhe had to expect. Poor Suſan wept bitterly, and begged ſhe might go to her miſtreſs, which ſhe ſoon after did.</p>
            <p>THO' Lord Sidly had only ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a year independent of his father, he was determined never again to ſeek his favor; but immediately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a majority in a marching regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſtined for the Eaſt-Indies—from whence he never returned.</p>
            <p>HERE Mr. Villars ſtopped, from an incapability of proceeding.—He after ſome time thus continued: "Some weeks after our marriage, Suſan arrived with my wife's trunks, and a letter from
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:048426_0035_1025484491E14D10"/>Lord Sidly; he mentioned his going to India, but ſaid he would pay us a viſit before he ſailed.—Maria and I had both wrote to Lord Beauclair; and our let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had been returned unopened; ſhe could bear with greater fortitude, their cruelty to herſelf, than to her brother; it moſt ſenſibly affected us, that he ſhould ſuffer ſo much for us; he ſpent a fortnight with us before he ſailed, and ſeemed perfectly chearful.—He told my wife to be entirely eaſy, on his account, that leaving her happy, would be a great means of making him ſo. Soon after he left us, we received a letter from him, in which he impowered me to draw upon his banker for two hundred a year, until his return.</p>
            <p>MY wife diſpoſed of her jewels; the ſale of which amounted to fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; this we added to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lord Sidly had ſo generouſly made his ſiſter, and purchaſed a ſmall eſtate in my father's neighborhood. But, alas! a cloud was now hanging over our heads, which burſt with all its force.</p>
            <p>MY father had been obliged to mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his eſtate for ſeveral hundreds.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:048426_0035_1025484491E14D10"/>Lord Beauclair bought the mortgage, and immediately cloſed it; this height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my father's reſentment againſt me; he had never been perfectly reconciled; he ſaid, he was convinced I ſhould be his ruin.—My wife propoſed mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our eſtate, to clear his, but he would not accept of it. His was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſold for much leſs than the value. —My ſiſter was juſt married to Colonel Montgomery, and went with him to Scotland. Had my father been pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he ſtill had ſufficient to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably; but his ſpirit was too great to retrench.</p>
            <p>AFTER his affairs were ſettled, there were ſeven thouſand pounds remaining, which he placed in the hands of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent broker: took a houſe in Bath; and lived as uſual.—A year after our marriage, my Maria preſented me with a ſon, whom we named Henry, after Lord Sidly.</p>
            <p>HERE Mr. Villars ceaſed—the tears flowed ſo faſt, he was obliged to leave the room; in a ſhort time he returned, and thus continued: "When my ſon was about ſix months old; Lord and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:048426_0036_10254849690C58B8"/>Lady Beauclair came to Bath. One day Lady Beauclair ſaw the nurſe and child walking before my father's door, (for though very much incenſed with me, ſhe was fond of my child, and would often ſend for him.)—She ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and aſked whoſe child it was: when ſhe was told, ſhe ſtarted and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; then returning, told the nurſe to ſtep into a milliner's ſhop with her; ſhe careſſed the infant. "It is a ſweet boy," ſaid ſhe. She then took a gold medal, and tied it by a ribbon round the child's neck: the nurſe aſked if ſhe ſhould tell Mrs. Beverly to whom ſhe was obliged. She anſwered, "it was not material."—When the nurſe came home, ſhe acquainted my wife with the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.—My poor Maria was near faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſhe knew the medal, and found her mother was ſtill determined not to ſee her.—She, however, reſolved again to write, but they left Bath the next day.</p>
            <p>MY father's affairs now became deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate—his creditors preſſed upon him, and we determined to mortgage our eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and ſend him relief as from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known hand. We raiſed eight hundred
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:048426_0036_10254849690C58B8"/>pounds, which we ſent, encloſed in a blank paper. But, alas! we were only involving ourſelves, without doing him any ſervice. His debts were to a much greater amount than we were worth, and I ſaw him dragged to the priſon without the power to aſſiſt him.</p>
            <p>I applied to ſeveral of his friends in town, but Lord Beauclair had prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them againſt him. He ſuffered but a few months—he was ſeized with a fever that carried him off within a few weeks.</p>
            <p>HOW can I expreſs my feelings?—I looked upon myſelf as acceſſary to his misfortune. The creditors took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every thing: my poor mother ſuffered in ſilence, and never reproached me; ſhe ſoon went to Scotland to my ſiſter, as Col. Montgomery had preſſed her to ſpend the remainder of her days with them. She was ſcarcely gone, when Mr. Granville, the gentleman from whom we borrowed the money demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediate payment. Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair would not appear in this; but I have been ſince informed, he perſuaded Mr. Granville to act in the manner he did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:048426_0037_1025484D10BB91C0"/>I WAS now obliged to apply to a broker, and to give an exhorbitant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. It is needleſs to mention the many misfortunes that attended me in the courſe of two years; I was obliged to ſell my eſtate. I had now one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds left; with which I ſtill continued in trade, with a merchant in Briſtol. Our whole ſtock was now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in one bottom, and the fate of that was uncertain; troubles ſeemed to thicken upon us; anxiety for my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (for I had now two children) entirely depreſſed my ſpirits: but fortune had ſtill greater evils in ſtore; we had been but three years married, when we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accounts of Lord Sidly's death: this ſtroke was almoſt too much for my poor Maria; but heaven ſupported her through it. He had left a will with her, which we opened, and found he had made her his heir: I commiſſioned a gentleman to wait on Lord Beauclair with a copy of the will; his Lordſhip flew in a violent rage, ſaid that "Lord Henry had been very imprudent, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us any thing while he was abroad; that the will was a vile forgery, and I
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:048426_0037_1025484D10BB91C0"/>ſhould ſuffer for it." He was indeed as good as his word; for three days after, I received his anſwer and was arreſted for forgery.</p>
            <p>I WILL not pretend to figure my aſtoniſhment, or my dear Maria's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; we did not imagine, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord Beauclair's threats, that he would have gone to ſuch lengths. The unfeeling bailiff pulled my wife, who was juſt ſinking into my arms, from me, and inhumanly dragged me away as Great God! ſhall I ever forget this ſcene or the cries of my little Henry, who was not three years old." Here Mr. Villars was obliged to ſtop for ſometime, and then went on as follows:</p>
            <p>"I begged the bailiff to be patient; that I was certain I could obtain bail." —He ſaid, "he had orders to admit of none."—We then proceeded to a cloſe uncomfortable gaol, where I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I was to remain until I had my trial. —Mr. Traffic (the gentleman with whom I had commenced but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:048426_0038_1025484F357B1DC8"/>unfortunately for us, Sir William Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, one of the witneſſes, was in India; the other, a Mr. Scrip, an attorney, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately abſconded; we made the ſtricteſt ſearch for him, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and it was ſuppoſed he was well paid for his abſence.</p>
            <p>MY wife wrote a moſt pathetic letter to her mother, and received for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, "That it was entirely out of her power to do any thing for her, unleſs ſhe would conſent to part from me; on thoſe conditions ſhe would be reinſtated in their favor; that ſhe would take her ſon under their own particular care; and I ſhould be releaſed, on promiſing to quit the country immediately, and never return; and that I ſhould have a month to conſider of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>"</p>
            <p>THIS was ſent by a ſervant of Lord Beauclair's, who told Maria, he believed his miſtreſs was compelled to write as ſhe did; for ſhe wept very much when ſhe gave him the letter. Maria anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it immediately; ſhe ſaid it required no time to conſider; that though ſhe was determined to live and die with me, and truſted to a juſt God, who knew
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:048426_0038_1025484F357B1DC8"/>my innocence, to ſee me righted;—to be reconciled to her mother, was her moſt earneſt wiſh; but was grieved, it could not be accompliſhed but on terms ſhe never would conſent to.</p>
            <p>I HAD remained ſix months in gaol, during which time, Mr Traffic had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived accounts of our veſſel having made a loſing voyage. My wife took a lodging contiguous to the gaol, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the few ſervants we kept, except my ſon's nurſe, whoſe huſband and child were both dead; and her attachment to my ſon was ſo great, ſhe ſaid ſhe would never leave us.</p>
            <p>MY wife had one day, brought the children to ſee me; I was careſſing them whilſt ſhe leaned over me, the tears flowing faſt down her cheeks, when the door opened, and the Hon. Charles Sidly, (now Lord Sidly, who we had not heard was returned) entered. Tho' he had not ſo much tenderneſs in his diſpoſition as his brother, he could not behold this ſcene unaffected. He ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly embraced his ſiſter, ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:048426_0039_102548531C8836E8"/>up." He ſaid that Lord Beauclair had been more exasperated againſt us ſince Lord Sidly's death, knowing that his unkindneſs to him, which drove him abroad, was entirely owing to us: He begged we would keep up our ſpirits; he did not in the leaſt doubt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of the will, (which we had ſhewn him) and hoped we might have it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> our power to prove it.—He ſeemed much amazed, when we informed him of Mr. Scrip's ſudden diſappearance. At parting, he put a note of five hundred pounds in Maria's hand, and ſaid he would ſee us again ſhortly.</p>
            <p>I NOW ſet about ſettling my affairs, as I was reſolved to leave England, as ſoon as I could procure my liberty.—At the end of three weeks, Lord Sidly arrived, with an order for my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He ſaid he was ſorry to own, his father ſeemed unreaſonably incenſed againſt us; and he would adviſe me to leave England, at leaſt for a time. That I might depend upon his intereſt, though he did not dare openly to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe my cauſe.—I told him, it was our intention, as I had no wiſh to ſtay i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:048426_0039_102548531C8836E8"/>place, in which I had experienced ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rubs from fortune.—He then gave me a note for £. 400, and told me I might every year draw upon him for the like ſum, through Mr. Traffic; and if ever the will could be proved, he ſhould with pleaſure reſign the eſtate his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er left us.</p>
            <p>WE now prepared for our departure; we took our paſſage in a ſhip ready to ſail for India. Mr. Traffic gave me let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his friends in Madeira, as the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was to touch there. We were juſt ready to ſail, when we were informed, that Lord Sidly was dead, occaſioned by a fall from his horſe; and that in his laſt moments, he had beſeeched his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to remember their unhappy daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. We were now again overwhelmed with grief and deſpair; this ſhock had ſo great an effect on my poor Maria's health, that we were near loſing our paſſage. She, however, exerted the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of her ſtrength, and we went on board.</p>
            <p>I LEFT Lord Sidly's will with Mr. Traffic, and a power (if it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,) to ſue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the eſtate. I made no
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:048426_0040_1025485807DE7338"/>doubt, but Lord Beauclair's hatred would ſtill follow me; ſo thought it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to change my name to Villars, which indeed was my real one; but as I never had received any of the eſtate of Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I was not obliged to keep the name. Our whole fortune, after providing for our ſea ſtores, amounted to no more than twelve hundred pounds. We took no ſervant with us, but Mrs. Worthy, the nurſe, and a girl that attended Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, who was eleven months old.</p>
            <p>THE fourth of June, 1766, we ſailed. The weather was exceeding fine, and continued ſo, till the next afternoon, when a guſt ſuddenly came up. The veſſel rolled exceſſively, and my wife and poor little Henry were very ſick. Mrs. Worthy took him for the benefit of the air, on deck, but unuſed to the motion of a ſhip, her head turned; ſhe reeled, and fell overboard—and I never ſaw them more."—Here Mr. Villars was for ſome time incapable of proceeding. "It is needleſs" continued he, after it had recovered himſelf, "to deſcribe our diſtreſs on this occaſion: the veſſel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately brought too, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>MY wife continued in fits for many hours; after they left her, ſhe remained in a violent fever, and in her delirium was continually calling for her child; and it was many days e'er ſhe became more tranquil.—I now ſaw it was the will of the Almighty to chaſtiſe us, and prayed fervently for fortitude, to ſupport the trial I was in all probability to go through. Our attention was now rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the illneſs of our little Louiſa; who had been obliged to be weaned, during her mother's illneſs; ſhe was for many days ſo bad, that we did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſhe would have got to Madeira alive. After a ſhort paſſage we reached that Iſland; I had letters to many of the principal Merchants there, which not long after our arrival I delivered; and received the greateſt politeneſs from them.</p>

I alſo incloſed letters to my mother and ſiſter, whom I had not heard from in ſome time; I placed my ſmall ſtock in a principal houſe, and was enabled to live tolerably well.</p>
            <p>NOTHING material happened, during our reſidence in Madeira; except my wife preſenting me with another ſon, whom we called Edward, after my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—The climate not agreeing with either of us; we embarked for Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. We were now poſſeſſed of about two thouſand pounds ſterling. "To you ſir," addreſſing himſelf to Mr. Sommers, "I was recommended, and have received the greateſt marks of friendſhip from many gentlemen in this town.—I have lived ſeveral years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably; and had it not been for the recollection of paſt misfortunes, I might ſay happily.—Here my youngeſt ſon was born, who after the Hon.

            <p>Mr. VILLARS here ended his ſtory; and the company expreſſed the greateſt obligations to him for his condeſcenſion.

It was very late before Miſs Sommers finiſhed her letter, which ſhe diſpatched early next morning.</p>
            <p>AT two o'clock, Captain Bellmore and Mr. Hargrave attended the Ladies to Col. Rightly's, as Mr. Sommers had buſineſs that would engage him till late. The old gentleman received them with his uſual politeneſs, and paſſed many encomiums on the generous behaviour of Hargrave, in which all the company
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:048426_0043_102548600853F158"/>joined him. Mr. Villars and Mr. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers ſoon joined them, and the day was ſpent with the utmoſt cordiality. Soon after dinner Mr. Hargrave went out of the room, and ſtayed ſome time. Mrs. Sommers, addreſſing herſelf to Colonel Rightly, ſaid, "I dare ſay our young friend has gone to pay a viſit to his old nurſe:" "No doubt of it madam," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he. He then informed Mr. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the many particulars relating to Mrs. Carely; "come," continued he, "we will paſs her room, as if by chance, and you will be more than ever delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Hargrave. I think he never appears in a more amiable light, than when he is ſaying obliging things to this poor woman." Mr. Villars then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. The room door was open; they entered.—"Harry," ſaid Colonel Rightly, "I am going to aſk Mr. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars's opinion of ſome curioſities in my greenhouſe; will you be of the party?" Mrs. Carely roſe as they entered, on ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Villars, ſhe ſtarted, and ſeemed very much aſtoniſhed; Mr. Villars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

"Oh!" ſaid he, ſhe is ſo like — He had no time to ſay more, ſhe flew to him, and graſping his knees, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, it is he—it is he himſelf, and fell ſenſeleſs on the floor. Mr. Hargrave ran for water, while Col. Rightly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to lay her on the bed.

An account of Mrs. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's ſituation reached the reſt of the company, who all immediately went to her room; ſhe at length opened her eyes, but ſeemed inſenſible who were around her.

            <p>Mrs. CARLEY was now ſufficiently recovered, to tell Mr. Villars they were taken up by a fiſherman; that after much trouble and difficulty, ſhe had conveyed the child to his Grand-Mama, where he was brought up in ignorance of his birth.—When her ſpirits were more compoſed, ſhe ſaid, ſhe would give him all the particulars.</p>

            <p>CAPT.

The day you mention, was to me the moſt diſtreſſing; and it has proved the moſt fortunate of my life."</p>
            <p>COL. Rightly now informed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies tea was waiting. They then bid Mrs. Carely good night, and returned to the parlour.—After tea, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany returned to Mr. Sommers's, and the evening was ſpent with the greateſt ſatisfaction.—Mr. Villars, long a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to happineſs, now confeſſed, that thus unexpectedly meeting with his ſon, and finding him ſo amiable, amply compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated for all the troubles he had met with.

            <p>"YOU no doubt ſir, remember maſter Harry was very ſick, and I carried him on deck for the benefit of the air; it was careleſs in me to walk ſo near the ſide of the veſſel. I know not what it was, but ſomething ſtruck me, and I fell overboard; I claſped the child in my arms, and I believe for ſome time I float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the water; the firſt I remember was finding myſelf in a dirty fiſhing-boat, with two men; they carried us to a ſhore which was not far diſtant, and which they told me was the coaſt of Ireland. I was too weak to walk, and one of the men ſupported me, while the other carried the child; they carried me to a neat little houſe near the banks of the river, and the women ſupplied us with dry clothes; the dear child ſeemed almoſt inſenſible to every thing till the next day, he then cried very much for his Mama. The good woman allowed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:048426_0048_102548701D83A618"/>me to apply for a ſervice, which I did; but I could learn very little with the child. I had three guineas, which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to keep, to pay our paſſage to England.</p>
            <p>I WORKED a year in Ireland, to get myſelf and the child a few clothes; but this I could not have accompliſhed, had it not been for the humanity of the lady with whom I lived. I told her and no one elſe, who we were; and ſhe adviſed me to write to Lord Beauclair. This I did not as I knew it would be in vain: but I wiſhed much to go to England, and ſhe was ſo good as to furniſh me with neceſſaries for the paſſage.</p>
            <p>THE poor dear child had forgot to call on his papa and mama; and I would not remind him of them, as I thought it beſt in our preſent ſituation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I begged him to tell me if there was any accounts from you; he ſaid he had been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you had ſailed for India; that the ſhip was loſt, and it was ſuppoſed, all had periſhed.</p>
            <p>OH! Sir, I now indeed thought my heart would have broke.—This very night our dear child fell ſick, occaſioned by fatigue; we ſtopped at a ſmall farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and were obliged to ſtay there ſeveral weeks; the child remained long ſick, and had he been well, I knew not where to go; I had but one brother, (and he lived in Wales) and no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that had it in their power to ſerve me. The ſickly looks of my poor boy prevented any one's hiring me; I was reduced to my laſt crown, when a tho't ſtruck me, that if Lady Beauclair ſaw the child, ſhe might perhaps have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on him, as his parents were dead, their hatred might be at an end: I thought ſhe would know him by the medal, which you recollect, Sir, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

I ſet out the next day, carrying the child on my back, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would walk a little way. I ſold the beſt gown I had, and was enabled to hire a lodging every night. We at length arrived in London; and I waited on Lady Beauclair, at a time I knew his Lordſhip was out.

I had thanked her, and was taking my leave, when the child began to cry.—"What is the matter with him nurſe," ſaid her Ladyſhip, "nurſe." cried the child, "I uſed to call her nurſe, and there was ſomebody I uſed to call Papa and Mama—but they are all gone now," ſaid he crying, "and I have no friend left but my poor mother here: won't you, madam, be my friend?"

Go home, nurſe, continued ſhe "and be ſure you let no one know whoſe child he is." I ſoon after took my leave. I went again in a few days; her Ladyſhip aſked me very particularly, if I had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her orders? I told her I had; ſhe then told me ſhe would ſee me in a ſhort time in company with Lord Beauclair, and that I muſt not contradict any thing ſhe ſaid.

Mr. Sommers had for ſome time ſeen an attachment between his young friend and daughter, and would never have been averſe to the match; but now to hear him ſpeak in this manner, was quite beyond his moſt ſanguine expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. "My Lord," ſaid he, "I hope Eliza is ſenſible of the honour you do her, nothing can give me more pleaſure than ſuch a connection; though your fortune is more than ſhe has a right to expect; believe me, I eſteem your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues much higher, and ſhould have been happy, had you put it in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to have convinced you, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent would have as freely been given to Mr. Hargrave as to Lord Beauclair." "Oh! Sir," returned his Lordſhip, "you have long ſince convinced me of

               </gap> power, the treaſure you have beſtowed on me; her happineſs ſhall be my chief ſtudy."</p>
            <p>DURING the above converſation, Miſs Sommers retired to the window, to avoid confuſion; he went to her, and preſſing her to his boſom, ſaid, "my dear Eliza, you ſay nothing." "You cannot, my Lord," returned ſhe, "think me inſenſible of the honor your Lordſhip does me." "This ſtill from <hi>you,</hi> my Eliza—I am ſtill your Henry, ſpeak to me as you uſed to do, and I am happy." "If any thing I can ſay or do will make you happy, believe me, you will never be otherwiſe. "Come, come, my dear," ſaid Mr. Sommers to his Lady, "I ſee theſe young people ſeem to underſtand each other ſo well, I believe they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with our company." So ſaying, they left the room.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair told her, there was an abſolute neceſſity for his going im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to England: and earneſtly begged to have the ceremony performed
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:048426_0060_102548A16A37ADA0"/>before he went. — The thought of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drew tears from Eliza. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, to his wiſhes; and it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the marriage ſhould take place as ſoon as Mr. Villars's family could come to town.</p>
            <p>IT was late when they parted; Lord Beauclair, retired to write to Lady Beauclair, as an opportunity offered for England. He wrote to her in the moſt affectionate manner, giving her a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his meeting with his parents, his engagements with Miſs Sommers, and his intention of ſoon returning; he ſaid nothing of a deſign he had of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading his father and his family to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with him to England, leſt he ſhould fail.—He ſpent the next day with his Eliza, and the following ſet out for—, where he ſoon arrived.</p>
            <p>MRS. Villars bore the death of her father, with greater reſignation than her ſon expected; his having mentioned her with kindneſs in his laſt moments. ſeemed a great conſolation. "He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> forgiven me!" exclaimed ſhe, claſping her hands, "he no doubt, bleſſed me
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:048426_0060_102548A16A37ADA0"/>with his dying breath! and I am happy; my mother too! could I once more throw myſelf at her feet."</p>
            <p>"YOU ſhall, my deareſt madam," anſwered Lord Beauclair; it is my earneſt deſire that we will return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land."—"What," ſaid Mr. Villars, "go to a place where I have never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced any thing but trouble."—"Every comfort awaits you now, my dear Sir;—If the fifteen thouſand pounds my Grandfather has left my Mother, is inſufficient, as much of my fortune as you wiſh to make uſe of, is entirely at your ſervice."</p>
            <p>AH! my Henry, ſuch a Son as you are, can be refuſed nothing. Fifteen thouſand pounds is much more than we want for your Mother; and I will never alter our manner of living. If we go with you to England, we muſt inſiſt on living retired." In this he was joined by Mrs. Villars.</p>
            <p>THEIR amiable ſon took a hand of each. "You ſhall live as you pleaſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>LOUISA roſe with the ſun, and ſtole from her ſiſter, who had juſt fallen in a deep ſleep. She went to the ſaloon
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:048426_0070_102548C479D5A618"/>where, as ſhe expected, ſhe meet Capt. Bellmore, who had no more inclination for ſleep than herſelf. "My dear Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa," ſaid he; "why will you riſe ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; you have no regard for your health." —"O!" I am quite well; you muſt now tell me what has happened, I cannot bear this ſuſpenſe." He then led her to a ſettee, and briefly related what the reader is already informed of. She heard him with a tolerable degree of compoſure. "So," cried ſhe, with a ſigh; when he concluded, "you had determined to obey him."—"But partly my love; could I expect my Louiſa would marry a beggar!—My determination was to go to India, and endeavor to acquire a competence, which, if I ſucceeded in, to return to you—if I failed—to die in a foreign country."</p>
            <p>"COULD you conſent to leave me?" ſaid ſhe, the tears ſtarting from her eyes: "Eaſily, my Louiſa," tenderly preſſing her to his boſom; "Heaven knows the conflicts of my heart; your diſcerning eye perceived it. The tender manner in which you aſked the cauſe, threw me off my guard, and I abſolutely uttered
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:048426_0071_102548C81B02F678"/>words that ſo much affected you: But, Oh! my Louiſa, to find myſelf ſo dear to you, compenſates for all I have met with."</p>
            <p>JUST now Eliza entered, and rallied Louiſa ſeverely, for giving her the ſlip. She imagined Capt. Bellmore had related his ſtory to her, and was happy to ſee her ſo compoſed. They were ſoon ſummoned to breakfaſt; Louiſa ſeemed much confuſed at meeting the reſt of the Family; but her indiſpoſition was ſlightly touched on; and the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion changed to a different ſubject.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair thought no time like the preſent, and went as ſoon as dreſſed, to wait on Miſs Lovemore; he ſent up his name; ſhe had ſeen him, and had heard of his new acquired title, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered herſelf, his Lordſhip would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the train of her admirers, as ſhe had not heard of his marriage; ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Bellmore, and the connection which he heard was to take place. "O Lord," I hate theſe made up matches; I am certain I ſhall deteſt him, and my Father need not think I will ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the match."</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair ſaid he was happy to ſee her ſo averſe to it, "for," added he, "the Captain, though he is a fine young man, is much too grave for you—a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your life and ſpirits, would ſuit much better with a man of the Bon Ton." "You do me honor, my Lord, I aſſure you I will never marry Capt.
