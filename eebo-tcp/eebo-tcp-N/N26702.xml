            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>FELLOW CITIZENS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFTER having debated the matter with myſelf at leaſt twenty times, at laſt I determined to publiſh all my letters, agreeably to the requeſt of my friends, with ſeveral others which I have prepared, and ſome trifles, that may at leaſt amuſe the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, whoſe brains, like my own, are not able to bear deep reaſoning, becauſe they have never learned Latin.</p>
            <p>Having come to this concluſion, in I ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to my neighbour the Latiniſt, and told him the ſcheme, with as few round-about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions as I could: he heard me to the end of my tale with great patience, and then, emphat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ically ſhaking his head, exclaimed, Ah! Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, I much fear you'll find the truth of the old Latin proverb, <hi>Sutor nè ultra crepidam,</hi>—let the cobler ſtick to his laſt. 'Tis a mad thing of you to commence author; for, firſt, you
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035516_0004_1004E921A6E444B0"/>
know you are not <hi>rich:</hi> you don't boaſt of great connexions, but stand, as you yourſelf have ſaid, a timorous little fellow, undiſtinguiſhed among the ſwiniſh herd. Secondly, you cannot come before the public with a flouriſh, thus—By ROBERT SLENDER, A. M. or D. M. or LL. D. or F. R. S. And in the laſt place, you have no great man to whom you can dedicate your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: and let me tell you, that a number of the poets and hiſtorians, of both modern and ancient times, would never have obtained the celebrity they enjoy, if they had not been pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized by ſome great men—Odds my heart, cried I, for I could hold no longer, I thought you would have applauded my reſolution, and offered me your aſſiſtance; but inſtead of that, you come forward with your doubts and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. To be ſure I am not rich, but what ſays that to my letters; the public ſay they like them, and why ſhould I deny them that grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?—Indeed, I grant that I cannot write myself, with truth, A. M. or D. M. or LL. D. or F. R. S.; but I can write myself, O. S. M. and that will do quite as well. In the name of common ſenſe, said my friend, what do you mean by O. S. M. I'm ſure I never heard of
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:035516_0005_1004E9245EB1E518"/>
it before? Why, anſwered I, I believe it has very ſeldom been choſen by any of your great men and great ſcholars; but it ſuits me exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—its meaning is, ONE OF THE SWINISH MUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TITUDE: and for dedicating, continued I, I'll dedicate to the Preſident of the United States. Nay, replied my friend, that could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be conſtrued than daring preſumption—Well then, to Timothy Pickering—That would be deemed an inſult—I'll dedicate, anſwered I, much agitated, to our own governor Thomas M'Kean, for whom I have more real reſpect than I have for them both—Why Robert, that would argue too great familiarity—It don't ſignify, said I, leaping to my feet, I'll dedicate to all their maſters—To the Freemen of the United States; and I'll bet you a pair of boots, that my plain ſtories, shall be by them as well received, with my plain name, and O. S. M. as some of the productions of theſe flaſhy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, with a ſtring of titles, which are of no other uſe to American freemen, than to lull them to ſleep. Robert, replied my friend, I'll not bet with you; I have gotten more boots, ſhoes and hats, by the election, than I'll wear theſe three years; but I doubt you will make
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:035516_0006_1004E925E3EE5188"/>
a poor job of it—dedications are of all others, the moſt difficult—Have you ſtudied the art of flattery? Can you new vamp a character as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as you would a pair of old boots; and make it appear fair and unſullied, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years have paſſed ſince a ſingle virtuous trait was found in it? Can you collect as many mouthfulls of moonſhine as the pallet of vanity can eaſily admit? Or with a good grace and pious countenance, offer incenſe to a mortal, who is only clothed with a little brief authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?—If you can do theſe things, go, dedicate to any great man you please, he'll be your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; and though your pages be as dull and as ſtupid as ever diſgraced the republic of letters, yet the great man's nod of approbation will place <hi>ſterling</hi> value on the performance; but if you dedicate to the freemen of the United States, you—I'll have none of your buts, ſaid I, out of all patience—I'll never flatter vice as long as I live; nay, firſt, as your book says, I'll "ſow nether ſocks, foot them and mend them too;" and placing my hands in my ſides, and looking as big as if I was worth a 1000 a-year, Do you think ſir, ſaid I, I'd gather moonſhine for any man? No ſir, if the ſides of vanity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:035516_0007_1004E927817F9350"/>
ſtand prominent till they are puffed out by the breath of Robert Slender's flattery, they will be as lean as a lath to the day of judgment—I ſay, I will dedicate my works to the Freemen, the Lovers of Liberty, the Aſſerters, Maintainers and Supporters of Independence throughout the United States—And not my works only, added I, but my life alſo, and all I have, and God knows that's not much, ſhall be ever at their ſervice, to defend and preſerve that invaluable CONSTITUTION and glorious Independence, which is their indeſcribable honour, and the richeſt patrimony that true republicans can hand down untarniſhed to poſterity—And if my plain told ſtories, continued I, can have the effect of calling up the republican ſpirits to a more ardent love of their country's rights—to more watchfulness, and ſtricter enquiry, I ſhall abundantly receive that which I expect—For the good of his country, muſt undoubtedly be the good of Robert Slender—</p>
            <p>And, ſaid my friend, ſeeing I had talked my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of breath, What will you do now?—Why, anſwered I, go home and write my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,—Why, anſwered he, you have done it already. Out of a frolic, when I ſaw you ſo
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035516_0008_1004E92BAAC83988"/>
earneſt, I took down your laſt reply—here it is—I pronounce it a complete dedication, and any thing you could ſay after this, would be as fulſome as the flatteries of Dryden—Odds my heart, ſaid I, I did not intend to have been cheated into a dedication neither, I would have—Hold, hold, ſays he, placing his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my mouth, not another word, or all's ruined. Well, well, ſaid I, ſo be it; if it must be ſo—only with your conſent, I would add, that with the ſincereſt wiſhes for your real happineſs,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR correſpondents, in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations of ſeveral meaſures which have of late very much engaged the attention of the public, have, in my opinion, reaſoned from a very erroneous principle, namely, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or preſidents ought always to act fairly, openly and ingenuouſly: that they ought not only to ſee that the laws ſhould be obeyed by others, but ſhould, in all their actions, ſtrictly act in conformity to both the letter and ſpirit of the law themſelves. If this indeed were ſo, that princes were bound by <hi>laws,</hi> and could never cauſe <hi>right</hi> to bend to convenience, I, for my part, would as ſoon be a dray-man as a ſecretary of ſtate; as ſoon tug at the oar, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035516_0010_1004E9369230E028"/>
fill the preſidential chair—But I am bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that I can prove the contrary; firſt, by the authority of the moſt learned and wiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſages; and, ſecondly, by the practices of princes in all ages.</p>
               <p>No man, ſays Pliny, ever preſumes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to princes, or include them within the verge of any laws but their own inclination. In the higheſt poſt, juſtice is always on the <hi>ſtrongeſt ſide.</hi> That which is moſt <hi>profitable,</hi> can never be <hi>unlawful.</hi> Holineſs and piety, faith, truth, and <hi>common honeſty,</hi> are the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of private men—princes are above theſe vulgar diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>It is allowed by all, that it is <hi>lawful</hi> for gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernors to uſe <hi>diſſimulation.</hi> Says one of high authority, "The same diſſimulation, which in perſons of private condition would be vicious and abominable, is in princes highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: there is no diſcharging their weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs without it; yea, the very thing which ruins private converſation, is the beſt ſupport of government. A prince or governor muſt <hi>appear</hi> open, honeſt, ſincere; but in his mind deceit, deep deſign, and cunning must hold their ſeat. If he wiſhes to govern wiſely, he muſt know, like Cromwell, the art of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing SPIES, and the almighty power of BRIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERY—of compaſſing his deſigns by deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and unſeen methods, by equivocating and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035516_0011_1004E93A858B53A8"/>
ambiguous terms; by refined ſubtilties and deep intrigue; by good words, fair promiſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments and congratulations, formalities of EMBASSIES and letters; and by theſe outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fair pretences and amuſing ſtratagems, bring the matters about on which his whole foul is ſteadily fixed." And to accompliſh this, ſays Plato, "governors ought to make no ſcruple of having frequent recourſe to <hi>lies</hi> and <hi>tricks;"</hi> and Pliny aſſerts, that it is a part of prudence to <hi>deceive,</hi> as occaſion and the preſent poſture of affairs ſhall require. Suppoſe, for inſtance, that in any ſtate or country whatever, there ſhould be a citizen or ſubject turbulent, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling and rebellious, head of a ſtrong and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined party, would it not be juſt to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the aſſaſſin ſecretly to ſtab him, or bribe one of his intimates to hand him the poiſoned draught? Or ſuppoſe ſome <hi>great man,</hi> who was every day increaſing in popularity, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening his intereſt; who undoubtedly had it in his power to do miſchief, if he were ſo inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I ſay, would it not be prudent for the governor to clip his wings—check his popular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity by well deviſed and plauſible ſtories, <hi>forged letters,</hi> and ſecret correſpondence, that ſo he might not be able to annoy, if he would? To me it appears evident, that in both theſe caſes the ruler would be perfectly juſtifiable. One thing is certain, princes ever have acted thus,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035516_0012_1004E93D3A249908"/>
and in ſo acting have ever found advocates. "In order to preſerve juſtice in greater and more important matters, there is ſometimes a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſays Plutarch, of deviating from it in thoſe of leſs moment; and in order to do right to the generality, it is allowable to put ſome hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and to do <hi>ſome wrong</hi> to <hi>particular perſons."</hi> Commonly ſpeaking, ſays Tacitus, the <hi>nobleſt exploits</hi> carry ſomewhat of injuſtice in them. A prudent prince, ſays Plutarch, muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know how to govern according to law, but know how to <hi>govern the laws themselves:</hi> that is, if the laws are <hi>not willing</hi> that he should do what is neceſſary at that time, he muſt <hi>make them willing.</hi> And, not to tire you with quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the ancients, Ariſtotle's rule is, if a prince cannot be good in all, it is <hi>ſufficient</hi> that he be ſo in the greater part of his admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istration.</p>
               <p>I now think I have fully eſtabliſhed my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by authorities, that princes are not bound to be, like other men, <hi>virtuous.</hi> Were I to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the proof of it from the practice of princes, it would be giving a hiſtory of their lives, which abounded, according to their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in every ſpecies of diſſimulation, deceit, and cunning; and if the moſt diligent hiſtorian can select <hi>one</hi> eminent for virtue, he will stand <hi>rara avis in terra, nigroque ſimilima cygno</hi>

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035516_0013_1004E93EC15A2930"/>
From this diſquiſition, of governors or princes being, in certain caſes ſupreme above all law, I would deduce the following particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. An irrefragable argument for the juſtice of the Alien Bill. Thoſe people who are moſt affected by it, and againſt whom it was made, are inimical to all good government. Witneſs the troubles they raiſed in Ireland, where at <hi>preſent,</hi> and for many hundred years paſt, the government hath been <hi>temperate, humane,</hi> and <hi>juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2d. It was neceſſary, by the Sedition Law, to clip the wings of ſome men, and to ſhew the <hi>heinous</hi> nature of ſpeaking againſt perſons high in truſt. What would have been the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence if a ſtop had not been put to ſuch abuſe?—Colonel Lyon's impriſonment and fine did more good to America, by inculcating a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubmiſſion to our rulers, than any thing that could be deviſed, ſhort of cutting off his head: which indeed might have been <hi>wrong</hi> in itſelf, but would have been right nevertheleſs, for great advantages would have ſprung from it.</p>
               <p>I was in great ſpirits a few days ago, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the tale of a tub with a double bottom, would have proved our governors well ſkilled in developing the ſecrets of foreign courts; but I am now quite chapfaln, for the tub appears to have loſt <hi>both</hi> its <hi>bottoms.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035516_0014_1004E94046D6A028"/>
But I hope they will be more fortunate in their next attempt. I truſt alſo that the people will ſoon open their eyes, to ſee that the paltry ſums of money which are granted by their repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives in Congreſs, for the uſe of government, will never ſerve to anſwer any valuable purpoſe: if ever they wiſh to ſee their government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable, they muſt give freely, and not ſtand trifling for a few thouſands, like women on a market-day higgling for halfpence; for when all is done, no ſword can cut ſo deep as that with a silver edge; it ſerves with zeal, obeys without grudging, and draws the world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. Let us never judge governors by thoſe rules by which we ourſelves are to abide and be governed; but reſt ſatisfied under whatever laws, decrees, or ordinances the rulers frame, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering this grand advice, (which is my laſt authority) whoſoever reſiſteth the power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves DAMNATION.</p>

               <p>UNTIL of late your paper ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came into the neighbourhood where I live: we all with one conſent pronounced it a <hi>French</hi> paper; and yet, when I begin to think why we did ſo, I cannot, for my life, find a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for none of us ever read a word of it. However, it came into my hands in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: A few weeks ago a man came to be my next door neighbour, who we ſoon found took the AURORA; and, indeed when we found <hi>that,</hi> we determined to keep ourſelves to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not to be defiled by <hi>democrats;</hi> but this reſolution we some how or other have entirely broken through; for he is a ſober, quiet, religious ſort of a man, and the whole family are the moſt obliging you ever knew. As we grew intimate I thought it could do me no hurt to read a paragraph of his paper, juſt for ſake of curioſity, as I had no paper of my own, for I gave up the Engliſh paper ſix months ago; not that I diſliked his politics, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he taught the children to <hi>curſe,</hi> and ſpeak <hi>bawdy.</hi> Well, to be ſure ſince that time I have every now and then, when tired of working, read a little; and it has produced on
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035516_0016_1004E947050C7330"/>
me ſtrange effects: my neighbours ſay I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and point their fingers at me, and call me a turn-coat; and then I wiſh your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per had never been ſeen,—but the next day the paper comes, and I cannot for the ſoul of me keep from reading it. It makes every thing appear <hi>ſo fair, open,</hi> and <hi>ſo like a hiſtory,</hi> that I believe my neighbours may hoot on, for I am determined to read a little longer.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Mr. Editor you publiſh ſome ſtrange things; I am often very much ſurpriſed: the other day, for inſtance, I was almoſt thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck with the account of the liberties allowed to kings and princes, in that piece ſigned a MONARCHIST—Lord bleſs me, ſaid I to my neighbour, can this be true? True, ſays he, aye, and this is only a very ſmall and imperfect ſketch of their character. Saying this, he took down a large Chronology book (I think he called it) and read to me above fifty inſtances of kings and princes ſwearing to do one thing, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately the contrary: of their treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, malice, unforgiving temper, cruelty; of their ſecret murdering, covetouſneſs, and uſury; until my hair nearly ſtood an end. But God be thanked, ſays I, theſe were all heathens, I am ſure Chriſtians could not be guilty of ſuch crimes. My neighbour ſmiled, and ſaid, I am ſorry my friend to inform you, that the infamy of kings <hi>profeſſing</hi> Chriſtianity, has been more
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035516_0017_1004E949CAA08520"/>
notorious than that of the Heathen of Pagan monarchs: well ſays I, if this be ſo, how can they ever ſay the Lord's prayer? Can they ever think of being Chriſtians, without following Chriſt's rule, of doing as they would be done by? Do they ever think on death? Do you ſuppoſe that they can be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and yet ſtrive to cheat and defraud? Kiſs like Judas, and ſtab like Joab; make fair promiſes and baſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; wink at wickedneſs, and ſuffer every ſpecies of fraud to paſs unpuniſhed; reward people for acting as ſpics; honor the <hi>adulterer,</hi> and laugh at the crime!—Lord keep me from unbelief, ſaid I; theſe men are great men, high in learning and in fame—Do they think religion a cheat, or a bug-bear only to frighten chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? I believe, says my neighbour, they think nothing at all about it! The ſcripture ſays, the god of this world hath blinded their eyes—and I verily believe it; but, ſurely ſaid I, if the rulers of this world would act ſo, the <hi>clergy</hi> would excommunicate them, and would not ſuffer them thus to wear the Chriſtian name, without its power. I cannot, ſaid I, believe it; it cannot be. Do you know, ſaid my neighbour any wicked men who are very rich? Yes, ſays I, there is X. Y. and Z. they are very rich, and every body knows they are great raſcals. Well, ſays my neighbour, are they excommunicated? No—I proteſt ſaid I, now when I think of it,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035516_0018_1004E94B4F935DA0"/>
the rev. Mr. W. dined with X. on—, and with Y. on—, and ſix or ſeven clergymen dined with Z. a few days ago. God preſerve us, ſaid I, where ſhall we look for help; in the <hi>great</hi> depravity is permitted, ſome kinds of wickedneſs counted laudable, and every ſpecies winked at. It is our great comfort, ſaid my friend, that although here ſome things are wrong, I muſt confeſs, among the rich and great, yet the great, the honourable and very worthy, our AMERICAN FARMERS, are VIRTUOUS, not in name but in REALITY. Vice has not been able to entice them from the ſtandard of VIRTUE, IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEPENDENCE, and FREEDOM. To <hi>them</hi> we look—they are our bulwark, the guardians of our rights, the ſupporters of our dignity, and the pillars of our CONSTITUTION. The miſt of darkneſs, ignorance and error, begins to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; party-ſpirit will ſoon, like a fretful child, cry itſelf to <hi>reſt;</hi> the ſeeds of reform that are ſown in our conſtitution, will bring forth fruit; the ſtorm indeed may awfully growl and grumble at a diſtance: but ſaid my friend (leaping to his feet, whilſt I ſhrunk into a corner) the ſun will ariſe with ten-fold glory; the demons of war, diſcord, and deſolation shall be diſappointed—true religion ſhall baniſh pretence and hypocriſy, and AMERICA SHALL STILL BE FREE.</p>

               <p>I THINK I have lived in the world about forty years, but I am not certain, for my parents thought dates of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence—"Our ſon, ſaid they, will never be a <hi>great man,</hi> and what uſe will it be to him to be able at every opportunity to hand down the record of his birth." The propheſy has been literally accompliſhed—I ſtand unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed among the ſwiniſh herd, as the poor are generally called by the great and <hi>well-born.</hi> However, be that as it may, theſe two or three laſt years paſt have brought about more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, than all the reſt of my life; and children, and weak minded ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you know, are ſo delighted with wonders, that oftentimes they think things are great wonders, that are no wonders at all—but I really am of opinion that theſe things are very wonderful which I am going to relate. The firſt thing that ſet me a wondering was, when the ſtates rebelled against Great Britain: Lord bleſs me! ſaid I, are the people mad? Is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they can think to be able to oppoſe king George? Why their deſtruction is as ſure as if it were written in the Bible. I trembled for
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035516_0020_1004E9522DB29FA8"/>
fear, and ſkulked into a corner, where I lay ſnug out of ſight during the awful conteſt; and when Waſhington had gained the day, and made En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, very much againſt her inclination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our independence; I, wondering more than ever, ſlipped out of my hiding-place, and talked, as well as I could, about Liberty, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, Freedom, and ſuch like things, juſt as the reſt of my neighbours did, who had hid as well as I. Since that to within theſe two or three years, as I ſaid before, my wonders have not been very great, though pretty numerous. I wondered a good deal about the poor ſoldiers who were ſo nicely tricked out of their <hi>hard earned wages,</hi> by receiving two ſhillings and ſixpence for twenty; and when I heard ſo much about <hi>funding ſyſtems, and banking ſyſtems,</hi> and <hi>public debt</hi> being a <hi>public bleſſing;</hi> O, ſaid I to myſelf, my poor head can't underſtand this—I wonder what it means?</p>
               <p>I wondered a good deal to ſee the old tories ſlipping in by little and little into places of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and truſt—I then wondered at their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and next at the readineſs with which they were admitted; and laſtly wondered what it would all come to. But theſe were only the beginning of wonders. I declare, Mr. Editor, one wonder of late has ſo cloſely followed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am yet aſtoniſhed to look back on them. The revolution of France, the defeating of the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035516_0021_1004E954E77ADF60"/>
combined powers, the creating of ſo many new Republics, the pulling down of Antichriſt, for which the Proteſtants and Preſbyterians have ſo long prayed to God, and now when God <hi>has pulled him down,</hi> they ſay they don't thank him, which to me appears a very great religious wonder, and I believe, a very irreligious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. I wondered at the valour and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the king of Naples, the ſagacity of the king of Sardinia, the conſiſtency of the Duke of Tuſcany, and above all, the modeſty and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of General Mack. At home I have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the Sedition Law—the Alien bill—the tale of a <hi>tub</hi>—the exiſtence of a ſtupendous army of United Iriſhmen in America—the barbarous and bloody <hi>hot water</hi> inſurrection—the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſent to ſubdue the <hi>vendue cryer</hi>—and, not to tire your patience with my wonders, I was ſtruck dumb with aſtoniſhment when I ſaw ſuch a deep laid, well concerted and organized plan, to influence the people into federal ideas at the next <hi>election:</hi> not altogether underſtanding ſome part of it, I took up the paper and went in to my neighbour, who underſtands Latin, and is therefore you know a man of more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledge—Did you ſee this, ſays I, about the election for governor—See it ſays he, yes, yes!—Surely, ſays I, it muſt all be a humbug—It has only been printed for a piece of fun; ah, ſays my neighbour, there is no joke like a true
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035516_0022_1004E9566C0F05B0"/>
joke—It is as true as the goſpel. Well for my part, ſays I, I cannot for the life of me, ſee much meaning in it—ſurely, added I, there are very few people in this ſtate who do not know <hi>Judge M'Keau?</hi> Very true, ſaid my neighbour, and thouſands know <hi>nothing at all</hi> about <hi>James Roſs.</hi> Why I was in company not may evenings ago, when it was ſtrongly debated, and ſome bets made about where he lived, and a world and all never heard of him before, and this they ſaid was the reaſon why ſuch pains are now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. They are fully aſſured that without theſe exertions there would be no chance at all for their candidate's getting many votes—they will ſtretch every nerve to the utmoſt, and you know if they ſtand in need of a <hi>few votes,</hi> there may be found a ſucceſſor for <hi>Joſey Thomas,</hi> of electioneering memory, who can forge a few: beſides, it makes it altogether evident what an opinion is entertained, by theſe gentlemen, of the independent electors of Pennsylvania; it is in fact ſpeaking to them in this language, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country farmers and others, long experience has undoubtedly taught you, that such poor, illit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate, uncultivated creatures as you are, can by no means pretend to <hi>judge for yourſelves,</hi> we therefore, who now addreſs you, being infallibly certain that we are gifted with all possible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and extensive diſcernment, and likewiſe being the <hi>friends</hi> of <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>good government,</hi>

Here I could hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger! Surely my friend, ſaid I, you cannot be ſerious; did not our Congreſs-men ſay that we were the moſt enlightened people in the world—it would in my opinion, ſaid I, be a flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction for theſe men to think thus if they believed as you ſay.</p>
               <p>By no means ſaid my friend, do you think when they aſſerted that we were the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened nation, that the poor farmers were included in the account; if you do, you are very much miſtaken, the truly enlightened are your <hi>lovers</hi> of order, your federaliſts, at whoſe head ſtands his excellency of <hi>Ninety-Six,</hi> his highneſs the courageous and continent <hi>Thatcher,</hi> the ſweet ſcented <hi>Rutledge,</hi> and the thrice noble

Lord bleſs me, ſaid I, you aſtoniſh me—If theſe men think ſo, no doubt but they will ſoon ſtrive to deprive the poor of the right of being electors. Soon ſtrive, ſaid my neighbour, why they ſtrive every election, and a number are really deprived of their rights to all intents. Why they plainly tell all their labourers and tradeſmen, if they do not vote as they order them, they ſhall not be employed by them another day!—I never was more pleaſed than with an anſwer made by a barber, with whom I am acquainted, at an election not long ago, to one of thoſe very wiſe and important gentlemen—"For whom does thee vote," ſaid a very plain but very ſpruce looking man; for Swanwick, ſaid the barber. If I had known that thee held ſuch principles, replied the other, thee would not have gotten ſo much money from me for ſhaving, but thee ſhall never ſhave me again; as to that ſaid the barber,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035516_0025_1004E95E94BEC2B0"/>
much nettled—I don't care a ſtraw, but if thee does not go very quickly about thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I'll effectually <hi>lather</hi> thee, and then I don't care who the devil ſhaves thee. Juſt as my neighbour ſaid this, I perceived his wiſe yawning, and caſting my eyes up to the clock, ſaw it was paſt eleven, ſo I got up haſtily, for fear I ſhould be troubleſome, and bade my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a very good night.</p>

               <p>THE other evening I happened to ſtep out to ſee an acquaintance, and on my way ſtopped at a neighbour's ſtore; whilſt I ſtood there, talking of, I do not remember what trifle, in came a man, ſeemingly in high ſpirits, and went on without any apology thus—"Well neighbour," addreſſing himſelf to the ſtore-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, "I have good news for you; you may lie down now without dread, and riſe up without fear; our government is determined to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the world, that it is not to be played upon by every deſigning democratic raſcal; God be thanked! we have learned from the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035516_0026_1004E96017834598"/>
practice of the English government, which is the best government on earth, how traitors ought to be served."—"Why, what's the matter now," said the store-keeper, "is the army to march again? Has Harper found another clue? Has Dr. Logan gone again to France—or have the conſpirators broken jail, or—ſpeak I pray you."—"No," anſwered he, "but the grant jury have found three of the inſurgents guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and they <hi>ſhall</hi> be hanged, beheaded and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, their hearts torn out and thrown in their faces, juſt the way they ſerve conſpirators in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. "O but" ſays I, venturing to thruſt in a word, "I believe, no body can as yet tell what will be their ſentence; I believe ſaid I, they muſt be tried by a jury of their fellow citizens."—"Fellow fiddleſticks!" replied the other, "if every curſed democrat of you could, you would free them without judge or jury;—but I tell you they <hi>ſhall</hi> die, let the jury condemn them or not. If," continued he, "we had been wiſe enough in the beginning of the unnatural rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and truſſed up but a dozen of the leading men in each ſtate <hi>in time,</hi> this country would have been yet happy under the king of Great Britain; but we were ſuch plagued fools as to give the deſigning fellows liberty to prate; they ſtirred up the common people, and chiefly the the hot-headed rebellious Iriſh, by which means the deteſtable ſin of reſiſting the Lord's anointed

But it wo'nt be the caſe now; our preſent Preſident, God bleſs him, will give them a paſſport to the other world, I'll be bail; and if he ſhould'nt, I know what I know."—"I hope," ſaid I, "my friend you do'nt intend to take the law into your own hands."—"Why sir," anſwered he, "what the devil would you have us to do? Do you imagine we are to ſit ſtill and look tamely on, till all the advances we have made to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reconciled to our mother country are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroyed? No sir, we will <hi>reſiſt,</hi> and that in a way which ſome folks little dream of. I thought," continued he, "that the people were heartily tired of their folly. I was fully

convinced in my own mind, that all they had been told by the Preſident, about republics, and republican governments, by Fenno and Peter Porcupine, about liberty or ſuch nonſenſe, had prepared them for at laſt putting abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the men to whom they had entruſted the government that they have eſtabliſhed; and not to do any thing contrary to the mind of the leading characters.

When I came home I ſtepped into my neighbour's, and told him the ſtory: Do you think, ſaid I, that the man can have any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for venturing to talk ſo—I declare, added I, I sometimes trembled for fear, when he talked ſo big, about <hi>hanging</hi> and <hi>quartering,</hi> but moſt of all when he ſaid <hi>mum!</hi> But now I am quite eaſy, I don't believe a word of it.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, added I, as I cannot ſay that I am over and above courageous, except when I take a glaſs extraordinary; and am beſides a fellow of a pale face, I dread very much fellows of Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retorian courage. "Indeed Robert, ſaid my neighbour, we ought neither to pay too much regard to what we hear in this way, nor reject it altogether; there is a middle way between theſe extremes, which is generally the saſeſt—that is, we ought coolly and diſpaſſionately to examine both ſides, and reject or approve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dictates of reaſon.—Porcupine has ſounded the alarm, and much in the ſame ſtrain. He is undoubtedly the organ of a ſtrong British party—they well know, that when Thomas M'Kean is choſen govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, as without a doubt he will, it will be ſigning another declaration of independence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt being under the influence of Britiſh mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or Britiſh connections—they will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

do all in their power to oppoſe his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."—</p>
               <p>"Lord bleſs me," ſaid I, "I'll ſettle my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and retreat to my old hiding-place. I hate fighting, not ſo much for the name of the thing but the ſmart of the blows;—and beſides, in conteſts of this kind, a man might loſe an eye, or a leg, or an arm, or indeed perchance be killed by <hi>accident,</hi> and then you know 'twould be no matter to me, whether <hi>Roſs</hi> or <hi>M'Kean</hi> was governor—!"</p>
               <p>"Very true," ſaid my friend, laughing, "very true;—but you need be in to haſte, although I am well aſſured that they will do all they can to <hi>intimidate</hi> weak minded people, <hi>keep back</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, <hi>forge votes,</hi> and <hi>bribe</hi> voters; yet they know <hi>too well</hi> what would be the reſult of any acts of violence.

               <p>WHEN your Saturday's paper came to hand, I took it up with a great deal of earneſtneſs, and caſting my eyes over it to ſee what I ſhould read firſt, I perceived—"To the Preſident of the United States," in large letters. So, ſo, ſays I, let me ſee what we have got here. Amazing! three columns and an half long! Why what in the name of wonder has the man to ſay to his Excellency, that can take
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035516_0032_1004E972220D6C28"/>
him ſuch a time in telling his ſtory! However, ſaid I to myſelf, 'tis no matter, my head could never, even in my youngeſt days, know the meaning of ſo long a tale; I'll paſs it over, and leave it to thoſe men who are bleſſed with a greater ſtock of patience, and a ſtronger brain. But juſt as I was about to begin the next arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>A Maryland Clergyman</hi> met my view. What, ſays I, was it written by a clergyman? It muſt be good, it would be ſacrilege not to read it. Perhaps, Mr. Editor, you may think ſtrange that the term Clergyman could produce on me ſuch an effect; the reaſon is, my father, who loved religion, not for the <hi>name of it,</hi> but for its <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> paid always the greateſt reſpect to the clergy. They labour for the good of our ſouls, he would ſay, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy of double honour. If one of them committed a fault, inſtead of railing out againſt the whole fraternity; let us remember, he would ſay, a miniſter is but a man; and "no <hi>man</hi> liveth and ſinneth not." I endeavour to imitate the old man, and though I fall far ſhort in performance, I ſtill remember the precept. There muſt be ſomething good in it, ſaid I; perhaps its a ſermon, though I can't ſee the text—but perhaps I will meet it as I go along—ſo having ſnuffed the candle, opened the wick, and ſet myſelf a little more on my centre, I began.</p>

                        <p>In your late reply to the Legiſlature of Maryland, you have appeared in all the dignified ſplendour of your public and private character—the ſtateſman, the philoſopher, the patriot—I truſt, the Chriſtian.</p>
                        <p>I hope it will not be conſidered any diminution of this tribute of reſpect, that I take the liberty, as an individual, of offering a few animadverſions on that part of your reply to our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in the State Aſſembly, that reſpects religion.

                        <p>In the reply, you expreſs some alarm or apprehenſion for the cauſe of religion; and a dereliction of its moſt eſſential princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the maintenance of morality, government and ſociety.</p>
                        <p>Such, ſir, being the ſlate of your mind, it has every reaſon to excite ſimilar apprehenſions in ours; to invite us to the inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of what new and unexpected dangers, foreign or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, menace our religious liberties. When we hear our dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſied political watchman proclaiming, that he truſts "Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca will not be converted into a perfect bedlam, whatever other parts of the world may wiſh it; we muſt naturally raiſe our eyes and look around on others, and on ourſelves; it is full time we ſhould examine the direction of the impending influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza of irreligious infanity. <bibl>

                  </note> God be thanked, ſaid I, after I had read the firſt five or ſix paragraphs, while wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs abounds, we have a good, virtuous, and truly wiſe man for our Preſident—who is "a terror to evil doors," and a praiſe to them that do well;—under his virtuous adminiſtration, no encouragement will be given to men who devour <hi>widow's houſes;</hi> and for a <hi>pretence</hi> make long prayers. But let me read a little farther—"Make a perfect bedlam of our country," in

the name of wonder what does this mean?—"Make a bedlam of all America;" to me it appears, ſaid I, perfectly nonſenſe. I thought when the French went to Egypt, it was a mad ſcheme; and when before that, they changed the Sabbath into a decade, a fooliſh ſcheme; but to turn America into a mad houſe, was the maddeſt of mad ſchemes that ever a raving mad people could for a moment conceive. Was it for this, ſaid I, they aſſiſted us to obtain our independence? Was it for this that they have been ever ſince telling us fair tales and ſmooth ſtories? No, no, ſaid I, if that's what they want, they ſhall want; why I would not give them the ſize of my garden for a mad houſe, let alone all America. I tried to read, it was all a joke; I could think of nothing but Bedlam—Bedlam, make a perfect Bedlam of our country, rung in my ears. I took off my ſpectacles, put them in the caſe, and muttering Bedlam all the way, went in to my neighbour? Did you ever hear the like, ſaid I? Why what's the matter, ſaid my neighbour? Why, ſaid I, our Preſident tells us theſe <hi>plagued French folks,</hi> want to make a <hi>perfect bedlam</hi> of our country. "O," ſaid my neighbour, "you are always in too great haſte.—Did I not tell you in our laſt converſation, that you ought to weigh both ſides of every point diſpaſſionately, and then judge? Had you read a little farther, you would have ſeen that
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035516_0035_1004E97920E4E218"/>
what is there meant by a Bedlam, is not a mad term, as you imagined, but a receptacle for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple holding opinions on religious ſubjects, which we and a majority of the United States think entirely without foundation, either in reaſon or ſcripture." Indeed! ſaid I, is that the meaning of a "perfect bedlam?'—"It is not," ſaid he, "the real meaning of the term; but, however, muſt be the meaning of it here.—But read on," ſaid my friend—"you are but juſt began, I ſee:" I read on accordingly—Is it poſſible, ſaid I; can this clergyman be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on? I thought, added I, that no religion of any kind was ſuffered in France; and yet here are prelates, biſhops, vicars, curates, &amp;c. large ſalaries and fine ſeminaries. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Under the new Conſtitution the French have no leſs than nine Metropolitan prelates, eighty-three biſhops, each depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a dioceſe, with vicars, curates, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—and the government has provided, that the ſalaries of the biſhops ſhall be from 500 to 840 pounds per annum, not to exceed the latter ſum—and from 160 to 50 pounds ſterling for the vicars and curates. Beſides a ſeminary is provided for in each dioceſe, for the inſtruction of candidates for the ministry, under three vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars and a vicar-general, in order that they may be properly prepared for entering into holy orders, agreeably to the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and wiſhes of the people. <bibl>

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035516_0036_1004E97AE431F9D8"/>
from an <hi>honeſt Calviniſtic Preſbyterian</hi> miniſter. You think then, ſaid my friend, that there are no Preſbyterians in France! Think, ſaid I, to be ſure I do, they are all papiſts or infidels—Indeed my friend, replied my neighbour, you are much miſtaken; truly there are more Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians in France at this day, than there are citizens in the United States; and among theſe are men eminent, yea of the firſt rank in all sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entific acquirements. A number of their leading men are deiſts, 'tis true, and ſo are a number of the leading men <hi>here,</hi> and in all other countries. The number may be more in France, becauſe of its very great population, and the long night of darkneſs and ſlavery in which they laboured—But here we are increaſing in proportion to our population, in every ſpecies of what is called in England <hi>liberality,</hi> as faſt as ever they did in France or elſewhere. Well, ſays I, but was it not from France that we derived all our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and profanity, and infidelity; ſure, ſays I, our parſon ſays ſo, and he is a learned cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman. Read on, ſaid my neighbour, and then judge. Why I proteſt, ſaid I, this gentleman thinks that our intercourſe with England has tended more to our growth in wickedneſs and infidelity, than our love of French principles; and for my own part, added I, I muſt confeſs I believe him. If the French, continued I, are infidels that come here, they can do little
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035516_0037_1004E98134752748"/>
hurt to me, for I do not underſtand a word of their gibberiſh nor they of mine—and I do not ever remember to have ſeen a Frenchman drunk, or in a quarrel, from the day of their revolution to this. I believe ſaid I, they do not pay much regard to the Sabbath; but alas! they may ſay as much of us—And if, ſaid my friend, that be the mark of infidelity, but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of believers will be found in Philadelphia. And yet, ſays he, I have been through moſt of the capital cities in Europe, and never did my eyes behold ſuch a well regulated, quiet, inoffenſive and peaceable people, as the inhabitants of Philadelphia. I ſuppose, however, that what your parſon meant was in alluſion to the great circulation that is given to the Age of Reaſon, by Thomas Paine; he thinks it was our love of French principles that enticed us to read his work; but in this, with all due reſpect, ſaid my friend, I chuſe to judge for myſelf. Paine's works were, and are ſought for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, firſt, he was a man very active, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed in our revolutionary conteſt; his Common Senſe, is a jewel which cannot be too much eſteemed—and his Rights of Man are but a continuation of the ſame ſubject; and it is richly deſerving of high approbation.—<hi>Again,</hi> his Age of Reaſon, would never have been much known in this country if the Clergy had ſuffered it to reſt; but they dragged it into
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035516_0038_1004E983EEB51B88"/>
publicity—let the text be what it would, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions on Paine, made a part of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The clergy wrote—the people read. Paine was brought to the bar of the public, and in general ſo ill was the cauſe of Chriſtianity handled, by its weak, yet conceited friends, that Paine too frequently came off with flying co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. I, for my own part, continued my friend, have read over ſeriously and carefully that paper of which you have now read a part, and do in my judgment declare it to be a ſtrong evidence that the writer is poſſeſſed of ſound judgment, a clear underſtanding, and a good heart, and had I influence I would undoubtedly endeavour to induce every good republican to read it ſeriouſly, and weigh it impartially: it anſwers compleatly all the cavils that are ſo loudly ſounded about our being corrupted by French principles; and his ſtrictures on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of men to offices of any kind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who are not in their ſtations a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well, argue that he is not a miniſter for filthy lucre's ſake—that he holds the perſon of no man in eſtimation—but is determined to reprove and not to ſpare. But after all, ſaid I, I can't reſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy—'tis no matter to us, added I, where the people came from, or who they are, if they make a perfect bedlam of our country—No doubt ſays I, but William Cobbett meant the ſame thing,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035516_0039_1004E98572BF2E30"/>
when he ſo pompouſly proclaimed the <hi>Church in danger.</hi> The world is indeed in a ſtrange way—I don't half like it, I hate to be among mad people, they ſay a bite is dangerous; beſides, not being a ſtrong man, added I, and not much uſed to tuſſling, I believe I had better in time ſlip quietly out of the way—better an hour too ſoon, than a moment too long, is my motto; and I think a ſafe one. I have no pleaſure in ſpaſms, pangs, and convulſions.</p>
               <p>I never thought, ſaid my neighbour, that you were ſo fearful; why I tell you there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger—the jarrings, diſcontents, and murmurings of party here, will juſt keep pace with the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afflicting ſtate of Europe. That men there will finally be free, is clear to every unprejudiced en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer—and as ſoon as Europe ſhall rejoice in peace, happineſs, and liberty, ſo ſoon ſhall this country, in renovated ſplendour, lift aloft the enſigns of freedom; then ſhe will rejoice, and her joy will receive an infinite addition, when ſhe reflects that the bright ray of liberty, which has diſpelled the ſhades of savage barbarity deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic cruelty, and monkiſh ignorance, firſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the <hi>American hemiſphere.</hi>—Stop my friend ſaid I, I will conſider of this a little more at leiſure, my poor head begins to grow giddy, and can't hold any more at this time; but, ſaid I, I'll not forget your advice, I'll weigh both ſides of every queſtion for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035516_0040_1004E98AE2D56390"/>
and judge as diſpaſſionately as I can. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid this, I bade my friend good morning.</p>

               <p>IN the country where I was born, ſcarce a day paſſes in which the little country towns are not viſited by deaf and dumb prophets, who for a ſmall ſum make the people as well acquainted with what is to come, as they are with what is paſt. When I was a child, one of the moſt eminent of theſe divines, plainly declared that I would ſtand in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being frightened to death. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy has at different times made me very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy and at every appearance of danger I make it my chief concern to ſlip out of harm's road as ſoon as I can. However, I am very much alarmed at preſent, I dread very much that the fulfilment of the fatal prediction draweth near; and I have been ſo often plagued and frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late, that it will require but a little more to do my turn. Indeed if it had not been for one little circumſtance, it would have been all over with me long ere this time; but this gave me a little courage and kept my ſpirits, which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035516_0041_1004E98D9C0CC558"/>
were juſt ready to make a laſt retreat, a little longer in a ſtate of operation. The circumſtance was, that all the alarms which were ſo indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly ſpread by men of the <hi>firſt rank,</hi> and all friends of order and good government, turned out to be what my neighbour the Latiniſt ſays, an old fellow whoſe name I have forgotten, ſaid of the nightingale, <hi>Vox <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t nihil preteria,</hi> that is, as my friend explains it, <hi>only a voice:</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when William Cobbett publiſhed what he called a formidable and alarming conſpiracy of the United Iriſhmen, their conſtitution, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and an army 50,000 ſtrong. I quaking at every limb, believed every word as firmly as if it had been revelation, barred my gates, double locked all my doors, and if a mouſe but ſcratched on the wall I was ready to hide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the curtains. But in a ſhort time Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett grew quiet, and all our experience from that to this has proved that <hi>it was only a voice.</hi> Next our city was to be burned—I trembled very much, and I believe ſo did a great many more. I every night had a ſharp eye about me, praiſed the carefulneſs of the friends of good government, and wetting out all the fires in the houſe <hi>myſelf,</hi> went quaking to bed—and this alſo proved <hi>a voice only.</hi> I was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed about the affair of X. Y. and Z.; dreamt every night of a French invaſion—dreaded ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly that the negroes would rebel—prayed all
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035516_0042_1004E98F20BBFD58"/>
my friends to ſtrive with all their might for to increaſe our <hi>navy</hi>—wiſhed heartily for a league offenſive and defenſive with our mother En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland—and thought our Envoys, the Preſident, the King of England, and the Grand Signior, the greateſt men upon earth. Think, only think of my diſappointment, when this, by the plain tale of Mr. Gerry, was ſhewn to be like the reſt, <hi>for ſome ſpecial purpoſe,</hi> only a voice. When the great Harper ingeniouſly catched the clue of a moſt dangerous conſpiracy, he made the Congreſs-hall ring with it, and my heart throbbed violently—Lord bleſs me, ſaid I, where will all this end? We have the beſt government on earth, <hi>except the Engliſh;</hi> and I dare ſay our great men would, <hi>to oblige us,</hi> make <hi>our's</hi> as good as <hi>their's,</hi> if we would but aſk them—and yet we are a divided people. Thus I miſtruſted my near neighbours, and was all of a cold ſweat if I ſaw two men talking ſeriouſly—Oh, ſays I, they are making up the plot—and then I ran home to put all my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to rights, that I might decamp at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's warning. But think how I felt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded when I got my eyes opened, and ſaw that the whole plan of United Iriſhmen, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the city, and the clue of conſpiracy, were only to prepare the way for the Alien and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition bills. The tale of the <hi>tubs</hi> alſo had its day, and produced on my weak mind very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035516_0043_1004E990E915AB70"/>
effects—and my diſturbance of mind was beyond my feeble powers to expreſs, when as I was going to church on the Sabbath, a moſt wicked conſpiracy was defeated, by the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of ſome active magiſtrates: a conſpiracy which had taken root among the <hi>taylors,</hi> who my neighbour the Latiniſt ſays, being generally people (excuſe me for not ſaying men) feeble, and like myſelf owners of <hi>pale faces,</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known to be at the head of a conſpiracy before. But, Mr. Editor, all theſe frights were only as a mole-hill by the ſide of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when compared with what I the other night felt, and, alas! do yet grievouſly feel.</p>
               <p>The other evening, having finiſhed my day's work a little ſooner than ordinary, I ſtepped out to drink a pint of ale at a tavern I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times frequent to read Brown's, Fenno's, or William Cobbett's paper, and ſmoke a ſegar. I placed myſelf in the dark ſide of the box, and after taking my draught, ſat thinking over ſome of the above alarming occurrences, when in came two men, and taking their ſeats without ever paying any attention to me, went on thus: You think the ſea-tyger a ſtrange beaſt; I wiſh you could but get a ſight of the Ariſtocrat. The ariſtocrat, ſays the other, you aſtoniſh me. Is not your ariſtocrat a man? No more a man, replied the other, (with a ſmile of ſuperior wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) than the ſea-tyger. Odds my life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035516_0044_1004E9926F376700"/>
his companion, what do you mean? I have heard it ſaid a thouſand times that man's an ariſtocrat. Granted ſaid the other, and have you not heard men ſay, that man is a ſad dog? Have you not alſo heard a man ſtiled a bear, a wolf, a fox, a ſheep, &amp;c.? I confeſs I have ſaid the other. Well continued he, in the ſame manner a man is called an ariſtocrat. I liſtened with both my ears—the subject was ſomething new. Well ſaid the other, this is plagued ſtrange; was it not that I know you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poring over books, I would not believe a word of this. But pray what ſort of a beaſt is it? I am able only to deſcribe it by hearſay, I am not <hi>entitled</hi> to a ſight of it—I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, continued he, that an ariſtocrat is headed like a lion, its body like a leopard, its feet like a bear, its tongue like that of a man, and its teeth like that of a panther. God bleſs me, ſaid his companion, it muſt be a wonderful beaſt indeed; pray where was it produced? That, anſwered the other, is much diſputed: Clavus Beligero, who has given us an accurate account of it, ſays it is coeval with the devil, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him in his firſt attack upon man. But this I can ſcarcely credit, for Milton, who knew all that ſtory as well as the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, makes no mention of it—Petrus Albinus ſays, "the ariſtocrat is the fourth beaſt ſpoken of by Daniel;" and Johanus Scotus, who was
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035516_0045_1004E997946DB0C8"/>
well acquainted with it, ſays that it is the king who was ſet over the beaſts which aſcended out of the bottomleſs pit, of whom John writes in the Revelations; and for my own part I think he is right.</p>
               <p>This is all new to me, I never heard a word of it, nor did I ever meet with a beaſt of that name in all my reading. That's not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, replied the other; yet not the leſs true. But are theſe beaſts numerous? The ariſtocrat is like the phoenix in that reſpect, ſaid the other, there is but one in the world; but that has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſame end as if they were innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for it has travelled over the whole world, and wherever it ſets its foot, it leaves such <hi>terrible impreſſions</hi> that they can ſcarcely ever be effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, unleſs by the blood of millions. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, ſaid his companion, that ever the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould defile America. Your prayer is uſeleſs, anſwered the other, it has, alas! been in this country too long for our quiet—Who imported it, continued he his not as yet come to my knowledge; but one thing is certain, it was brought here from England, for it is well known that Lord Dunmore was very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with it, and acted ſolely under its direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What new wonder it this?—you ſpeak of it as if it were a reaſonable being. Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, replied the deſcriber, yes, it poſſeſſes the art of reaſoning to a high degree. It was this
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035516_0046_1004E99917522378"/>
circumſtance that led Clavus Beligero to think it was the devil's companion in the defeat of our firſt parents, becauſe the ſerpent is ſaid to be more ſubtile than any beaſt of the field; and what is more wonderful ſtill, it ſpeaks diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and underſtands accurately all the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and tongues that are spoken on the earth—and its diſcourſe is full of <hi>high ſwelling words of vanity.</hi> It was the ariſtocrat, continued he, that planned the campaign which rendered Burgoyne ſo famous, it preſided at the Indian war feaſt, and 'tis ſaid that it dictated the war ſpeech delivered to them by the general.—It was alſo held in high eſteem by General Howe, and planned the whole of that elegant exhibition, in honour of the general, ſtiled the Mezchienſa. At the cloſe of our conteſt, the Engliſh through ſpite let it looſe, well knowing it would be a worſe enemy to us, than either the Hittite or the Canaanite was to the Jews. This being found out, Dr. Franklin, Rittenhouſe, and a few other ingenious men, contrived a TRAP to catch it; but it is creditably atteſted, that about that time the crafty creature put itſelf under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Society of Cincinnati. Since that time the ariſtocrat has never appeared to any but the great and well-born, and to them he is ſo very agreeable, that although he is of ſuch an hideous appearance, yet ladies of the moſt delicate mould play as familiarly with him as if he
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035516_0047_1004E99AB9D09920"/>
were a kitten; it is alſo ſaid, though I cannot credit it, that the ariſtocrat has been the chief counſellor, attended to by a certain perſon high in authority, that he is admitted into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate chamber when the doors are ſhut, and is always preſent in the houſe of Repreſentatives when the galleries are cleared. Well, ſaid the other, many a ſtrange ſtory you have told me before, but this is the moſt ſingular I ever liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to; why continued he, the English have done us more real harm by leaving that devil of a beaſt hehind them, than it was in their power to effect with all their armies. Yes, that's true, ſaid the other—but the TRAP ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by Franklin is not loſt, though it is a <hi>little</hi> out of <hi>order;</hi> and I ſtill hope the ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocrat will be caught; and, that America may have the honor of freeing the world of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human monſter.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, they got up, paid their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning and departed—I followed their example—I ran the whole way home; often however, looking on this ſide, and that, for fear it would leap upon me from ſome of its lurking places—and I might, Mr. Editor, ſafely aſſure you that the ariſtocrat meets me in my waking medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is even preſent in my dreams—I wiſh that ſome of your ingenious correſpondents would be ſo good as to inform me through the medium of your paper, whether this beaſt

               <p>WELL Mr. Editor, for my own part I can't conceive of what ſtuff ſome people are made—You ſay, that you do not feel that plagued rib-beating and head-bumping bout—Perhaps the <hi>gentlemen,</hi> for gentlemen they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly are, were only in ſport, and you did not clearly underſtand them—if this was the caſe, I do not think it was over and above kind of either you or them, to make ſuch a confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded rompus, and ſo to frighten poor, quiet inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive people, out of their ſeven ſenſes—I am ſure that I ſhan't feel myſelf the ſame thing this month. I feel myſelf dwindle very much of late—I grow paler and paler, and how can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? Conſtantly on the watch—ever on the wing—Why Hercules could not ſtand it—and how then can I—Frightened by plots, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed with wonders, made jealous and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful by conſpiracies and combinations, robbed of my natural reſt by inſurrections, terrified to death by whipping, pummelling, choaking, noſebumping,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035516_0049_1004E9A2ABF60358"/>
eye-bruiſing, and cow-ſkinning.—I can with the wiſe man exclaim, with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit. I was juſt reflecting this laſt evening, when in ſtepped my neighbour. He came in without knocking; a ceremony I will never again diſpenſe with—for I will be on my guard, and am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined if I can't get a peep at the knocker through the window, the perſon ſhall give his or her name; and unleſs I know them well, but one at a time ſhall be my gueſt.</p>
               <p>What think you of times <hi>now,</hi> ſaid my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as he ſeated himſelf in a chair—Think of them ſaid I, why I am going to think no more about them—let them ſight who love it: as long, ſays I, as nothing can be gotten by fighting but black eyes and bloody noſes, I'll declare off—I'll ſtart to-morrow morning, added I, and then let the hardeſt ſkin hold longeſt out. Well but I thought, replied my neighbour, that you had been always a lover of order and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and yet you talk of running away: Is this the part of a good citizen?</p>
               <p>I have always, ſaid I, been a friend to good order, and that for two reaſons—religion bade me love my neighbour as myſelf, and do unto all men as I would they ſhould do unto me—and I do not yet believe that religion is a <hi>cypher;</hi> ſecondly, I always have been an advocate for good government, becauſe being but a weakly
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035516_0050_1004E9A42F989DB8"/>
little fellow, and not very fool-hardy, as I have often told you, my whole dependence for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is on ſociety—I therefore love the law; not club law, that's my averſion; and if ever I find myſelf inſulted, I retreat behind it, and find myſelf perfectly ſecure—But at preſent, ſays I, it ſeems the law is ſet at defiance—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in the Bible I have read theſe words, "There was no king in Iſrael, and every one did that which ſeemeth good in his own eyes." I began to think that is the reaſon of all our diſorders—We have too much <hi>freedom</hi>—our chief magiſtrate has too <hi>little power,</hi> and therefore is not ſufficiently reſpected. When the hon. Robert Goodloe Harper, and I. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams, humbled themſelves ſo much as to ſtate, with remarkable preciſion and infallible vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth—if ſufficient power had been lodged in the proper authority, all who ſuffered themſelves to doubt, but for one inſtant, the truth of the relation, ought to have been carbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naded—And you ſee, added I, what the Editor of the Aurora has gotten for ſpeaking out—I wiſh, continued I, the law-makers would ſpeak plainly, and tell us, if the being a volunteer, and immediately under the direction of the chief magiſtrate, gives any excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges—It has ſome how or other popt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my head that it does. I remember a
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035516_0051_1004E9A5B25D99B8"/>
foolish fellow in the country, having been hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with the office of conſtable, came home in a great flurry, and ſummoning the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours together, went on thus: My good friends and neighbours, with the greateſt good nature and love, I warn you not to provoke me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or even tread on my corns, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for, riſing from his ſeat, and placing his arms a-kimbo, Gentlemen you muſt know I am now a <hi>civil officer;</hi> I am, I ſay, gentlemen, a conſtable, and may therefore, kick, cuff, beat, bruiſe, cowſkin, or kill any man I pleaſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay gentlemen, for God's ſake be careful. Now, ſays I, if this is the caſe in reſpect of the volunteers, as I for my own part have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection but it ſhould be, becauſe they are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the <hi>niceſt honour and humaneſt minds,</hi> and being enrolled for the expreſs purpoſe of ſupporting order and good government, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting us in the enjoyment of our rights, our lives and honour would <hi>undoubtedly</hi> be perfectly ſaſe in their hands—I would only wiſh it to be generally known, and then every perſon would know, how he ought to reſpect theſe gentlemen of <hi>honour;</hi> I am ſure, ſaid I, I would do any thing, bruſh their coats, black their boots, or <hi>powder their fore tops,</hi> rather than be either run through the body, or ſhot through the head; but as long as we are ignorant what ſhould be done for the men whom the Preſident delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035516_0052_1004E9A738498FA8"/>
to honour, we are every moment in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of incurring their diſpleaſure, and perhaps occaſioning our own ruin.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſaid my neighbour, I think we have ſome reaſon to be alarmed, but not to ſuch an extent as to cauſe us to run away from the city—the moderate men of both parties, who I hope are equally lovers of their country's good, though they do not exactly agree in the mode of bringing it about, ought to meet and fix upon ſome method to keep under this ſpirit of anarchy. Delays, in ſuch caſes as this, may be very dangerous—if blood is once ſpilt in this mad buſineſs, God only knows, where it will ſtop—Both parties have arms in their hands, and in both parties are many brave men—The death of one man would only be a prelude to the death of thouſands. That's what I fear, replied I—Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Phillis, cried I, as loud as I could bawl, go and tell your miſtreſs to make all the ſpeed ſhe poſſibly can, for we'll leave town before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break. Away ran Phillis—and in came Mrs. Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Why my dear all this haſte? Why all this haſte, replied I, that's a queſtion indeed; do you think I am going to ſtay here to have my throat cut, to be whipped to death, or ſkivered like a lark?—No, no, I'm not ſuch a fool yet, God be thanked! Our Preſident, ſaid I, ſaid our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was in danger of being turned into a bedlam by French principles—But I doubt that we ſtand
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035516_0053_1004E9AED9588298"/>
in more danger of turning it into a ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe by wicked practice—But, ſaid ſhe, where will you go?—Go, ſaid I, where ſhould I go, but to the place I was during the laſt war, and then we will be ſafe—and if I ſhould live, ſaid I, to ſee the end of the ſcuffle, I'll be then in the high way to preferment—for to have done <hi>nothing,</hi> or <hi>worſe</hi> than nothing for the country, you know has ſo highly recommended the old tories, that they are now raiſed to power, truſt and honour—That may be true, anſwered ſhe, for any thing I know; but how ſhall we go?—We will go in the ſtage—Why we have no places taken you know, and it is now too late—In the water ſtage then, cried I—There are no water-ſtages to ſail to-morrow my dear—Well in a waggon, a cart, or on our feet, ſaid I, rather than ſtay here and be killed—I believe we can't go to-morrow, Patty has no ſhoes, the mantua-maker has not brought home my gown, and the barber has not your wig ready yet—Death and confuſion! cried I—My dear Sir, ſaid my neighbour, do not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yourſelf to death; this fooliſh buſtle will in a day or two blow over; and take my word for it, that your ſecurity will be more confirmed and not made leſs ſure thereby—The eyes of every true American are on the actions of each day—The genius of America is not dead, but <hi>only ſleepeth</hi>—Let <hi>us,</hi> ſaid my neighbour, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to overleap the boundaries of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—let
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035516_0054_1004E9B05DB3A340"/>
us be <hi>calm,</hi> cool and collected—You will ſhortly ſee that thoſe who dig a pit for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall themſelves firſt fill it—for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent make yourſelf eaſy; I aſſure you, you are in no danger—So ſaying, he ſhook me cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the hand, and departed; whilſt I was forced, much againſt my inclination, to poſtpone my journey.</p>

               <p>IN my laſt you know, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced much againſt my mind, to poſtpone my journey; and as my friend ſaid, I find all the buſtle has ended, and peace and good order ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as uſually—Ever ſince I have been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to bring my mind to ſuch a ſtate as not always to be ſo ſeverely acted upon by the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of alarm which is ſtill kept up by a certain deſcription of people, I doubt not to anſwer ſome very valuable purpoſes. I can only ſpeak for myſelf—of other folks I know but little—but if many in the union have been ſo plagued with their lying alarms as I have been, I think they may exclaim, like the old fellow with the great belly, in a book my neighbour ſometimes reads
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035516_0055_1004E9B1E2938060"/>
to me, called, I think, Shakeſpeare, "Lord help the while"—I have been, like the weather-cock, the ſport of every blaſt; like a tennis ball, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died from hand to hand; now up and then down, for all the world like the ends of a balancing beam—As for example: when first I heard of a French conſpiracy for the ſubverſion of our government, publiſhed in the Engliſh paper, and found that a number of <hi>our very</hi> wiſe men in Congreſs believed it, why what ſhould poor I do, but believe it alſo—Ah, ſays I, it muſt indeed be true; if there were not ſome foundation for it, Harper, and Smith, and Otis, and Fenno, and WILLIAM COBBETT, men ſo remarkably gifted with <hi>long heads,</hi> would never have credited it; and I'll lay my life, added I, thoſe men will <hi>ferret</hi> out theſe ſecret-working villains, who wiſh to riſe on our ruin—Thus my mind was placed on the very pinnacle of expectation—I greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ran over the contents of each paper, looking for ſomething which would prove me a true <hi>prophet:</hi> for I have ever been very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the act of <hi>foreſeeing,</hi> though I muſt confeſs I am generally diſappointed; but in that I have good company, witneſs my friend Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per—that's my comfort. Well, as I was ſaying, I looked, and looked, and pauſed, and looked again, till at long, and at laſt, out came the ſtory of the <hi>famous</hi> packet directed to Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Franklin Bache, ſealed after the form in

which the Directory, and all that ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeal their letters of <hi>great</hi> conſequence—So ſo, ſays I, my prophecy is come true at laſt—I thought they would <hi>ferret it out,</hi> and I ſee I was not miſtaken—I could ſcarcely ſit a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill, ran round to all my acquaintances, told them of my having <hi>foreſeen</hi> as much long ago, and freely conſigned Bache to puniſhment and inſamy. But judge Mr. Editor, my confuſion, when Bache, with ſo much manlineſs, called upon them for his packet—and when received, broke it in the preſence even of his enemies, as well as friends; and lo! the important communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation proved to be two pamphlets—My neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours laughed at me—What's come of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy now, ſaid one?—You <hi>foreſee</hi> truly, ſaid another—What death muſt Bachedie, ſaid a third—Aſk Porcupine, he is in the ſecret, replied a fourth; whilſt I ſtood in the middle, as ſtill as a mouſe, and as ſheepiſh as Hamilton when he wrote the ſtory about Reynolds' wife.</p>
               <p>However, picking up a little confidence, Have patience, friends, ſays I, you will all ſee—Huſh, cries a man at my elbow—Robert is going to give us another prophecy—aye—aye—Harper—ſays a ſecond—He <hi>foreſees</hi>—Out with it, ſaid a third. I turned, and ſeeing an opening in the croud, ran home as faſt as my heels could carry me; from which I did not ſtir for three days. The recalling of this tranſaction has ſo ruffled

               <p>THIS comes with the kind love, and good wiſhes of myſelf and family to you and yours, hoping this will find you all in good health, as we are, thank God, at preſent—I was much ſurpriſed to beſure couſin Robert, to hear that you had of late turned your mind ſo much to politics, and in particular, that you had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to correſpond in the public prints with the editor of the Aurora, who is for certain, as all our neighbours ſay, a dangerous ſort of a man. It was by mere chance, as I do not take the Auro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, that I met with your publications, and now write purely to give you my advice on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—Ah! couſin Robert, if you only followed the good advice of your father, my honoured uncle

Timothy Slender, you would certainly never have troubled yourſelf with ſuch kind of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which, believe me, does not ſuit ſuch heads as yours—Is it poſſible you can have forgotten how earneſtly he always warned all his friends and relations, and particularly yourſelf, how that you ſhould not upon any account have any thing to do with ſtate affairs, but mind your own proper buſineſs, and get money as faſt as poſſible. He was, as every body knows, a very wiſe man, and to me it appears unaccountable that you could ſo ſoon forget his precepts—But how in the name of wonder, if you muſt be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in politics, came you to chooſe the editor of the Aurora, in preference to all others, to correſpond with? Why he is repreſented all thro' this neighbourhood as a moſt ſtrange ſort of a man, and moreover ſuſpected ſomehow of a kind of an inclination for democracy, and writing and printing about liberty; and how that all men ought to be equal, and that the preſent ſyſtem, which (as Mr. Fenno ſays) no body underſtands, is better than the good old kingly government, which you know our wiſe fathers always loved. You may well be afraid, as I ſee by your letters you are, of the bad conſequences of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. See only what it has brought your corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to. Why we have been informed, that he has been attacked on account of his publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and beaten and abuſed in a moſt ſad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

—Take warning dear couſin, and think how poor a chance you would ſtand againſt ſuch fighting fellows, when the editor of the Aurora was overcome by only ten, and it is even doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if Buonaparte himſelf would not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched by twenty ſuch deſperadoes. Why there is one fellow who is ſo powerful, that he can kill at every blow, if he pleaſes; and then there is another, God bleſs us, a moſt dreadful ſort of a man, who is ſure to injure every one that comes within a ſcaffold pole's length of him—beſides there is M.

               <p>I had juſt wrote ſo far, when Dorothy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and underſtanding I was writing to you, inſiſted upon knowing the whole buſineſs—It is impoſſible to give you an idea of the manner ſhe took on, when ſhe heard the dreadful danger you were in, and ordered me to ſet off immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and perſuade you all to come up—and in particular to offer couſin Slender the uſe of Dobbin, together with her new ſide ſaddle and ſafeguard—However, recollecting that you had moved, and not knowing whither, I perſuaded her at laſt it would be more proper to ſend our oldeſt ſon Titus, with directions, if he cannot find you, to call at the Aurora office, and leave

handling a cat-o'-nine-tails, and the ever memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable engagement between the editor of the Aurora and fifteen cavalry officers; in which the officers gained, by manly actions and deeds of hardyhood, laurels, which ſhall never fade, but flouriſh as long as the Aurora riſes. But all theſe were nothing to what I now feel—Lord bleſs me dear Sim, are you in earneſt?—Have I indeed been meddling with politics? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! I thought I might talk of the moon for a month without meddling with her!—See what it is to have a <hi>poor head</hi>—I find I have been juſt in the ſtation of the fellow in a play that my neighbour read to me the other night, who had been ſpeaking <hi>proſe</hi> all his life without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it—Duce take the politics—A man's indeed reduced to a fine condition, when he can't write an account to his friend that he has been frightened, without meddling with poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics—Dear Simon, you ſtudied the law a little in your youth—write to me as ſoon as poſſible, read over my letters, tell me if I have written ſedition—If I have not, they can't put me in limbo; and God be praiſed I am not an <hi>alien.</hi> But if you doubt in the ſmalleſt degree, put the houſe in readineſs, that was occupied by your brother Hezekiah, and ſend black Titus down with Dobbin—we'll loſe no time, but go up to you bag and baggage; and once we are there, they muſt have better ſpies than the Britiſh

In the midſt of my concern, I reaped a little pleaſure from your remembering my good old father ſo affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately: I hope couſin, ſince you have ſo well, and <hi>ſo ſucceſſfully,</hi> remembered his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, of getting money as faſt as you can, that you have not forgotten another of his ſayings, which ſtill followed this—"but make not too much haſte to be rich"—and then he would add, "and ſtill remember, my dear children, a well won penny goes far."—You aſk, how I came to correſpond with the ſeditious editor of the Aurora?—If you had carefully read my firſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you would not have aſked. I there informed him, it was becauſe his accounts were ſo fair, that his paper juſt read like a hiſtory—and the more I read, I declare couſin, I like him the better. I hope, dear Sim, you'll not only take this paper yourſelf, but cauſe Simon Sure, Thomas Silly, William Doolittle, and Jeremiah Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, who are all our blood relations, to take it alſo, and read it ſeriouſly, that they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves and know ſomething. Inform them, from me, that they will receive more delight in reading it, than ever they did from Valentine and Orſon, the Seven Champions of Chriſtendom—yes, almoſt as much as from Laugh and be Fat, or any other ſtory book I know.

It brings to my mind the poor fellows that were burnt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the buckwheat ſtraw at the Crooked Billet—And for any of the reſt, I am not ſo much afraid at preſent; for Barnabas Bigbones ſwears, that if they look croſs at me, that he will dreſs them in the true ſtile of Mendoza, the Britiſh bruiſer—But I promiſe you, I'll not touch any of them, unleſs I do it without my knowledge, juſt as I touched politics—Give our beſt reſpects to couſin Simple, and tell Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus I am collecting a few diverting ſtory books for to entertain him during the next winter.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE ever been a great advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the dignity of human nature, and have ever condemned that very <hi>prudent</hi> counſel giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a miſer to his ſon, "deal with every man as if he were a rogue;" my practice has ever been the contrary, I deal and eſteem every man honeſt and honourable, unleſs I know by experience, or on good authority, that he is not. 'Tis very true, I have often ſuffered by this good opinion of man—but the pleaſure I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from placing ſome degree of confidence in my fellows, and giving no place to diſtruſt in my boſom, amply compenſates me for any little loſſes I have ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>In agreeableneſs to this mode of reaſoning, I conſider every one of our Repreſentatives in Congreſs as honourable men, becauſe I know nothing to the contrary. Says I to myſelf, they all have our good at heart, and are worthy of double honour. One thing, however, appeared to me very ſtrange, that all having but one end in view, how had they come ſo widely to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? And ſo I told my neighbour—I believe neighbour, ſaid I, man himſelf is the greateſt
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035516_0065_1004E9E8A0565200"/>
riddle, and the moſt difficult to explain, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was propoſed ſince the day that Sampſon propoſed his famous one to try the ſkill of the Philiſtines—Gallatin ſays one thing, Harper the quite contrary; yet they are both men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and both no doubt love their country—When I hear Harper reaſon, ſaid I, then I'm on his ſide; Callatin replies; I change ſides—I'm ſure he is right. Otis, or Rutledge, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tonguey man gets up, harangues for an hour, and in the end convinces me that I was in the wrong—Findley once more convinces me—and thus I am plagued, until at length I know no more of what opinion I am of, than I know of the man in the moon—Now that which puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles me ſo confoundedly, ſaid I, is, whether, judging ſtill charitably, added I, theſe men think that they themſelves are right. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly anſwered my neighbour, they do; why if they did not from their ſoul, believe that they were acting for the advancement of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's good, they would be as arrant knaves as ever exiſted—Well, anſwered I, it may be ſo. God forbid, it ſhould be otherwise; yet I freely acknowledge that my poor brain can't compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it: God help the ignorant, ſaid I, ſince the wiſe can be ſo much miſtaken; for although I know but very little, this much I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—one of them muſt be wrong. Indeed Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, anſwered my neighbour, you are right—
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035516_0066_1004E9EA2507FEE8"/>
but we will ſtill hope that we have not arrived as yet to ſuch an height in wickedneſs, as to pretend to be lovers of our country, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of its good, while ſecretly plotting its ruin. Hope! ſaid I, when hope dies heart breaks. I'll hope for the beſt as long as I can breathe; but though I hope, I can't be ſatisfied that all are as they ſhould be—I know, continued I, that many a thing is a riddle to me that is very plain to other people—and this always makes me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diffident: but you, my friend have been bleſſed with a good education; you can read Latin and Greek, and ſpeak Italian and jabber French—tell me, do you really believe that Harper did not know that the paper he read in Congreſs was a forgery? Can you think that he ever poſſeſſed a thread of conſpiracy, but what was bred in his own brain? Do you think that Joſey Thomas thought he was right, when he forged the cleven votes on the conteſted elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—or, can you imagine that Blount thought he was <hi>right</hi> in that little <hi>delicate buſineſs,</hi> that has been ſo ingeniouſly <hi>huſhed</hi> into ſilence, for the good of the public? Do you imagine, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued I, that the people who ſo neatly dreſſed up the ſtory of the ſhip Ocean, and ſerved up the whole crew carbonaded alamode-de-Francaiſe, a highly reliſhed diſh, ſit for a Virginian's dinner on the day of election, thought they were right? Or, to mention no more, can you think Dr.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035516_0067_1004E9EBA7D70538"/>
Morſe can pretend that he was right, to preach the ſame ſtory from the pulpit, heightened with all the Doctor's rhetorical ſkill, that ſo he might rouſe his hearers to revenge; when Chriſt, whom the Dr. pretends to follow, enjoins it on all his followers to forgive their enemies—It may be, ſaid I, that theſe people think they are right—but I aſſure you my poor head can't fathom it.</p>
               <p>Indeed Robert, anſwered my neighbour, in this reſpect religion and politics are ſomething a-kin; Chriſt informs us, that they who ſhould kill his diſciples would think they were doing God ſervice; although the precepts of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are ſo plain, that he who runs may read them. In politics it is nearly ſimilar: You think a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of government is beſt—I think a republican form of government is the <hi>higheſt note in the gamut of nonſenſe.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Fenno's Farewel. United States' Gazette.</note> You think there is nothing on earth, for goodneſs, to be compared to the federal conſtitution—I think it is like an old ſow going to eat up her farrow of pigs. <note n="†" place="bottom">lbidem.</note> Each of us no doubt, think we are right, and all theſe <hi>little falſe ſteps,</hi> that appear ſo crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in your eyes, may be eaſily juſtified.—You know it is a well known maxim, that every ſcheme is lawful in war—Are not theſe parties
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035516_0068_1004E9EEB4DDDFE0"/>
at open war, as to opinion, and ſometimes as to practice too—therefore all ſchemes are lawful—Now continued my neighbour, if I can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manoeuvre you by a few well-tim'd lies, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged letter, or a few nicely managed votes—as I know I am right in the end, let that juſtify the means.</p>
               <p>Lord help me, ſaid I, what kind of doctrine is this. Does not the apoſtle tell us, "Ye ſhall not do evil that good may come of it."</p>
               <p>Yes, truly, anſwered my neighbour, but that was long ago, and we are not altogether of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion—For Dr. Dwight, the great poet, ſays that the Jews ſlew all the male children of the Canaanites, not for any thing the <hi>poor little things</hi> had done, but leaſt they ſhould do evil when they could; juſt as we kill the young ſnake—not becauſe he has bitten any perſon, but leſt he poſſibly might do ſo. I declare, ſaid I, it is the ſame doctrine to a leek—What? ſaid my neighbour—I'll tell you, ſaid I: the other morning, as I took my walk along the ſtreet, I was much alarmed with the noiſe of blows, and very high words—I haſted up to the houſe from whence it proceeded, the door ſtood open—I then ſaw a luſty ſhoemaker ſtrapping his wife in a moſt unmerciful manner. I called out—the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtopped, and, ſeemingly with much good humour, ſaid, I hope it will do you no harm my dear—Are you not aſhamed, man, ſaid I, thus
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035516_0069_10049B16B86EBB48"/>
to beat the woman?—No Sir!—Pray, what wrong has ſhe done?—Nothing Sir—In the name of common ſenſe, then, why do you beat her?—Why Sir, for fear ſhe <hi>ſhould do wrong!</hi>—'Tis juſt ſo, ſaid my neighbour—with all theſe gentlemen you will find it an eſtabliſhed axiom—the end juſtifies the means—For proof of this, attend to the whole ſyſtem of bribery, ſpies, ſomenters of ſtrife, ſecret ſervice money, diplomatic ſkill, ſyſtems of alarm—and inſincere negociations—I'll think of it, ſaid I, as I ſhut the door—but I am not yet convinced that we ſhould do evil that good may come of it.</p>

               <p>THE other evening my friend and I, after having taken a cheering glaſs, ſat talking over the affairs of our country, as is our cuſtom—Well, ſaid I, the birth-day of INDEPENDENCE draws near: I hope it may'nt rain—I am an enemy to all holy days, that, and Sunday excepted—But; on the 4th of July, I'm determined to put on my Sunday coat, and treat Mrs. Slender and the children in one of the public gardens, if I ſhould wor<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

for it, for a fortnight after. I think, ſaid my neighbour, it would be better for you to work the hour later for to pay your expence, for a fortnight before: for I have often heard your frolicking fellows ſay, it was very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to pay for paſt pleaſure. I declare, anſwered I, you are right—I'll ſit up an hour every night from this to that, and the hope of the pleaſure will keep up my ſpirits. But now let me aſk you—is it not a ſhame, that you, who are ſuch a great scholar, and underſtand grammar, and hiſtory, and all that, never write a line we hear of?—Can't you write us an ode, or a ſong, or an oration, for the fourth of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?—Odds my heart do, ſays I; I'll carry it to the editor myſelf—Nay, anſwered he, the editor has one prepared, and a good one too; but, continued he, here, drawing a paper out of his pocket, is an ode, not for that glorious day, but for the day after—you ſee I am ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular—which you may take to your friend and welcome. I ſnatched the paper with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt earneſtneſs, and without ſaying a ſingle word, whipped up my hat, left my friend in a fit of laughter, and ran to the office with it; where I had the misfortune to not find you. I therefore thought proper to write theſe lines on the ſubject, and your attending to my friend's ode, which I have incloſed, in due time, will oblige your friend, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>SOME time ago, I thought that I had gained ſuch an entire maſtery over my fears, that the whole troop, ſo remarkable for printer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flogging, here, or elſewhere, could not make me tremble—and ſo I walked about in open day, ventured even to talk in favour of the Aurora in the little beer-houſe at the corner, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was ſo fool-hardy, as to aſſert that the clergy were now behaving in the moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent manner, by praying for the ſucceſs of Suwarrow, the pope, and the re-eſtabliſhment of the Romiſh religion; for the downfall of which they, and their fathers before them in the church, have prayed heartily for at leaſt theſe two hundred years—But this conduct raiſed ſuch a buz about my ears, that I have
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035516_0073_1004EA0065B847D0"/>
been forced to run away in good earneſt. What chiefly led to this was the following—One day having gained a little time, I took my ſtick in my hand, adjuſted my wig, and walked out to ſee an acquaintance. Who happened to be there, as ill luck would have had it, but his reverence—So after ſome chit chat, about dry weather, water works, ſickneſs, and ſome thoughts on death; which I thought, made the parſon's face longer than ordinary, though it is not ſhort at any time; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>the thus addreſſed me—So Robert, I am informed that the reaſon why you no longer attend to hear God's word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Sabbath, is becauſe you neither like our prayers, nor our preaching. I confeſs Mr. Editor, I knew not what to ſay—I looked on the one ſide, and then on the other, roſe from my chair, ſpit in the ſand box, and threw a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, I had but juſt lighted, into the fire.—I had never contradicted the clergy, becauſe my good father had often ſaid to me, "Robert ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddle with the clergy—they are edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tools;" but father's advice had ſlipped out of my memory at that time—ſo giving three pretty loud hems, by way of preface, I anſwered—And pray your reverence, ſaid I, can I have a better reaſon? If, Robert, anſwered he, our preaching or praying were not <hi>orthodox,</hi> then you would have a right to quit us and go elſewhere; but what fault have you?—Why ſir, ſaid I, as to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035516_0074_1004EA01E8E1BE78"/>
what is <hi>orthodox,</hi> and, what do you call it, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dox—Heterodox, replied he—Aye, aye, ſays I, that's it, I never clearly knew what they meant—I have but a poor head at beſt, and theſe are hard words—I would be much obliged to your reverence to tell me what they mean, and then I will try to anſwer your queſtion. The parſon putting on one of his airs, went to thus: I am aſtoniſhed Robert to hear you talk thus—You have appeared in public, cenſured men and meaſures, in that democratical ſheet called the Aurora, and your name is ſamiliar in every company. Some ſay you're a man of ſenſe; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that you are a fool; yet both laugh at your productions; and <hi>you aſk</hi> what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> words.—They may be <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> for me, ſaid I, much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of my own ignorance; but if you pleaſe to tell me, I'll thank you kindly ſir, and if I can I wont forget what you ſay.—Why ſaid he, with a ſmile of ſuperior wiſdom, orthodoxy is the whole body of principles taught in <hi>our church</hi>—and every opinion contrary thereto is heterodox—So, ſaid I, this is indeed to me very ſtrange but I'll remember it—But, added I, can a principle be heterodox one year, and orthodox another year?—No ſir, anſwered his reverence, with much authority; orthodoxy is ever the ſame; the principles I have the honour to preach, were taught by Chriſt, his apoſtles, and ſo on,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035516_0075_1004EA0760D75558"/>
to the preſent day, without the ſmalleſt alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.—It may be ſo, anſwerd I, I have but a poor brain—but I confeſs I think otherwiſe. And pray ſir, ſaid the parſon, what is this great fault that we have been guilty of, and of which your wiſe head is ſo full?—Sir, ſays I, before you come to preach at our church, the reverend Dr. * * * * never went into the pulpit, but he prayed for the fall of Antichriſt, that man of ſin, and this I think was orthodox praying—He preached very often againſt the errors of the church of Rome, and from the prophecies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Pope was Antichriſt; and this, becauſe you know it was taught in <hi>our church,</hi> was orthodox preaching—Now ſir, you pray for the re-eſtabliſhment of the Romiſh religion, and preach that the French have committed a damning ſin, in pulling Antichriſt from his chair, converting images into money, conſecrated bells into democratic cannon, ſhutting up the nunneries, and ſending the poor girls into the world to anſwer the end of their creation—Now ſir, is this alſo orthodoxy? Undoubtedly ſir, anſwered he, for you know it is taught in our church. But, ſays I, how ſir can this be? You told me but juſt now, that orthodoxy did not change, but was always the ſame—I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, ſaid his reverence, that you have, Robert, ſtumbled on ſomething like a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and it deſerves a reply. We prayed
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035516_0076_1004EA0B5DF670D0"/>
for the downfall of the Pope, becauſe we thought religion would be benefitted by it—we now ſee that religion is much hurt by it, and therefore we wiſh it reſtored—If indeed God had brought down Antichriſt in <hi>ſome other way,</hi> and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true Calviniſtic Preſbyterian religion in its room, then we would not have deſired its reſtoration—<hi>and this is orthodox.</hi> It may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, ſaid I, for ought I know to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but one thing I'll venture to ſay, that it is neither agreeable to Judaiſm or Chriſtianity—I hope, Robert, ſaid his reverence, you don't pretend to argue religion <hi>with me!</hi>—God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid ſir, ſays I, excuſe me for ſpeaking raſhly; but if you pleaſe ſir, I'll tell you a ſtory—Let's hear it, ſays he; but I tell you aforehand, there muſt be nothing about the French in it, for I hate them heartily—Indeed ſaid I, there is not one word about the French in it, for I believe it is ſomewhere in the Bible or Teſtament—Once upon a time, there was a very great man, but he was not a Jew, who had the bad fortune to be afflicted with the leproſy—all the doctors in his own country were conſulted in vain, and he was pronounced incurable. At length he was informed, that in the land of Jewry, there lived a very good man, who could cure him in an inſtant. The great man ſet forward imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on his journey. His equipage was ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did—his retinue numerous. He arrived—the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035516_0077_1004EA0CE2FC0E00"/>
man of God paid no reſpect to him, although he was very great—but ſent him word to go and waſh himſelf a number times in the river Jordan. The great man was enraged. Are not, ſaid he, the rivers of my own country much better than the rivers of Iſrael? I thought he would have come out to me—put his hand on the place, called on God, and ſo healed me. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being a man of ſome ſenſe, and having ſome wiſe men about him, he was induced to obey the prophet. He did ſo, and was cured. You have my ſtory. I can make nothing of it, ſaid the parſon. Well, ſaid I, I'll apply it. God had his way (like the prophet) of bringing down Antichriſt; but you, like the great man, ſay his way was not a good way, and if he had taken counſel with the very wiſe Chriſtians of the day, they would have taught him, that it would have been much better to have left him ſtanding, than to have made uſe of ſuch inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and now you would inſtruct him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his providential diſpenſations by your advice, and once more erect ſpiritual Babylon, bring back the images, catch the poor nuns, and ſhut them once more in their cells. As I ſaid this, his reverence leaped to his feet. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Robert, ſaid he, you are unfit to live in ſociety, 'tis ſuch men as you who are bringing the curſe of God on our city. I pronounce you an infidel, a deſpiſer of the clergy, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035516_0078_1004EA0E67D43E48"/>
authorities, holy cuſtoms, and a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man in ſociety, and I hope we ſhall ſhortly have it in our power to lay ſuch fault-finding ignorant fellows by the heels, that ſo they may learn to reverence the moſt uſeful and honourable of all men, the clergy. Having ſaid this, he ſtalked out of the houſe with great conſequence. Shortly after I took my leave. The ſtory ran like lightening—Robert Slender is an infidel, ſaid one—Why, he argued with the Reverend—, and the parſon told him he ought to be impriſoned for the good of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Mrs. Slender went to viſit her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour—I am very ſorry, ſays Goody Rattle that it is ſo bad. What's the matter, ſaid ſhe? Why I need not hide it—Mr. Slender is an infidel—a ſpeaker againſt the clergy—a puller down of religion—and his reverence ſays ſo!—In ſhort, I had once more to ſhut myſelf up in the houſe; and I have moved into the country among my friends, till the ſtory blows over.</p>
               <p>P. S. Your papers have come ſafe to hand. Lord bleſs me! what a ſtory about horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieves, and buſy-bodies, and proclamation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtakes, and Kingſton-cargo! But I cannot ſay I underſtand it all—but I'll read it over along with my friend the Latiniſt, (for he came out along with me) and perhaps I'll ſteal time to ſend you our remarks.</p>

               <p>THE miſtakes that are daily made in the world, is a ſubject, which, if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, would certainly yield us ſome good amuſement, and perhaps improvement too. I know I have a tolerably good memory, though, like the Iriſh gentleman's horſe, I cannot boaſt of a very good judgment—I ſhall therefore try to amuſe you a little. Miſtakes may be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two kinds, firſt, thoſe that alter the terms, but do not much injure the ſenſe—ſecond, miſtakes, that by altering the terms, entirely deſtroy the ſenſe—As Mr. Reverend ſays, of each of theſe I ſhall treat in its order. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when I was a ſchool-boy, one of my claſs-mates was reading to old Mr. Slaſhem, that portion of the New Teſtament, where it is thus written, "there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth;" but the poor boy read it thus, "there ſhall be whipping and ſlaſhing to death."—You ſee he miſcalled the words, but nearly preſerved the ſenſe—the matter was not great. One day I heard a young clergyman citing that text," the devil was a liar from the beginning"—by miſtaking the term he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it thus, "the devil was a lawyer
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035516_0080_1004EA16865F8FB0"/>
from the beginning"—the ſermon was little the worſe—the <hi>ſenſe was undoubtedly preſerved.</hi> When ſuch miſtakes as theſe happen, I think we ought to receive them with good nature, laugh at the blunders, and ſo diſmiſs them. But miſtakes of the ſecond claſs ought not to be ſo eaſily paſſed over. As for example: the boy who read in ſchool, "beggars' ſkins," inſtead of "badgers' ſkins," was, without a doubt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly whipped—for ſhould the tranſcriber of the command have made ſuch a blunder, and have ſent it to the <hi>heads of the people;</hi> as the command of the Lord, what a plagued buſtle would it have made among the beggars—and the butchers would have had a very diſagreeable taſk. The man alſo was much to be blamed, who read thus, "Mr. Edward Young was <hi>executed</hi> at Cambridge"—when he ought to have read, "Mr. Edward Young was <hi>educated</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge." But all theſe miſtakes are but as mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills to a mountain, when compared with the miſtake made by Dr. Stevens, or Dr. Somebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or T. Pickering—to publiſh to the United States, that ſuch ports in St. Domingo, on the firſt day of Auguſt, ſhould be open for to receive veſſels from the United States; when it ſhould have been, that it would be lawful for veſſels to leave the United States on and after the firſt of Auguſt—is ſuch a blunder as I believe has not its parallel. The blunders or miſtakes I
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035516_0081_1004E9F55C788F18"/>
have juſt mentioned, have a likeneſs of ſound or a likeneſs in ſenſe; but this has neither a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity in ſound or ſenſe—And ſo I told my neighbour the Latiniſt, How do you think, ſays I, could it have taken place—That I cannot poſitively ſay, replied he—perhaps to honour more highly Touſſaint, the treaty was written by <hi>his ſecretary,</hi> in the language ſpoken in Guinea, and the miſtake is the fault of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator—But, ſays I, Dr. Stevens muſt have heard of it, converſed about it, and agreed to it—Perhaps not, ſaid he, he <hi>might</hi> confide in General Maitland—the General <hi>might</hi> tell the Doctor right enough—the Doctor <hi>might</hi> write his diſpatches from memory; his memory <hi>might</hi> deceive him—or, he <hi>might</hi> write St. Domingo for the United States, and the United States for St. Domingo—Cheſterfield's abſent man, you know, did much more than this, when he ſwallowed the dice and threw the glaſs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over the table.—But, ſays I, I would ſuppoſe, that the whole tranſactions were regularly laid before our Executive, and I don't ſee, how Dr. Stevens can be blamed—I would think—, but I confeſs I know but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about any thing, my own calling excepted, and not half enough about that; that our Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive knows, and had as good a right to know all about it as Robert Liſton, who I ſee has the honour of underſtanding <hi>plain language,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035516_0082_1004EA1809B07BE8"/>
them all to rights—Well, ſays my friend; if you won't take my thoughts on this buſineſs, you muſt e'en take your own—but added he, my pride as an American, is, I aſſure you, very much hurt by this ſhameful affair—where the fault lies is a myſtery as yet—but it will come out—It is a diſgrace, as the fellow ſays in the play, put upon a whole nation—And Robert Liſton has demonſtrated to the world, that he is a man of conſummate knowledge and ability-diploma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; for he can not only argue, but convince his opponents; for Timothy, <hi>who it is well known is no friend to Robert,</hi> confeſſes the fact. But ſaid I, I suppoſe it cannot be of much conſequence, otherwiſe more care would have been taken—It certainly will produce ſome very ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to ſome merchants, replied he, who put faith in the proclamation. They immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted out, in order to be there by the time appointed—At the day, they are ready to enter but are not permitted—thus diſappointed, they muſt either run into the Engliſh ports, already ſtalled, or run the riſque of falling into the hands of Rigaud's pickeroons; in either way it will enrich the Engliſh merchants, and ruin the Americans. God bleſs me ſays I, what a miſtake this was—A ſchool boy ought to be whipped for it—the ſkining of the beggars inſtead of the badgers was but a trifle to it—But I hope, ſaid I, there is ſo much virtue ſtill left among us as to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035516_0083_1004EA198E7BB7C8"/>
inveſtigate this matter in full, and ſo effectually prevent ſuch doings for the future—Having ſaid this, I bade my friend, as I now do you, a very good night.</p>

               <p>LAST evening I had juſt placed my tools in proper order, laid aſide my apron, and was preparing myſelf to take a walk, to catch a mouthful of freſh air, when who ſhould ſtep in but my old friend the Latiniſt, with one of your papers in his hand: I have ſeveral times wondered, friend Robert, ſays he, that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoke to me about Mr. Sweezy the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thief, when you and I have been talking about your good friend Robert Liſton. Odds my life, ſays I, I would have mentioned it—but the thing did not at all ſurprize me—Not ſurprize you, anſwered he, why, how could that be, that Sir Robert Liſton would have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with a horſe-thief, <hi>a knight</hi> of Great Britain with one of the <hi>knights</hi> of the moon, as John Falſtaff ſays, is unparalleled. I declare, ſaid I, friend, if you talk thus you'll convince me that there's leſs knowledge connected with a ſkill in the Latin language than I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035516_0084_1004E9F3D8C650D0"/>
thought—I have not read a great deal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I; my time for reading is very little, and my poor weak head can't bear much; but in what little I have read, I never have met with a king that was not ſurrounded by a parcel of rogues, raſcals, ſycophants and lazy fellows, who had no conſcience but intereſt, and no god but gain! Only turn to the Bible, ſaid I, ſee what a righteous ſet ſurrounded David, the man after God's own heart, I Sam. xxii. 26. And every one that was in diſtreſs, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that <hi>was in debt,</hi> and every one that was <hi>diſcontented,</hi> gathered themſelves unto him. But, added I, turn to the hiſtory of kings, glance only at their ſyſtem of bribery, of ſpies, ſecret ſervice money, aſſaſſinations, open violations of every principle of justice, honour, and honeſty—mark the horrid atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which by the inſtrumentality of theſe pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned vagabonds, they have been enabled to perpetrate; and then ſay, if a horſe-thief does not poſſeſs more real honour, more humanity, more generoſity, and more Chriſtianity than any king on earth—Mark him out for me, ſays I, in a rather higher tone of voice, and though I can neither ſpeak Latin, nor read Greek, nor jabber French, nor ſing Italian—yet I'll lay the price of all the laſts in my ſhop, that I'll prove, before an impartial audience, that a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thief is the moſt honourable of the two—for,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035516_0085_1004E9E4B076B918"/>
continued I, what have kings done, ſince firſt we found them in the hiſtory of man, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on a ſyſtem of aggrandizing themſelves on the ruins of millions, and endeavouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to eſtabliſh their own greatneſs, though the poignard of the aſſaſſin, or the ſlow work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poiſon, ſhould drink the blood of thouſands? The poor horſe-thief—the Sweezies of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, or of antiquity, are ſo much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and ſo far the leſs criminal, as the value of a horſe is beneath the life of a man—Of a man, did I ſay? of thouſands of men. I'll not diſpute this with you, Robert, ſaid my friend, but you know in the eyes of the world, the one is more eſteemed than the other—More feared anſwered I, haſtily, I think would have been a better word; for that they are feared, is a fact—but eſteemed!—I am much of opinion, ſays I, that if eſteem was food, and kings could live on it, there would not be a king in the world in a week. At this my friend laughed heartily, and ſaid, well Robert, you grow more eccentric every day—As to that, ſays I, I don't know what it is, only one thing I know, I hate kings moſt heartily—don't miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, added I, I mean their office and their power, as for their perſons, God be praiſed, continued I, I love them and all mankind—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all my Father's children, though like the devils, they are in an abſolute ſtate of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035516_0086_1004E9D83B38FAF0"/>
rebellion to his laws.—Well, but Robert, ſays he, after all, was it not a little ſtrange, that a horſe-thief was employed?—I cannot ſee that it was, anſwered I—Lord bleſs me, have not kings their aſſaſſins? Emperors their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, whom they can ſend for a head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judge or jury? Have not Seignors, and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and Moguls, their mutes? And have not bawdy-houſe keepers their—<hi>bullies?</hi> And would you think it ſtrange, that an ambaſſador, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of a king, might not even employ a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thief, and not in his <hi>proper vocation</hi> either, but only as a letter-carrier?—I confeſs I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange in it; but I have but a poor brain—there may be much in it that I can't ſee. Why ſaid my friend, I have as little depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the friendſhip of kings as yourſelf, and therefore I cannot help thinking there was more in the choice of this perſon, than has yet, or perhaps ever may come to light. It was a thouſand pities that the fellow got away; on a cloſe examination things might have come to light, which would have been highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous. From the affair of Mr. Blount, and the repeated aſſurances we have received, through very different channels, of a ſtrong party in the United States, favourable to the intereſt and political views of Britain; Liſton's letters, which are in the hands of the public; and the diſagreement between the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035516_0087_1004E9CFCC1C1130"/>
for the ſettlement of <hi>Britiſh claims,</hi> I am induced ſtrongly to believe, that the Britiſh have not yet relinquiſhed the idea of once more cauſing the United States to bend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their power. Attend to the language of her hirelings here; do they not vilify our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, mock at our laws, abuſe our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, traduce and calumniate our magiſtrates, and talk of our freedom as if it were ſlavery? Do they not ſpeak of the Engliſh government as a paragon of perfection? Smooth over their crimes, and convert them into virtues? Inform our citizens, that the Engliſh are the happieſt, the freeſt, the moſt virtuous and moſt humane people on earth? Have they not even endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to increaſe our <hi>ſyſtem of expence?</hi> that ſo our citizens might be galled with taxes, and ſo forced to look back to the mild era of '63, when they were happy under the foſtering wing of Great Britain.

It is highly probable that

he was to ſound ſeveral influential characters, either directly, or indirectly, that ſo ſecret ſervice money might not be applied in vain: that they might know their ſtrength, and if opportunity offered, be able to take time by the forelock—For it is abſolutely certain, that if the coalition of kings, emperors, ſeignors, and moguls, can prevail ſo as to eſtabliſh a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in France, which God in his infinite mercy forbid, our republic muſt undoubtedly fall: we muſt receive a king, one of the royal brood of Great Britain, and like ſpaniels lick the feet of godlike majeſty—God help us, ſaid I, I feel very much afraid indeed; I think I ſee the red coats once more march along the Delaware—I think I hear the groans of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Americans from the hulk of the Jerſy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhip—my blood runs cold—I think I behold the Crooked Billet ſcene acted over again, and the poor fellows frying in the buckwheat ſtraw—Lord deliver us, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035516_0091_1004E9C5F4EFBA30"/>
and original mode of puniſhment. One capital defect that I would firſt mention is, that, if I am well informed, the inventor's oven was quite cold; now you know that in all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if fear be taken away, the puniſhment loſes much of its effect, and in an oven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat there is not much fear—there is far more fear in a dungeon, for there a man might be eaten alive by rats. 'Tis true, the air might not be very wholeſome, and might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſome ſlight convulſion fits, but what does that signify? that leaves no marks; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out marks, you know, there well be but a ſlight remembrance. I would alſo remark, that in this puniſhment there is no degrees—You may anſwer, yes—degrees of duration; but I mean degrees of external pain: for inſtance, Put your man when dead drunk into your oven, he either ſleeps out his time and then awakens, or ſleeps the time appointed and never awakens. In the firſt caſe, ſuppoſe he awakens at all, what puniſhment has he felt? In the ſecond, ſuppoſe he never awakens, fools and democrats will rail againſt the mode of puniſhment—Now to remedy theſe defects, and make the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>uſeful,</hi> as it is elegant <hi>and manly,</hi> the following hints are offered. Firſt, let the oven be carefully heated, and the heat regulated by the beſt thermometer: when it ſtands at 90 it

others—The inventor may eaſily ſee, that I ſtill leave the perfecting of this new military mode of puniſhment to himſelf: for there are a number of <hi>petty crimes,</hi> which his good ſenſe will eaſily adapt his oven to—ſuch as quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, lying, pilfering or ſtealing, gaming, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending houſes of ill fame, that is, <hi>democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal taverns,</hi> or diſpoſing of any of their clothes or accoutrements, &amp;c. &amp;c. I have offered theſe hints, merely for the good, glory, and honour of the army of the United States, and that the inventor, when he applies for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as he undoubtedly will) to the Congreſs of the United States, that ſo not only the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> but the honour of the invention may be preſerved to, and for the uſe of himſelf and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, may have his whole ſcheme as perfect as poſſibly—I am well aware, Mr. Editor, that no mode of puniſhment can be deviſed, which will not be objected to by you, and your diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing democrats; but ſurely in this mode, in point of ſuffering for the ſame crime, there can be no partiality—flogging, <hi>you well know,</hi> has been formerly the puniſhment; but a drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may ſtrike lighter, or heavier, according as he loves or hates the culprit—not ſo here, the thermometer loves and hates all alike.</p>

               <p>LOOKING over the laſt received numbers of the Aurora, which you have ſo punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſent me, and for which I thank you, I chanced to light upon that one, in which you have given us your good friend Robert Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's letters. The largeneſs of the type im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtruck my eye—ſo taking off my ſpectacles, and wiping them clean—let me ſee ſays I, as I replaced them on my noſe, let me ſee, what we have got here?—it muſt certainly be of ſome importance, for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare he has printed it ſo plain, added I, that he who runs may read it—Having thus ſaid, I read it over, ſentence by ſentence, till I came to theſe remarkable words, "THIS GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN A NEW SUBJECT OF PROVOCATION TO FRANCE." 'Tie a lie ſaid I, a baſe lie—Our government, ſaid I to myſelf, is, God be praiſed, too honeſt, too honourable, and too much bent on peace, to give a ſubject of provocation to any nation, or perſon whatever—ſo ſaying I aroſe from my ſeat, and ſtepped into my friend the Latiniſt—Did you not hear this? ſays I, as I drew my chair up to his deſk. What's the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035516_0096_1004EA21CB84AB60"/>
matter Robert, ſays he, you ſeem to be much ruffled?—Ruffled ſays I, why flesh and blood can't bear it—Why, here's that Engliſhman, added I, who was ſent here by the king of Great Britain for no other purpoſe, as far as I can ſee, than to breed broils, and ſee—ſays I, pointing my finger to the place, he has the aſſurance to ſay our government has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en another ſubject of provocation of France—I never in my life, ſaid I, before wiſhed to be a lawyer or a judge, or ſome great man, added I, but if I were, I would undoubtedly proſecute this—I don't know what to call him, ſaid I, for libelling our government—Why Robert, ſays my friend, I did not think you had been ſuch a friend to government; ſure I have often heard you ſay—this is not right, that's undoubtedly wrong, ah! I ſee all's not as it ſhould be, &amp;c. &amp;c. Lord bleſs me, ſaid I, you almoſt put me out of patience. I'll tell you a ſtory—When I was a young man, ſaid I, I poſſeſſed more courage than I do now; when a man grows a little in years his paſſions loſe much of their headſtrongneſs, and he then begins to ponder, weigh and compare, and not to run head-foremoſt into danger—One night returning home from a friend's houſe, where I had ſpent a very agreeable evening, I heard a dreadful buſtle in a houſe on the road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide—I ſtood on the ſtep, pauſed, and would have gone on; but the wine I had pretty, freely
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035516_0097_1004EA2369676550"/>
drank at my friend's, heightened my natural courage—in I ruſhed, and to my great ſurprize found the huſband cruſh'd up in a corner, and the wife banging him with a good cudgel; I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately laid hold of the woman, twiſted the ſtaff out of her hand, and for my kindneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſtout box on the ear; as ſhe made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond blow, I took hold of her hands, upon which her huſband recovering himſelf, came at me with the tongs—I ran for my life, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving three or four ſtout blows on my head and back, my cloathes torn, and my face all all ſcratched, I made a ſhift of ſcramble away with my life—Next morning I took one of my neighbours along with me, and went out to the houſe; we found them both within—I aſked him why he uſed me ſo, when I was ſo ſerviceable to him?—Why friend, do you ſee, ſaid he, my wife and I had a buſtle—that's true enough—ſhe beat me—and what of it?—ſhe is my wife ſtill—and may I never, ſaid he, be ſmiled upon by a woman, if I would not beat any man, aye the parſon of the pariſh, if he would but lay his finger on her—What? ſaid I, though ſhe was flogging you?—Yes ſays he, though ſhe was flogging me; and I tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though ſhe was, ſhe's my wife ſtill; and as loving a good natured creature too as ever lay by a man's ſide—I underſtand you, Robert, ſaid my friend—though you find fault with
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035516_0098_1004EA24EDBC9E40"/>
ſome part of the governmental proceedings, yet you don't want foreigners to interfere. No, no, ſays I, I would, if I had power, let all theſe buſy, meddling fellows know, that it <hi>was our own government,</hi> ſet up by our own conſent, and anſwerable to us, not to them, for any wrong it may poſſibly do: and therefore I can't be eaſy to hear this ſervant of a king tell his fellow ſervant, that our government has given a ſubject of provocation to France—Why Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, ſays he, in your paſſion you forget the beſt part of your ſtory—He ſays, ANOTHER SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECT OF PROVOCATION; which, you know, preſuppoſes that they have given ſome ſubjects of provocation before this one—Rot the * * * ſaid I, and ſo he does; well 'tis good for him, added I, that he is in Philadelphia, where we don't love to give ſubjects of provocation to any body, for I am ſure, if our miniſter in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, would ſpeak ſo of the court of London, I don't know what would be the conſequence—but I think he would ſurely be diſmiſſed, and 'tis highly probable his houſe would be pulled about his ears—but we are the peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of William Penn, and therefore he's ſafe, though, ſays I, for my own part I don't love a bone in HIS BODY, nor of any other body who would dare ſo to ſpeak of our government—Why we could not talk in another ſtrain, if we were as fond of fighting France as ever buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035516_0099_1004EA2B5A9534D0"/>
Jackſon, or big Ben, or the tinker of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, were of entering the liſt to fight for fun to the royal family of his royal maſter.—Are not you too warm on this ſubject, Robert? ſaid my friend; why, ſome of the people with whom I have converſed, ſay there's nothing in what he ſays, of any conſequence—Odds my heart, ſays I, I wiſh people would ſpeak from them as they do to them, as the ſaying is. If any man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me ſhould talk thus, 'Tis true indeed, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Slender affronted his friend, and he pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; then Robert in <hi>conjunction</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gave him another ſubject of provocation, but it is ſcarcely ſuppoſed to be probable, that his old acquaintance will POCKET this ALSO—what would the impartial public ſay of me?—would they not be very apt to ſay, why Robert has indeed behaved very imprudently, firſt in affronting, and ſtill more in again giving him a new ſubject of provocation?—we could not have imagined that a man profeſſing, as he does, to be a Chriſtian, and a lover of peace, ſhould evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuch a quarrelſome diſpoſition—and in CONJUNCTION with others <hi>too!</hi> we really thought he would have behaved much more manly than that comes to—however, we ſee how little truſt ought to be put in profeſſion—Who would have thought it?—Well, well, we plainly ſee, let a man cloak as he will, the cloven foot will out at laſt—What do you think would be my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?

               <p>SINCE you became the editor, I have, till very lately, been highly pleaſed with you. I conſidered you as a man of a determined ſpirit, having one great end in view, and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily purſuing it. I read your paper with both pleaſure and profit, and thereby was led to form a pretty accurate judgment of men and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as I thought; but I believe, ſir, you have at laſt gone mad wrong—Your remarks about the ſhip Kingſton, are, I think, very unſustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and I ſhall now undertake to prove, that whoever they were that loaded the ſhip—who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were who ſuffered her to clear out,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035516_0102_1004EA350C958308"/>
or whoever he was who gave an order for her clearance, all of them acted as honeſt men ought.</p>
               <p>In our dealings with each other, it is a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and long-eſtabliſhed principle, that, that which advantageth me, and does no harm to any one elſe, is certainly lawful for me to do.—In the ſhip Kingſton, Dr. Stevens was to ſail to St. Domingo—Does not every body know, that when you add to Dr. Stevens's weight—<hi>his dignity—his office—his ambition—and his well-known and well-tried diplomatic ſkill</hi>—and join thereto the weight of all his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retinue—that ſtill the ſhip <hi>would not</hi> have half her burden? Now this being granted—and I cannot ſee how it can be denied—unleſs it can be demonſtrated, that an Ambaſſador is a ſufficient burden for a ſhip of as large a burden as the Kingſton—I proceed to prove, that carrying a few articles more, if it could be of advantage to any perſon, and diſadvantage to no perſon—could not be a crime—my firſt is granted—and my ſecond a moral axiom—therefore no blame can be placed to the account of Mr.—, who freighted, Mr.—who cleared it out of the Cuſtom Houſe, or Mr.—who gave the order to the Cuſtom Houſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, as their authority—for their part of the buſineſs—and yet you have made the whole continent ring about it—Ah, Mr. Editor, I am ſorry for thee, that thou didſt publiſh ſo unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035516_0103_1004EA38F9179DA8"/>
that inventory—And ſo I told my friend the Latiniſt—he has no right to ſay a word about that buſineſs, ſays I, he can make nothing of it—odds my life, added I, what a fooliſh thing it would have been to have ſent the ſhip Kingſton ſo far, for ſuch a trifle, as could in reaſon be paid for the paſſage of <hi>one man</hi> and his attendant. Why anſwered he, Robert, you ſeem to have entirely miſtaken the matter. It may be ſo, ſaid I, miſtakes are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in our days among men of the <hi>firſt abilities,</hi> and how then ſhould I eſcape—but tell me, added I, in what?—Why Robert, ſaid he, the ſhip Kingſton was hired wholly and ſolely, for to carry Dr. Stevens and his ſuite, as they term it. Is it poſſible you can be ſerious? ſaid I. I am in reality—it is an eſtabliſhed cuſtom. And as fooliſh a one, ſaid I, as ever I heard of—a whole ſhip for one man—It puts me in mind of a laughable affair that happened about forty years ago in England—A Liverpool privateer took a very rich Spaniſh prize; the leaſt boy in the privateer had ſome thouſands for his ſhare. The ſailors came into port—dreſſed themſelves as fine as poſſible—and every way was taken they could deviſe, to ſpend their money: they would join in cabals, engage all the coaches they could find; each man would have five or six, one to carry his hat, another his cane, a third his knife, a fourth his tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-box—and
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035516_0104_1004EA3A821D07E8"/>
in this ſtate would they ride ten or fifteen miles <hi>to buy a pound of tobacco.</hi> But the fact was, they ſoon got through their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney—but, ſays I, this makes it ſtill leſs of a fault—if they had the Dr's. conſent, and gave him enough of elbow room—But ſtill, ſays my friend, you ſeem to forget that Congreſs made a law to prevent us from buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſelling any thing, or having any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with France, or her dependencies, until they would alter their treatment of our veſſels and come on honourable terms of adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—No, no, ſays I, I have not forgotten that—Why, then you know, it was a breach of the law in the moſt expreſs manner poſſible—By no means, ſaid I—I remember to have read in the Teſtament, theſe words—<q>For the LAW was not made for the righteous, but for ſinners, and the rebellious</q>—ſo ſay I of this law, and ſo I expound it—The friends of good order and good government are not <hi>bound,</hi> nor is it fit they ſhould be <hi>bound,</hi> by theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and regulations that others are <hi>bound</hi> by. They are the righteous: Democrats are the ſinners and rebellious. Mark that—they ſpeak againſt authority and revile kings, which you know are God's ordinance—the law was made to bind them—now, ſaid I, if you can prove that a ſingle pair of democratical breeches were aboard the Kingſton, then I'll grant it
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035516_0105_1004EA3C05ED6908"/>
that the law was broken in reality.—Why, Robert, ſaid my friend, many a queer thought comes into your head, but this is the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular—And yet, replied I, I'm ſure it is true; ſuppoſe, ſaid I, Schneider the printer had gotten a number of men and flogged Captain Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, would the fault have been as trivial as Montgomery's flogging the printer?—Or, had Mr. Duane, and ten or twenty of his friends, went and kicked, cuffed and rib-roaſted any of the <hi>valiant</hi> officers who maltreated him, would the fault be only equal to theirs? Or, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only one more, if the man, whom the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Sterrit killed, with ſo much courage, had killed Sterrit, do you believe, he would have been alive at this day? Its highly probable, ſaid my friend, that he would not. Again, ſaid I, I ſuppoſe you have read the paper of the 24th ult. upon account of which the editor was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, was it in any reſpect to be compared with Cobbett's inſolent and virulent remarks on the nomination of R. V. Murray—and yet you ſee he was not arreſted—And only here lies the difference between them: the one is a citizen of the United States who owes fidelity to the union; the other glories in being a ſubject of the king of England, our former tyrant:—the firſt mantains that all governments originate in the people, and that they make rulers, who are reſponſible to them for their conduct—the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035516_0106_1004EA41474CC640"/>
other maintains, that kings poſſeſs power inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and derive it not from the people, to whom they are not at all reſponſible—and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the laſt is a good federaliſt; the friend of order and good government: the firſt a diſorgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izer, a jacobin and a democrat, and therefore is arreſted—from all which it appears plain to me, that I am not the only one who explains the text I have juſt cited in this manner; I am pretty ſure, ſaid I, according to my poor judgment, that the law was <hi>not made</hi> for the righteous, but for ſinners and the rebellious—I cannot agree with you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied my friend; I am fully of opinion the law was broken to all intents, and that the ſending thoſe goods to the iſland of St. Domingo was nothing better than ſmuggling—One thing is plain—if you or I had done ſo, we ſhould have been ſmugglers undoubtedly—Why that's my ſtory ſtill, ſays I—"The LAW was not made for the righteous, but for sinners and the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious—But as you do not think this a complete vindication, I will propoſe you another, which I think will convince you, that the editor of the Aurora was very wrong to blame the man concerned in this affair—Miſtakes, you know, are now pretty common—Suppoſe two ſhips in the harbour at the ſame time, the one bound <hi>for St. Domingo, the other for Hamburg;</hi> both belonging to N. Crammond, and Co. Theſe goods were intended for Hamburg, but by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035516_0107_1004EA440334A208"/>
take were ſent on board the Kingſton inſtead of the other—and ſuppoſe the miſtake not be found out till ten days after the ſailing of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton—how then could the miſtake be remedied? or who could be blamed? it only was a miſtake, and not <hi>done with any evil intention,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be explained in a manner as <hi>favourable as poſſible.</hi> And I proteſt, ſays I, ſince I began to ſpeak, I am much more pleaſed with this way of ſolving the difficulty than the other; and I do, added I, ſeriouſly dedicate this ſolution to the parties concerned, if they have not ere this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated a better—My friend, on my ſaying this, got into an immoderate fit of laughing, at which I felt ſo much hurt and offended, that I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately took my hat and ſtick, and came off without bidding him good bye, proteſting that I would do as I now have done—tell you the whole ſtory.</p>

               <p>IN reading the hiſtory of man, and attending to the important and noble ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of eminent individuals, either for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their liberty when aſſailed by rapacious tyrants, or freeing themſelves from the galling yoke of ſlavery and oppreſſion, I have, ſaid my
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035516_0108_1004EA4588A29240"/>
friend the Latiniſt, as we ſat chatting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day under a tree, felt for them in all their troubles; my heart has bled for their wounds, and gladly, were it in my power, would I have acted the good Samaritan, and poured in the wine and oil. But, continued he, I do not remember that ever my feelings were excited to a higher pitch, than by the fate of Jonathan Robbins. Why, what of him? ſaid I; I think I never heard his name before. I do not remember any of our miniſters, or conſuls, our generals, or commodores, added I, of that name: if he was one of them, to be ſure he might be an object of pity—for, ſays I, he might have been <hi>recalled,</hi> and diſgraced, without knowing for what—or <hi>diſhonoured,</hi> by having a young officer placed over his head—or, when almoſt worn out, and grown grey in the ſervice of his country, a number of men might come forward in the face of the world, and pledge themſelves to ſupport and protect all ſuch, as from envy or malevolence might be inclined to raiſe and circulate ſtories calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to injure his reputation, and fully his fair fame.—In the half of the time, ſaid my friend, that you have been conjecturing, I would have told you his ſtory—Odds my life, replied I, let me hear it—has poor Robbins been carbonadoed for going to France (as Dr. Logan did) to make peace, and keep us from
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035516_0109_1004EA470C792938"/>
murdering one another?—or has he been flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, like SCHNEIDER and DUANE, for writing the truth, as many people ſay?—or—If you go on at this rate Robert, ſaid my friend, the moon may change before I'll get time to tell you the ſtory—Why, ſaid I, you well know I would fifty times rather find out a thing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than be informed of it by any man alive—but I hope you will go on, and tell the ſtory your own way—Some time ago, ſaid my friend, a Britiſh ſhip called the Hermoine, was taken by the crew—the captain, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, fell in the conteſt—ſhe was carried into a Spaniſh port, and then ſold by thoſe who carried her in, who made off with the booty. After ſome time, however, the affair was found out, and it was made appear that a Jonathan Robbins was ſomehow concerned in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—This Robbins, a citizen of the United States, had before that fatal affair been preſſed aboard the Hermoine, and there forced to work and fight in a cauſe <hi>contrary</hi> to his conſcience—yet this man was taken in the United States, impriſoned—tried—not by a jury, mind that—and delivered over in chains to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Britiſh frigate, who immediately ſailed for Jamaica, where he will undoubtedly be hanged like a dog.—'Tis all a joke, ſaid I, there is no more truth in it than there is in the Alcoran—A CITIZEN of the UNITED STATES
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035516_0110_1004EA489684E480"/>
delivered up to the Britiſh, to be hanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he uſed every means in his power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his freedom, when actually a ſlave!!—No, no, ſays I, 'tis by circulating ſuch ſtories as this, that your Democrats will loſe any little credit they may have acquired—Don't labour under a miſtake Robert, replied my friend, 'tis as true as the goſpel—Well, anſwered I, if it is indeed true, I am as ſure as I live; that if any state government has given him up, our Preſident will immediately claim him—Softly good friend, returned he, the Preſident adviſed and requeſted them to give him up. Did he indeed? ſays I, then if he did—but I cannot believe it—'tis all over, we muſt be once more a Britiſh colony—for if that were not the caſe, could any man be blamed, at the riſque of his life to obtain his freedom? I think, ſays I, I have as much of the milk of human kindneſs flowing in my veins as any a preſident or king in the world, and yet I believe in my heart, added I, if I were taken priſoner by an Algerine cruizer, if I had it in my power to gain my liberty by ſending the whole ſhip's crew to Davy Jones, bag and baggage, I would not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate a moment—Nor would any one blame you for ſo doing, ſaid my friend—but you muſt remember, this was a frigate belonging to his Britannic Majesty; the chief ſupporter of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, good government, humanity and religion
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035516_0111_1004EA4DC20614E8"/>
in the world—it matters not, ſays I, ſomewhat ruffled, what ſhe was, a ſloop or frigate, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop or what you pleaſe—or whether ſhe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Dick, Billy, Tom or Harry—anſwer me only this plain queſtion, Was Robbins kept there againſt his will, or not? if againſt his mind, then he was as completely a ſlave on board the Hermoine as if he had been in Algiers; and is it poſſible that any freeborn republican, who loves, or ought to love his freedom more than his life, can condemn his equal in rights and in liberty, for breaking the chains with which he is unjuſtly bound, and which every moment rankle in his fleſh?—My God! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I, it is poſſible, that, if a Britiſh raſcal makes me a ſlave, beat, abuſe, and compel me to fight contrary to my conſcience, and if an opportunity offers by which I may regain my liberty, once more reviſit my country, my beloved relations, and dear friends, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of my violent oppreſſor and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical enſlaver—muſt I for this be delivered up by my country?—muſt I for this be delivered up to die?—for aſſerting my native right, for repelling the unjuſt attack of a cruel tyrant, for ſupporting my independence at the riſque of my life, muſt I be ſacrificed on the altar of deſpotic power?—If this be true, added I, what language does the unaccountable action ſpeak to the poor American ſailors?—Does it not
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035516_0112_1004EA4F44E232C8"/>
ſpeak thus—ſailors of America, remember, that ſhould you be preſſed by any of the ſhips of war belonging to his Britannic Majeſty, ye muſt there do duty faithfully and truly—if you be ſet at liberty, 'tis well; if not, though it were in your power to regain your liberty, you <hi>muſt not;</hi> for in the attempt, ſhould you kill any of his Majeſty's ſubjects, your country will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly give you up to his Majeſty, the king of Great Britain—and God have mercy on your ſouls?—Why Robert, ſaid my friend, you talk on this ſubject as if you felt it—Feel it, replied I, is it poſſible for an American citizen not to feel it? if he be not actually blinded by prejudice, or money, which is ten times worſe, his loſt dignity, his injured independence, his degraded ſituation, from a citizen of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican republic, FREE and INDEPENDENT, to be a SLAVE in a Britiſh galley, muſt render him completely miſerable—Good heavens! ſays I, if his blood does not run cold—if he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonizing through every pore—'tis becauſe he is BOUGHT WITH A PRICE—This is juſt your way, ſaid my friend, you always get ſo warm on the ſubject you diſcourſe of, that I am glad always to withdraw, leſt it ſhould injure your health—Health, rejoined I, what is health? what is life? what is houſe, or home, without liberty? but painted baubles fit only for children—that I do not carry my reaſoning too far, ſaid I, I'll
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035516_0113_1004EA50E76F94C0"/>
put a caſe, which I would wiſh the Judge Bee's of the day would rightly conſider—Suppoſe an Engliſh frigate, to make up her complement of men, ſends a part of her crew and preſſes fifty Americans—after ſome time, theſe men find that it is in their power to take the frigate—they do ſo; but fifty Britons are ſlain in the ſtruggle—they run the veſſel into the neareſt port—ſuppoſe a Spaniſh—diſpoſe of her, and ſo return home, and openly avow what they have done—Sir Robert Liſton proſecutes them—pleads the article of the treaty—and, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! "our Preſident gives his advice that <hi>they ought to be given up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</hi> Judge Bee preſides—and theſe fifty men are delivered over to be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <hi>Molech</hi>—Spirits of ſeventy-ſix! ſaid I, whither are ye flown? What ſhall arouſe you from your lethargy? Free-born American!—AWAKE! AWAKE! ere thou ſleepeſt a ſleep unto death—But ſtay Robert, ſaid my friend, have you not ſtated this caſe wrong?—You know that theſe fifty men perpetrated an high crime on, or in Britiſh territory, that is, on board a Britiſh veſſel, and by the treaty they <hi>muſt</hi> be given up. 'Tis falſe, ſaid I, I know no ſuch thing; they acted virtuouſly, they acted nobly—they ſo acted, ſaid I, that Great Britain, were they her ſubjects, would load them with honour—But let us, added I, examine this caſe—ſuppoſe ſays I, this frigate's crew had landed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035516_0114_1004EA561A046E50"/>
of taking men, had gutted two or three merchants' ſtores, and carried away whatever they could find valuable, what would you call them? Pirates undoubtedly, anſwered my friend. And would they not forfeit, ſaid I both the ſhip and their lives? I am of opinion, ſaid he, they would. Suppoſe I, or Jonathan, or Nathan, or Dick, or Tom, ſays I, ſhould kill a dozen of them, or the whole of them—have I or he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a crime?—By no means ſaid he—but they did not do this. I'll prove they did worſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I—do not you know, ſays I, that in the law of God, <hi>which we ſay we reverence,</hi> it is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated, that he who ſteals from me any of my property, muſt reſtore it four-fold; but he who ſteals a man, ſhall, ſays the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>die</hi> the DEATH? But ſtill, ſays my friend, admitting the full force of this reaſoning, for indeed it cannot be denied—they did not come aſhore and take away Jonathan Robbins—but preſſed him out of one of our ſhips—That, ſays I, does not alter the caſe—You know the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh council argued, that on board a Britiſh ſhip is Britiſh territory, and hence I would ſuppoſe that an American ſhip is American territory, at leaſt my weak brain cannot ſee the difference—And, ſays I, by this mode of reaſoning, I prove that a Britiſh officer preſſing, enſlaving, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining an American citizen, is a man-ſtealer, a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, a robber of the worſt poſſible deſcription—
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035516_0115_1004EA58D692F9F8"/>
and that any American, confined and enſlaved aboard any veſſel of any power whatever, as, by his confinement and ſlavery all ties of amity are broken which did formerly ſubſiſt between him and them, is juſtifiable, in the ſight of God and man, to regain his liberty, even with the deſtruction of the ſhip's crew—and deſerves the higheſt approbation of his country, for aſſerting his right in ſo noble a manner—And, added I, 'tis all a joke to talk about the treaty, becauſe they, by preſſing a ſingle American, broke the treaty effectually—unleſs, added I, there be a ſecret treaty, by which they are permitted to preſs American citizens to aid the cauſe of kings againſt the cauſe of republicans—which I have oftentimes thought before now, to be the caſe—One thing, ſaid I, is pretty certain, there are ſecrets, there are clues, there are conſpiracies;—but, whether the ſagacious Harper will be able to ferret them out—or whether Peter will blab them, Robert acknowledge them,—or the Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian committee open the way for them, is as great a ſecret as the secrets themſelves. But, honeſt Americans, 'tis full time ye were unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; 'tis time ye ſhould think for yourſelves, 'tis full time ye ſhould ſee what the fate of Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Robbins leads to—and what ſecurity it holds out, for the ſafety of our hardy ſailors, and infant navy—And ye ſhall be made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, ſaid I, ſnatching up my hat, and
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035516_0116_1004EA5B9A42A418"/>
adjuſting my wig, which I had much ruffled in my paſſion—for I'll go this inſtant, and ſend it to my friend Duane, and my friend Callendar; and, ſays I, to that noble fellow, that I would be very glad to be acquainted with, the editor of the Albany Regiſter—and, ſays I, we'll hold up the A's, and B's, and C's, and D's, and E's, who yielded up poor Robbins to that infamous government, that they may be branded with eternal execration.—</p>

His cheerful countenance and friendly addreſs always give me new ſpirits, and although he is a man of great learning, yet you ſee he talks as familiarly with me as if I were as great a ſcholar as himſelf. After having taken a ſtool—(for you muſt know, Mr. Editor, that in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where taxes are pretty <hi>high,</hi> proviſions not very <hi>cheap,</hi> and houſe rent enormous, it is not eaſy for a poor mechanic, who has five or ſix

               <p>Indeed, ſaid my friend, I ſee you have wrought yourſelf up to a very ſerious ſtate of mind; but I much fear, as the ſcripture ſaith, that this caſe of poor Robbins is only "the beginning of ſorrows." When the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of nations, and the freedom of ſtates, are depending on almoſt the turn of a beam—when corruption lifts its head in open day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhamed—when bribery is reduced to a regular and avowed ſyſtem—when religion has degen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated into hypocriſy, and men with brazen front aſſert that they love God, and yet plot to deſtroy their brother, covering the earth with blood, rapine, and horrid cruelty—when ſuch is the ſtate of things, ſaid my friend, the deſtruction of an obſcure individual, however diſhonourable and perfidious the ſacrifice, will be eaſily looked over, and perhaps forgotten—for who would attend to the burning of a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when Etna or Veſuvius blazes?</p>
               <p>To enſlave men, continued my friend, is now as earneſt an object, as to free them was twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago—Look at the combination, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035516_0120_1004EA6829FCD338"/>
mark the intrigues of kings and emperors, popes and muftis, princes and biſhops, nobles and prieſts, with the whole train of their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and adherents, united as one man—and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, ſee republics betrayed into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt themſelves—It is vain, friend Robert, to repine over the fate of poor Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins; we may 'tis true deplore the man—but we muſt conſider what is to become of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public under ſuch a precedent of diſhonour and indignity!—Liberty or its enemies muſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph—one or the other muſt fall; and, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gloomy you may be, conſidering the ſtate of this martyr to Britiſh tyranny and influence, his death may be the ſalvation of our liberties. My friend never diſplayed ſo much ſenſibility, the tears trickled from his eyes—and I was ſo much overcome, that I could only ſqueeze his hand as he laid it once more on my knee, and proceeded again.</p>
               <p>My friend Robert, this ſacrifice of Robbins is a very ſerious tranſaction—and whether ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, or farmer, every man muſt think upon ſo ſtrange and cruel a ſubject—the ſcheme for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring univerſal ſlavery is untolding faſt, by the principal actors in our country; but it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy itſelf. In other countries liberty has been deſtroyed by one bold ſtroke—here it is attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by piece-meal—The Britiſh arms could not prevail twenty years ago—they now uſe other
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035516_0121_1004EA69ACD7A8F8"/>
weapons, they gain upon us inch by inch—The Britiſh treaty was a bold ſtroke—We now are forced to acknowledge that Grenville out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generalled Jay—and the commiſſioners for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Britiſh claims have diſcovered, that we are completely entrapped, ſaddled with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous debt, which for ages we could not diſcharge—and for which wiſe behaviour, the ſinger of diſcernment, throughout the world, is pointed with rebuke at our degraded forehead—Why need I mention, added my friend, the alien and ſedition bills—ſtamp act—ſtanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my—exciſe law—and many others; they are but ſo many features of the grand ſyſtem that is ſo well underſtood, and ſo warmly advocated by the friends of order and good government—God bleſs me, ſays I, why you almoſt make my hair ſtand on end—I think, I ſee ſlavery rattling her chains and ſharpenig all her inſtruments of torture—What ſhall we do?—how ſhall we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape? Muſt we ſit ſtill until the label "SLAVE" is ſtigmatized upon our cheek, or branded on our forhead?—Is there no help?—Yes, anſwered my friend, there is, thanks to the wiſe, the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous framers of our glorious conſtitution—the invaluable right of election is ſtill ours—Let us but uſe this right well—let us be diligent to canvaſs the character of theſe men that are candidates for any office of power or truſt—let our pointed diſapprobation ever attend thoſe
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035516_0122_1004EA6DE2974D08"/>
who are known to have advocated the Britiſh treaty, alien and ſedition bills, ſtamp act, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army, &amp;c.; and in a ſpecial manner, let us be careful of <hi>truſting</hi> any man who maintains, that a republican form of government may mean any thing or nothing. Indeed, ſaid I, I think we ought to be careful—If we can do any good, and do not do it, then we are crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal, as my good old father uſed to ſay—but it has long been a queſtion with me, as well as with many of my well-meaning neighbours, whether we can do any good by going and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at elections. I have often heard this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument made uſe of—What need I go to the election?—let them put in whom they will, to me it makes no difference. I muſt obey, let them chooſe who they may. And ſo reaſoning, they ſtay at home. And if a bad man is choſen, then they comfort themſelves thus—Well, God be thanked, we had no hand in it. Indeed, ſaid my friend, they are much miſtaken, but they had a hand in it, and a ſtrong one too; for by one man's ſtaying away, the man who would honeſtly and faithfully ſerve his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, might loſe his election—and every free elector ought to conſider his vote of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as that thereby an able man is choſen to act for the common good; and therefore it is a duty which every man owes to God, his country, and himſelf, to inform himſelf of the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035516_0123_1004EA70A433D280"/>
character of every candidate for any public of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as I ſaid before, with the greateſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impartiality—If he be a man of true honour and of Chriſtian-like deportment; if he be the poor man's friend, and ever ready to curb the rich in their domineering ſtrides; at every time, and in God's name, let us ever ſupport him; for ſuch a man is undoubtedly a treaſure—Having thus ſaid, my friend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it grew late, bade me good night.</p>

I had juſt ſcribbled this far, when in came my friend. Well Robert, writing again? Yes ſays I, I was juſt telling my friend how plaguedly I have been puzzled. With what? Why, ſaid I, you know when Judge Bee paſſed ſentence on poor Robbins, he argued, that his being a citizen of the United States was of no conſequence—and now we ſee the greateſt pains are taken to prove that he was not a citizen—The wiſe men in Danbury ſay they knew him not, and the old ſexton was not preſent at his baptiſm—If it had been of any importance in any way, the wiſe and upright judge, would have undoubtedly known it—and ſince it was not, why ſearch for it now? Are they going to try him again?—or try the judge?—or prove him an Engliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter?—or—I confeſs, added I, I can make nothing of it—Indeed Robert, anſwered my friend, I think you might eaſily ſee the reaſon of this piece of cunning—The people of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca felt more alive to the public affront that was offered to them in the perſon of Jonathan Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, than in any thing that has happened ſince the aera of their Independence—A citizen to be given up, becauſe he nobly, like themſelves, brake the chains by which he was bound, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>death</hi> to bondage, made every lover of freedom and independence ſhudder, and with uplifted eyes exclaim—<hi>Is it come to this!</hi>

It appears to me pretty evident, that it was ſuppoſed, the yielding up an obſcure individual, without fortune and without friends, would never have been noticed by the public; but when the miſtake was found out—when it was diſcovered the America, from Georgia to New Hampſhire, rang with it, then this ſtory, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe I know not, was preſented to the public?—Odds my heart, ſaid I, what's the meaning of this? can it be imagined for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the people are to be gulled at this rate?—are we bound to ſwallow all the ſtories that deſigning men can invent? No, added I, the days of prieſt-craft and king-craft are at an end. God be praiſed, we can, and we will think for ourſelves. I heartily agreed with Judge Bee, continued I, in one thing; though I am not ſure that I have the honour of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it after his manner—His being or not being a native of America, in my opinion, is out of the queſtion—one thing is certain, it has not been diſputed, that ſeveral years ago he applied for, and received a protection, as an American citizen, atteſted in due form—nevertheleſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſailing in one of our veſſels, and having his protection, on which he depended, he was preſſed by theſe ſea-robbers; his protection deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed; and in that, the government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States—For they were either bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, or they were not: If they were not,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035516_0126_1004EA76882E2D60"/>
why was he granted one? Was it to mock him? or throw him of his guard, that ſo he might fall into the hands of enemies, from whom he expected, and indeed received no mercy?—If they were bound to protect a man, to whom, in the uſual form, a protection had been granted, then was it not as great an inſult, as could well be offered to an independent nation, to pay neither reſpect to its flag, or its public and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved acts?—I do not know, continued I, that ever I have been more affected by any ſubject, than I have by this—Poor, unfortunate, brave men!—why are ye thus neglected? why is any nation on earth ſuffered thus to inſult us? Let our government come plainly forward and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it cannot yield a ſailor protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or elſe let them reſent ſuch degrading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour with proper ſpirit, and ſo for ever put an end to the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>I heartily wiſh, ſaid my friend, this affair had never happened; for I am convinced it will much leſſen us in the eyes of the world. Our country is very extenſive—in the increaſe of our population our ſtrength exiſts—to encourage foreigners therefore, to come and ſettle among us, is a plan laid in profound wiſdom—The hardy and laborious Iriſh and Germans, flying from bondage, and ſettling among us, ought to be conſidered as highly advantageous; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much encourages men to ſettle in any
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035516_0127_1004EA7CF3DE5DB8"/>
country, as a thorough belief that there they will be protected in their lives, property, and their invaluable privileges—But how will this damp the ſpirits of Europeans; if they ſhould emigrate to this country, and even be admitted to the rights of citizenſhip, yet with their atteſted certificates in their hand, they may be preſſed aboard a king's ſhip, forced to fight againſt their conſcience, or expire under the laſh—But, continued my friend, I truſt this affair will not be ſuffered to ſleep in ſilence—Our Repreſentatives are acquainted with it, it was not done in a corner—it calls loudly for a cloſe inveſtigation—Robbins, 'tis true, has ſuffered—he cannot be reſtored—but the like may again happen, and we ought to be prepared to meet every difficulty—Entirely occupied by my friend's diſcourſe, and my own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I continued for ſome time to muſe—at laſt—You are abſolutely right, ſays I, and I hope they will pay that attention to the ſubject which it deſerves. But—as I ſaid this, I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, but to my aſtoniſhment my friend was gone—which ſo diſturbed me, that I could purſue the ſubject no farther—</p>

               <p>HAVING heard that there was a tavern at about the diſtance of a mile or ſo from my favourite country ſpot, where now and then a few neighbours meet to ſpit, ſmoke ſegars, drink apple whiſkey, cider, or cider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal, and read the news—a few evenings ago, I put on my beſt coat, combed out my wig, put my ſpectacles in my pocket, and a quarter dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar—This I thought was right; for although Mrs. Slender told me eleven-pence was enough, ſays I, I'll e'en take the quarter dollar, for a man always feels himſelf of more conſequence when he has got good money in his pocket—ſo out I walks, with a good ſtout ſtick in my hand, which I always make a point to carry with me, leſt the dogs ſhould make rather freer with my legs than I could wiſh. But I had not gone more than half the way, when, by making a falſe ſtep, I ſplaſh'd my ſtocking from the knee to the ancle—Odds my heart, ſaid I, ſee what a hand I have made of my ſtocking; I'll be bail, added I, I'll hear of this in both ſides of my head—but it can't now be helped—this, and a thouſand worſe accidents, which daily happen, are all occaſioned by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

neglect, and the miſapplication of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic's money—Had I, ſaid I, (talking to myſelf all the while) the diſpoſal of but half the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the United States, I could at leaſt ſo order matters, that a man might walk to his next neighbour's without ſplaſhing his ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or being in danger of breaking his legs in ruts, holes, gutts, and gullies. I do not know, ſays I to myſelf, as I moralized on my ſplaſh'd ſtocking, but money might with more profit be laid out in repairing the roads, than in marine eſtabliſhments, ſupporting a ſtanding army, uſeleſs embaſſies, exhorbitant ſalaries, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to many flaſhy fellows that are no honour to us, or to themſelves, and chartering whole ſhips to carry a ſingle man to another nation—Odds my life, continued I, what a number of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a man labours under, who has never read farther than Lilly's grammar, and has but a poor brain—had I been favoured with a good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I could no doubt readily ſee the <hi>great uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of all theſe meaſures of government, that now appear to me ſo unaccountable—I could then, ſaid I, ſtill talking to myſelf, ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the old patriots, whoſe blood flowed ſo freely in purchaſing our independence, are caſt aſide, like a broken pitcher, (as the ſcripture ſays) and why the old tories and active refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees are advanced to places of power, honour, and truſt—I could then be able to explain, why

Robbins, an American citizen, for killing an Engliſhman, who held him a ſlave, and ſo gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his liberty, was delivered to the Engliſh to be hanged—and Sterret, who killed a veteran ſailor, who had formerly fought and bled in the cauſe of his country, and then was bravely doing his duty, yet remains unpuniſhed—I would then be able to ſee clearly the reaſon why James Roſs ſhould be advanced to be governor of Pennſylvania in preference to Thomas M'Kean, which to me appears as great a wonder as how George III. Paul of Ruſſia, the Emperor, the humane Suwarrow, and the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning William Pitt, are <hi>well exerciſed, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Chriſtians,</hi> fighting for the glory of God, the ſupport of true evangelical religion, and the protection of civil and religious LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, and good <hi>order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all theſe things are to me, by the want of polite learning, ſo great myſteries, that I have been ſearching for ſome time for a man of true learning and goodneſs of heart, on whoſe ſleeve I might ſix my political faith, that ſo I might jog quietly on through life, without thinking for myſelf—but indeed I have not yet found him—As I ſaid this, by accident I looked up, and perceived to my ſurpriſe that if I had gone but one ſtep further, I would have actually knocked my noſe againſt the ſign-poſt—I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſaid I, here I am—this is a tavern indeed.
