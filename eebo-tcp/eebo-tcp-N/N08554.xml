            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>YE who liſten with credulity to the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of fancy, and purſue with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the phantoms of hope; who expect that age will perform the promiſes of youth, and that the deficiencies of the preſent day will be ſupplied by the morrow; attend to the hiſtory of Raſſelas prince of Abiſſinia.</p>
                     <p>Raſſelas was the fourth ſon of the mighty emperor, in whoſe dominions the Father of waters begins his courſe; whoſe bounty pours down the ſtreams of plenty, and ſcatters over half the world the harveſts of Egypt.</p>
                     <p>

According to the cuſtom which has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from age to age among the monarchs of the torrid zone, he was confined in a private palace, with the other ſons and daughters of Abiſſinian royalty, till the order of ſucceſſion ſhould call him to the throne.</p>
                     <p>The place, which the wiſdom or policy of antiquity had deſtined for the reſidence of the Abſſinian princes, was a ſpacious valley in the kingdom of Amh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ra, ſurrounded on every ſide by mountains, of which the ſummits overhang the middle part. The only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, by which it could be entered, was a cavern that paſſed under a rock, of which it has long been diſputed whether it was the work of nature or of human induſtry. The outlet of the cavern was concealed by a thick wood, and the mouth which opened into the valley was cloſed with gates of iron, forged by the the artificers of ancient days, ſo maſſy that no man could, without the help of engines, open or ſhut them.</p>
                     <p>From the mountains on every ſide, rivulets deſcended that filled all the valley with verdure and fertility, and formed a lake in the middle inhabited by fiſh of every ſpecies, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every fowl whom nature has taught to dip the wing in water. This lake diſcharged its ſuperfluities by a ſtream which entered a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010939_0010_0F852A746491D4E8"/>
dark cleft of the mountain on the northern ſide, and fell with dreadful noiſe from precipice to precipice till it was heard no more.</p>
                     <p>The ſides of the mountains were covered with trees, the banks of the brooks were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified with flowers; every blaſt ſhook ſpices from the rocks, and every month dropped fruits upon the ground. All Animals that bite the graſs, or brouſe the ſhrub, whether wild or tame, wandered in this extenſive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, ſecured from beaſts of prey by the mountains which confined them. On one part were flocks and herds feeding in the paſtures, on another all the beaſts of chace friſking in the lawns; the ſprightly kid was bounding on rocks, the ſubtle monkey fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licking in the trees, and the ſolemn elephant repoſing in the ſhade. All the diverſities of the world were brought together, the bleſſings of nature were collected, and its evils extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and excluded.</p>
                     <p>The valley, wide and fruitful, ſupplied its inhabitants with the neceſſaries of life, and all delights and ſuperfluities were added at the annual viſit which the emperor paid his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when the iron gate was opened to the ſound of muſick; and during eight days every one that reſided in the valley was required to propoſe whatever might contribute to make
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010939_0011_0F852A75185F8C38"/>
ſecluſion pleaſant, to fill up the vacancies of attention, and leſſen the tediouſneſs of time. Every deſire was immediately granted. All the artificers of pleaſure were called to glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the feſtivity; the muſicians exerted the power of harmony, and the dancers ſhewed their activity before the princeſs, in hope that they ſhould paſs their lives in this bliſsful captivity, to which theſe only were admitted whoſe performance was thought able to add novelty to luxury. Such was the appearance of ſecurity and delight which this retirement afforded, that they to whom it was new always deſired that it might be perpetual; and as thoſe on whom the iron gate had once cloſed were never ſuffer'd to return, the effect of longer experience could not be known. Thus every year produced new ſchemes of delight, and new competitors for impriſonment.</p>
                     <p>The palace ſtood on an eminence, raiſed about thirty paces above the ſurface of the lake. It was divided into many ſquares or courts, built with greater or leſs magnificence, according to the rank of thoſe for whom they were deſigned. The roofs were turned into arches of maſſy ſtone, joined with a cement that grew harder by time, and the building ſtood from century to century, deriding the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This houſe, which was ſo large as to be fully known to none but ſome ancient officers, who ſucceſſively inherited the ſecrets of the place, was built as if ſuſpicion herſelf had dictated the plan. To every room there was an open and ſecret paſſage, every ſquare had a communication with the reſt, either from the upper ſtories by private galleries, or by ſubterranean paſſages from the lower apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Many of the columns had unſuſpected cavities, In which ſucceſſive monarchs repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited their treaſures. They then cloſed up the opening with marble, which was never to be removed but in the utmoſt exigencies of the kingdom; and recorded their accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in a book which was itſelf concealed in a tower not entered but by the emperor, attended by the prince who ſtood next in ſucceſſion.</p>

                     <p>HERE the ſons and daughters of Abiſſinia lived only to know the ſoft viciſſitudes of pleaſure and repoſe, attended by all that were ſkilful to delight and gratified with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſenſes can enjoy. They wandered in gardens of fragrance, and ſlept in the fortreſſes
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010939_0013_0F852A7D2B09AF58"/>
of ſecurity. Every art was practiſed to make them pleaſed with their own condition. The ſages who inſtructed them, told them of noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the miſeries of publick life, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all beyond the mountains as regions of calamity, where diſcord was always raging, and where man preyed upon man.</p>
                     <p>To heighten their opinion of their own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they were daily entertained with ſongs, the ſubject of which was the <hi>happy valley.</hi> Their appetites were excited by frequent enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of different enjoyments, and revelry and merriment was the buſineſs of every hour from the dawn of morning to the cloſe of evening.</p>
                     <p>Theſe methods were generally ſucceſsful; few of the princes had ever wiſhed to enlarge their bounds, but paſſed their lives in full conviction that they had all within their reach that art or nature could beſtow, and pitied thoſe whom fate had excluded from this ſeat of tranquillity, as the ſport of chance, and the ſlaves of miſery.</p>
                     <p>Thus they roſe in the morning, and lay down at night, pleaſed with each other and with themſelves, all but Raſſelas, who, in the twenty-ſixth year of his age, began to withdraw himſelf from their paſtimes and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010939_0014_0F852A7D8EBC9D10"/>
aſſemblies, and to delight in ſolitary walks and ſilent meditation. He often ſat before tables covered with luxury, and forgot to taſte the dainties that were placed before him: he roſe abruptly, in the midſt of the ſong and haſtily retired beyond the ſound of muſick. His attendants obſerved the change, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to renew his love of pleaſure: he neglected their endeavours, repulſed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, and ſpent day after day on the banks of rivulets ſheltered with trees, where he ſometimes liſtened to the birds in the branches, ſometimes obſerved the fiſh playing in the ſtream, and anon caſt his eyes upon the paſtures and mountains filled with animals, of which ſome were biting the herbage, and ſome ſleeping among the buſhes.</p>
                     <p>This ſingularity of his humour made him much obſerved. One of the ſages, in whoſe converſation he had formerly delighted, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him ſecretly, in hope of diſcovering the cauſe of his diſquiet. Raſſelas, who knew not that any one was near him, having for ſome time fixed his eyes upon the goats that were brouſing among the rocks, began to compare their condition with his own.</p>
                     <p>"What," ſaid he, "makes the difference between man and all the reſt of the animal creation? Every beaſt that ſtrays beſide me has
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010939_0015_0F852A7E1460FAE0"/>
the ſame corporeal neceſſities with myſelf; he is hungry and crops the graſs, he is thirſty and drinks the ſtream, his thirſt and hunger are appeaſed, he is ſatisfied and ſleeps; he riſes again and is hungry, he is again fed and is at reſt. I am hungry and thirſty like him, but when thirſt and hunger ceaſe I am not at reſt; I am like him pained with want, but am not, like him, ſatisfied with fulneſs.</p>
                     <p>The intermediate hours are tedious and gloomy; I long again to be hungry that I may again quicken my attention. The birds peck the berries or the corn, and fly away to the groves where they ſit in ſeeming happineſs on the branches, and waſte their lives in tuning one unvaried ſeries of ſounds. I likewiſe can call the lutaniſt and the ſinger, but the ſounds that pleaſed me yeſterday weary me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and will grow yet more weariſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. I can diſcover within me no power of perception which is not glutted with its proper pleaſure, yet I do not feel myſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. Man has ſurely ſome latent ſenſe for which this place affords no gratification, or he has ſome deſires diſtinct from ſenſe, which muſt be ſatisfied before he can be happy."</p>
                     <p>After this he lifted up his head, and ſeeing the moon riſing, walked towards the palace. As he paſſed through the fields, and ſaw the animals around him, "Ye, ſaid he, are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010939_0016_0F852A7ED78291E8"/>
and need not envy me that walk thus among you, burthened with myſelf; nor do I, ye gentle beings, envy your felicity; for it is not the felicity of man. I have many diſtreſſes from which ye are free; I fear pain when I do not feel it; I ſometimes ſhrink at evils recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and ſometimes ſtart at evils anticipated: ſurely the equity of providence has ballanced peculiar ſufferings with peculiar enjoyments."</p>
                     <p>With obſervations like theſe the prince amuſed himſelf as he returned, uttering them with a plaintive voice, yet with a look that diſcovered him to feel ſome complacence in his own perſpicacity, and to receive ſome ſolace of the miſeries of life, from conſciouſneſs of the delicacy with which he felt, and the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence with which he bewailed them. He mingled chearfully in the diverſions of the evening, and all rejoiced to find that his heart was lightened.</p>

                     <p>ON the next day his old inſtructor, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that he had now made himſelf acquainted with his diſeaſe of mind, was in hope of curing it by counſel, and officiouſly ſought an opportunity of a conference, which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010939_0017_0F852A7F95067A10"/>
the prince was not very willing to afford, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long conſidered him as one whoſe intellects were exhauſted: "Why, ſaid he, does this man thus intrude upon me; ſhall I be never ſuffered to forget thoſe lectures which pleaſed only while they were new, and to become new again muſt be forgotten;" He then walked into the wood, and compoſed himſelf to his uſual meditations; when before his thoughts had taken any ſettled form, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his purſuer at his ſide, and was at firſt prompted by his impatience to go haſtily away; but, being unwilling to offend a man whom he had once reverenced and ſtill loved, he invited him to ſit down with him on the bank.</p>
                     <p>The old man, thus encouraged, began to lament the change which had been lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the prince, and to enquir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> why he ſo often retired from the pleaſures of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, to lonelineſs and ſilence. "I fly from pleaſure, ſaid the prince becauſe pleaſure has ceaſed to pleaſe; I am lonely becauſe I am miſerable, and am unwilling to cloud with my preſence the happineſs of others. "You, Sir, ſaid the ſage, are the firſt who, has complained of miſery in the <hi>happy valley.</hi> I hope to convince you that your complaints have no real cauſe. You are here in full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all that the emperor of Abiſſinia can
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010939_0018_0F852A805B6EEB30"/>
beſtow; here is neither labour to be endured, nor danger to be dreaded, yet here is all that labour or danger can procure. Look round and tell me which of your wants is without ſupply: if you want nothing, how are you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy?"</p>
                     <p>"That I want nothing, ſaid the prince, or that I know not what I want, is the cauſe of my complaint; if I had any known want, I ſhould have a certain wiſh; that wiſh would excite endeavour, and I ſhould not then repine to ſee the ſun move ſo ſlowly towards the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern mountain, or lament when the day breaks and ſleep will no longer hide me from my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. When I ſee the kids and the lambs chaſing one another, I fancy that I ſhould be happy if I had ſomething to purſue. But, poſſeſſing all that I can want, I find one day and one hour exactly like another, except that the latter is ſtill more tedious than the former. Let your experience inform me how the day may now ſeem as ſhort as in my childhood, while nature was yet freſh, and every moment ſhewed me what I never had obſerved before. I have already enjoyed too much; give me ſomething to deſire."</p>
                     <p>The old man was ſurpriſed at this new ſpecies of affliction, and knew not what to reply, yet was unwilling to be ſilent, "Sir, ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

if you had ſeen the miſeries of the world, you would know how to value your preſent ſtate." "Now ſaid the prince, you have given me ſomething to deſire; I ſhall long to ſee the miſeries of the world, ſince the ſight of them is neceſſary to happineſs."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. The prince continues to grieve and muſe.</head>
                     <p>AT this time the ſound of muſick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the hour of repaſt, and the converſation was concluded. The old man went away ſufficiently diſcontented to find that his reaſonings had produced the only concluſion which they were intended to prevent. But in the decline of life, ſhame and grief are of ſhort duration; whether it be that we bear eaſily what we have borne long, or that, finding our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in age leſs regarded, we leſs regard others; or, that we look with ſlight regard upon afflictions, to which we know that the hand of death is about to put an end.</p>
                     <p>The prince, whoſe views were extended to a wider ſpace, could not ſpeedily quiet his emotions. He had been before terrified at the length of life which nature promiſed him, becauſe he conſidered that in a long time much muſt be endured; he now rejoiced in his youth, becauſe in many years much might be done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010939_0020_0F852A82007F2AB0"/>
This firſt beam of hope, that had been ever darted into his mind, rekindled youth in his cheeks, and doubled the luſtre of his eyes. He was fired with the deſire of doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, tho' he knew not yet with diſtinctneſs, either end or means.</p>
                     <p>He was now no longer gloomy and unſocial; but, conſidering himſelf as maſter of a ſecret ſtock of happineſs, which he could enjoy only by concealing it, he affected to be buſy in all ſchemes of diverſion, and endeavoured to make others pleaſed with the ſtate of which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was weary. But pleaſures never can be ſo multiplied or continued, as not to leave much of life unemployed; there were many hours, both of the night and day, which he could ſpend without ſuſpicion in ſolitary thought. The load of life was much light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened: he went eagerly into the aſſemblies, becauſe he ſuppoſed the frequency of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence neceſſary to the ſucceſs of his purpoſes; he retired gladly to privacy, becauſe he had now a ſubject of thought.</p>
                     <p>His chief amuſement was to picture to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that world which he had never ſeen; to place himſelf in various conditions; to be entangled in imaginary difficulties, and to be engaged in wild adventures: but his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence always terminated his projects in the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010939_0021_0F852A829A574D28"/>
relief of diſtreſs, the detection of fraud, the defeat of oppreſſion, and the diffuſion of happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus paſſed twenty months of the life of Raſſelas. He buſied himſelf ſo intenſely in viſionary buſtle, that he forgot his real ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and, amidſt hourly preparations for the various incidents of human affairs, neglected to conſider by what means he ſhould mingle with mankind.</p>
                     <p>One day as he was ſitting on a bank, he feigned to himſelf an orphan virgin robbed of her little portion by a treacherous lover, and crying after him for reſtitution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. So ſtrongly was the image impreſſed upon his mind, that he ſtarted up in the maid's defence, and ran forwards to ſeize the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer with all the eagerneſs of real purſuit. Fear naturally quickens the flight of guilt. Raſſelas could not catch the fugitive with his utmoſt efforts; but reſolving to weary, by perſeverance, him whom he could not ſurpaſs in ſpeed, he preſſed on till the foot of the mountain ſtopped his courſe.</p>
                     <p>Here he recollected himſelf, and ſmiled at his own uſeleſs impetuoſity. Then raiſing his eyes to the mountain, "This, ſaid he, is the fatal obſtacle that hinders at once the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010939_0022_0F852A8362F65910"/>
enjoyment of pleaſure, and the exerciſe of virtue. How long is it that my hopes and wiſhes have flown beyond this boundary of my life, which yet I never have attempted to ſurmount!"</p>
                     <p>Struck with this reflection he ſat down to muſe, and remembered, that ſince he firſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to eſcape from his confinement, the ſun had paſſed twice over him in his annual courſe. He now felt a degree, of regret with which he had never before been acquainted. He conſidered how much might have been done in the time which had paſſed and left nothing real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it. He compaired twenty months with the life of man. "In life, ſaid he, is not to be counted the ignorance of infancy, or imbecillity of age. We are long before we are able to think, and we ſoon ceaſe from the power of acting. The true period of human exiſtence may be reaſonably eſtimated at forty years, of which I have muſed away the four and twentieth part. What I have loſt was certain, for I have certainly poſſeſſed it; but of twenty months to come who can aſſure me?"</p>
                     <p>The conſciouſneſs of his own folly pierced him deeply, and he was long before he could be reconciled to himſelf. "The reſt of my time, ſaid he, has been loſt by the crime or
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010939_0023_0F852A8413B4E048"/>
folly of my anceſtors, and the abſurd inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my country; I remember it with diſguſt, but without remorſe: but the months that have paſſed ſince new light darted into my ſoul, ſince I formed a ſcheme of reaſonable felicity, have been ſquandered by my own fault. I have loſt that which can never be reſtored. I have ſeen the ſun riſe and ſet for twenty months an idle gazer on the light of heaven: In this time the birds have left the neſt of their mother, and committed themſelves to the woods and to the ſkies: the kid has forſaken the teat, and learned by degrees to climb the rocks in queſt of independant ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. I only have made no advances, but am ſtill helpleſs and ignorant. The moon, by more than twenty changes, admoniſhed me of the flux of life; the ſtream that rolled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my feet upbraided my inactivity.

                     <p>Theſe ſorrowful meditations faſtened upon his mind; he paſt four months in reſolving to loſe no more time in idle reſolves, and was awakened to more vigorous exertion by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a maid, who had broken a porcelain cup, remark, that what cannot be repaired is not to be regretted.</p>

This was obvious; and Raſſelas reproached himſelf that he had not diſcovered it, having not known, or not conſidered, how many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hints are obtained by chance, and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the mind, hurried by her own ardour to diſtant views, neglects the truths that lie open before her. He, for a few hours, regretted his regret, and from that time bent his whole mind upon the means of eſcaping from the valley of happineſs.</p>

                     <p>HE now found that it would be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to effect that which it was very eaſy to ſuppoſe effected. When he looked round about him, he ſaw himſelf confined by the bars of nature which had never yet been broken, and by the gate, through which none that once had paſſed, were ever able to return. He was now impatient as an eagle in a grate. He paſſed week after week in clambering the the mountains, to ſee if there was any aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the buſhes might conceal, but found all the ſummits inacceſſible by their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. The iron gate he deſpaired to open; for it was not only ſecured with all the power of art, but was always watched by ſucceſſive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010939_0025_0F852A859FDF9778"/>
to the perpetual obſervation of all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
                     <p>He then examined the cavern through which the waters of the lake were diſcharged; and looking down at a time when the ſun ſhone ſtrongly upon its mouth, he diſcover'd it to be full of broken rocks, which, though they permitted the ſtream to flow through many narrow paſſages, would ſtop any body of ſolid bulk. He returned diſcouraged and dejected; but, having now known the bleſſing of hope reſolved never to deſpair.</p>
                     <p>In theſe fruitleſs reſearches he ſpent ten months. The time, however, paſſed chearfully away: in the morning he roſe with new hope, in the evening applauded his own diligence, and in the night ſlept ſound after his fatigue. He met a thouſand amuſements which beguiled his labour, and diverſified his thoughts. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the various inſtincts of animals, and properties of plants, and found the place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with wonders, of which he purpoſed to ſolace himſelf with the contemplation, if he ſhould never be able to accompliſh his flight; rejoicing that his endeavours, though yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, had ſupplied him with a ſource of inexhauſtible enquiry.</p>
                     <p>But his original curioſity was not yet abated,

he reſolved to obtain ſome knowledge of the ways of men. His wiſh ſtill continued, but his hope grew leſs. He ceaſed to ſurvey any longer the walls of his priſon, and ſpared to ſearch by new toils for interſtices which he knew could not be found, yet determined to keep his deſign always in view, and lay hold on any expedient that time ſhould offer.</p>

                     <p>AMONG the artiſts that had been allured into the happy valley, to labour for the accomodation and pleaſure of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, was a man, eminent for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the mechanick powers, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived many engines both of uſe and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By a wheel, which the ſtream turned, he forced the water into a tower, whence it was diſtributed to all the apartments of the palace. He erected a pavillion in the garden, around which he kept the air always cool by artificial ſhowers. One of the groves, appropriated to the ladies, was ventilated by fans, to which the rivulet that ran through it, gave a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant motion; and inſtruments of ſoft muſick were placed at proper diſtances, of which ſome played by the impulſe of the wind, and ſome by the power of the ſtream.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:010939_0027_0F852A87187E4F38"/>
This artiſt was ſometimes viſited by Raſſelas, who was pleaſed with every kind of knowledge, imagining that the time would come, when all his accquiſitions ſhould be of uſe to him in the open world. He came one day to amuſe himſelf in his uſual manner, and found the maſter buſy in building a ſailing chariot: he ſaw that the deſign was practicable upon a level ſurface, and with expreſſions of great eſteem ſolicited its completion. The workman was pleaſed to find himſelf ſo much regarded by the prince, and reſolving to gain yet higher honours. "Sir, ſaid he, you have ſeen but a ſmall part of what the mechanick ſciences can perform. I have been long of opinion, that inſtead of the tardy conveyance of ſhips and chariots, man might uſe the ſwifter migration of wings; that the fields of air are open to knowledge, and that only ignorance and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs need crawl upon the ground."</p>
                     <p>This hint rekindled the prince's deſire of paſſing the mountains; and having ſeen what the mechaniſt had already performed, he was willing to fancy that he could do more; yet reſolved to enquire further before he ſuffered hope to afflict him by diſappointment. "I am afraid ſaid he to the artiſt, that your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination prevails over your ſkill, and that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010939_0028_0F852A87D53CC868"/>
you now tell me rather what you wiſh than what you know. Every animal has his element aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him; the birds have the air, and men and beaſts the earth." "So, replied the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſt, fiſhes have the water, in which yet beaſts can ſwim by nature, and men by art. He that can ſwim needs not deſpair to fly: to ſwim is to fly in a groſſer fluid, and to fly is to ſwim in a ſubtiler. We are only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion our power of reſiſtance to the different denſity of the matter through which we are to paſs. You will be neceſſarily upborne by the air, if you can renew any impulſe upon it, faſter than the air can recede from the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure."</p>
                     <p>"But the exerciſe of ſwimming, ſaid the prince, is very laborious, the ſtrongeſt limbs are ſoon wearied; I am afraid the act of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be yet more violent, and wings will be of no great uſe, unleſs we can fly further than we can ſwim."</p>
                     <p>"The labour of riſing from the ground, ſaid the artiſt will be great, as we ſee it in the heavier domeſtick fowls; but, as we mount higher the earth's attraction, and the body's gravity will be gradually diminiſhed, till we ſhall arrive at a region where the man will float in the air without any tendency to fall: no care will then be neceſſary, but to move forwards, which
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010939_0029_0F852A8C5738FA10"/>
the gentleſt impulſe will effect. You, Sir, whoſe curioſity is ſo extenſive, will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with what pleaſure a philoſpher, furniſhed with wings and hovering in the ſky, would ſee the earth, and all its inhabitants rolling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him, and preſenting to him ſucceſſively by its diurnal motion, all the countries within the ſame parallel. How muſt it amuſe the pendent ſpectator to ſee the moving ſcene of land and ocean, cities and deſarts! to ſurvey with equal ſecurity the marts of trade, and the fields of battle, mountains infeſted by barbarians, and fruitful regions gladdened by plenty, and lulled by peace! How eaſily ſhall we then trace the Nile through all his paſſage; paſs over to diſtant regions, and examine the face of nature from one extremity of the earth to the other!"</p>
                     <p>"All this, ſaid the prince, is much to be deſired, but I am afraid that no man will be able to breath in theſe regions of ſpeculation and tranquillity. I have been told that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is difficult upon lofty mountains, yet from theſe precipices, though ſo high as to produce great tenuity of the air, it is very eaſy to fall; and I ſuſpect, that from any height, where life can be ſupported, there may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of too quick deſcent."</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, replied the artiſt, will ever be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010939_0030_0F852A8E02E6E3B0"/>
attempted, if all poſſible objections muſt be firſt overcome. If you will favour my project, I will try the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>light at my own hazard. I have conſidered the ſtructure of all volant animals, and find the folding continuity of the bat's wings moſt eaſily accommodated to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man form. Upon this model I ſhall begin my taſk to morrow, and in a year expect to tower into the air beyond the malice or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of man. But I will work only on this condition, that the art ſhall not be divulged, and that you ſhall not require me to make wings for any but ourſelves."</p>
                     <p>"Why, ſaid Raſſelas, ſhould you envy others ſo great an advantage? All ſkill ought to be exerted for univerſal good; every man has owed much to others, and ought to repay the kindneſs that he has received."</p>
                     <p>"If men were all virtuous, returned the artiſt, I ſhould with great alacrity teach them all to fly. But what would be the ſecurity of the good, if the bad could at pleaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade them from the ſky? againſt an army ſailing through the clouds neither walls, nor mountains, nor ſeas could afford any ſecurity. A flight of northern ſavages might hover in the wind, and light at once with irreſiſtible vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon the capital of a fruitful region that was rolling under them. Even this valley,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010939_0031_0F852A8EB2C183D8"/>
the retreat of princes, the abode of happineſs, might be violated by the ſudden deſcent of ſome of the naked nations, that ſwarm on the coaſt of the ſouthern ſea."</p>
                     <p>The prince promiſed ſecrecy, and waited for the performance, not wholly hopeleſs of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He viſited the work from time to time, obſerved its progreſs, and remarked the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious contrivances to facilitate motion, and unite levity with ſtrength. The artiſt was every day more certain, that he ſhould leave vultures and eagles behind him, and the contagion of his confidence ſeized upon the prince.</p>
                     <p>In a year the wings were finiſhed, and, on a morning appointed, the maker appeared furniſhed for flight on a little promontory: he waved his pinions a while to gather air, then leaped from his ſtand, and in an inſtant dropped into the lake. His wings which were of no uſe in the air, ſuſtained him in the water, and the prince drew him to land, half dead with-terror and vexation.</p>

                     <p>THE prince was not much afflicted by this diſaſter, having ſuffered himſelf to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010939_0032_0F852A8F5980F9F8"/>
hope for a happier event, only becauſe he had no other means of eſcape in view. He ſtill perſiſted in his deſign to leave the happy valley by the firſt opportunity.</p>
                     <p>His imagination was now at a ſtand; he had no proſpect of entering into the world; and notwithſtanding all his endeavours to ſupport himſelf, diſcontent by degrees preyed upon him, and he began again to loſe his thoughts in ſadneſs when the rainy ſeaſon, which in theſe countries in periodical, made it inconvenient to wander in the woods.</p>
                     <p>The rain continued longer and with more violence than had been ever known: the clouds broke on the ſurrounding mountains, and the torrents ſtreamed into the plain on every ſide, till the cavern was too narrow to diſcharge the water. The lake overflowed its banks, and all the level of the valley was covered with the inundation. The eminence on which the palace was built, and ſome other ſpots of riſing ground, were all that the eye could now diſcover. The herds and flocks left the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and both the wild beaſts and the tame retreated to the mountains.</p>
                     <p>This inundation confined all the princes to domeſtick amuſements, and the attention of Raſſelas was particularly ſeized by a poem,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010939_0033_0F852A9554048300"/>
which Imlac recited, upon the various conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of humanity. He commanded the poet to attend him in his apartment, and recite his verſes a ſecond time; then entering into fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar talk, he thought himſelf happy in having found a man who knew the world ſo well, and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

He aſked a thouſand queſtions about things, to which, though common to all other mortals, his confinement from childhood had kept him a ſtranger. The poet pitied his ignorance, and loved his curioſity, and entertained him from day to day with novelty and inſtruction, ſo that the prince regretted the neceſſity of ſleep, and longed till the morning ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>As they were ſitting together, the prince commanded Imlac to relate his hiſtory, and to tell by what accident he was forced, or by what motive induced, to cloſe his life in the happy valley. As he was going to begin his narrative, Raſſelas was called to a concert, and obliged to reſtrain his curioſity till the evening.</p>

                     <p>THE cloſe of the day is, in the regions of the torrid zone, the only ſeaſon of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010939_0034_0F852A956C40D798"/>
diverſion and entertainment, and it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mid-night before the muſick ceaſed, and the princeſſes retired. Raſſelas then called for his companion and required him to begin the ſtory of his life.</p>
                     <p>"Sir, ſaid Imlac, my hiſtory will not be long: the life that is devoted to knowledge paſſes ſilently away, and is very little diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by events. To talk in public, to think in ſolitude, to read and to hear, to enquire, and anſwer inquires, is the buſineſs of a ſcholar. He wanders about the world without pomp or terror, and is neither known nor valued but by men like himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I was born in the kingdom of Goiama, at no great diſtance from the fountain of the Nile. My father was a wealthy merchant, and traded between the inland countries of Africk and the ports of the Red Sea. He was honeſt, frugal, and diligent, but of mean ſentiments, and narrow comprehenſion: he deſired only to be rich, and to conceal his riches, leſt he ſhould be ſpoiled by the governors of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince."</p>
                     <p>"Surely, ſaid the prince, my father muſt be negligent of his charge, if any man in his dominions dares take that which belongs to another. Does he not know that kings are
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010939_0035_0F852A97352F0168"/>
accountable for injuſtice permitted as well as done? If I were emperor not the meaneſt of my ſubjects ſhould be oppreſſed with impunity. My blood boils when I am told that a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant durſt not enjoy his honeſt gains, for fear of loſing by the rapacity of power. Name the governor who robbed the people, that I may declare his crimes to the emperor."</p>
                     <p>"Sir, ſaid Imlac, your ardour is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect of virtue animated by youth: the time will come when you will acquit your father, and perhaps hear with leſs impatience of the governor. Oppreſſion is, in the Abiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinian dominions, neither frequent nor tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but no form of government has been yet diſcovered, by which cruelty can be wholly prevented. Subordination ſuppoſes power on one part and ſubjection on the other; and if power be in the hands of men, it will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be abuſed. The vigilance of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate may do much, but much will ſtill remain undone. He can never know all the crimes that are committed, and can ſeldom puniſh all that he knows."</p>
                     <p>"This, ſaid the prince, I do not underſtand, but I had rather hear thee than diſpute. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy narration."</p>
                     <p>"My father, proceeded Imlac, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010939_0036_0F852A97CF4560C8"/>
intended that I ſhould have no other education, than ſuch as might qualify me for commerce; and diſcovering in me great ſtrength of memory, and quickneſs of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, often declared his hope, that I ſhould be ſome time the richeſt man in Abiſſinia."</p>
                     <p>"Why ſaid the prince, did thy father deſire the increaſe of his wealth, when it was already greater than he durſt diſcover or enjoy? I am unwilling to doubt thy veracity, yet inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies cannot both be true."</p>
                     <p>"Inconſiſtencies, anſwered Imlac, cannot both be right, but, imputed to man, they may both be true. Yet diverſity is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency. My father might expect a time of greater ſecurity. However, ſome deſire is neceſſary to keep life in motion, and he, whoſe real wants are ſupplied, muſt admit thoſe of fancy."</p>
                     <p>"This, ſaid the prince, I can in ſome meaſure conceive. I repent that I interrupted thee."</p>
                     <p>"With this hope, proceeded Imlac, he ſent me to ſchool; but when I had once found the delight of knowledge, and felt the pleaſure of intelligence and the pride of invention, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſilently to deſpiſe riches, and determined
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010939_0037_0F852A987B03DD48"/>
to diſappoint the purpoſe of my father, whoſe groſſneſs of conception raiſed my pity. I was twenty years old before his tenderneſs would expoſe me to the fatigue of travel, in which time I had been inſtructed, by ſucceſſive maſters, in all the literature of my native country. As every hour taught me ſomething new, I lived in a continual courſe of gratifications; but, as I advanced towards manhood, I loſt much of the reverence with which I had been uſed to look on my inſtructors; becauſe, when the leſſon was ended, I did not find them wiſer or better than common men.</p>
                     <p>"At length my father reſolved to initiate me in commerce, and, opening one of his ſubterranean treaſuries, counted out ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pieces of gold. This, young man, ſaid he, is the ſtock with which you muſt nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate. I began with leſs than the fifth part, and you ſee how diligence and parſimony have increaſed it. This is your own to waſte or to improve. If you ſquander it by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or caprice, you muſt wait for my death before you will be rich: if, in four years, you double your ſtock, we will thence forward let ſubordination ceaſe, and live together as friends and partners; for he ſhall always be equal with me, who is equally ſkilled in the art of growing rich.</p>

"We laid our money upon camels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in bales of cheap goods, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ſhore of the Red Sea. When I caſt my eye on the expanſe of waters, my heart bounded like that of a priſoner eſcaped. I felt an unextinguiſhable curioſity kindle in my mind, and reſolved to ſnatch this opportunity of ſeeing the manners of other nations, and of learning ſciences unknown in Abiſſinia.</p>
                     <p>"I remembered that my father had obliged me to the improvment of my ſtock, not by a promiſe which I ought not to violate, but by a penalty which I was at liberty to incur, and therefore determined to gratify my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant deſire, and by drinking at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of knowledge, to quench the thirſt of curioſity.</p>
                     <p>"As I was ſuppoſed to trade without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with my father, it was eaſy for me to become acquainted with the maſter of a ſhip, and procure a paſſage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I then deſcended into the ſhip, and doubted for a while whether all my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pleaſures, would not end like this in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and diſappointment.

My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, for ſome reaſon or other, conjecturing that I was rich, and by my inquiries and admiration, finding that I was ignorant, conſidered me as a novice whom they had a right to cheat, and who was to learn at the uſual expence the art of fraud. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to the theft of ſervants, and exaction of officers, and ſaw me plundered upon falſe pretences, without any advantage to themſelves, but that of rejoicing in the ſuperiority of their own knowledge."</p>
                     <p>"Stop a moment, ſaid the prince, is there ſuch depravity in man, as that he ſhould injure another without benefit to himſelf? I can eaſily conceive that all are pleaſed with ſuperiority: but your ignorance was meerly accidental, which, being neither your crime nor your folly, could afford them no reaſon to applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the knowledge which they had, and which you wanted, they might as effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually have ſhewn by warning you, as betraying you."</p>
                     <p>"Pride, ſaid Imlac, is ſeldom delicate, it will pleaſe itſelf with very mean advantages;

and envy feels not its own happineſs, but when it may be compared with the miſery of others. They were my enemies becauſe they thought me rich, and my oppreſſors, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to find me weak."</p>
                     <p>"Proceed, ſaid the prince: I doubt not of the facts which you relate, but imagine that you impute them to miſtaken motives."</p>
                     <p>"In this company, ſaid Imlac, I arrived at Agra, the capital of Indoſtan, the city in which the great Mogul commonly reſides. I applied myſelf to the language of the country, and in a few months was able to converſe with the learned men; ſome of whom I found moroſe and reſerved, and others eaſy and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; ſome were unwilling to teach another, what they had with difficulty learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſome ſhewed that the end of their ſtudies was to gain the dignity of inſtructing.</p>

The emperor aſked me many queſtions concerning my country and my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; and though I cannot now recollect any thing that he uttered above the power of a common man, he diſmiſſed me, aſtoniſhed at his wiſdom, and enamoured of his gooodneſs.</p>

"My credit was now ſo high, that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants with whom I had travelled, applied to me for recommendations to the ladies of the court. I was ſurpriſed at their confidence of ſolicitation, and gently reproached them with their practices on the road. They heard me with cold indifference, and ſhewed no tokens of ſhame or ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>"They then urged their requeſt with the offer of a bribe; but what I would not do for kindneſs I would not do for money; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them, not becauſe they had injured me, but becauſe I would not enable them to injure others; for I knew they would have made uſe of my credit to cheat thoſe who ſhould buy their wares.</p>
                     <p>"Having reſided at Agra, till there was no more to be learned, I travelled into Perſia, where I ſaw many remains of ancient magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and obſerved many new accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life.

                     <p>WHEREVER I went, I found that Poetry was conſidered as the higheſt learning, and regarded with a veneration ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what approaching to that which man would pay to the Angelick Nature. And it yet fills me with wonder, that, in almoſt all countries, the moſt ancient poets are conſidered as the beſt: whether it be that every other kind of knowledge is an acquiſition gradually attained, and poetry is a gift conferred at once; or that the firſt poetry of every nation ſurpriſed them as a novelty, and retained the credit by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which it received by accident at firſt: or whether the province of poetry is to deſcribe Nature and Paſſion, which are always the ſame, and the firſt writers took poſſeſſion of the moſt ſtriking objects for deſcription, and the moſt probable occurrences for fiction, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to thoſe that followed them, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the ſame events, and new combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the ſame images. Whatever be the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010939_0044_0F852A9DA8CFB548"/>
reaſon, it is commonly obſerved that the early writers are in poſſeſſion of nature, and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of art: that the firſt excel in ſtrength and invention, and the latter in elegance and refinement.</p>
                     <p>"I was deſirous to add my name to this illuſtrious fraternity. I read all the poets of Perſia and Arabia, and was able to repeat by memory the volumes that are ſuſpended in the moſque of Mecca. But I ſoon found that no man was ever great by imitation. My deſire of excellence impelled me to transfer my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to nature and to life. Nature was to be my ſubject, and men to be my auditors: I could never deſcribe what I had not ſeen: I could not hope to move thoſe with delight or terror, whoſe intereſts and opinions I did not underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Being now reſolved to be a poet, I ſaw every thing with a new purpoſe; my ſphere of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſuddenly magnified: no kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was to be overlooked. I ranged moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and deſerts for images and reſemblances, and pictured upon my mind every tree of the foreſt and flower of the valley. I obſerved with equal care the crags of the rock and the pinnacles of the palace. Sometimes I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered along the mazes of the rivulet, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times watched the changes of the ſummer clouds. To a poet nothing can be uſeleſs.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010939_0045_0F852A9E69A13DE8"/>
Whatever is beautiful, and whatever is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, muſt be familiar to his imagination: he muſt be converſant with all that is awfully vaſt, or elegantly little. The plants of the garden, the animals of the wood, the minerals of the earth, and meteors of the ſky, muſt all concur to ſtore his mind with inexhauſtible variety: for every idea is uſeful for the inforcement or deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of moral or religious truth; and he, who knows moſt, will have moſt power of diverſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſcenes and of gratifying his reader with remote alluſions and unexpected inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>"All the appearances of nature I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore careful to ſtudy, and every country which I have ſurveyed has contributed ſomething to my poetical powers."</p>
                     <p>"In ſo wide a ſurvey, ſaid the prince, you muſt ſurely have left much unobſerved. I have lived, till now, within the circuit of theſe mountains, and yet cannot walk abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſight of ſomething which I had never beheld before, or never heeded."</p>
                     <p>"The buſineſs of a poet, ſaid Imlac, is to examine, not the individual, but the ſpecies; to remark general properties and large appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances: he does not number the ſtreaks of the tulip, or deſcribe the different ſhades in the verdure of the foreſt He is to exhibit in his
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010939_0046_0F852A9F1A1F9B58"/>
portraits of nature ſuch prominent and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing features, as recal the original to every mind; and muſt neglect the minuter diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which one may have remarked, and another have neglected, for thoſe characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics which are alike obvious to vigilance and careleſſneſs.</p>
                     <p>"But the knowledge of nature is only half the taſk of a poet; he muſt be acquainted likewiſe with all the modes of life. His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter requires that he eſtimate the happineſs and miſery of every condition; obſerve the power of all the paſſions in all their combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and trace the changes of the human mind as they are modified by various inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and accidental influences of climate or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, from the ſprightlineſs of infancy to the deſpondence of decrepitude. He muſt diveſt himſelf of the prejudices of his age or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; he muſt conſider right and wrong in their abſtracted and invariable ſtate; he muſt diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard preſent laws and opinions, and riſe to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and tranſcendental truths, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the ſame: he muſt therefore content himſelf with the ſlow progreſs of his name; and contemn the applauſe of his own time, and commit his claims to the juſtice of poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He muſt write as the interpreter of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the legiſlature of mankind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider himſelf as preſiding over the thoughts and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010939_0047_0F852A9FF9E745D0"/>
manners of ſucceſſive generations; as a being ſuperior to time and place. His labour is not yet at an end: he muſt know many languages and many ſciences; and, that his ſtile may be worthy of his thoughts, muſt, by inceſſant practice, familiarize to himſelf every delicacy of ſpeech and grace of harmony."</p>

                     <p>IMLAC now felt the enthuſiaſtic fit, and was proceeding to aggrandize his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, when the prince cried out, "Enough! Thou haſt convinced me, that no human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can ever be a poet. Proceed now with thy narration."</p>
                     <p>"To be a poet, ſaid Imlac, is indeed very difficult." "So difficult, returned the prince, that I will at preſent hear no more of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Tell me whither you went when you had ſeen Arabia."</p>
                     <p>"From Arabia, ſaid the poet, I travelled through Syria, and for three years reſided in Paleſtine, where I converſed with great numbers of the northern and weſtern nations of Europe; the nations which are now in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion

of all power and all knowledge; whoſe armies are irreſiſtible, and whoſe fleets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the remoteſt parts of the globe. When I compared theſe men with the natives of our own kingdom, and thoſe that ſurround us, they appeared almoſt another order of beings. In their countries it is difficult to wiſh for any thing that may not be obtained: a thouſand arts, of which we never heard, are continually labouring for their convenience and pleaſure; and whatever their own climate has denied them, is ſupplied by their commerce."</p>
                     <p>"By what means, ſaid the prince, are the Europeans thus powerful? or why, ſince they can ſo eaſily viſit Aſia and Africa for trade or conqueſt, cannot the Aſiaticks and Africans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade their coaſts, plant colonies in their ports, and give laws to their natural princes? The ſame wind that carries them back would bring us thither."</p>
                     <p>"They are more powerful, Sir, than we, anſwered Imlac, becauſe they are wiſer; knowledge will always predominate over ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, as man governs the other animals. But why their knowledge is more than ours, I know not what reaſon can be given, but the un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>chable will of the Supreme Being."</p>
                     <p>"When, ſaid the prince with a ſigh, ſhall
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010939_0049_0F852AA1592AC3A8"/>
I be able to viſit Paleſtine, and mingle with this mighty confluence of nations? Till that happy moment ſhall arrive, let me fill up the time with ſuch repreſentations as thou canſt give me. I am not ignorant of the motive that aſſembles ſuch numbers in that place, and cannot but conſider it as the center of wiſdom and piety, to which the beſt and wiſeſt men of every land muſt be continually reſorting."</p>
                     <p>"There are ſome nations, ſaid Imlac, that ſend few viſitants to Paleſtine; for many numerous and learned ſects in Europe, concur to cenſure pilgrimage as ſuperſtitious, or deride it as ridiculous."</p>
                     <p>"You know, ſaid the prince, how little my life has made me acquainted with diverſity of opinions: it will be too long to hear the arguments on both ſides; you, that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them, tell me the reſult."</p>
                     <p>Pilgrimage, ſaid Imlac, like many other acts of piety, may be reaſonable or ſuperſtitious, according to the principles upon which it is performed. Long journeys in ſearch of truth are not commanded. Truth, ſuch as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the regulation of life, is always found where it is honeſtly ſought. Change of place is no natural cauſe of the increaſe of piety, for
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010939_0050_0F852AA21AF79850"/>
it inevitably produces diſſipation of mind. Yet, ſince men go every day to view the places where great actions have been performed, and return with ſtronger impreſſions of the event, curioſity of the ſame kind may naturally diſpoſe us to view that country whence our religion had its beginning; and I believe no man ſurveys thoſe awful ſcenes without ſome confirmation of holy reſolutions. That the Supreme Being may be more eaſily propitiated in one place than in another, is the dream of idle ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that ſome places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner, is an opinion which hourly experience will juſtify. He who ſuppoſes that his vices may be more ſucceſsfully combated in Paleſtine, will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, find himſelf miſtaken, yet he may go thither without folly: he who thinks they will be more freely pardoned, diſhonours at once his reaſon and religion."</p>
                     <p>"Theſe, ſaid the prince, are European diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions. I will conſider them another time. What have you found to be the effect of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? are thoſe nations happier than we?"</p>

Ignorance is meer privation, by which nothing can be produced: it is a vacuity in which the ſoul ſits motionleſs and torpid for want of attraction; and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing why, we always rejoice when we learn, and grieve when we forget.

                     <p>"From Paleſtine, ſaid Imlac, I paſſed through many regions of Aſia; in the more civilized kingdoms as a trader, and among the Barbarians of the mountains as a pilgrim. At laſt I began to long for my native country, that I might repoſe after my travels, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, in the places where I had ſpent my earlieſt years, and gladden my old companions with the recital of my adventures. Often did I figure to myſelf thoſe, with whom I had ſported away the gay hours of dawning life, ſitting round me in its evening, wondering at my tales, and liſtening to my counſels.</p>
                     <p>"When this thought had taken poſſeſſion of my mind, I conſidered every moment as waſted which did not bring me nearer to Abiſſinia. I haſtened into Egypt, and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my impatience, was detained ten months in the contemplation of its ancient mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and in enquiries after the remains of its ancient learning. I found in Cairo a mixture of all nations; ſome brought thither by the love of knowledge, ſome by the hope of gain, and many by the deſire of living
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010939_0054_0F852AA7F631EE90"/>
after their own manner without obſervation, and of lying hid in the obſcurity of multitudes: for, in a city, populous as Cairo, it is poſſible to obtain at the ſame time the gratifications of ſociety, and the ſecrecy of ſolitude.</p>
                     <p>"From Cairo I travelled to Suez and embarked on the red ſea paſſing along the coaſt till I arrived at the port from which I had departed twenty years before. Here I joined myſelf to a caravan and re-entered my native country.</p>
                     <p>"I now expected the careſſes of my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the congratulations of my friends, and was not without hope that my father, whatever value he had ſet upon riches, would own with gladneſs and pride, a ſon who was able to add to the felicity and honour of the nation. But I was ſoon convinced that my thoughts were vain. My father had been dead fourteen years, having divided his wealth among my brothers, who were removed to ſome other provinces. Of my companions the greater part was in the grave, of the reſt ſome could with difficulty remember me, and ſome conſidered me as one corrupted by foreign manners.</p>
                     <p>"A man uſed to viciſſitudes is not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. I forgot, after a time, my diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

and endeavoured to recommend myſelf to the nobles of the kingdom: they admitted me to their tables, heard my ſtory, and diſmiſſed me. I opened a ſchool, and was prohibited to teach. I then reſolved to ſit down in the quiet of domeſtick life and addreſſed a lady that was fond of my converſation, but rejected my ſuit, becauſe my father was a merchant.</p>
                     <p>"Wearied at laſt with ſolicitation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, I reſolved to hide my ſelf for ever from the world, and depend no longer on the opinion or caprice of others. I waited for the time when the gate of the <hi>happy valley</hi> ſhould open, that I might bid farewell to hope and fear: the day came; my performance was diſtinguiſhed with favour, and I reſigned myſelf with joy to perpetual confinement."</p>

All the Inhabitants of this valley celebrate their lot, and, at the annual viſit of the emperor, invite others to partake of their felicity."</p>
                     <p>"Great prince, ſaid Imlac, I ſhall ſpeak the truth: I know not one of all your attendants who does not lament the hour when he entered this retreat. I am leſs unhappy than the reſt, becauſe I have a mind replete with Images,

which I can vary and combine at pleaſure.

                     <p>"From this crime, however, I am wholly free. No man can ſay that he is wretched by my perſuaſion.

                     <p>"My dear Imlac, ſaid the prince, I will open to thee my whole heart, that I have long meditated an eſcape from the happy valley. I have examined the mountains on every ſide, but find myſelf inſuperably barred: teach me the way to break my priſon; thou ſhalt be the companion of my flight, the guide of my ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the partner of my fortune, and my ſole director in the <hi>choice of life.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"Sir, anſwered the poet, your eſcape will be difficult, and perhaps, you may ſoon repent your curioſity. The world, which you figure to yourſelf ſmooth and quiet as the lake in the valley, you will find a ſea foaming with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, and boiling with whirlpools: you will be ſometimes overwhelmed by the waves of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſometimes daſhed againſt the rocks of treachery.

                     <p>THE prince now diſmiſſed his favourite to reſt, but the narrative of wonders and novelties filled his mind with perturbation. He revolved all that he had heard, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared innumerable queſtions for the morning.</p>
                     <p>Much of his uneaſineſs was now removed. He had a friend to whom he could impart his
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010939_0059_0F852AB17A988CA0"/>
thoughts, and whoſe experience could aſſiſt him in his deſigns. His heart was no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſwell with ſilent vexation. He thought that even the <hi>happy valley</hi> might be endured with ſuch a companion, and that, if they could range the world together, he ſhould have nothing further to deſire.</p>
                     <p>In a few days the water was diſcharged, and the ground dried. The prince and Imlac then walked out together to converſe without the notice of the reſt. The prince, whoſe thoughts were always on the wing, as he paſſed by the gate, ſaid, with a countenance of ſorrow, "Why art thou ſo ſtrong, and why is man ſo weak;"</p>
                     <p>"Man is not weak, anſwered his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; knowledge is more than equivalent to force. The maſter of mechanicks laughs at ſtrength. I can burſt the gate, but cannot do it ſecretly. ſome other expedient muſt be tried."</p>
                     <p>As they were walking on the ſide of the mountain, they obſerved that the conies, which the rain had driven from their burrows, had taken ſhelter among the buſhes, and formed holes behind them, tending upwards in an oblique line. "It has been the opinion of antiquity, ſaid Imlac, that human reaſon bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed

many arts from the inſtinct of animals; let us, therefore, not think ourſelves degraded by learning from the coney. We may eſcape by piercing the mountain in the ſame direction. We will begin where the ſummit hangs over the middle part, and labour upward till we ſhall iſſue out beyond the prominence."</p>
                     <p>The eyes of the prince, when he heard this propoſal, ſparkled with joy. The execution was eaſy, and the ſucceſs certain.</p>
                     <p>No time was now loſt. They haſtened early in the morning to chuſe a place proper for their mine. They clambered with great fatigue among crags and brambles, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without having diſcovered any part that favoured their deſign. The ſecond and the third day were ſpent in the ſame manner, and with the ſame fruſtration. But, on the fourth, they found a ſmall cavern, concealed by a thicket, where they reſolved to make their experiment.</p>
                     <p>Imlac, procured inſtruments proper to hew ſtone and remove earth, and they fell to their work on the next day with more eagerneſs than vigour.

                     <p>They returned to their labour day after day, and, in a ſhort time found a fiſſure in the rock, which enabled them to paſs far with very little obſtruction. This Raſſelas conſidered as a good omen. "Do not diſturb your mind, ſaid Imlac, with other hopes or fears than reaſon may ſuggeſt; if you are pleaſed with prognoſticks of good, you will be terrified likewiſe with tokens of evil, and your whole life will be a prey to ſuperſtition.

                     <p>THEY had now wrought their way to the middle, and ſolaced their labour with the approach of liberty, when the prince coming down to refreſh himſelf with air, found his ſiſter Nekayah ſtanding before the mouth of the cavity. He ſtarted and ſtood confuſed, afraid to tell his deſign, and yet hopeleſs to conceal it. A few moments determined him to repoſe on her fidelity, and ſecure her ſecrecy by a declaration without reſerve.</p>
                     <p>"Do not imagine, ſaid the princeſs, that I came hither as a ſpy: I had often obſerved from my window that you and Imlac directed your walk every day towards the ſame point, but I did not ſuppoſe that you had any better reaſon for the preference than a cooler ſhade, or more fragrant bank; nor followed you with any other deſign than to partake of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Since then not ſuſpicion but fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has detected you, let me not loſe the advantage of my diſcovery. I am equally weary of confinement with yourſelf, and not leſs deſirous of knowing what is done or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the world. Permit me to fly with you from this taſteleſs tranquillity, which will yet grow more loathſome when you have left me.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010939_0063_0F852AB4F373F388"/>
You may deny me to accompany you, but cannot hinder me from following."</p>
                     <p>The prince, who loved Nekayah above his other ſiſters, had no inclination to refuſe her requeſt, and grieved that he had loſt an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhewing his confidence by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary communication. It was therefore agreed that ſhe ſhould leave the valley with them; and that, in the mean time, ſhe ſhould watch, leaſt any other ſtraggler ſhould, by chance or curioſity, follow them to the mountain.</p>
                     <p>At length their labour was at an end; they ſaw light beyond the prominence, and, iſſuing to the top of the mountain, beheld the Nile, yet a narrow current, wandering beneath them.</p>
                     <p>The prince looked round with rapture, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated all the pleaſures of travel, and in thought was already tranſported beyond his fathers dominions. Imlac, though very joyful at his eſcape, had leſs expectation of pleaſure in the world, which he had before tried, and of which he had been weary.</p>
                     <p>Raſſelas was ſo much delighted with a wider horizon, that he could not ſoon be perſuaded to return into the valley. He informed his ſiſter that the way was open, and that nothing now remained but to prepare for their departure.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV The prince and princeſs leave the valley, and ſee many wonders.</head>
                     <p>THE prince and princeſs had jewels ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make them rich whenever they came into a place of commerce, which, by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac's direction, they hid in their cloaths, and, on the night of the next full moon, all left the valley. The princeſs was followed only by a ſingle favourite, who did not know whither ſhe was going.</p>
                     <p>They clambered through the cavity, and began to go down on the other ſide. The princeſs and her maid turned their eyes towards every part, and, ſeeing nothing to bound their proſpect, conſidered themſelves as in danger of being loſt in a dreary vacuity. They ſtopped and trembled. "I am almoſt afraid, ſaid the princeſs, to begin a journey of which I cannot perceive an end, and to venture into this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe plain where I may be approached on every ſide by men whom I never ſaw." The prince felt nearly the ſame motions, though he thought it more manly to conceal them.</p>
                     <p>Imlac ſmiled at their terrors, and encouraged them to proceed; but the princeſs continued
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010939_0065_0F852AB658D08618"/>
irreſolute, till ſhe had been imperceptibly drawn forward too far to return.</p>
                     <p>In the morning they found ſome ſhepherds in the field, who ſet milk and fruits before them. The princeſs wondered that ſhe did not ſee a palace ready for her reception, and a table ſpread with delicacies; but, being faint and hungry, ſhe drank the milk and eat the fruits, and thought them of a higher flavour than the products of the valley.</p>
                     <p>They travelled forward by eaſy journeys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all unaccuſtomed to toil or difficulty, and knowing, that though they might be miſſed, they could not be purſued. In a few days they came into a more populous region, where Imlac was diverted with the admiration which his companions expreſſed at the diverſity of manners, ſtations; and employments.</p>
                     <p>Their dreſs was ſuch as might not bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the ſuſpicion of having any thing to conceal, yet the prince, wherever he came, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be obeyed, and the princeſs was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe thoſe that came into her preſence did not proſtrate themſelves before her. Imlac was forced to obſerve them with great vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, leſt they ſhould betray their rank by their unuſual behaviour, and detained them ſeveral weeks in the firſt village to accuſtom them to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

By degrees the royal wanderers were taught to underſtand that they had for a time laid aſide their dignity, and were to expect only ſuch regard as liberality and courteſy could procure. And Imlac, having, by many admonitions, prepared them to endure the tumults of a port, and the ruggedneſs of the commercial race, brought them down to the ſea-coaſt.</p>
                     <p>The prince and his ſiſter, to whom every thing was new, were gratified equally at all places, and therefore remained for ſome months at the port without any inclination to paſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Imlac was content with their ſtay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not think it ſafe to expoſe them, unpractiſed in the world, to the hazards of a foreign country.</p>
                     <p>At laſt he began to fear leſt they ſhould be diſcovered, and propoſed to fix a day of their departure. They had no pretenſions to judge for themſelves, and referred the whole ſcheme to his direction. He therefore took paſſage in a ſhip to Suez; and, when the time came, with great difficulty prevailed on the princeſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the veſſel. They had a quick and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voyage, and from Suez travelled by land to Cairo.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVI. They enter Cairo, and find every man happy.</head>
                     <p>AS they approached the city, which filled the ſtrangers with aſtoniſhment, "This, ſaid Imlac to the prince, is the place where travellers and merchants aſſemble from all the corners of the earth. You will here find men of every character, and every occupation. Commerce is here honourable: I will act as a merchant, and you ſhall live as ſtrangers, who have no other end of travel than curioſity; it will ſoon be obſerved that we are rich; our reputation will procure us acceſs to all whom we ſhall deſire to know; you will ſee all the conditions of humanity, and enable yourſelf at leiſure to make your <hi>choice of life.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>They now entered the town, ſtunned by the noiſe, and offended by the crowds. Inſtruction had not yet ſo prevailed over habit, but that they wondered to ſee themſelves paſs undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed along the ſtreet, and met by the loweſt of the people without reverence or notice. The princeſs could not at firſt bear the thought of being levelled with the vulgar, and, for ſome days, continued in her chamber, where ſhe was ſerved by her favourite as in the palace of the valley.</p>

Imlac, who underſtood traffick, ſold part of the jewels the next day, and hire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a houſe, which he adorned with ſuch magnificence, that he was immediately conſider'd as a merchant of great wealth. His politeneſs attracted many acquaintance, and his generoſity made him courted by many dependants. His table was crowded by men of every nation, who all admired his knowledge and ſolicited his favour. His companions, not being able to mix in the converſation, could make no diſcovery of their ignorance or ſurpriſe, and were gradually initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the world, as they gained knowledge of the language.</p>
                     <p>The prince had, by frequent lectures, been taught the uſe and nature of money; but the ladies could not, for a long time comprehend what the merchants did with ſmall pieces of gold and ſilver, or why things of ſo little uſe ſhould be received as equivalent to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life.</p>
                     <p>They ſtudied the language two years, while Imlac was preparing to ſet before them the various ranks and conditions of mankind. He grew acquainted with all who had any thing uncommon in their fortune or conduct. He frequented the voluptuous and the frugal, the idle and the buſy, the merchants and the men of learning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:010939_0069_0F852AB976C40500"/>
The prince, being now able to converſe with fluency, and having learned the caution neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be obſerved in his intercourſe with ſtrangers, began to accompany Imlac to places of reſort, and to enter into all aſſemblies, that he might make his <hi>choice of life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſome time he thought choice needleſs, becauſe all appeared to him equally happy. Wherever he went he met gaiety and kindneſs, and heard the ſong of joy, or the laugh of careleſſneſs. He began to believe that the world overflowed with univerſal plenty, and that nothing was with-held either from want or merit; that every hand ſhowered liberality, and every heart melted with benevolence: "And who then, ſays he, will be ſuffered to be wretched?"</p>
                     <p>Imlac permitted the pleaſing deluſion, and was unwilling to cruſh the hope of inexperience, till one day, having ſat a while ſilent, "I know not, ſaid the prince, what can be the reaſon that I am more unhappy than any of our friends. I ſee them perpetually and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly chearful, but feel my own mind reſtleſs and uneaſy. I am unſatisfied with thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which I ſeem moſt to court; I live in the crowds of jollity, not ſo much to enjoy company as to ſhun myſelf; and am only loud and merry to conceal my ſadneſs."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:010939_0070_0F852ABA155F5428"/>
"Every man, ſaid Imlac, may, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining his own mind, gueſs what paſſes in the minds of others: when you feel that your own gaiety is counterfeit, it may juſtly lead you to ſuſpect that of your companions not to be ſincere. Envy is commonly reciprocal. We are long before we are convinced that happineſs is never to be found, and each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it poſſeſſed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himſelf. In the aſſembly, where you paſſed the laſt night, there appeared ſuch ſprightlineſs of air, and volatility of fancy, as might have ſuited beings of an higher order, formed to inhabit ſerener regions inacceſſible to care or ſorrow: yet, believe me, prince, there was not one who did not dread the moment when ſolitude ſhould deliver him to the tyranny of reflection."</p>
                     <p>"This ſaid the prince, may be true of others ſince it is true of me; yet, whatever be the general infelicity of man, one condition is more happy than another, and wiſdom ſurely directs us to take the leaſt evil in the <hi>choice of life.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"The cauſes of good and evil, anſwered Imlac, are ſo various and uncertain, ſo often entangled with each other, ſo diverſified by various relations, and ſo much ſubject to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which cannot be foreſeen, that he who
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010939_0071_0F852ABADFB96238"/>
would ſix his condition upon inconteſtable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of preference, muſt live and die enquiring and deliberating."</p>
                     <p>"But ſurely, ſaid Raſſelas, the wiſe men, to whom we liſten with reverence and wonder, choſe that mode of life for themſelves which they thought moſt likely to make them happy."</p>
                     <p>"Very few, ſaid the poet, live by choice. Every man is placed in his preſent condition by cauſes which acted without his foreſight, and with which he did not always willingly co-operate; and therefore you will rarely meet one who does not think the lot of his neighbour better than his own."</p>
                     <p>"I am pleaſed to think, ſaid the prince, that my birth has given me at leaſt one advantage over others, by enabling me to determine for my ſelf. I have here the world before me; I will review it at leaſure: ſurely happineſs is ſomewhere to be found."</p>

"Youth, cried he, is the time of gladneſs: I will join myſelf to the young men, whoſe only buſineſs is to gratify their deſires, and whoſe time is all ſpent in a ſucceſſion of enjoyments."</p>
                     <p>To ſuch ſocieties he was readily admitted, but a few days brought him back weary and diſguſted. Their mirth was without images, their laughter without motive; their pleaſures were groſs and ſenſual, in which the mind had no part; their conduct was at once wild and mean; they laughed at order and at law, but the frown of power dejected, and the eye of wiſdom abaſhed them.</p>
                     <p>The prince ſoon concluded, that he ſhould never be happy in a courſe of life of which he was aſhamed. He thought it unſuitable to a reaſonable being to act without a plan, and to be ſad or chearful only by chance. "Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaid he, muſt be ſomething ſolid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, without fear and without uncertainty."</p>

But his young companions had gained ſo much of his regard by their frankneſs and courteſy, that he could not leave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warning and remonſtrance. "My friends, ſaid he, I have ſeriouſly conſidered our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and our proſpects, and find that we have miſtaken our own intereſt.

Let us conſider that youth is of no long duration, and that in maturer age, when the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fancy ſhall ceaſe, and phantoms of delight dance no more about us, we ſhall have no comforts but the eſteem of wiſe men, and the means of doing good. Let us, therefore, ſtop, while to ſtop is in our power: let us live as men who are ſome time to grow old, and to whom it will be the moſt dreadful of all evils not to count their paſt years but by their follies, and to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only by the maladies which riot has produced."</p>

                     <p>AS he was one day walking in the ſtreet, he ſaw a ſpacious building, which all were, by the open doors, invited to enter: he followed the ſtream of people, and found it a hall or ſchool of declamation; in which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors read lectures to their auditory. He fixed his eye upon a ſage raiſed above the reſt, who diſcourſed with great energy on the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the paſſions. His look was venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his action graceful, his pronunciation clear, and his diction elegant. He ſhewed, with great ſtrength of ſentiment, and variety of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration, that human nature is degraded and debaſed, when the lower faculties predominate over the higher; that when fancy, the parent of paſſion, uſurps the dominion of the mind, nothing enſues but the natural effect of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful government, perturbation and confuſion; that ſhe betrays the fortreſſes of the intellect to rebels, and excites her children to ſedition againſt reaſon, their lawful ſovereign. He compared reaſon to the ſun, of which the light
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010939_0075_0F852ABDEC406650"/>
is conſtant, uniform and laſting; and fancy to a meteor, of bright but tranſitory luſtre, irregular in its motion, and deluſive in its direction.</p>
                     <p>He then communicated the various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts given from time to time for the conqueſt of paſſion, and diſplayed the happineſs of thoſe who had obtained the important victory, after which man is no longer the ſlave of fear, nor fool of hope; is no more emaciated by envy, inflamed by anger, emaſculated by tenderneſs, or depreſſed by grief; but walks on calmly through the tumults or the privacies of life, as the ſun purſues alike his courſe through the calm or the ſtormy ſky.</p>
                     <p>He enumerated many examples of heroes in moveable by pain or pleaſure, who looked with indifference on thoſe modes or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to which the vulgar give the names of good and evil. He exhorted his hearers to lay aſide their prejudices, and arm themſelves againſt the ſhafts of malice or misfortune, by invulnerable patience; concluding, that this ſtate only was happineſs, and that this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was in every one's power.</p>
                     <p>Raſſelas liſtened to him with the veneration due to the inſtructions of a ſuperior being, and waiting for him at the door, humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010939_0076_0F852ABEAF4286A8"/>
the liberty of viſiting ſo great a maſter of true wiſdom. The lecturer heſitated a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Raſſelas put a purſe of gold into his hand, which he received with a mixture of joy and wonder.</p>
                     <p>"I have found, ſaid the prince, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Imlac, a man who can teach all that is neceſſary to be known, who, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken throne of rational fortitude, looks down on the ſcenes of life changing beneath him. He ſpeaks, and attention watches his lips. He reaſons, and conviction cloſes his periods. This man ſhall be my future guide: I will learn his doctrines, and imitate his life."</p>
                     <p>"Be not too haſty, ſaid Imlac, to truſt, or to admire, the teachers of morality: they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe like angels, but they live like men."</p>
                     <p>Raſſelas, who could not conceive how any man could reaſon ſo forcibly without feeling the cogency of his own arguments, paid his viſit in a few days, and was denied admiſſion. He had now learned the power of money, and made his way by a piece of gold to the inner apartment, where he found the philoſopher in a room half darkned, with his eyes miſty, and his face pale. "Sir, ſaid he, you are come at a time when all human friendſhip is uſeleſs; what I ſuffer cannot be remedied, what I have
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010939_0077_0F852ABF55EFB130"/>
loſt cannot be ſupplied. My daughter, my only daughter, from whoſe tenderneſs I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected all the comforts of my age, died laſt night of a fever. My views, my purpoſes, my hopes are at an end: I am now a lonely being diſunited from ſociety."</p>
                     <p>Sir, ſaid the prince, mortality is an event by which a wiſe man can never be ſurpriſed: we know that death is always near, and it ſhould therefore always be expected. "Young man, anſwered the philoſopher, you ſpeak like one that has never felt the pangs of ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on." "Have you then forgot the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſaid Raſſelas, which you ſo powerfully enforced? Has wiſdom no ſtrength to arm the heart againſt calamity? Conſider, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things are naturally variable, but truth and reaſon are always the ſame." "What comfort ſaid the mourner, can truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon afford me? of what effect are they now, but to tell me, that my daughter will not be reſtored?"</p>
                     <p>The prince, whoſe humanity would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to inſult miſery with reproof, went away convinced of the emptineſs of rhetorical ſound, and the inefficacy of poliſhed periods and ſtudied ſentences.</p>

                     <p>HE was ſtill eager upon the ſame enquiry; and, having heard of a hermit, that lived near the loweſt cataract of the Nile, and filled the whole country with the fame of his ſanctity, reſolved to viſit his retreat, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether that felicity, which publick life could not afford, was to be found in ſolitude; and whether a man, whoſe age and virtue made him venerable, could teach any peculiar art of ſhunning evils, or enduring them.</p>
                     <p>Imlac and the princeſs agreed to accompany him, and, after the neceſſary preparations, they began their journey. Their way lay through fields where ſhepherds tended their flocks, and the lambs were playing upon the paſture." "This ſaid the poet, is the life which has been often celebrated for its innocence and quiet: let us paſs the heat of the day among the ſhepherds tents, and know whether all our ſearches are not to terminate in paſtoral ſimplicity."</p>
                     <p>The propoſal pleaſed them, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſhepherds, by ſmall preſents and familiar queſtions, to tell their opinion of their
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010939_0079_0F852AC11C7D22F8"/>
own ſtate: they were ſo rude and ignorant, ſo little able to compare the good with the evil of the occupation, and ſo indiſtinct in their narratives and deſcriptions, that very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle could be learned from them. But it was evident that their hearts were cankered with diſcontent; that they conſidered themſelves as condemned to labour for the luxury of the rich, and looked up with ſtupid malevolence toward thoſe that were placed above them.</p>
                     <p>The princeſs pronounced with vehemence, that ſhe would never ſuffer theſe envious ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages to be her companions, and that ſhe ſhould not ſoon be deſirous of ſeeing any more ſpecimens of ruſtick happineſs; but could not believe that all the accounts of primeval plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were fabulous, and was yet in doubt whether life had any thing in it that could be juſtly preferred to the placid gratifications of fields and woods. She hoped that the time would come, when, with a few virtuous and elegant companions, ſhe ſhould gather flowers planted by her own hand, fondle the lambs of her own ewes, and liſten, without care, among brooks and breezes, to one of her maidens reading in the ſhade.</p>

                     <p>ON the next day they continued their journey, till the heat compelled them to look round for ſhelter. At a ſmall diſtance they ſaw a thick wood, which they no ſooner entered than they perceived that they were approaching the habitations of men. The ſhrubs were diligently cut away to open walks where the ſhades were darkeſt; the boughs of oppoſite trees were artificially interwoven; ſeats of flowery turf were raiſed in vacant ſpaces, and a rivulet, that wantoned along the ſide of a winding path, had its banks ſometimes opened into ſmall baſons, and its ſtream ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſtructed by little mounds of ſtone heaped together to increaſe its murmurs.</p>
                     <p>They paſſed ſlowly through the wood, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with ſuch unexpected accommodations, and entertained each other with conjecturing what, or who, he could be, that, in thoſe rude and unfrequented regions, had leiſure and art for ſuch harmleſs luxury.</p>
                     <p>As they advanced, they heard the ſound of muſick, and ſaw youths and virgins dancing in the grove; and, going ſtill further, beheld
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010939_0081_0F852AC25C3AC2C8"/>
a ſtately palace built upon a hill ſurrounded with woods. The laws of eaſtern hoſpitality allowed them to enter, and the maſter wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed them like a man liberal and wealthy.</p>
                     <p>He was ſkilful enough in appearances ſoon to diſcern that they were no common gueſts, and ſpread his table with magnificence. The eloquence of Imlac caught his attention, and the lofty courteſy of the princeſs excited his reſpect. When they offered to depart, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated their ſtay, and was the next day ſtill more unwilling to diſmiſs them than before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were eaſily perſuaded to ſtop, and civility grew up in time to freedom and confidence.</p>
                     <p>The prince now ſaw all the domeſticks chearful, and all the face of nature ſmiling round the place, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> could not forbear to hope that he ſhould find here what he was ſeeking; but when he was congratulating the maſter upon his poſſeſſions, he anſwered with a ſigh, "My condition has indeed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of happineſs, but appearances are deluſive. My proſperity puts my life in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the Baſſa of Egypt is my enemy, incenſed only by my wealth and popularity.

                     <p>They all joined in lamenting his danger, and deprecating his exile; and the princeſs was ſo much diſturbed with the tumult of grief and indignation, that ſhe retired to her apartment. They continued with their kind inviter a few days longer, and then went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to find the hermit.</p>

                     <p>THEY came on the third day, by the direction of the peaſants, to the hermit's cell: it was a cavern in the ſide of a mountain, over-ſhadow'd with palm-trees; at ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the cataract, that nothing more was heard than a gentle uniform murmur, ſuch as compoſed the mind to penſive meditation, eſpecially when it was aſſiſted by the wind whiſtling among the branches.

                     <p>The hermit ſat on a bench at the door, to enjoy the coolneſs of the evening. On one ſide lay a book with pens and papers, on the other mechanical inſtruments of various kinds. As they approached him unregarded, the princeſs obſerved that he had not the countenance of a man that had found, or could teach, the way to happineſs.</p>
                     <p>They ſaluted him with great reſpect, which he repaid like a man not unaccuſtomed to the forms of courts. "My children ſaid he, if you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They thanked him and entering, were pleaſed with the neatneſs and regularity of the place. The hermit ſet fleſh and wine before them, though he fed only upon fruits and water. His diſcourſe was chearful without levity, and pious without enthuſiaſm. He ſoon gained the eſteem of his gueſts and the princeſs repented of her haſty cenſure.</p>

At laſt Imlac began thus: "I do not now wonder that your reputation is ſo far extended; we have heard at Cairo of your wiſdom, and came hither to implore your direction for this young man and maiden in the <hi>choice of life.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"To him that lives well, anſwered the hermit, every form of life is good; nor can I give any other rule for choice, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from all apparent evil."</p>
                     <p>"He will remove moſt certainly from evil, ſaid the prince, who ſhall devote himſelf to that ſolitude which you have recommended by your example."</p>
                     <p>"I have indeed lived fifteen years in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſaid the hermit but have no deſire that my example ſhould gain any imitators. In my youth I profeſſed arms, and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

I had once eſcaped from the purſuit of the enemy by the ſhelter of this cavern, and therefore choſe it for my final

reſidence. I employed artificers to form it into chambers, and ſtored it with all that I was likely to want."</p>
                     <p>"For ſome time after my retreat, I rejoiced like a tempeſt-beaten ſailor at his entrance into the harbour, being delighted with the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change of the noiſe, and hurry of war, to ſtillneſs and repoſe. When the pleaſure of novelty went away, I employed my hours in examining the plants which grow in the valley, and the minerals which I collected from the rocks. But that enquiry is now grown taſteleſs and irkſome. I have been for ſome time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled and diſtracted: my mind is diſturbed with a thouſand perplexities of doubt, and vanities of imagination, which hourly prevail upon me, becauſe I have no opportunities of relaxation or diverſion. I am ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to think that I could not ſecure myſelf from vice, but by retiring from the practice of virtue, and begin to ſuſpect that I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impelled by reſentment, than led by devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into ſolitude. My fancy riots in ſcenes of folly, and I lament that I have loſt ſo much, and have gained ſo little.

ſo laudably followed. The ſentiments of the hearers were various. Some were of opinion, that the folly of his choice had been juſtly puniſhed by condemnation to perpetual perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. One of the youngeſt among them, with great vehemence, pronounced him an hypocrite. Some talked of the right of ſociety to the labour of individuals, and conſidered retirement as a deſertion of duty. Others readily allowed, that there was a time when the claims of the publick were ſatisfied, and when a man might properly ſequeſter himſelf, to review his life, and purify his heart.</p>
                     <p>One, who appeared more affected with the narrative than the reſt, thought it likely, that the hermit would, in a few years, go back to his retreat, and, perhaps, if ſhame did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, or death intercept him, return once more from his retreat into the world: "For the hope of happineſs, ſays he, is ſo ſtrongly impreſſed, that the longeſt experience is not able to efface it. Of the preſent ſtate, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, we feel, and are forced to confeſs, the miſery, yet, when the ſame ſtate is again at a diſtance, imagination paints it as deſirable. But the time will ſurely come, when deſire will be no longer our torment, and no man ſhall be wretched but by his own fault."</p>
                     <p>"This, ſaid a philoſopher, who had heard
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010939_0088_0F852AC7961601C8"/>
him with tokens of great impatience, is the preſent condition of a wiſe man. The time is already come, when none are wretched but by their own fault. Nothing is more idle, than to enquire after happineſs, which nature, has kindly placed within our reach. The way to be happy is to live according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in obedience to that univerſal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable law with which every heart is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally impreſſed; which is not written on it by precept, but engraven by deſtiny, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled by education, but infuſed at our nativity. He that lives according to nature, will ſuffer nothing from the deluſions of hope, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of deſire: He will receive and reject with equability of temper; and act or ſuffer as the reaſon of things ſhall alternately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.

When he had ſpoken, he looked round him with a placid air, and enjoyed the conſciouſneſs of his own beneficence. "Sir, ſaid the prince, with great modeſty, as I, like all the reſt of mankind, am deſirous of felicity, my cloſeſt attention has been fixed upon your diſcourſe: I doubt not the truth of a poſition which a man ſo learned has ſo confidently advanced. Let me only know what it is to live according to nature."</p>
                     <p>"When I find young men ſo humble and ſo docile, ſaid the philoſopher, I can deny them no information which my ſtudies have enabled me to afford. To live according to nature, is to act always with due regard to the fitneſs ariſing from the relations and qualities of cauſes and effects; to concur with the great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable ſcheme of univerſal felicity; to co-operate with the general diſpoſition and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the preſent ſyſtem of things."</p>

                     <p>RASSELAS returned home full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, doubtful how to direct his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſteps. Of the way to happineſs he found the learned and ſimple equally ignorant; but, as he was yet young, he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he had time remaining for more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, and further enquiries. He commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Imlac his obſervations and his doubts, but was anſwered by him with new doubts, and remarks that gave him no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. He therefore diſcourſed more frequently and freely with his ſiſter, who had yet the ſame hope with himſelf, and always aſſiſted him to give ſome reaſon why, though he had been hitherto fruſtrated, he might ſucceed at laſt.</p>
                     <p>"We have hitherto, ſaid ſhe, known but little of the world: we have never yet been either great or mean. In our own country, though we had royalty, we had no power, and in this we have not ſeen the private receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of domeſtick peace. Imlac favours not our ſearch, leſt we ſhould in time find him miſtaken. We will divide the taſk between us: you ſhall try what is to be found in the ſplendor of courts, and I will range the ſhades of humbler life. Perhaps command and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may be the ſupreme bleſſings, as they

                     <p>RASSELAS applauded the deſign, and appeared next day with a ſplendid retinue at the court of the Baſſa. He was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for his magnificence, and admitted, as a prince whoſe curioſity had brought him from diſtant countries, to an intimacy with the great officers, and frequent converſation with the Baſſa himſelf.</p>
                     <p>He was firſt inclined to believe, that the man muſt be pleaſed with his own condition, whom all approached with reverence, and heard with obedience, and who had the power to extend his edicts to a whole kingdom. "There can be no pleaſure, ſaid he, equal to that of feeling at once the joy of thouſands all made happy by wiſe adminiſtration, Yet, ſince, by the law of ſubordination, this ſublime delight can be in one nation but the lot of one, it is ſurely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think there is ſome ſatisfaction more popular and acceſſible, and that millions can hardly be ſubjected to the will of a ſingle man,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010939_0092_0F852ACCF4CA6398"/>
only to fill his particular breaſt with incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable content."</p>
                     <p>Theſe thoughts were often in his mind, and he found no ſolution of the difficulty. But as preſents and civilities gained him more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, he found that almoſt every man that ſtood high in employment hated all the reſt, and was hated by them, and that their lives were a continual ſucceſſion of plots and detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtratagems and eſcapes, faction and treachery. Many of thoſe, who ſurrounded the Baſſa, were ſent only to watch and report his conduct; every tongue was muttering cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and every eye was ſearching for a fault.</p>
                     <p>At laſt the letters of revocation arrived, the Baſſa was carried in chains to Conſtantinople, and his name was mentioned no more.</p>
                     <p>"What are we now to think of the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of power, ſaid Raſſelas to his ſiſter; is it without any efficacy to good? or, is the ſubordinate degree only dangerous, and the ſupreme ſafe and glorious? Is the Sultan the only happy man in his dominions? or, is the Sultan himſelf ſubject to the torments of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, and the dread of enemies?"</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time the ſecond Baſſa was depoſed. The Sultan, that had advanced him, was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Janiſaries, and his ſucceſſor had other views and different favourites.</p>

                     <p>THE princeſs in the mean time, inſinuated herſelf into many families; for there are few doors, through which liberality, joined with good humour, cannot find its way. The daughters of many houſes were airy and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but Nekayah had been too long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the converſation of Imlac, and her brother, to be much pleaſed with childiſh levity and prattle which had no meaning. She found their thoughts narrow, their wiſhes low, and their merriment often artificial. Their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, poor as they were, could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved pure, but were embittered by petty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions and worthleſs emulation. They were always jealous of the beauty of each other; of a quality to which ſolicitude can add nothing, and from which detraction can take nothing away. Many were in love with triflers like themſelves, and many fancied that they were in love when in truth they were only idle. Their affection was ſeldom fixed on ſenſe or virtue, and therefore ſeldom ended but in vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their grief, however, like their joy, was tranſient; every thing floated in their mind unconnected with the paſt or future, ſo that one deſire eaſily gave way to another, as a ſecond ſtone caſt into the water effaces and confounds the circles of the firſt.</p>

With theſe girls ſhe played as with inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive animals, and found them proud of her countenance, and weary of her company.</p>
                     <p>But her purpoſe was to examine more deeply, and her affability eaſily perſuaded the hearts that were ſwelling with ſorrow to diſcharge their ſecrets in her ear: and thoſe whom hope flattered, or proſperity delighted, often courted her to partake of their pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>The princeſs and her brother commonly met in the evening in a private ſummer-houſe on the bank of the Nile, and related to each other the occurrences of the day. As they were ſitting together, the princeſs caſt her eyes upon the river that flowed before her. "An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaid ſhe, great father of waters, thou that rolleſt thy floods through eighty nations, to the invocations of the daughter of thy native king. Tell me if thou watereſt, through all thy courſe, a ſingle habitation from which thou doſt not hear the murmurs of complaint?"</p>
                     <p>"You are then, ſaid Raſſelas, not more ſucceſsful in private houſes than I have been in courts." "I have, ſince the laſt partition of our provinces, ſaid the princeſs, enabled my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to enter familiarly into many families, where there was the faireſt ſhow of proſperity and peace, and know not one houſe that is not haunted by ſome fiend that deſtroys its quiet.</p>

"I did not ſeek eaſe among the poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I concluded that there it could not be found. But I ſaw many poor whom I had ſuppoſed to live in affluence. Poverty has, in large cities, very different appearances: it is often concealed in ſplendor, and often in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance. It is the care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their indigence from the reſt: they ſupport themſelves by temporary expedients, and every day is loſt in contriving for the morrow.</p>
                     <p>"This, however, was an evil, which, though frequent, I ſaw with leſs pain, becauſe I could relieve it. Yet ſome have refuſed my bounties; more offended with my quickneſs to detect their wants, than pleaſed with my readineſs to ſuccour them: and others, whoſe exigencies compelled them to admit my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have never been able to forgive their benefactreſs. Many however, have been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely grateful without the oſtentation of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, or the hope of other favours."</p>

                     <p>"In families, where there is or is not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, there is commonly diſcord: if a kingdom be, as Imlac tells us, a great family, a family likewiſe is a little kingdom, torn with factions and expoſed to revolutions. An unpractiſed obſerver expects the love of parents and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to to be conſtant and equal; but this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeldom continues beyond the years of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy: in a ſhort time the children become rivals to their parents. Benefits are allayed by reproaches, and gratitude debaſed by envy.</p>

                        </gap>: each child endeavours to appropriate the eſteem or fondneſs of the parents, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, with yet leſs temptation, betray each other to their children; thus ſome place their confidence in the father, and ſome in the mother, and, by degrees, the houſe is filled with artifices and feuds.</p>
                     <p>"The opinions of children and parents, of the young and the old, are naturally oppoſite, by the contrary effects of hope and deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of expectation and experience, without crime or folly on either ſide. The colours of life in youth and age appear different, as the face of nature in ſpring and winter. And how can children credit the aſſertions of parents, which their own eyes ſhow them to be falſe?</p>
                     <p>"Few parents act in ſuch a manner as much to enforce their maxims by the credit of their lives. The old man truſts wholly to ſlow contrivance and gradual progreſſion: the youth expects to force his way by genius, vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and precipitance. The old man pays regard to riches, and the youth reverences vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The old man deifies prudence: the youth commits himſelf to magnanimity and chance. The young man, who intends no ill, believes that none is intended, and therefore acts with openneſs and candour: but his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

having ſuffered the injuries of fraud, is impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſuſpect, and too often allured to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice it. Age looks with anger on the temerity of youth, and youth with contempt on the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity of age. Thus parents and children, for the greateſt part, live on to love leſs and leſs: and, if thoſe whom nature has thus cloſely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are the torments of each other, where ſhall we look for tenderneſs and conſolation?"</p>
                     <p>"Surely, ſaid the prince, you muſt have been unfortunate in your choice of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: I am unwilling to believe, that the moſt tender of all relations is thus impeded in its effects by natural neceſſity."</p>
                     <p>"Domeſtick diſcord anſwered ſhe, is not inevitably and fatally neceſſary; but yet is not eaſily avoided. We ſeldom ſee that a whole family is virtuous: the good and evil cannot well agree; and the evil can yet leſs agree with one another: even the virtuous fall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to variance, when their virtues are of different kinds, and tending to extremes. In general thoſe parents have moſt reverence who moſt deſerve it: for he that lives well cannot be deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>Many other evils infeſt private life. Some are the ſlaves of ſervants whom they have truſted with their affairs. Some are kept in
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:010939_0100_0F852964D5F2BE70"/>
continual anxiety to the caprice of rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, whom they cannot pleaſe, and dare not offend. Some huſbands are imperious, and ſome wives perverſe: and, as it is always more eaſy to do evil than good, though the wiſdom or virtue of one can very rarely make many happy, the folly or vice of one may often make many miſerable."</p>
                     <p>"If ſuch be the general effect of marriage, ſaid the prince, I ſhall for the future, think it dangerous to connect my intereſt with that of another, leſt I ſhould be unhappy by my partner's fault."</p>
                     <p>"I have met, ſaid the princeſs, with many who live ſingle for that reaſon; but I never found that their prudence ought to raiſe envy. They dream away their time without friendſhip, without fondneſs, and are driven to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the day, for which they have no uſe, by childiſh amuſements, or vicious delights. They act as beings under the conſtant ſenſe of ſome known inferiority, that fills their minds with rancour, and their tongues with cenſure. They are peeviſh at home, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent abroad; and, as the out-laws of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, make it their buſineſs and their pleaſure to diſturb that ſociety which debars them from its privileges.

without adding to the felicity of others, or afflicted without taſting the balm of pity, is a ſtate more gloomy than ſolitude: it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat but excluſion from mankind. Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures."</p>
                     <p>"What then is to be done? ſaid Raſſelas; the more we enquire, the leſs we can reſolve. Surely he is moſt likely to pleaſe himſelf that has no other inclination to regard."</p>

                     <p>THE converſation had a ſhort pauſe. The prince, having conſidered his ſiſter's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, told her, that ſhe had ſurveyed life with prejudice, and ſuppoſed miſery where ſhe did not find it "Your narrative, ſays he, throws yet a darker gloom upon the proſpects of futurity: the predictions of Imlac were but faint ſketches of the evils painted by Nekayah. I have been lately convinced that quiet is not the daughter of grandeur, or of power: that her preſence is not to be bought by wealth, nor enforced by conqueſt. It is evident, that as any man acts in a wider compaſs, he muſt be more expoſed to oppoſition from enmity or miſcarriage from chance; whoever has many
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:010939_0102_0F852966546E9B28"/>
to pleaſe or to govern, muſt uſe the miniſtry of many agents, ſome of whom will be wicked, and ſome ignorant; by ſome he will be miſled, and by others betrayed. If he gratifies one he will offend another: thoſe that are not favoured will think themſelves injured; and, ſince fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours can be conferred but upon few, the greater number will be always diſcontented."</p>
                     <p>"The diſcontents ſaid the princeſs, which is thus unreaſonable, I hope that I ſhall always have ſpirit to deſpiſe, and you power to repreſs."</p>
                     <p>"Diſcontent, anſwered Raſſelas, will not always be without reaſon under the moſt juſt or vigilant adminiſtration of public affairs. None, however attentive, can always diſcover that merit which indigence or faction may happen to obſcure; and none however power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, can always reward it. Yet, he that ſees inferior deſert advanced above him, will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impute that preference to partiality or caprice; and, indeed, it can ſcarcely be hoped that any man, however magnanimous by nature, or exalted by condition, will be able to perſiſt for ever in fixed and inexorable juſtice of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution: he will ſometimes indulge his own affections, and ſometimes thoſe of his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; he will permit ſome to pleaſe him who can never ſerve him; he will diſcover in thoſe

whom he loves, qualities which in reality they do not poſſeſs; and to thoſe, from whom he receives pleaſure, he will in his turn endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give it. Thus will recommendations ſometimes prevail which were purchaſed by money, or by the more deſtructive bribery of flattery and ſervility."</p>
                     <p>"He that has much to do will do ſomething wrong, and of that wrong muſt ſuffer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; and, if it were poſſible that he ſhould always act rightly, yet when ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are to judge of his conduct, the bad will cenſure and obſtruct him by malevolence, and the good ſometimes by miſtake.</p>
                     <p>"The higheſt ſtations cannot therefore hope to be the abodes of happineſs, which I would willingly believe to have fled from thrones and palaces to ſeats of humble privacy and placid obſcurity. For what can hinder the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or intercept the expectations, of him whoſe abilities are adequate to his employments, who ſees with his own eyes the whole circuit of his influence, who chooſes by his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all whom he truſts, and whom none are tempted to deceive by hope or fear? Surely he has nothing to do but to love and to be loved, to be virtuous and to be happy."</p>
                     <p>"Whether perfect happineſs would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:010939_0104_0F852967DB296E20"/>
by perfect goodneſs, ſaid Nekayah, this world will never afford an opportunity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding. But this, at leaſt, may be maintained, that we do not always find viſible happineſs in proportion to viſible virtue. All natural and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all political evils are incident alike to the bad and good: they are confounded in the miſery of a famine, and not much diſtinguiſhed in the fury of a faction; they ſink together in a tempeſt, and are driven together from their country by invaders. All that virtue can afford is quietneſs of conſcience, a ſteady pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a happier ſtate; this may enable us to endure calamity with patience; but remember that patience muſt ſuppoſe pain."</p>

<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010939_0105_0F85296911BB2770"/>
threatens every city with a ſiege like that of Jeruſalem, that makes famine attend on every flight of locuſts, and ſuſpends peſtilence on the wings of every blaſt that iſſues from the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>"On neceſſary and inevitable evils, which overwhelm kingdoms at once, all diſputation is vain: when they happen they muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. But it is evident, that theſe burſts of univerſal diſtreſs are more dreaded than felt: thouſands and ten thouſands, flouriſh in youth, and wither in age, without the knowledge of any other than domeſtick evils, and ſhare the ſame pleaſures and vexations whether their kings are mild or cruel, whether the armies of their country purſue their enemies, or retreat before them. While courts are diſturbed with inteſtine competitions, and embaſſadors are negotiating in foreign countries, the ſmith ſtill plies his anvil, and the huſbandman drives his plow forward; the neceſſaries of life are required and obtained, and the ſucceſſive buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſeaſons continues to make its wonted revolutions."</p>
                     <p>"Let us ceaſe to conſider what, perhaps, may never happen, and what, when it ſhall happen, will laugh at human ſpeculation. We will not endeavour to modify the motions of the elements, or to fix the deſtiny of kingdoms. It is our buſineſs to conſider what beings like

us may perform; each labouring for his own happineſs, by promoting within his circle, however narrow, the happineſs of others.</p>
                     <p>"Marriage is evidently the dictate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; men and women were made to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of each other, and therefore I cannot be perſuaded but that marriage is one of the means of happineſs."</p>
                     <p>"I know not, ſaid the princeſs, whether marriage be more than one of the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble modes of human miſery. When I ſee and reckon the various forms of connubial infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the unexpected cauſe of laſting diſcord, the diverſities of temper, the oppoſitions of opinion, the rude colliſions of contrary deſire where both are urged by violent impulſes, the obſtinate conteſts of diſagreeing virtues, where both are ſupported by conſciouſneſs of good intention, I am ſometimes diſpoſed to think with the ſeverer caſuiſt of moſt nations, that marriage is rather permitted than approved, and that none, but by the inſtigation of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion too much indulged, entangle themſelves with indiſſoluble compacts."</p>

it happens when wrong opinions are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they mutually deſtroy each other, and leave the mind open to truth."</p>
                     <p>"I did not expect, anſwered the princeſs to hear that imputed to falſehood which is the conſequence only of frailty. To the mind, as to the eye, it is difficult to compare with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs objects vaſt in their extent, and various in their parts.

We differ from ourſelves juſt as we differ from each other, when we ſee only part of the queſtion, as in the multifarious relations of politicks and morality: but when we perceive the whole at once, as in numerical computations, all agree in one judgement, and none ever varles his opinion."</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIX. The debate on marriage continued.</head>
                     <p>"THE good of the whole ſays Raſſelas, is the ſame with the good of all its parts. If marriage be beſt for mankind it muſt be evidently beſt for individuals, or a permanent and neceſſary duty muſt be the cauſe of evil, and ſome muſt be inevitably ſacrificed to the convenience of others. In the eſtimate which you have made of the two ſtates, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the incommodities of a ſingle life are, in a great meaſure, neceſſary and, certain, but thoſe of the conjugal ſtate accidental and avoidable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:010939_0109_0F85296D3113DF90"/>
"I cannot forbear to flatter myſelf that prudence and benevolence will make marriage happy. The general folly of mankind is the cauſe of general complaint. What can be expected but diſappointment and repentance from a choice made in the immaturity of youth, in the ardour of deſire, without judgment, without foreſight, without enquiry after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of opinions, ſimilarity of manners, rectitude of judgment, or purity of ſentiment.</p>
                     <p>"Such is the common proceſs of marriage. A youth and maiden meeting by chance, or brought together by artifice, exchange glances, reciprocate civilities, go home, and dream of one another. Having little to divert attention, or diverſity of thought, they find themſelves uneaſy when they are apart, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they ſhall be happy together. They marry, and diſcover what nothing but voluntary blindneſs had before concealed; they wear out life in altercations, and charge nature with cruelty.</p>
                     <p>"From thoſe early marriages proceeds likewiſe the rivalry of parents and children: the ſon is eager to enjoy the world before the father is willing to forſake it, and there is hardly room at once for two generations. The daughters begins to bloom before the mother
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010939_0110_0F85296DD8EE2808"/>
can be content to fade, and neither can forbear to wiſh for the abſence of the other.</p>
                     <p>"Surely all theſe evils may be avoided by that deliberation and delay which prudence preſcribes to irrevocable choice. In the variety and jollity of youthful pleaſures, life may be well enough ſupported without the help of a partner. Longer time will encreaſe experience, and wider views will allow better opportunities of enquiry and ſelection: one advantage, at leaſt, will be certain; the parents will be viſibly older than their children."</p>
                     <p>"What reaſon cannot collect, ſaid Nekayah, and what experiment has not yet taught, can be known only from the report of others. I have been told that late marriages are not emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently happy. This is a queſtion too impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to be neglected, and I have often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to thoſe, whoſe accuracy of remark, and comprehenſiveneſs of knowledge, made their ſuffrages worthy of regard. They have generally determined, that it is dangerous for a man and woman to ſuſpend their fate upon each other, at a time when opinions are fixed, and habits are eſtabliſhed; when friendſhips have been contracted on both ſides, when life has been planned into method, and the mind has long enjoyed the contemplation of its own proſpects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="unknown:010939_0111_0F8529739B2C0A18"/>
"It is ſcarcely poſſible that two travelling through the world under the conduct of chance, ſhould have been both directed to the ſame path, and it will not often happen that either will quit the track which cuſtom has made pleaſing. When the deſultory levity of youth has ſettled into regularity, it is ſoon ſucceeded by pride aſhamed to yield, or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy delighting to contend. And even though mutual eſteem produces mutual deſires to pleaſe, time itſelf as it modifies unchangeably the external mien, determines likewiſe the direction of the paſſions, and gives an inflexible rigidity to the manners. Long cuſtoms are not eaſily broken: he that attempts to change the courſe of his own life, very often labours in vain; and how ſhall we do that for others, which we are ſeldom able to do for ourſelves."</p>
                     <p>"But ſurely, interpoſed the prince, you ſuppoſe the chief motive of choice forgotten or neglected. Whenever I ſhall ſeek a wife, it ſhall be my firſt queſtion, whether ſhe be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be led by reaſon."</p>
                     <p>"Thus it is, ſaid Nekayah, that philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are deceived. There are a thouſand familiar diſputes which reaſon never can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; queſtions that elude inveſtigation, and make logick ridiculous; caſes where ſomething muſt be done, and where little can be ſaid.

Conſider the ſtate of mankind, and enquire how few can be ſuppoſed to act upon any occaſion whether ſmall or great, with all the reaſons of action preſent to their minds. Wretched would be the pair above all names of wretchedneſs, who ſhould be doomed to adjuſt by reaſon every morning all the minute detail of a domeſtick day.</p>
                     <p>"Thoſe who marry at an advanced age, will probably eſcape the encroachments of their children; but, in diminution of this advantage, they will be likely to leave them, ignorant and helpleſs, to a guardian's mercy: or, if that ſhould not happen, they muſt at leaſt go out of the world before they ſee thoſe whom they love beſt either wiſe or great.</p>
                     <p>"From their children, if they have leſs to fear, they have leſs alſo to hope, and they loſe, without equivalent, the joys of early love, and the convenience of uniting with manners pliant, and minds ſuſceptible of new impreſſions, which might wear away their diſſimilitudes by long cohabitation, as ſoft bodies, by continual attrition, conform their ſurfaces to each other.</p>
                     <p>"I believe it will be found that thoſe who marry late are beſt pleaſed with their children, and thoſe who marry early with their partners."</p>

"The union of theſe two affections, ſaid Raſſelas, would produce all that could be wiſhed. Perhaps there is a time when marriage might unite them, a time neither too early for the father, nor too late for the huſband."</p>
                     <p>"Every hour, anſwered the princeſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms my prejudice in favour of the poſition ſo often uttered by the mouth of Imlac, 'That nature ſets her gifts on the right hand and on the left." Thoſe conditions, which flatter hope and attract deſire, are ſo conſtituted, that, as we approach one, we recede from another. There are goods ſo oppoſed that we cannot ſeize both, but, by too much prudence, may paſs between them at too great a diſtance to reach either. This is often the fate of long conſideration; he does nothing who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do more than is allowed to humanity. Flatter not yourſelf with contrarieties of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Of the bleſſings ſet before you make your choice, and be content.

                     <p>THEY roſe up, and returned through the cavity at which they had entered, and the princeſs prepared for her favourite a long narrative of dark labyrinths, and coſtly rooms, and of the different impreſſions which the varieties of the way had made upon her. But, when they came to their train, they found every one ſilent and dejected: the men diſcovered ſhame and fear in their countenances, and the women were weeping in the tents.</p>
                     <p>What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but immediately enquired. "You had ſcarcely entered into the pyramid, ſaid one of the attendants, when a troop of Arabs ruſhed upon us: we were too few to reſiſt

They were about to ſearch the tents, ſet us on our camels, and drive us along before them, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſome Turkiſh horſemen put them to flight; but they ſeized the lady Pekuah with her two maids, and carried them away: the Turks are now purſuing them by our inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but I fear they will not be able to overtake them."</p>
                     <p>"The princeſs was overpowered with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and grief. Raſſelas in the firſt heat of his reſentment, ordered his ſervants to follow him and prepared to purſue the robbers with his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre in his hand. "Sir, ſaid Imlac, what can you hope from violence or valour? the Arabs are mounted on horſes trained to battle and retreat; we have only beaſts of burthen. By leaving our preſent ſtation we may loſe the princeſs, but cannot hope to regain Pekuah."</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time the Turks returned, having not been able to reach the enemy. The princeſs burſt out into new lamentations, and Raſſelas could ſcarcely forbear to reproach them with cowardice; but Imlac was of opinion, that the eſcape of the Arabs was no addition to their misfortune, for perhaps, they would have killed their captives rather than have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them.</p>

                     <p>THERE was nothing to be hoped from longer ſtay. They returned to Cairo repenting of their curioſity, cenſuring the negligence of the government, lamenting their own raſhneſs which had neglected to procure a guard, imagining many expedients, by which the loſs of Pekuah might have been prevented, and reſolving to do ſomething for her recovery, though none could find any thing proper to be done.</p>
                     <p>Nekayah retired to her chamber where her women attempted to comfort her, by telling her that all had their troubles, and that lady Pekuah had enjoyed much happineſs in the world for a long time, and might reaſonably expect a change of fortune. They hoped that ſome good would befal her whereſoever ſhe was, and that their miſtreſs would find another friend who might ſupply her place.</p>
                     <p>The princeſs made them no anſwer, and they continued the form of condolance, not much grieved in their hearts that the favourite was loſt.</p>

Next day the prince preſented to the Baſſa a memorial of the wrong which he had ſuffered, and a petition for redreſs. The Baſſa threatened to puniſh the robbers, but did not attempt to catch them, nor, indeed, could any account or deſcription to given by which he might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the purſuit.</p>
                     <p>It ſoon appeared that nothing would be done by authority. Governors, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to hear of more crimes than they can puniſh, and more wrongs than they can redreſs, ſet themſelves at eaſe by indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate negligence, and preſently forget the requeſt where they loſe ſight of the petitioner.</p>
                     <p>Imlac then endeavoured to gain ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence by private agents. He found many who pretended to an exact knowledge of all the haunts of the Arabs, and to regular correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with their chiefs, and who readily undertook the recovery of Pekuah. Of theſe, ſome were furniſhed with money for their journey, and came back no more; ſome were liberally paid for accounts which a few days diſcovered to be falſe. But the princeſs would not ſuffer any means however, improbable to be left untried. While ſhe was doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhe kept her hope alive as one expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent failed, another was ſuggeſted; when one meſſenger returned unſucceſsful, another was diſpatched to a different quarter.</p>

Two months had now paſſed, and of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuah nothing had been heard; the hopes which they had endeavoured to raiſe in each other grew more languid, and the princeſs when ſhe ſaw nothing more to be tried, ſunk down inconſolable in hopeleſs dejection. A thouſand times ſhe reproached herſelf with the eaſy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance by which ſhe permitted her favourite to ſtay behind her. "Had not my fondneſs, ſaid ſhe, leſſened my authority, Pekuah had not dared to talk of her terrors. She ought to have feared me more than ſpectres. A ſevere look would have overpowered her; a peremptory command would have compelled obedience. Why did fooliſh indulgence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon me? Why did I not ſpeak and refuſe to hear?"</p>
                     <p>"Great princeſs, ſaid Imlac, do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach yourſelf for your virtue, or conſider that as blameable by which evil has acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally been cauſed.

Man cannot ſo far know the connection of cauſes and events, as that he may venture to do wrong in order to do right. When we purſue our end by lawful means, we may always conſole our miſcarriage by the hope of future recompence. When we conſult only our own policy, and attempt to find a nearer way to good, by overleaping the ſettled boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of right and wrong, we cannot be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py even by ſucceſs, becauſe we cannot eſcape the conſciouſneſs of our fault; but if we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, the diſappointment is irremediably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered.

having no great care to collect notions which ſhe had no convenience of uttering. Raſſelas endeavoured firſt to comfort and afterwards to divert her; he hired muſicians, to whom ſhe ſeemed to liſten, but did not hear them, and procured maſters to inſtruct her in various arts, whoſe lectures, when they viſited her again, were again to be repeated. She had loſt her taſte of pleaſure and her ambition of excellence. And her mind, though forced into ſhort excurſions, always recurred to the image of her friend.</p>
                     <p>Imlac was every morning earneſtly enjoined to renew his enquiries, and was aſked every night whether he had yet heard of Pekuah, till not being able to return the princeſs the anſwer that ſhe deſired, he was leſs and leſs willing to come into her preſence. She ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his backwardneſs, and commanded him to attend her. "You are not, ſaid ſhe, to confound impatience with reſentment, or to ſuppoſe that I charge you with negligence, becauſe I repine at your unſucceſsfulneſs. I do not much wonder at your abſence; I know that the unhappy are never pleaſing, and that all naturally avoid the contagion of miſery.

                     <p>"Do not entangle your mind ſaid Imlac, by irrevocable determinations, nor increaſe the burden of life by a voluntary accumulation of miſery; the wearineſs of retirement will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue or increaſe when the loſs of Pekuah is forgotten. That you have been deprived of one pleaſure is no very good reaſon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the reſt."</p>
                     <p>"Since Pekuah was taken from me, ſaid the princeſs, I have no pleaſure to reject or to retain. She that, has no one to love or truſt has little to hope.

                     <p>"How far ſolitude may admit goodneſs, or advance it, I ſhall not, replied Imlac, diſpute at preſent. Remember the confeſſion of the pious hermit.

The generous frankneſs, the modeſt obſequiouſneſs, and the faithful ſecrecy of my dear Pekuah, will always be more miſſed as I ſhall live longer to ſee vice and folly."</p>
                     <p>"The ſtate of a mind oppreſſed with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calamity, ſaid Imlac, is like that of the fabulous inhabitants of the new created earth, who, when the firſt night came upon them, ſuppoſed that the day never would return.

                     <p>The price was no ſubject of debate. The princeſs was in extaſies when ſhe heard that her favourite was alive, and might ſo cheaply be ranſomed. She could not think of delaying for a moment Pekuah's happineſs or her own, but entreated her brother to ſend back the meſſenger with the ſum required. Imlac, being conſulted, was not very confident of the veracity of the relator, and was ſtill more doubtful of the Arab's faith, who might, if he were too liberally truſted, detain at once the money and the captives. He thought it dangerous to put themſelves in the power of the Arab, by going into his diſtrict, and could not expect that the Arab would ſo much expoſe himſelf as to come into the lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where he might be ſeized by the forces of the Baſſa.</p>
                     <p>It is difficult to negotiate where neither will truſt. But Imlac, after ſome deliberation, directed the meſſenger to propoſe that Pekuah ſhould be conducted by ten horſemen to the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:010939_0137_0F85298E68758370"/>
monaſtery of St. Antony, which is ſituated in the deſerts of Upper-Egypt, where ſhe ſhould be met by the ſame number, and her ranſome ſhould be paid.</p>
                     <p>That no time might be loſt, as they expected that the propoſal would not be refuſed, they immediately began their journey to the monaſtery; and, when they arrived, Imlac went forward with the former meſſenger to the Arab's fortreſs. Raſſelas was deſirous to go with them, but neither his ſiſter nor Imlac would conſent. The Arab, according to the cuſtom of his nation, obſerved the laws of hoſpitality with great exactneſs to thoſe who put themſelves into his power, and, in a few days, brought Pekuah with her maids, by eaſy journeys, to their place appointed, where he received the ſtipulated price, and, with great reſpect, reſtored her to liberty and her friends, and undertook to conduct them back towards Cairo beyond all danger of robbery or violence.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXVIII. The adventures of the lady Pekuah.</head>
                     <p>"AT what time, and in what manner, I was forced away ſaid Pekuah, your ſervants have told you. The ſuddenneſs of the event ſtruck me with ſurpriſe, and I was at firſt rather ſtupified than agitated with any paſſion of either fear or ſorrow. My confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was increaſed by the ſpeed and tumult of our flight while we were followed by the Turks, who as it ſeemed, ſoon deſpaired to overtake us, or were afraid of thoſe whom they made a ſhew of menacing.</p>
                     <p>"When the Arabs ſaw themſelves out of danger they ſlackened their courſe, and, as I was leſs harraſſed by external violence, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feel more uneaſineſs in my mind. After ſome time we ſtopped near a ſpring ſhaded with trees in a pleaſant meadow, where we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>t upon the ground, and offered ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments as our maſters were partaking. I was ſuffered to ſit with my maids apart from the reſt, and none attempted to comfort or inſult us. Here I firſt began to feel the full weight of my miſery. The girls ſat weeping in ſilence, and from time to time looked up to me for ſuccour. I knew not to what condition
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:010939_0139_0F852990076668C0"/>
we were doomed, nor could conjecture where would be the place of our captivity, or whence to draw any hope of deliverance. I was in the hands of robbers and ſavages, and had no reaſon to ſuppoſe that their pity was more than their juſtice, or that they would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the gratification of any ardour of deſire, or caprice of cruelty. I, however, kiſſed my maids, and endeavoured to pacify them by remarking, that we were yet treated with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and that, ſince we were now carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond purſuit, there was no danger of violence to our lives.</p>
                     <p>"When we were to be ſet again on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, my maids clung round me, and refuſed to be parted, but I commanded them not to irritate thoſe who had us in their power. We travelled the remaining part of the day through an unfrequented and pathleſs country, and came by moonlight to the ſide of a hill, where the reſt of the troop was ſtationed. Their tents were pitched, and their fires kindled, and our chief was welcomed as a man much beloved by his dependants.</p>
                     <p>"We were received into a large tent, where we found women who had attended their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in the expedition. They ſet before us the ſupper which they had provided, and I eat it rather to encourage my maids, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

with any appetite of my own. When the meat was taken away they ſpread the carpets for repoſe. I was weary, and hoped to find in ſleep that remiſſion of diſtreſs which nature ſeldom denies. Ordering myſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be undreſſed, I obſerved that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men looked very earneſtly upon me, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, I ſuppoſed, to ſee me ſo ſubmiſſively attended. When my upper veſt was taken off, they were apparently ſtruck with the ſplendor of my cloaths, and one of them timorouſly laid her hand upon the embroidery. She then went out, and, in a ſhort time, came back with another woman, who ſeemed to be of higher rank, and greater authority. She did, at her entrance, the uſual act of reverence, and, taking me by the hand, placed me in a ſmaller tent, ſpread with finer carp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"In the morning, as I was ſitting on the graſs, the chief of the troop came towards me: I roſe up to receive him, and he bowed with great reſpect. "Illuſtrious lady, ſaid he, my fortune is better than I had preſumed to hope; I am told by my women, that I have a princeſs in my camp." Sir, anſwered I, your women have deceived themſelves and you; I am not a princeſs, but an unhappy ſtranger who intended ſoon to have leſt this country, in which I am now to be impriſoned for ever.

Whoever, or whenceſoever, you are, returned the Arab, your dreſs, and that of your ſervants, ſhew your rank to be high, and your wealth to be great. Why ſhould you, who can ſo eaſily procure your ranſome, think yourſelf in danger of perpetual captivity? The purpoſe of my incurſions is to encreaſe my riches, or more properly to gather tribute. The ſons of Iſhmael are the natural and hereditary lords of this part of the continent, which is uſurped by late invaders, and low-born tyrants, from whom we are compelled to take by the ſword what is denied to juſtice. The violence of war admits no diſtinction; the lance that is lifted at guilt and power, will ſometimes fall on innocence and gentleneſs."</p>
                     <p>"How little, ſaid I, did I expect that yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day it ſhould have fallen upon me."</p>
                     <p>"Misfortunes, anſwered the Arab, ſhould always be expected. If the eye of hoſtility could have learned to ſpare, excellence like yours had been exempt from injury. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Do not be diſconſolate; I am not one of the lawleſs and cruel rovers of the deſert; I know the rules of civil life; I will fix your ranſome, give a paſſport to your meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and perform my ſtipulation with nice punctuality.</p>
                     <p>

"You will eaſily believe that I was pleaſed with his courteſy; and finding that his predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant paſſion was deſire of money, I began now to think my danger leſs, for I knew that no ſum would be thought too great for the releaſe of Pekuah. I told him that he ſhould have no reaſon to charge me with ingratitude, if I was uſed with kindneſs, and that any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, which could be expected for a maid of common rank, would be paid, but that he muſt not perſiſt to rate me as a princeſs. He ſaid, he would conſider what he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and then, ſmiling, bowed and retired.</p>
                     <p>"Soon after the women came about me, each contending to be more officious than the other, and my maids themſelves were ſerved with reverence. We travelled onward by ſhort journeys. On the fourth day the chief told me, that my ranſome muſt be two hundred ounces of gold, which I not only promiſed him, but told him, that I would add fifty more, if I and my maids were honourably treated.</p>
                     <p>"I never knew the power of gold before. From that time I was the leader of the troop. The march of every day was longer or ſhorter as I commanded, and the tents were pitched where I choſe to reſt. We now had camels and other conveniencies for travel, my own women

                     <p>"The chief of the band was a man far from illiterate: he was able to travel by the ſtars or the compaſs, and had marked in his erratick expeditions ſuch places as are moſt worthy the notice of a paſſenger. He obſerved to me, that buildings are always beſt preſerved in places little frequented, and difficult of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: for when once a country declines from its primitive ſplendor, the more inhabitants are left, the quicker ruin will be made. Walls ſupply ſtones more eaſily than quarries, and palaces and temples will be demoliſhed to make ſtables of granate, and cottages of porphyry.</p>

                     <p>WE wandered about in this manner for ſome weeks, whether, as our chief pretended, for my gratification, or, as I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpected, for ſome convenience of his own. I endeavoured to appear contented

where ſullenneſs and reſentment would have been of no uſe, and that endeavour conduced much to the calmneſs of my mind; but my heart was always with Nekayah, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the night much over-balanced the amuſements of the day. My women, who threw all their cares upon their miſtreſs, ſet their minds at eaſe from the time when they ſaw me treated with reſpect, and gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to the incidental alleviations of our fatigue without ſolicitude or ſorrow. I was pleaſed with their pleaſure, and animated with their confidence. My condition had loſt much of its terror, ſince I found that the Arab ranged the country merely to get riches. Avarice is an uniform and tractable vice: other intellectual diſtempers are different in different conſtitutions of mind; that which ſooths the pride of one will offend the pride of another; but to the favour of the covetuous there is a ready way, bring money and nothing is denied.</p>
                     <p>"At laſt we came to the dwelling of our chief, a ſtrong and ſpacious houſe built with ſtone in an iſland of the Nile, which lies, as I was told, under the tropick. "La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and to which I can retire unpurſued. You may now repoſe in ſecurity: here are few pleaſures, but here is no danger." He then led me into the inner apartments, and ſeating me in the place of honour bowed to the ground. His women, who conſidered me as a rival, looked on me with malignity; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon informed that I was a great lady de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only for my ranſome, they began to vie with each other in obſequiouſneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</p>
                     <p>"Being again comforted with new aſſurances, of ſpeedy liberty, I was for ſome days diverted from impatience by the novelty of the place. The turrets overlooked the country to a great diſtance, and afforded a view of many windings of the ſtream. In the day I wandered from one place to another, as the courſe of the ſun varied the ſplendor of the proſpect, and ſaw many things which I had never ſeen before. The crocodiles and river-horſes were common in this unpeopled region, and I often looked upon them with terror, though I knew that they could not hurt me. For ſome time I expected to ſee merma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"At night the Arab always attended me to a tower ſet apart for celeſtial obſervations, where he endeavoured to teach me the names and courſes of the ſtars. I had no great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to this ſtudy, but an appearance of attention was neceſſary to pleaſe my inſtructor, who valued himſelf for his ſkill, and in a little while, I found ſome employment requiſite to beguile the tediouſneſs of time, which was to be paſſed always amidſt the ſame objects. I was weary of looking in the morning on things from which I had turned away weary in the evening: I therefore was at laſt willing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtars rather than do nothing, but could not always compoſe my thoughts, and was very often thinking on Nekayah when others imagined me contemplating the ſky. Soon after the Arab went upon another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and then my only pleaſure was to talk with my maids about the accident by which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we were carried away, and the happineſs that we ſhould all enjoy at the end of our captivity.</p>
                     <p>"There were women in your Arab's fortreſs, ſaid the princeſs, why did you not make them your companions, enjoy their converſation, and partake their diverſions?

                     <p>"The diverſions of the women, anſwered Pekuah, were only childiſh play, by which the mind accuſtomed to ſtronger operations could not be kept buſy. I could do all which they delighted in doing by powers merely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, while my intellectual faculties were flown to Cairo. They ran from room to room as a bird hops from wire to wire in his cage. They danced for the ſake of motion, as lambs friſk in a meadow. One ſometimes pretended to be hurt that the reſt might be alarmed, or hid herſelf that another might ſeek her. Part of their time paſſed in watching the progreſs of light bodies that floated on the river, and part in marking the various forms into which clouds broke in the ſky.</p>

                     <p>"Nor was much ſatisfaction to be hoped from their converſation: for of what could they be expected to talk? They had ſeen nothing;
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:010939_0148_0F852998B0647550"/>
for they had lived from early youth in that narrow ſpot: of what they had not ſeen they could have no knowledge, for they could not read. They had no ideas but of the few things that were within their view, and had hardly names for any thing but their cloaths and their food. As I bore a ſuperior character, I was often called to terminate their quarrels, which I decided as equitably as I could. If it could have amuſed me to hear the complaints of each againſt the reſt, I might have been often detained by long ſtories, but the motives of their animoſity were ſo ſmall, that I could not liſten long without intercepting the tale."</p>
                     <p>"How, ſaid Raſſelas, can the Arab, whom you repreſented as a man of more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon accompliſhments, take any pleaſure in his ſeraglio, when it is filled only with women like theſe. Are they exquiſitely beautiful?"</p>
                     <p>"They do not, ſaid Pekuah, want that unaffecting and ignoble beauty which may ſubſiſt without ſpritelineſs or ſublimity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out energy of thought or dignity of virtue. But to a man like the Arab ſuch beauty was only a flower caſually plucked and careleſsly thrown away. Whatever pleaſures he might find among them, they were not thoſe of friendſhip or ſociety. When they were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

about him he looked on them with inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive ſuperiority: when they vied for his regard he ſometimes turned away diſguſted. As they had no knowledge, their talk could take nothing from the tediouſneſs of life: as they had no choice, their fondneſs, or appearance of fondneſs, excited in him neither pride nor gratitude; he was not exalted in his own, eſteem by the ſmiles of a woman who ſaw no other man, nor was much obliged by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, of which he could never know the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and which he might often perceive to be exerted not ſo much to delight him as to pain a rival. That which he gave, and they received, as love, was only a careleſs diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuperfluous time, ſuch love as man can beſtow upon that which he deſpiſes, ſuch as has neither hope nor fear, neither joy nor ſorrow."</p>
                     <p>"You have reaſon lady, to think yourſelf happy, ſaid Imlac, that you have been thus eaſily diſmiſſed. How could a mind, hungry for knowledge, be willing, in an intellectual famine, to loſe ſuch a banquet as Pekuah's converſation?</p>
                     <p>"I am inclined to believe, anſwered Pekuah, that he was for ſome time in ſuſpenſe; for,

notwithſtanding his promiſe whenever I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to diſpatch a meſſenger to Cairo, he found ſome excuſe for delay. While I was detained in his houſe he made many incurſions into the neighbouring countries, and, perhaps, he would have refuſed to diſcharge me, had his plunder been equal to his wiſhes. He returned always courteous, related his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, delighted to hear my obſervations, and endeavoured to advance my accquaintance with the ſtars. When I importuned him to ſend away my letters, he ſoothed me with profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of honour and ſincerity; and when I could be no longer decently denied, put his troop again in motion, and left me to govern in his abſence. I was much afflicted by this ſtudied procraſtination, and was ſometimes afraid that I ſhould be forgotten; that you would leave Cairo, and I muſt end my days in an iſland of the Nile.</p>
                     <p>"I grew at laſt hopeleſs and dejected, and cared ſo little to entertain him, that he for a while more frequently talked with my maids. That he ſhould fall in love with them, or with me, might have been equally fatal, and I was not much pleaſed with the growing friendſhip. My anxiety was not long; for, as I recovered ſome degree of chearfulneſs, he returned to me, and I could not forbear to deſpiſe my former uneaſineſs.</p>

"He ſtill delayed to ſend for my ranſome, and would, perhaps, never have determined, had not your agent found his way to him. The gold, which he would not fetch, he could not reject when it was offered. He haſtened to prepare for our journey hither, like a man delivered from the pain of an inteſtine conflict.

He admits a few friends once a month to hear his deductions and enjoy his diſcoveries. I was introduced as a man of knowledge worthy of his notice. Men of various ideas and fluent converſation are commonly welcome to thoſe whoſe thoughts have been long fixed upon a ſingle point, and who find the images of other things ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. I delighted him with my remarks, he ſmiled at the narrative of my travels, and was glad to forget the conſtellations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend for a moment into the lower world.</p>
                     <p>"On the next day of vacation I renewed my viſit, and was ſo fortunate as to pleaſe him again. He relaxed from that time the ſeverity of his rule, and permitted me to enter at my own choice. I found him always buſy, and always glad to be relieved. As each knew much which the other was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of learning, we exchanged our notions with great delight. I perceived that I had every day more of his confidence, and always found new cauſe of admiration in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of his mind. His comprehenſion
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:010939_0153_0F85299DE0FE1738"/>
is vaſt, his memory capacious and retentive, his diſcourſe is methodical, and his expreſſion clear.</p>
                     <p>"His integrity and benevolence are equal to his learning. His deepeſt reſearches and moſt favourite ſtudies are willingly interrupted for any opportunity of doing good by his counſel or his riches. To his cloſeſt retreat, at his moſt buſy moments, all are admitted that want his aſſiſtance: "For tho' I exclude idleneſs and pleaſure, I will never, ſays he, bar my doors againſt charity. To man is permitted the contemplation of the ſkies, but the practice of virtue is commanded."</p>
                     <p>"Surely, ſaid the princeſs, this man is happy."</p>
                     <p>"I viſited him, ſaid Imlac, with more and more frequency, and was every time more enamoured of his converſation: he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime without haughtineſs, courteous without formality, and communicative without oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I was at firſt, Madam, of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, thought him the happieſt of mankind, and often congratulated him on the bleſſing that he enjoyed. He ſeemed to hear nothing with indifference but the praiſes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to which he always returned a general anſwer, and diverted the converſation to ſome other topick.</p>

                        <pb n="154" facs="unknown:010939_0154_0F85299EA7A85BE8"/>
"Amidſt this willingneſs to be pleaſed, and labour to pleaſe, I had always reaſon to imagine that ſome painful ſentiments preſſed upon his mind. He often looked up earneſtly towards the ſun, and let his voice fall in the midſt of his diſcourſe. He would ſometimes, when we were alone, gaze upon me in ſilence with the air of a man who longed to ſpeak what he was yet reſolved to ſuppreſs. He would ſometimes ſend for me with vehement injunctions of haſte, though, when I came to him, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary to ſay. And ſometimes, when I was leaving him would call me back, pauſe a few moments and then diſmiſs me.</p>

A ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tempeſt clouded the ſky, and diſappointed our obſervation. We ſat a while ſilent in the dark, and then he addreſſed himſelf to me in theſe words: "Imlac, I have long conſidered thy friendſhip as the greateſt bleſſing of my life. Integrity without knowledge is weak and uſeleſs, and knowledge without integrity is

I have poſſeſſed for five years the regulation of weather, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the ſeaſons: the ſun has liſtened to my dictates and paſſed from tropick to tropick by my direction; the clouds, at my call, have poured their waters, and the Nile has overflowed at my command; I have reſtrained the rage of the dog-ſtar, and mitigated the fervours of the crab. The winds alone, of all the elemental powers, have hitherto refuſed my authority, and multitudes have periſhed by equinoctial tempeſts wihch I found myſelf unable to prohibit or reſtrain.

                     <p>"About ten years ago, ſaid he, my daily obſervations of the changes of the ſky led me to conſider whether, if I had the power of the ſeaſons, I could confer greater plenty upon the

inhabitants of the earth. This contemplation faſtened on my mind, and I ſat days and nights in imaginary dominion, pouring upon this country and that the ſhowers of fertility, and ſeconding every fall of rain with a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſunſhine. I had yet only the will to do good, and did not imagine that I ſhould ever have the power.</p>
                     <p>"One day as I was looking on the fields withering with heat, I felt in my mind a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wiſh that I could ſend rain on the ſouthern mountains, and raiſe the Nile to an inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <p>"Do not believe, ſaid he with impatience, that ſuch objections could eſcape me: I reaſoned long againſt my own conviction, and laboured againſt truth with the utmoſt obſtinacy.

                     <p>The princeſs was recollected, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite was abaſhed. Raſſelas, more deeply affected, enquired of Imlac, whether he thought ſuch maladies of the mind frequent, and how they were contracted.</p>

                     <p>"DISORDERS of intellect, anſwered Imlac, happen much more often than ſuperficial obſervers will eaſily believe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if we ſpeak with rigorous exactneſs, no human mind is in its right ſtate. There is no man whoſe imagination does not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times predominate over his reaſon, who can
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:010939_0161_0F8529A7A3C31720"/>
regulate his attention wholly by his will, and whoſe ideas will come and go at his command. No man will be found in whoſe mind airy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not ſometimes tyranniſe, and force him to hope or fear beyond the limits of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber probability. All power of fancy over rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a degree of inſanity but while this power is ſuch as we can control and repreſs, it is not viſible to others, nor conſidered as any depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the mental faculties: it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced madneſs but when it becomes ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable, and apparently influences ſpeech or action.</p>
                     <p>"To indulge the power of fiction, and ſend imagination out upon the wing, is often the ſport of thoſe who delight too much in ſilent ſpeculation. When we are alone we are not always buſy; the labour of excogitation is too violent to laſt long; the ardour of enquiry will ſometimes give way to idleneſs or ſatiety. He who has nothing external that can divert him, muſt find pleaſure in his own thoughts, and muſt conceive himſelf what he is not; for who is pleaſed with what he is? He then expatiates in boundleſs futurity, and culls from all imaginable conditions that which for the preſent moment he ſhould moſt deſire, amuſes his deſires with impoſſible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and confers upon his pride unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dominion. The mind dances from ſcene

to ſcene, unites all pleaſures in all combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and riots in delights which nature and fortune, with all their bounty, cannot beſtow.</p>
                     <p>"In time ſome particular train of ideas fixes the attention, all other intellectual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications are rejected, the mind, in wearineſs or leiſure, recurs conſtantly to the favourite conception, and feaſts on the luſcious falſehood, whenever ſhe is offended with the bitterneſs of truth. by degrees the reign of fancy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; ſhe grows firſt imperious, and in time deſpotick. Then fictions begin to operate as realities, falſe opinions faſten upon the mind and life paſſes in dreams of rapture or of anguiſh.</p>
                     <p>"This, Sir, is one of the dangers of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which the hermit has confeſſed not always to promote goodneſs, and the aſtronomer's miſery has proved to be not always propitious to wiſdom."</p>
                     <p>"I will no more, ſaid the favourite, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine myſelf the queen of Abiſſinia. I have often ſpent the hours, which the princeſs gave to my own diſpoſal, in adjuſting ceremonies and regulating the court; I have repreſſed the pride of the powerful, and granted the petitions of the poor; I have built new palaces in more happy ſituations, planted groves upon

                     <p>"And I, ſaid the princeſs, will not allow myſelf any more to play the ſhepherdeſs in my waking dreams. I have often ſoothed my thoughts with the quiet and innocence of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral employments, till I have in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber heard the wind whiſtle, and the ſheep bleat; ſometimes freed the lamb entangled in the thicket, and ſometimes with my crook encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the wolf.

                     <p>THE evening was now far paſt, and they roſe to return home. As they walked along the bank of the Nile, delighted with the beams of the moon quivering on the water, they ſaw at a ſmall diſtance an old man, whom, the prince had often heard in the aſſembly of the ſages. "Yonder, ſaid he, is one whoſe years have calmed his paſſions, but not clouded his reaſon: let us cloſe the diſquiſitions of the night, by enquiring what are his ſentiments of his own ſtate, that we may know whether youth alone is to ſtruggle with vexation, and whether any better hope remains for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of life."</p>
                     <p>Here the ſage approached and ſaluted them. They invited him to join their walk, and prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled a while as acquaintance that had unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly me another.

not diſregarded, accompanied them to their houſe, and, at the prince's requeſt, entered with them. They placed him in the ſeat of honour, and ſet wine and conſerves before him.</p>
                     <p>"Sir, ſaid the princeſs, an evening walk muſt give to a man of learning, like you, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which ignorance and youth can hardly conceive. You know the qualities and the cauſes of all that you behold, the laws by which the river flows, the periods in which the planets perform their revolutions. Every thing muſt ſupply you with contemplation, and renew the conſciouſneſs of your own dignity."</p>
                     <p>"Lady anſwered he, let the gay and the vigorous expect pleaſure in their excurſions, it is enough that age can obtain eaſe. To me the world has loſt its novelty: I look round, and ſee what I remember to have ſeen in happier days. I reſt againſt a tree, and conſider, that in the ſame ſhade, I once diſputed upon the annual overflow of the Nile, with a friend who is now ſilent in the grave. I caſt my eyes upwards, fix them on the changing moon, and think with pain on the viciſſitudes of life. I have ceaſed to take much delight in phyſical truth; for what have I to do with thoſe things which I am ſoon to leave?"</p>

"You may at leaſt recreate yourſelf, ſaid Imlac, with the recollection of an honourable and uſeful life, and enjoy the praiſe which all agree to give you."</p>
                     <p>"Praiſe, ſaid the ſage with a ſigh, is to an old man an empty ſound. I have neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be delighted with the reputation of her ſon, nor wife to partake the honours of her huſband. I have outlived my friends and my rivals. Nothing is now of much importance; for I cannot extend my intereſt beyond my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Youth is delighted with applauſe, becauſe it is conſidered as the earneſt of ſome future good, and becauſe the proſpect of life is far extended: But to me, who am now declining to decrepitude, there is little to be feared from the malevolence of men, and yet leſs to be hoped from their affection or eſteem. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they may yet take away, but they can give me nothing. Riches would now be uſeleſs, and high employment would be pain. My retroſpect of life recalls to my view many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of good neglected, much time ſquandered upon trifles, and more loſt in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vacancy. I leave many great deſigns unattempted, and many great attempts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed. My mind is burthened with no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy crime, and therefore I compoſe myſelf to tranquillity; endeavour to abſtract my thoughts from hopes and cares, which, though
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:010939_0167_0F8529AE5B7B6298"/>
reaſon knows them to be vain, ſtill try to keep their old poſſeſſion of the heart; expect, with ſerene humility, that hour which nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long delay; and hope to poſſeſs in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate that happineſs which here I could not find, and that virtue which here I have not attained."</p>
                     <p>He roſe and went away, leaving his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience not much elated with the hope of long life. The prince conſoled himſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, that it was not reaſonable to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed by this account; for age had never been conſidered as the ſeaſon of felicity, and, if it was poſſible to be eaſy in decline and weakneſs, it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity might be happy; that the noon of life might be bright, if the evening could be calm.</p>
                     <p>The princeſs ſuſpected that age was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous and maligant, and delighted to repreſs the expectations of thoſe who had newly entered the world. She had ſeen the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of eſtates look with envy on their heirs, and known many who enjoy pleaſure no longer than they can confine it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Pekuah conjectured, that the man was older than he appeared, and was willing to

impute his complaints to delirious dejection; or elſe ſuppoſed that he had been unfortunate, and was therefore diſcontented: "For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſaid ſhe, is more common than to call our own condition, the condition of life.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XLVI. The princeſs and Pekuah viſit the aſtronomer.</head>
                     <p>THE princeſs and Pekuah having talked in private of Imlac's aſtronomer, thought his character at once ſo amiable and ſo ſtrange, that they could not be ſatisfied without a nearer knowledge, and Imlac was requeſted to find the means of bringing them together.</p>
                     <p>

This was ſomewhat difficult; the philoſopher had never received any viſits from women, though he lived in a city that had in it many Europeans, who followed the manners of their own countries, and many from other parts of the world that lived their with European liberty. The ladies would not be refuſed, and ſeveral ſchemes were propoſed for the accompliſhment of their deſign. It was propoſed to introduce them as ſtrangers in diſtreſs, to whom the ſage was always acceſſible; but, after ſome deliberation, it appeared, that by this artifice, no acquaintance could be formed, for their converſation would be ſhort, and they could not decently importune him often. "This, ſaid Raſſelas, is true; but I have yet a ſtronger objection againſt the miſrepreſentation of your ſtate. I have always conſidered it as treaſon againſt the great republick of human nature, to make any man's virtues the means of deceiving him, whether on great or little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. All impoſture weakens confidence and chills benevolence. When the ſage finds that you are not what you ſeemed, he will feel the reſentment natural to a man who, conſcious of great abilities, diſcovers that he has been tricked by underſtandings meaner than his own, and, perhaps, the diſtruſt, which he can never afterwards wholly lay aſide, may ſtop the voice of counſel, and cloſe the hand of charity; and where will you find the power
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:010939_0170_0F8529B099596528"/>
of reſtoring his benefactions to mankind, or his peace to himſelf?"</p>
                     <p>To this no reply was attempted, and Imlac began to hope that their curioſity would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; but, next day, Pekuah told him, ſhe had now found an honeſt pretence for a viſit to the aſtronomer, for ſhe would ſolicite permiſſion to continue under him the ſtudies in which ſhe had been initiated by the Arab, and the princeſs might go with her either as a fellow-ſtudent, or becauſe a woman could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently come alone. "I am afraid, ſaid Imlac, that he will be ſoon weary of your company: men advanced far in knowledge do not love to repeat the elements of their art, and I am not certain, that even of the elements, as he will deliver them connected with inferences, and mingled with reflections, you are a very capable auditreſs." "That, ſaid Pekuah, muſt be my care: I aſk of you only to take me thither. My knowledge is, perhaps, more than you imagine it, and by concurring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with his opinions I ſhall make him think it greater than it is."</p>
                     <p>The aſtronomer, in purſuance of this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, was told, that a foreign lady travelling in ſearch of knowledge, had heard of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and was deſirous to become his ſcholar. The uncommonneſs of the propoſal raiſed at once his ſurpriſe and curioſity, and when, after
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:010939_0171_0F8529B15B1CF6B8"/>
a ſhort deliberation, he conſented to admit her, he could not ſtay without impatience till the next day.</p>
                     <p>The ladies dreſſed themſelves magnificently, and were attended by Imlac to the aſtronomer, who was pleaſed to ſee himſelf approached with reſpect by perſons of ſo ſplendid an appearance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the exchange of the firſt civilities he was timorous and baſhful; but, when the talk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came regular, he recollected his powers, and juſtified the character which Imlac had given. Enquiring of Pekuah what could have turned her inclination towards aſtronomy, he received from her a hiſtory of her adventure at the py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, and of the time paſſed in the Arab's Iſland. She told her tale with eaſe and elegance, and her converſation took poſſeſſion of his heart. The diſcourſe was then turned to aſtronomy: Pekuah diſplayed what ſhe knew: he looked upon her as a prodigy of genius, and entreated her not to deſiſt from a ſtudy which ſhe had ſo happily begun.</p>
                     <p>They came again and again, and were every time more welcome than before. The ſage endeavoured to amuſe them, that they might prolong their viſits, for he found his thoughts grow brighter in their company; the clouds of ſolicitude vaniſhed by degrees, as he forced himſelf to entertain them, and he grieved
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:010939_0172_0F8529B282E3DE40"/>
when he was left at their departure to his old employment of regulating the ſeaſons.</p>
                     <p>The princeſs and her favourite had now watched his lips for ſeveral months, and could not catch a ſingle word from which they could judge whether he continued, or not, in the opinion of his preternatural commiſſion. They often contrived to bring him to an open decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but he eaſily eluded all their attacks, and on which ſide ſoever they preſſed him eſcaped from them to ſome other topick.</p>
                     <p>As their familiarity increaſed, they invited him often to the houſe of Imlac, where they diſtinguiſhed him by extraordinary reſpect. He began gradually to delight in ſublunary pleaſures. He came early and departed late; laboured to recommend himſelf by aſſiduity and compliance; excited their curioſity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter new arts, that they might ſtill want his aſſiſtance; and when they made any excurſion of pleaſure or enquiry, entreated to attend them.</p>
                     <p>By long experience of his integrity and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the prince and his ſiſter were convinced that he might be truſted without danger; and, leſt he ſhould draw any falſe hopes from the civilities which he received, diſcovered to him their condition, with the motives of their

                        </gap> and required his opinion on the choice of life.</p>
                     <p>"Of the various conditions which the world ſpreads before you, which you ſhall prefer, ſaid the ſage, I am not able to inſtruct you. I can only tell that I have choſen wrong. I have paſſed my time in ſtudy without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; in the attainments of ſciences which can, for the moſt part, be but remotely uſeful to mankind. I have purchaſed knowledge at the expence of all the common comforts of life: I have miſſed the endearing elegance of female friendſhip, and the happy commerce of domeſtick tenderneſs. If I have obtained any prerogatives above other ſtudents, they have been accompanied with fear, diſquiet, and ſcrupuloſity; but even of theſe prerogatives, whatever they were, I have, ſince my thoughts have been diverſified by more intercourſe with the world begun to queſtion the reality. When I have been for a few days loſt in pleaſing diſſipation, I am always tempted to think that my enquiries have ended in error, and that I have ſuffered much, and ſuffered it in vain.</p>
                     <p>Imlac was delighted to find that the ſage's underſtanding was breaking through its miſts, and reſolved to detain him from the planets till he ſhould forget his taſk of ruling them, and reaſon ſhould recover its original influence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:010939_0174_0F8529B3B7A018D8"/>
From this time the aſtronomer was received into familiar friendſhip, and partook of all their projects and pleaſures: his reſpect kept him attentive and the activity of Raſſelas did not leave much time unengaged. Something was always to be done; the day was ſpent in making obſervations which furniſhed talk for the evening, and the evening was cloſed with a ſcheme for the morrow.</p>
                     <p>The ſage confeſſed to Imlac, that ſince he had mingled in the gay tumults of life, and divided his hours by a ſucceſſion of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he found the conviction of his authority over the ſkies fade gradually from his mind, and began to truſt leſs to an opinion which he never could prove to others, and which he now found ſubject to variation from cauſes in which reaſon had no part. "If I am acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally left alone for a few hours, ſaid he, my inveterate perſuaſion ruſhes upon my ſoul, and my thoughts are chained down by ſome irreſiſtible violence, but they are ſoon diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled by the prince's converſation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly releaſed at the entrance of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuah. I am like a man habitually afraid of ſpectres, who is ſet at eaſe by a lamp, and wonders at the dread which harraſſed him in the dark; yet, if his lamp be extinguiſhed, feels again the terrors which he knows that when it is light he ſhall feel no more. But I
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:010939_0175_0F8529B4561C3B88"/>
am ſometimes afraid leſt I indulge my quiet by criminal negligence, and voluntarily forget the great charge with which I am intruſted. If I favour myſelf in a known error, or am determined by my own eaſe in a doubtful queſtion of this importance, how dreadful is my crime!"</p>
                     <p>"No diſeaſe of the imagination, anſwered Imlac, is ſo difficult of cure, as that which is complicated with the dread of guilt: fancy and conſcience then act interchangeably upon us, and ſo often ſhift their places, that the illuſions of one are not diſtinguiſhed from the dictates of the other. If fancy preſents images not moral or religious, the mind drives them away when they give it pain, but when me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick notions take the form of duty, they lay hold on the faculties without oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe we are afraid to exclude or baniſh them. For this reaſon the ſuperſtitious are often melancholy, and the melancholy almoſt always ſuperſtitious.</p>
                     <p>"But do not let the ſuggeſtions of timidity overpower your better reaſon: the danger of neglect can be but as the probability of the obligation, which when you conſider it with freedom, you find very little, and that little growing every day leſs. Open your heart to the influence of the light, which, from time
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:010939_0176_0F8529B760E4AF50"/>
to time, breaks in upon you: when ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples importune you, which you in your lucid moments know to be vain, do not ſtand to parley, but fly to buſineſs or to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuah, and keep this thought always prevalent, that you are only one atom of the maſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and have neither ſuch virtue nor vice, as that you ſhould be ſingled out for ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural favours or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afflictions."</p>

"Your learning and virtue, ſaid Imlac, may juſtly give you hopes."</p>
                     <p>Raſſelas then entered with the princeſs and Pekuah, and enquired whether they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived any new diverſion for the next day. "Such, ſaid Nekayah, is the ſtate of life, that none are happy but by the anticipation of change: the change itſelf is nothing; when we have made it, the next wiſh is to change again. The world is not yet exhauſted; let me ſee ſomething to-morrow which I never ſaw before.</p>
                     <p>"Variety, ſaid Raſſelas, is ſo neceſſary to content, that even the happy valley diſguſted me by the recurrence of its luxuries; yet I could not forbear to reproach myſelf with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, when I ſaw the monks of St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony ſupport without complaint, a life, not of uniform delight, but uniform hardſhip."</p>

                     <p>"Do you think, ſaid Nekayah, that the monaſtick rule is a more holy and leſs imperfect ſtate than any other? May not he equally hope for future happineſs who converſes openly with mankind, who ſuccours the diſtreſſed by his charity, inſtructs the ignorant by his learning, and contributes by his induſtry to the general ſyſtem of life; even though he ſhould omit ſome of the mortifications which are practiſed in the cloiſter, and allow himſelf ſuch harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs delights as his condition may place within his reach?"</p>
                     <p>"This, ſaid Imlac, is a queſtion which has long divided the wiſe, and perplexed the good. I am afraid to decide on either part. He that lives well in the world, is better than he that lives well in a monaſtery. But, perhaps, every one is not able to ſtem the temptations of publick life; and, if he cannot conquer, he may properly retreat. Some have little
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:010939_0179_0F8529B9A46A1138"/>
power to do good, and have likewiſe little ſtrength to reſiſt evil. Many are weary of their conflicts with adverſity, and are willing to eject thoſe paſſions which have long buſied them in vain. And many are diſmiſſed by age and diſeaſes from the more laborious duties of ſociety. In monaſteries the weak and timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous may be happily ſheltered, the weary may repoſe, and the penitent may meditate. Thoſe retreats of prayer and contemplation have ſomething ſo congenial to the mind of man, that, perhaps, there is ſcarcely one that does not purpoſe to cloſe his life in pious abſtraction with a few aſſociates ſerious as himſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Such, ſaid Pekuah, has often been my wiſh, and I have heard the princeſs declare, that ſhe would not willingly die in a croud."</p>
                     <p>"The liberty of uſing harmleſs pleaſures, proceeded Imlac, will not be diſputed; but it is ſtill to be examined what pleaſures are harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The evil of any pleaſure that Nekayah can image is not in the act itſelf, but in its conſequences. Pleaſure, in itſelf harmleſs, may become miſchievous, by endearing to us a ſtate which we know to be tranſient and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batory, and withdrawing our thoughts from that, of which every hour brings us nearer to the beginning, and of which no length of time will bring us to the end. Mortification is not vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

in itſelf, nor has any other uſe, but that it diſengages us from the allurements of ſenſe. In the ſtate of future perfection, to which we all aſpire, there will be pleaſure without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſecurity without reſtraint."</p>
                     <p>The princeſs was ſilent, and Raſſelas, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aſtronomer, aſked him, whether he could not delay her retreat, by ſhewing her ſomething which ſhe had not ſeen before.</p>
                     <p>"Your curioſity, ſaid the ſage, has been ſo general, and your purſuit of knowledge ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, that novelties are not now very eaſily to be found: but what you can no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the living may be given by the dead. Among the wonders of this country are the catacombs, or the ancient repoſitories, in which the bodies of the earlieſt generations were lodged, and where, by the virtue of the gums which embalmed them, they yet remain without corruption.</p>
                     <p>"I know not, ſaid Raſſelas, what pleaſure the ſight of the catacombs can afford; but, ſince nothing elſe is offered, I am reſolved to view them, and ſhall place this with many other things which I have done, becauſe I would do ſomething."</p>

When they were about to deſcend into the ſupulchral caves, "Pekuah, ſaid the princeſs, we are now again invading the habitations of the dead; I know that you will ſtay behind; let me find you ſafe when I return."

                     <p>"It is no limitation of omnipotence, replied the poet; to ſuppoſe that one thing is not conſiſtent with another, that the ſame propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition cannot be at once true and falſe, that the ſame number cannot be even and odd, that cogitation cannot be conferred on that which is created incapable of cogitation."</p>
                     <p>"I know not, ſaid Nekayah, any great uſe of this queſtion. Does that immateriality, which, in my opinion, you have ſufficiently proved, neceſſarily include eternal duration?"</p>
                     <p>"Of immateriality, ſaid Imlac, our ideas are negative, and therefore obſcure. Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:010939_0185_0F8529BE25A271F8"/>
ſeems to imply a natural power of perpetual duration as a conſequence of exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all cauſes of decay: whatever periſhes, is deſtroyed by the ſolution of its contexture, and ſeparation of its parts; nor can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how that which has no parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admits no ſolution, can be naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or impaired."</p>
                     <p>"I know not ſaid Raſſelas, how to conceive any thing without extenſion: what is extended muſt have parts, and you allow, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has parts may be deſtroyed."</p>
                     <p>"Conſider your own conceptions, replied Imlac, and the difficulty will be leſs. You will find ſubſtance without extenſion. An ideal form is no leſs real than material bulk: yet, an ideal form has no extenſion. It is no leſs certain, when you think on a pyramid that your mind poſſeſſes the idea of a pyramid, than that the pyramid itſelf is ſtanding. What ſpace does the idea of a pyramid occupy, more than the idea of a grain of corn? or how can either idea ſuffer laceration? As is the effect ſuch is the cauſe: as the thought is, ſuch is the power that thinks; a power impaſſive and indiſcerpible.</p>
                     <p>"But the Being ſaid Nekayah, whom I fear to name, the Being which made the ſoul, can deſtroy it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="unknown:010939_0186_0F8529C26E8414C0"/>
"He, ſurely can deſtoy it, anſwered, Imlac, ſince, however unperiſhable in itſelf, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from a higher nature its power of duration. That it will not periſh by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent cauſe or trouble or corruption, may be collected from philoſophy; but philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy can tell no more. That it will not be annihilated by him that made it, we muſt humbly learn from higher authority."</p>
                     <p>The whole aſſembly ſtood a while ſilent and collected. "Let us return, ſaid Raſſelas, from this ſcene of mortality. How gloomy would be theſe manſions of the dead to him who did not know that he ſhould never die; that what now acts ſhall continue its agency, and what now thinks ſhall think on for ever. Thoſe that lie here ſtretched before us, the wiſe and the powerful of ancient times, warn us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſhortneſs of our preſent ſtate: they were, perhaps, ſnatched away while they were buſy, like us, in the choice of life."</p>
                     <p>"To me ſaid the princeſs, the choice of life is become leſs important; I hope hereafter to think only on the choice of eternity."</p>
                     <p>They then haſtened out of the caverns, and under the protection of their guard, returned to Cairo.</p>

                     <p>IT was now the time of the inundation of the Nile: a few days after their viſit to the catacombs, the river began to riſe.</p>
                     <p>They were confined to their houſe. The whole region being under water gave them no invitation to any excurſions, and, being well ſupplied with materials for talk, they diverted themſelves with compariſons of the different forms of life which they had obſerved, and with various ſchemes of happineſs which each of them had formed.</p>
                     <p>Pekuah was never ſo much charmed with any place as the convent of St. Anthony, where the Arab reſtored her to the princeſs, and wiſhed only to fill it with pious maidens, and to be made prioreſs of the order: ſhe was weary of expectation and diſguſt, and would gladly be fixed in ſome unvariable ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The princeſs thought, that of all ſublunary things, knowledge was the beſt: She deſired firſt to learn all ſciences, and then purpoſed to found a college of learned women, in which
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:010939_0188_0F8529C48FD4B818"/>
ſhe would preſide, that, by converſing with the old, and educating the young, ſhe might divide her time between the acquiſition and communication of wiſdom, and raiſe up for the next age models of prudence, and patterns of piety.</p>
                     <p>The prince deſired a little kingdom, in which he might adminiſter juſtice in his own perſon, and ſee all the parts of government with his own eyes; but he could never fix the limits of his dominion, and was always adding to the number of his ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>Imlac and the aſtronomer were contented to be driven along the ſtream of life, without directing their courſe to any particular port.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe wiſhes that they formed they well knew that none could be obtained. They deliberated a while what was to be done, and reſolved, when the inundation ſhould ceaſe, to return to the land of in Abiſſinia.</p>

                     <q>is a voyage, in the progreſs of which, we are perpetually changing our ſcenes; we firſt leave child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood behind us, then youth, then the years of ripened manhood, then the more pleaſing part of old age.</q> The peruſal of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, having excited in me a train of reflections on the ſtate of man, the inceſſant fluctuation of his wiſhes, the gradual change of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all external objects, and the thoughtleſſneſs with which he floats along the ſtream of time, I ſunk into a ſlumber amidſt my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and, on a ſudden, found my ears filled with the tumult of labour, the ſhouts of alacrity, the ſhrieks of alarm, the whiſtle of winds, and the daſh of waters.</p>
                  <p>MY aſtoniſhment for a time repreſſed my curioſity; but ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering myſelf ſo far as to enquire whither we were going, and what was the cauſe of ſuch clamour and confuſion, I was told that we were launching out into the <hi>ocean of life;</hi> that we had already paſſed the ſtreights of infancy, in which multitudes had periſhed, ſome by the weakneſs and fragility of their veſſels, and more by the folly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, or negligence of thoſe who undertook to ſteer them; and
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:010939_0190_0F8529C5A3CBA2A0"/>
that we were now on the main ſea, abandoned to the winds and bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, without any other means of ſecurity, than the care of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, whom it was always in our power to chooſe among great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that offered their direction and aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>I THEN looked round <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith anxious eagerneſs; and firſt turning my eyes behind me, ſaw a ſtream flowing through flowery Iſlands, which every one that failed along ſeemed to behold with pleaſure; but no ſooner touched, than the current, which, though not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> or turbulent, was yet irreſiſtible, bore him away. Beyond theſe iſlands all was darkneſs, nor could any of the paſſengers deſcribe the ſhore at which he firſt embarked.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE me, and on each ſide, was an expanſe of waters vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently agitated, and covered with ſo thick a raiſt, that the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicacious eye could ſee but a little way. It appeared to be full of rocks and whirlpools, for many ſunk unexpectedly while they were courting the gale with full ſails, and inſulting thoſe whom they had left behind. So numerous, indeed, were the dangers, and ſo thick the darkneſs, that no caution could confer ſecurity. Yet there were many, who, by falſe intelligence, betrayed their followers into whirlpools, or by violence puſhed thoſe whom they found in their way againſt the rocks.</p>
                  <p>THE current was invariable and inſurmountable; but though it was impoſſible to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ail againſt it, or to return to the place that was once paſſed, yet it was not ſo violent as to allow no opportunities for dexterity on courage, ſince, though none could retreat back from danger, yet they might often avoid it by oblique direction.</p>
                  <p>IT was, however, not very common to ſteer with much care or prudence; for; by ſome univerſal infatuation, every man appeared to think himſelf ſafe, though he ſaw his conſorts every moment ſinking round him; and no ſooner had the waves cloſed over them, than their fate and their miſconduct were forgotten; the voyage was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with the ſame jocund confidence; every man congratulated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the ſoundneſs of his veſſel, and believed himſelf able to ſtem the whirlpool in which his friend was ſwallowed, or glide over the rock on which he was daſhed: nor was it often obſerved that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight of a wreck made any man change his courſe; if he turned aſide for a moment, he ſoon forgot the rudder, and left himſelf again to the diſpoſal of chance.</p>
                  <p>THIS negligence did not proceed from indifference, or from wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of their preſent condition; for not one of thoſe, who thus ruſhed upon deſtruction, failed, when he was ſinking, to call loudly upon his aſſociates for that help which could not now be given him; and many ſpent their laſt moments in cautioning others againſt the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:010939_0191_0F8529C7407D9088"/>
folly, by which they were intercepted in the midſt of their courſe. Their benevolence was ſometimes praiſed, but their admonitions were unreg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rded.</p>
                  <p>THE veſſels, in which we had embarked, being confeſſedly une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to to the turbulence of the ſtream of life, were viſibly impaired in the courſe of the voyage; ſo that every paſſenger was certain, that how long ſoever he might, by favourable accidents, or by inceſſant vigilance, be preſerved, he muſt ſink at laſt.</p>
                  <p>THIS neceſſity of periſhing might have been expected to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dden the gay, and intimidate the daring, at leaſt to keep the melancholy and timorous in perpetual torments, and hinder them from any enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the varieties and gratifications which nature offered them as the ſolace of their labours; yet in effect none ſeemed leſs to expect deſtruction than thoſe to whom it was moſt dreadful; they all had the art of concealing their danger from themſelves; and thoſe who knew their inability to bear the ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of the terrors that embarraſſed their way, took care never to look forward, but found ſome amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the preſent moment, and generally entertained themſelves by playing with HOPE, who was the conſtant aſſociate of the voyage of life.</p>
                  <p>YET all that HOPE ventured to promiſe, even to thoſe whom ſhe favoured moſt, was, not that they ſhould eſcape, but that they ſhould ſink among the laſt; and with this promiſe every one was ſatisfied, though he laughed at the reſt or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eming to believe it. HOPE, indeed, apparently mocked the credulity of her companions, for, inproportion as their veſſels grew leaky, ſhe redoubled her aſſurances of ſafety; and none were more buſy in making proviſion for a long voyage, than they, whom all but themſelves ſaw likely to periſh ſoon by irreparable decay.</p>
                  <p>IN the midſt of the current of life was the <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erſperſed with rocks, of which the pointed crags were concealed under water, and the tops covered with herbage, on which EASE ſpread couches of repoſe, and with ſhades, where PLEASURE warbled the ſong of invitation. Within ſight of theſe rocks all who ſailed on the ocean of life muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily paſs. REASON, indeed; was always at hand to ſteer the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers through a narrow outlet by which they might eſcape; but very few could, by her entreaties or remonſtrances, be induced to put the rudder into her hand, without ſtipulating that ſhe ſhould approach ſo near unto the rocks of PL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ASURE, that they might ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a ſhort enjoyment of that delicious region, after which they always determined to purſue their courſe without any other deviation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="unknown:010939_0192_0F8529C7F31D9DF8"/>
REASON was too often prevailed upon ſo far by theſe promiſes, as to venture her charge within the eddy of the gulph of INTEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERANCE, where, indeed, the circumvolution was weak, but yet interrupted the courſe of the veſſel, and drew it by inſenſible rotations, towards the centre. She then repented her temerity, and with all her force endeavoured to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>treat; but the draught of the gulph was generally too ſtrong to be overcome; and the paſſenger, having danced in circles with a pleaſing and giddy velocity, was at laſt overwhelmed and loſt. Thoſe ſew whom REASON was able to extricate, generally ſuffered ſo many ſhocks upon the points which ſhot out from the rocks of PLEASURE,, that they were unable to continue their courſe with the ſame ſtrength and facility as before, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THERE were artiſts who profeſſed to repair the breach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s and ſtop the leaks of the veſſels which had been ſhattered on the rocks of PLEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SURE. Many appeared to have great confidence in their skill, and ſome, indeed, were preſerved by it from ſinking, who had received only a ſingle blow; but I remarked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that few veſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE only advantage, which in the voyage of life, the cautious had above the negligent, was, that they ſunk later, and more ſuddenly; for they paſſed forward till they had ſometimes ſeen all thoſe in who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But ſuch as had often fallen againſt the rocks of PLEASURE, commonly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided by ſenſible degrees, contended long with the encroaching waters, and haraſſed themſelves by labours that ſcarce HOPE herſelf could flatter with ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>AS I was looking upon the various fate of the multitude about me, I was ſuddenly alarmed with an admonition from ſome unknown Power, <q>Gaze not idly upon others when thou thyſelf art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
