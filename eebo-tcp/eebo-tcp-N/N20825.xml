            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHEN fam'd Columbus nobly dar'd to brave,</l>
               <l>The untry'd perils of the Western wave;</l>
               <l>Ten thousand dangers in his passage lay,</l>
               <l>Dark was his night, and dreary was his day!</l>
               <l>The rude companions of his bold design,</l>
               <l>Fatigu'd with toil, against their chief combine:</l>
               <l>When sudden—bursting on th' astonish'd view!</l>
               <l>A world discover'd prov'd his judgment true.—</l>
               <l>"Yet black ingratitude, the Great Man's fate!</l>
               <l>"Pursu'd Columbus with envenom'd hate;</l>
               <l>"But minds like his a base degen'rate race,</l>
               <l>"Might meanly persecute—but not disgrace:</l>
               <l>"The noble soul its energy maintains,</l>
               <l>"In spite of dungeons, tyranny, and chains.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The sons of Europe found a guileless race,</l>
               <l>No fraud was veil'd beneath the smiling face;</l>
               <l>Their manners, mild, benevolent, and kind,</l>
               <l>Pourtray'd the cloudless sunshine of the mind:</l>
               <l>Bless'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign,</l>
               <l>Whose pow'r reliev'd, but ne'er inflicted pain,</l>
               <l>Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew;</l>
               <l>Their joys were many, and their wants were few.</l>
               <l>One custom with their virtues ill agreed,</l>
               <l>Which made Humanity with anguish bleed;</l>
               <l>Compell'd at Superstition's shrine to bow,</l>
               <l>The hapless victims of a cruel vow!</l>
               <l>Their sweetest maids were often doom'd to prove,</l>
               <l>No joy in friendship, and no bliss in love!</l>
               <l>Yet love and nature cannot be supprest,</l>
               <l>The sigh will heave, and palpitate the breast;</l>
               <l>For spite of vows, which Heaven's wise laws disown,</l>
               <l>Love sits triumphant on the heart—his throne!</l>
               <l>And breaks those fetters bigots would impose,</l>

               <l>The rigid laws of time, and place, our bard,</l>
               <l>In this night's drama, ventures to discard:</l>

                  <p>I here present the darling of my age to be devoted to the service of our god. It will be worse than parting with my life to lose the comforts of her dear society—but the bright sun, our glorious deity, demands such excellence to be consigned alone to do <hi>him</hi> honour.—Pardon, my king, an old man's tears; but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not always, without a struggle, yield to duty.</p>

                  <p>My father's will has ever sway'd my thoughts, from the first hour that infant sense cou'd learn obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:—Should he doom my death, his mandate would be met with equal resignation.</p>

                  <p>Thy pious mind, which knows to yield such duty to a father, will well befit the service of thy god.—But hear the sacred tenour of the law which binds a priestess to her duty.—Should the heart, to heaven devoted, become the prey of sacrilegious love, our law consigns it priestess, and the accomplice of her guilt, to instant death. Her parents and their offspring are pledges for her faith, and should her flight elude offended justice, their forfeit lives must expiate her erime. <stage>[Cora <hi>bows to the sun</hi>]</stage> Now to the altar, and record your vows; then, as our custom is, come forth to shine Queen of this festive day, the last you are to know exempt from sacred duty.</p>

for insuring the love of heaven, as taking half a dozen hereticks and broiling them gently over a slow fire—Acknowledge Roldan Viceroy, says he—I'd see you damn'd first, says I—so watching my opportunity, I gave the priest a Cornish hug, showed his scullions a specimen of English wrestling, and off I came, trussed for dressing as you see me.</p>

                  <p>Alonzo, my wrongs were enviable—cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity was triumph—When amidst the applauding shouts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thousands, I approached the royal presence, the suffering monarch shrunk from the sight, and threw his mantle o'er his face, crimsoned with shame; then raised me to his arms, still my pride sustained me: but when I beheld the beauteous Isabella, try to force from their dire grasp my galling chains, and on each wound drop a balmy tear, loyalty and love rushed on my soul, I embraced her royal feet, and gave her tears for thanks; then all the pride of pageantry was decreed, but my soul languished for the time, when, Orozimbo, I might thus again enfold thee, and restore to thee thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, freed from the gripe of ruthless tyranny.</p>
