            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEFORE I proceed, it will be neceſſary to give you the clue which led to this buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Simon Wingate one of the deacons of the Church in Biddeford, a rigid Trinitarian, and a man of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper, had for many years been endeavoring to for up a church quarrel with Mr. Hill, on account of his catholic ideas, which he in converſation held up to view, when religion was the topic, influenced the Rev. Mr. Webſter paſtor of ſaid church, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him and Mr. Hill to meet at his houſe, and at the ſame time to invite a number of the church to be preſent. (Mr. Hill had, for a number of years, carefully avoided any converſation with Deacon Wingate reſpecting religion, on account of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid principles, and violent temper.)</p>
            <p>Accordingly they met at the Paſtor's on Friday, the 14th. day of September, 1792, and four other members of ſaid Church. After a little converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Deacon Wingate propoſed to Mr. Hill the following Queſtion:—</p>
            <p>"Of whom was Jeſus Chriſt the Son?"</p>
            <p>To which Mr. Hill anſwered, "I am not fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in my own mind."—"Whom do you think he was the ſon of?" Anſwer: "I am inclined to think that he was the ſon of Joſeph." After a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable converſation reſpecting various texts of Scripture which ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt, Deacon Wingate finding thoſe preſent wiſhed to drop the matter expreſſed himſelf after this manner, "If you are all ſatisfied, I ſhall endeavour to make myſelf contented"—and each one returned to his reſpective home. The next ſabbath, Deacon Wingate did not attend meeting, and it was currently reported that he exclaimed bitterly againſt the Paſtor and Church, calling them as much heretics as Mr. Hill, and that he was conſcience-ſmitten, and could not, or would not worſhip with them, &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:025603_0003_0FCDEF5F72D48320"/>
Mr. Hill, underſtanding that James Emery, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deacon of ſaid Church, was a good deal affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the clamour Deacon Wingate had made reſpecting this conference, his tenets, &amp;c. wrote Deacon Emery a letter on the ſubject, expreſſing his concern for the difficulties and animoſities that agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Church; that as rational creatures we ought to <hi>reaſon</hi> on religious ſubjects, as we did on other matters; that <hi>reaſon</hi> was a diſtinguiſhing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which God had given men above the brutes, and adduced a number of texts of Scripture to ſhew the propriety of such an inveſtigation of religious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that the Apoſtles always exerciſed this noble talent in introducing the Goſpel into the world; that we ought to uſe candour towards one another who made different conſtructions of the ſame text or that the Proteſtants doctrine of tranſubſtantiation becauſe it was <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Scriptures plainly ſaid "this is my body—this is my blood"; that it was as unreaſonable to believe that <hi>three</hi> were but <hi>one,</hi> and that <hi>one</hi> was <hi>three,</hi> as to believe that bread was fleſh, or that wine was blood; that one great object of Chriſt's miſſion into the world was to enforce the doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to an immortal life, and to give an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as a full proof of the doctrine; that it Jeſus Chriſt was in the order of beings ſuperior to man, <hi>his</hi> reſurrection would not prove <hi>man's</hi> reſurrection any more than <hi>man's</hi> reſurrection would prove the reſurrection of a <hi>brute;</hi> and that concerning the divine conception (ſo called) he argued that Mary was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed, that is, <hi>married</hi> to Joſeph; that Joſeph wascal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her huſband, and Mary wascalled by the angel his wife; that if the had not been his wife; he could not poſſibly have meditated the putting her away; that being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, ſignified that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025603_0004_0FCDEF626E4F3598"/>
the child which ſhe had conceived, would be highly favored of God, would have much of the Divine influence, would be the Meſſiah, the ſame which the prophets had foretold was to come, would ſave the people from their ſins, would bring life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light; that Joſeph, in order to prove the event of his wonderful dream, declined to have any converſation with her as his wife from the time of the dream, till ſhe was delivered: that Luke and other diſciples and Apoſtles ſuppoſed him to be the ſon of Joſeph as well as the ſcribes and phariſees, who were the teachers of the people in that day, and doubtleſs were men of information; that he did not ſee why we in this day might not ſuppoſe ſo too; that his being called the Son of God did not prove any <hi>trinity,</hi> any more than Adam's being called the ſon of God;—for all good men were called the ſons of God; that if we quit reaſon and common ſenſe, we, by enthuſiaſm, bigotry and ſuperſtition, might make <hi>nothing</hi> mean <hi>any, thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Deacon Emery received this letter kindly; ſaw Mr. Hill a few days after, and with more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cordiality took him by the hand, thanked him for the letter he had ſent him, ſaying it had given him a good deal of ſatisfaction; that his creed was not ſo bad as he had heard, &amp;c. Deacon Wingate borrowed this letter and ſhewed it to the Rev. Mr. Lancaſter, of Scarborough, who, filled with enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic zeal, paſſed his ſolemn ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon it, calling it hereſy, blaſphemy, damnable doctrine, &amp;c. This awful ſentence being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by Deacon Wingate to Deacon Emery; he was much agitated, and by deacon Wingate's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was induced with one other member of ſaid church, to apply to the Paſtor, requeſting a church meeting, which was appointed to be held at the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025603_0005_0FCDEF63EE350290"/>
January 17, 1793—At which meeting Deacon Wingate appeared, and entered his complaint againſt Mr. Hill, charging him with giving it as his opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that Jeſus Chriſt the Meſſiah was not begotten by the miraculous power of the Holy Ghoſt, and that he was the real ſon of Joſeph and Mary. Mr. Hill then deſired the meeting might be adjourned, that he might have time to prepare himſelf for his defence, and that the meeting at the adjournment might be held at the meeting-houſe, and public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given. Accordingly the meeting was adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the firſt Thurſday in May, then next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to meet at the meeting-houſe at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>On the firſt Wedneſday in May the Aſſociation met at Mr. Webſter's pariſh, and after lecture, the Church ſtopped, and agreed to aſk counſel in this matter, of the Aſſociation. Accordingly the Church were all invited to meet the Aſſociation that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at Mr. Webſter's, which they did, and after a good deal of converſation, in which Mr. Hill freely and fully gave his opinion reſpecting the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſpute, and his reaſons for forming ſuch an opinion, fixing the whole on his Bible. The Church retired for ſome time, that the Aſſociation might conſult among themſelves. After ſome time the Church were again invited in, and the Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion delivered the reſult of their conſultation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that the tenet Mr. Hill embraced, was in their judgment erroneous, and that it ought to be teſtified and guarded againſt. The Church as well as Mr. Hill, were not ſatisfied with this reſult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had left the matter as looſe as they found it, and the Church as much in the dark as ever. It muſt be remembered, that during all this time, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Wingate withdrew himſelf from the ſocial wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025603_0006_0FCDEF656CA74E10"/>
and communion of the Church; that Mr. Hill had had two conferences with him before ſeveral witneſſes, and expoſtulated with him on the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of his conduct; that obſerving different creeds could not hurt their reſpective believers; that we are in a land of light and knowledge; that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpoke louder than words; that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles condemned mal conduct only; and that what we call <hi>creeds</hi> were not introduced into the Church till a long time after the Chriſtian Era.</p>
            <p>After Mr. Hill found that expoſtulations had no effect, he exhibited to the Paſtor a complaint againſt Deacon Wingate, charging him with abſenting himſelf from the ſocial worſhip and communion of the Church for ſix months then laſt paſt; for his unchriſtian conduct towards thoſe who did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue the ſacred Scriptures agreeable to his notion.—For being a railer, a tatler, and a buſybody in other men's matters, contrary to the precepts and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt; for combining with others to defraud one David Hutchins in the ſale of ſome iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore mines; for unchriſtian conduct towards him in calling him to a conference before witneſſes, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his anſwering ſome queſtions concerning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Meſſias, and then making his anſwers the foundation of an accuſation before the Church; and for perſecuting him for a private pique under the cloak of religion. Mr. Hill always ſuppoſed that Deacon Wingate carried on this matter out of revenge, becauſe he enliſted his apprentice during the late war, contrary to his will, though his perſon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal intereſt did not ſuffer by it, for the apprentice gave him one hundred dollars of his bounty.—On this account the Deacon often quarreled with Mr. Hill, and finding he could not get any advantage by quarreling in that way, he commenced the combat
bernard
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025603_0007_0FCDEF670EB29A90"/>
under the cloak of religion. Beſides, Deacon Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate was jealous that Mr. Hill aſſiſted Mr. Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins in his law-ſuit againſt him concerning the iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore mines; for Mr. Hill, as a Juſtice of the Peace, took a number of depoſitions to be uſed in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on both ſides, and when Deacon Wingate came to him for his advice, reſpecting the matter, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly gave him his opinion, and the reaſons why he formed ſuch an opinion, which offended the Deacon, though the judgment of the court of reference prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the ſame. But to return,</p>
            <p>The Church being met at the meeting-houſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to adjournment, and the Rev. Doctor Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menway being preſent, the Church requeſted him to aſſiſt in the buſineſs before them as a conciliator. The Doctor read a paper, which he ſaid was agreeable to the minds of the Aſſociation, giving it as their opinion, that Mr. Hill's tenet was falſe, unſound, &amp;c. and that the Church ought to bear their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt it; that they ought to deal tenderly with a brother who was in an error not voluntarily; that they ought to adviſe him to ſtudy the Scriptures more carefully, and to be careful in not advancing ſuch doctrines, they being againſt the common te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the Churches in general, and this Church in particular.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hill then deſired liberty to anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and give the reaſons publicly, why he formed ſuch an opinion, a conſiderable number of perſons being collected to hear the debates, &amp;c. Mr. Hill then roſe and delivered the following Addreſs:</p>
            <p>Friends, Brethren &amp; Fellow-Citizens,</p>
            <p>I think myſelf happy that I am permitted this day to anſwer for myſelf before this aſſembly, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things whereof I am accuſed, becauſe I
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025603_0008_0FCDEF6AF1FEC078"/>
know that this is an age of free inquiry; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to thank my God, that by the conſtitution of this Commonwealth, "No ſubject ſhall be hurt, moleſted, or reſtrained, in his perſon, liberty, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, for werſhipping God in the manner and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt agreeable to the dictates of his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or for his religious profeſſion or ſentiments; provided he doth not diſturb the public peace, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others in their religious worſhip": therefore I beſeech you to hear me patiently.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not pretend to deny the accuſation, which is, 'for giving it as my opinion, that Jeſus Chriſt the Meſſiah was not begotten by the miraculous power of the Holy Ghoſt; and that he was the real ſon of Joſeph and Mary:" but ſhall endeavor to give you the reaſons why I have formed ſuch an opinion. In doing this I shall quote no authors but the holy men of God, who wrote as they were moved by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; neither ſhall I give their writings any private interpretation, but ſhall conſtrue every text rationally, according to the gift of God that is in me. But before I proceed, I ſhall offer for your candid conſideration three propoſitions, in which think you will agree with me.</p>
            <p>1. That the Scriptures are true.</p>
            <p>2d., That Scripture is the beſt interpreter of Scripture.</p>
            <p>3d. That God has made us rational creatures and thereby diſtinguiſhed us from the brutal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore he requires us to act and think of him, his ways, his word, and his works, according to thoſe rational powers and faculties,-which if we neglect, we, like the ſlothful ſervant muſt be ſaid to have hid this diſtinguiſhed talent in the earth, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically to call God Almighty a hard maſter.

to embrace the Chriſtian religion, would you not bid him uſe <hi>reaſon?</hi> and argue the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of the ſyſtem as a proof of its validity? "Come now, let us <hi>reaſon</hi> together, faith the Lord, though your ſins be as scarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool." Iſai. i. 18.—Which is as if he had ſaid, tho' your ſins be ever ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, though they be of the deepeſt dye, yet if you will but <hi>reaſon</hi> with me on my ways, my word and my works, you will ſoon be convinced that I am your Almighty father, who gives you every good and perfect gift, and then you will be aſhamed of your baſe conduct and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards me, and return and repent of all your tranſgreſſions, and put away the evil of your doings from before my face, and I-do-then aſſure you that I will pardon all your iniquities; and your ſins ſhall be remembered no more. Seeing God thus condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to <hi>reaſon</hi> with us, ſurely then it is our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty to <hi>reaſon</hi> with one another. The same prophet ſays, xlili-28. "Put me in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, let us <hi>plead</hi> together": also the prophet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah ſays, vi. 23. "Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's <hi>controverſy,</hi> and ye ſtrong foundations of the earth, for the Lord hath a <hi>controverſy,</hi> with his people, he will <hi>plead</hi> with Iſrael."<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "O my people, what have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? teſtify againſt me:" Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſays, John v. 39. "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtify of me." What can poſſibly be meant by ſearching, if we are not to uſe our rational powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in judging or forming an opinion upon what we find? And how can we judge, or form an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion but by exerciſing thoſe powers and faculties which God has given us to diſtinguiſh us from the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025603_0010_0FCDEEE9A6A3C110"/>
brutes? All the parables which are ſo plentifully and beautifully interſperſed in the four Evangeliſts, have a tendency to ſhew the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of the Goſpel. The apoſtle Paul in all his epiſtles exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe powers and faculties; and the Bereans are ſaid Acts xvii. II. "to be more noble than thoſe of Theſſalonica, in that they received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily whether theſe things were ſo": and in his defence before Felix, Acts x. iv. 25. he <hi>reaſoned</hi> ſo ſtrongly of righteouſneſs, temperance, and judgment to come, as to make Felix <hi>tremble.</hi> So alſo on a like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when he was permitted to anſwer for himſelf before king Agrippa, Acts xxvi I. his arguments were ſo forcible that Agrippa publicly Confeſſed that he was almoſt perſuaded to be a Chriſtian. The whole ſyſtem of the Chriſtian religion was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the world by the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and by that gained aſcendency over all other religions. If then we are to exerciſe our reaſon on ſubjects of this nature, a ſubject of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to every one both here and hereafter, I claim your attention and candor to the reaſons which I ſhall now offer in juſtification of the opinion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am now accuſed.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I ſhall endeavor to ſhew, upon the principles before eſtabliſhed, that Jeſus Chriſt the Meſſiah is not, nor can be <hi>the eternal Father of all things,</hi> who is Omniſcient and omnipreſent, God over all bleſſed forever. And for the ſupport of which I ſhall appeal to the "law and the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for if any man ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in him." The Scriptures teach us that there is but <hi>one</hi> God, who is himſelf the maker and governor of all things; that this <hi>one</hi> God is the ſole object of worſhip; and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025603_0011_0FCDEF6F508F26A8"/>
that <hi>he</hi> ſent Jeſus Chriſt into the world to inſtruct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, empowered him to work miracles, raiſed him from the dead, and gave him all the power that he everwas or is now poſſeſſed of. The Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the moſt clear and expreſs declarations to this purpoſe. "Thou ſhalt have no other God before <hi>me.</hi>" Again, "hear O Iſrael, the Lord our God is <hi>one</hi> Lord." Again, "to us there is but <hi>one</hi> God, the <hi>Father,</hi> of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him." Again, <hi>one</hi> Lord, <hi>one</hi> faith, <hi>one</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ONE GOD and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. For there is <hi>one</hi> God and one Mediator between God and men, the <hi>man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus." It is no where in Scripture ſaid that there are three perſons in this one God, nor is the doctrine of a Trinity expreſsly laid down in any other direct propoſition whatever. Chriſt himſelf indeed ſays "I and my father are one;" but he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently explains himſelf by praying that his diſciples might be <hi>one</hi> with him in the ſame ſenſe in which he was <hi>one</hi> with the Father, John xvii. 21, 22. "that they all may be one, as thou Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; and the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they all may be one, even as we are one." The apoſtle John, 1ſt. Epiſt. v. 7. ſays, that "there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one." By the Father I underſtand the creator of all things; by the Word, the power by which he ſpake; and by the Holy Ghoſt the divine influence which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts the being of a God, and his providence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and are no more three diſtinct perſons than the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, water and blood, which conſtitute every human being, make each man three men.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:025603_0012_0FCDEF70B9AE1918"/>
This one God is ſaid to have created all things, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. God ſaid let there be light, and there was light. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſts of them by the breath of his mouth. He ſpake, and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt. Thus faith the Lord thy-Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that ſtretcheth out the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens alone, that ſpreadeth abroad the earth by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf" This fame one God is called the <hi>Father,</hi> that is; the <hi>author</hi> of all things, as well with reſpect to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as all other brings. "That they may know thee the <hi>only true God,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt, whom <hi>thou</hi> haft ſent. Go to my brethren (ſays Chriſt) and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto <hi>my</hi> father and to <hi>your</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to <hi>my</hi> God and to <hi>your</hi> God." He alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſays that he is inferior to his Father, and that all his power was given him by the Father, and that he could do nothing without the Father, John xiv. 28, "My Father is greater than I. The ſon can do nothing of himſelf. The words that I ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I ſpeak not of myſelf, but the Father that dwelleth in me, <hi>be</hi> doth the works, He received from God the Father honor and glory." Again, "the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt which <hi>God</hi> gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him."</p>
            <p>"It is ſaid by ſome that Chriſt did not mean that he was inferior to the Father with reſpect to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, but only with reſpect to his human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but if ſuch liberties be taken in explaining a perſon's meaning, language has no uſe whatever. Upon the ſame principle, it might be ſaid that he never died, or that he never roſe from the dead, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly meaning his divine nature only, 2nd there is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025603_0013_0FCDEF72E7F51C58"/>
no kind of impoſition but what might be authoriſed by ſuch an abuſe of language as this."</p>
            <p>Some things are ſaid to be with held from him: "Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no not the angles; neither the ſon, but the Father. To ſit on my right hand and on my left is cot mine to give." So his dominion is ſaid to be <hi>derived</hi> from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to that of the Father; "and when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the ſon alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</p>
            <p>Seeing then Jeſus Chriſt is not the eternal Father, who is he? To the law and to the teſtimony. In the infancy of days, God told the ſerpent, that the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the woman ſhould bruiſe his head; is it then poſſible that the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the woman cad be older than the <hi>woman</hi> herſelf; and alſo co-equal and co eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with God the creator of the woman? Alſo God told Abraham, that in his ſeed all nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed; and this ſeed (faith the apoſtle) is Chriſt. Hear alſo what Moſes ſaid to his people, Deut. xviii. 15. "the Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a <hi>prophet</hi> from the midſt of thee of thy <hi>brethren,</hi> like unto <hi>me,</hi> unto him ye ſhall hearken." The apoſtle Peter, Acts iii. 20. &amp;c. ſpeaks of Jeſus Chriſt as being this ſame perſon who Moſes foretold was to come, and ſays, that all the prophets, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as have ſpoken have likewiſe foretold of theſe days. Luke in his genealogy has theſe words, iii. 23. "and Jeſus himſelf began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was ſuppoſed) the ſon of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph." The words <hi>as was ſuppoſed</hi> are in a paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, which may be left out in readings, and the phraſe would then ſtand thus "being the ſon of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph." This agrees with Mat. xv. 55. "Is not this the carpenter's ſon? is not his mother called Mary,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025603_0014_0FCDEF759120B848"/>
and his brethren James and Joſes, and Simon and Judas: and his ſiſters, are they not all with us? whence then hath this man all theſe things? and they were offended in him. But Jeſus ſaid unto them, a prophet is not without honor, ſave in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and in his own houſe." The Jews always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Meſſiah, would come from ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed family, with great pomp, and it gave them great offence to ſee ſo many of the people run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after this carpenters's ſon, and calling him the promiſed Meſſias, which led him to obſerve as he did, intimating that thoſe whom they called low peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, might have as great abilities, and be as highly favored of God, as thoſe of more elevated ſtations, and ſeemed in an oblique manner to requeſt their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Samuel, who ſprang from no diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line according to their own genealogy, and to David, who was a man after God's own heart, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his father's being a huſbandman, and he brought up tending ſheep. Alſo this agrees with what Philip ſaid to Nathaniel, John i. 45. "We have found him of whom Moſes in the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth the ſon of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph." He often called himſelf the ſon of <hi>man;</hi> ſo the woman of Samaria faith, "come ſee a man which told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Chriſt?" Jeſus Chriſt alſo faith to the ſame woman, "ye worſhip ye know not what, we know what we worſhip: for ſalvation is of the Jews." With this agreeth the apoſtles, Acts ii. 22. 'Jeſus of Nazareth, a <hi>man</hi> approved of by God, by miracles, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſigns, which God did by him in the midſt of you." Heb. ii. 17. "Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren.' Heb. ii. 10
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025603_0015_0FCDEF76CF9AF6F0"/>
became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſuffering." 1. Cor. xv. 21. "for ſince by <hi>man</hi> came death, by <hi>man</hi> came alſo the reſurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive." So the apoſtle ſays, ſpeaking of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, "that God had ſworn to him, that of the fruit of his loins according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his throne." Paul ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, Rom. i. 3. "concerning his ſon, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, which was made of the ſeed of David, according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and declared to be the ſon of God with power, according to the ſpirit of holineſs, by the reſurrection from the dead." Hence I think it appears pretty clear that the diſciples and apoſtles did not conceive of him in any other ſenſe than as a man divinely favored of God.</p>
            <p>I aſk your attention once more. It appears that the third day after he was crucified, two of his diſciples went to Emmaus, and as they were talking and reaſoning about what had happened, Jeſus drew near and walked with them, and aſked them what they were talking about: they aſked him if he was a ſtranger in Jeruſalem, and did not know the things that had happened? and as they did not know him, they went on to tell him "concerning Jeſus of Nazareth, who was a <hi>prophet,</hi> mighty in deed and word before God and all the people"; Luke xxiv. 19. and how he had been condemned and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and that that it was then three days ſince this had happened, and that they had truſted that this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus would have redeemed Iſrael. Beſides, they had heard ſtrange ſtories about his being riſen again. He then aſked them if Chriſt ought not to have ſuffered, "and beginning at Moſes and all the prophets, he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025603_0016_0FCDEF7830656F50"/>
expounded unto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf." Now if this doctrine of his being more than a man had been true, or of ſo much importance as ſome would have it, why did he not teach it plainly to his diſciples and apoſtles? but inſtead of this he told them that repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all nations: therefore let God be true and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man a liar; that is, every man who contradicts him. But there are ſome texts ſaid to be myſterious, and ſeemingly to contradict what has been before ſaid: on theſe I ſhall now obſerve in their order.</p>
            <p>John i. 1. &amp;c. "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, the ſame was in the beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." The evangeliſt appears to me to be here recapitulating the great work of creation, and the word manifeſts the power and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy by which he commanded all things into being: thus, "God ſaid let there be light, and there was light. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſts of them by the breath of his mouth. He ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt." Eph. iii. 9. "And to make all men ſee what is the fellowſhip of the myſtery which from the beginning of the world hath been bid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt." Col. i. 1. "For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in the earth, viſible and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him. Here it may be obſerved, that heaven and earth were not created by Jeſus Chriſt, but all things <hi>in</hi> heaven and <hi>in</hi> the earth; that is, all things reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the new world, or the Goſpel kingdom.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025603_0017_0FCDEF79A9FC7190"/>
Heb. i. 1, 2. "God, who at ſundry times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his ſon, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds." Here the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle uſes the plural number, worlds: this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that theſe <hi>all things</hi> reſpecting the Goſpel, of which he was appointed heir, would ſpread far and wide into various regions and countries. Theſe are the only texts, which ſeem to favor the notion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt's being the creator of the world, and theſe I think, will bear a different interpretation, ſo as not to claſh with other plain poſitive texts, which ſpeak of God as the author of all things. It appears to me that the apoſtles are here ſpeaking of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Goſpel diſpenſation, and of Jeſus Chriſt as the creator, author, promulgator and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſher of this diſpenſation. Hence he is called the head of the body, the church, "who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead, that in all things (reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the church) he might have the pre-eminence; for it pleaſed the Father, that in him, ſhould all full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwell." Alſo he is ſaid to be made <hi>ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> than the angels, as he hath by inheritance <hi>obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> a more excellent name than they. John viii. 58. Jeſus Chriſt ſays, "before Abraham was, I am." This text appears to me to be fully explained by St. Jhon, i. 30. "this is he of whom I ſaid, after me cometh a <hi>man</hi> who is prefered before me; for he was before me." To <hi>prefer,</hi> ſignifies to regard, eſteem or value more than another, to exalt or raiſe to dignity. Thus Jeſus Chriſt was preferred before Abraham, or any of his progenitors, for he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted or raiſed by God far above any of Adam's race, and in this ſenſe was <hi>before</hi> them. Phil. ii. 6. Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025603_0018_0FCDEF7CF17E1310"/>
be equal with God." Which I conſtrue thus, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pattern of piety, and doing ſuch things as none but God could do, does not rob God of any of his attributes. I Tim. iii. 16. "for without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory." That is, as if he had ſaid, there is no diſpute but that the Goſpel now deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was in ancient days a myſtery, which is now made known by this Jeſus, a fleſhly being, which was vindicated by the ſpirit of every man, who duly conſidered its beneficent effects upon the world of mankind, as it tended to promote good will and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love among men, which the angels ſaw would tend to the glory of God; and this Goſpel was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and finally this ſame fleſhly being was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up into glory. But he is ſaid to be "the alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending, the firſt and the laſt." Very true, alpha is the firſt letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is the laſt; the goſpel was promulgated to mankind in the Greek language, hence be is called the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt, beginning</hi> and the <hi>ending</hi> of the Goſpel diſpenſation. But my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſaying and doing are very different things; to ſay well is good, but to do well is better. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man had two ſons, one of their names was Jew, the other's name was Gentile: At harveſt time the old gentleman called on his ſons to aſſiſt him in his huſbandry and to work in his vineyard. Jew told him plainly he would not, but after reflecting a little on the matter, he went. Gentile, like a good boy, ſaid I will go ſir, but he went not. Which of the two think ye, did the will of his father? Methinks I hear ſome of you whiſper, he that went. It is idle
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025603_0019_0FCDEF7E31CEEE48"/>
for any man to make a profeſſion of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion and not to live agreeable to the precepts thereof. How diametrically oppoſite is it to the precepts and examples of Jeſus Chriſt, the great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Goſpel diſpenſation, to make it a buſineſs to go about from houſe to houſe tattling, making himſelf buſy with every man's matters, railing at, ſlandering and perſecuting his neighbour, reviling and backbiting those againſt whom he happens to have a diſtaſte, and anathematizing thoſe who do not form an opinion in religious matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his notion: this is diametrically oppoſite to the precepts of that Goſpel which he profeſſes, which ſays, Mat. vii I. "judge not that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged, and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again," and inſiſts on taking a mote out of his brother's eye, without ever conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is a beam in his own, or taking the leaſt thought of looking after it when he is told of it; or that he has no right to judge "another man's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant" but emphatically ſays, "come not near me for I am holier than thou"; "theſe (ſays the prophet I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah) lxv 5. are a ſmoke in my noſe, a fire that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the day." A good tree, my brethren, cannot bring forth corrupt fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit, but every tree is known by its fruit; do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles? Theſe are the very characters whom Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt repreſents as ſhutting up heaven againſt men; they will not go in themſelves, and thoſe who would go in they hinder; who devour window's hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and for a preſence make long prayers; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs ſea and land to make one proſelyte, and when he is made, make him two-fold more the child of hell than he was before. How oppoſite is this to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025603_0020_0FCDEF7FB3FFF360"/>
the character of a Chriſtian, who always endeavors to deal juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God; who performs all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs: full of pity and compaſſion to all men, and loves the brethren that all men may know that he is Chriſt's diſciple indeed and in truth, fulfilling the very laſt point; "ſon (as the apoſtle James ſays, ii.10.) whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all." To keep the whole law, that is, the code of moral laws, and yet break one of thoſe laws, is a contradiction in terms: for if the whole were kept, no one could be broken.</p>
            <p>A young man came to Jeſus Chriſt in his day, and aſked him what he ſhould do to inherit eternal life: he anſwered keep the commandments, and told him which they were, that is, thou ſhaft do no murder, nor commit adultery, nor ſteal, nor bear falſe witneſs, but honor thy father and mother, and love thy neighbor as thyſelf. All theſe (ſays the young man) I have kept from my youth up, what lack I yet? If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all that thou haſt, and give to the poor: that is, as if he had ſaid, thou haſt abundance of this world's goods, therefore thou oughteſt to be more charitable to the poor and diſtreſſed, this is one thing needful. And the apoſtle ſays, "though I ſpeak with the tongues of men, or of angels, and have not charity, I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſounding braſs or a tinkling cymbal: and though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I beſtow all goods to the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity ſuffereth long and is kind, charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave itſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily PROVOKED, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they ſhall fail; whether there be tongues, they ſhall ceaſe; whether there be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it ſhall vaniſh away. When I was a child, I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, theſe three; but the greateſt of theſe is charity." This is the one point, which if any man neglect to keep, he is verily guilty of offending againſt the moſt important command contained in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

I ſhall now give you by way of concluſion a ſhort ſchedule of the introduction of creeds into the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church; for in the days of Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles, there was no creed required of Chriſtians except "believe in God, believe alſo in me," that is, Jeſus Chriſt, "Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhall be ſaved;" but they were cautioned not to believe every ſpirit, but to <hi>try</hi> the ſpirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were of God; becauſe many falſe prophets had gone out into the world; and they were told how they ſhould know the true ſpirit from the falſe ones; that is, "every ſpirit that confeſseth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is come in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> is of God." Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, Emperor of Rome, about three hundred years after Chriſt, having ſome remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for ſome enormities he had committed, applied to the prieſts of the church of Ceres (then a heathen Church) for a pardon: They knowing his crimes, refuſed to grant his requeſt. He took umbrage at their refuſal, and immediately applied to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Biſhops, who embraced the favorable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and told him, they would grant his requeſt — provided he would confeſs his faults, and take the Chriſtian religion under his protection. He accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their propoſition, made a confeſſion, received his pardon, and then iſſued a decree in favour of the Chriſtian religion, declaring it to be the religion of his empire. Soon after, in order to eſtabliſh a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in religious matters, he called a council of the clergy to aſſemble at Nice, in which he attended himſelf, and after long altercations they brought forth what is now called the Athanaſian creed; tho' a number of the clergy then diſſented, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who complied, and ſubſcribed the creed for the ſake of conformity, went home, explained away the rigor of it, and taught their people a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

doctrine.—This incorporation of the civil and eccleſiaſtical authorities has been the cauſe of oceans of blood being ſpilt in the Chriſtian world, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to revenge private piques, and party quarrels, each party being always dubbed by the other with the title of <hi>Heretic.</hi> For near ten centuries after this incorporation, to keep the people in ignorance, this Bible was printed in a language unknown to the common people, as it is this day in Roman catholic countries, ſo that the people were under the neceſſity of taking their creed from the literati. About four hundred and forty years ago, it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> in England in the vulgar tongue, but ſtill under the ſuperintendency of theſe literati, and the leaſt devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from their conſtruction was deemed heretical and dangerous to the lives and properties of thoſe who dared to think for themſelves: witneſs, John Rogers and thouſands of others. But thanks be to God who has given us, the Inhabitants of theſe U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and my earneſt prayer is, that his word may have free courſe, run and be glorified.</p>
            <p>To ſum up the whole matter, muſt we not all judge of every thing, according to ſuch powers and faculties as God has given us? Can there be two Supremes? Can any being <hi>derived</hi> be <hi>underived?</hi> Can any being <hi>begotten</hi> be <hi>unbegotten?</hi> Can any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>proceeding from</hi> the firſt cauſe, <hi>be the firſt cauſe?</hi> Was there any equivocation or exception in Peter's addreſs, when he ſaid, Acts x. 34. "of a truth I perceive, that God is no reſpector of perſons, but in every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall be accepted with him?" Is it not neceſſary for every Chriſtian to endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct himſelf agreeable to the precepts and examples of Jeſus Chriſt, the great author of the Goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation?

Does any man who (knowingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) lives in open violation of any known command of Jeſus Chriſt, deſerve the name of a Chriſtian? Do not all Chriſtians aim at the fame thing, <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs?</hi> Did not the apoſtles always endeavor to keep a good underſtanding between the Jewiſh and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Chriſtians? Is it not the duty of every man to read his Bible? Has not every man a right to <hi>think</hi> upon what he reads? Have I not as good a right to <hi>think</hi> on what I read and tell <hi>my thoughts</hi> as any other man? Can any of you, my brethren, put yourſelf in my ſituation (willing, nay deſirous, to keep fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with thoſe of a different perſuaſion in ſome points, which are univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be myſterious,) lay your hand on your heart and condemn yourſelf? "Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them; this is the law and the prophets."</p>
            <p>Upon which Dr. Hemmenway, at the requeſt of Deacon Wingate, made ſome curſory obſervations; and then the Church paſſed the following votes:</p>
            <p>1ſt. "That it appears to the Church that brother Hill has profeſſed and declared his opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon of our bleſſed Saviour in the manner charged in the complaint."</p>
            <p>2d. "That the tenet abovementioned is in their judgment falſe and unſound, repugnant to doctrine taught in the ſacred Scriptures, ſubverſive of the Chriſtian religion, as taught, profeſſed, and believed in the proteſtant reformed Churches, and in this Church in particular; that it is derogatory to the dignity and honor which is to be aſcribed to our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Redeemer; and that for any one to hold forth and propagate ſuch ſentiments is matter of juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Church, tending to diſturb and deſtroy

the comfort, peace and edification of the Church, and corrupt the doctrine of faith which is the Bond of Chriſtian communion, and the church think it their duty to give their teſtimony againſt it: but as brother Hill profeſſes his ſerious and hearty belief of the Chriſtian religion as contained in the ſacred Scriptures, and his readineſs to receive any farther light which may be offered to him from the word of God, charity diſpoſes to hope and preſume that he is not confirmed and obſtinate in his miſtakes, but that upon better conſideration he will ſee reaſon to purge out that unſavory leaven, which gives offence to ſo many ſerious Chriſtians: and it is our deſire, in conformity to the Rules of the Goſpel, to reſtore an offending brother in the ſpirit of meekneſs, and heal his wound with a tender hand: we do now ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhort him humbly and prayerfully to ſearch the Scriptures, to ſearch his own heart, and keep his mind open to conviction, to guard againſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and not think it any diſhonor to give up any miſtakes which he may have unwarily entertained, and it is our hearty deſire and prayer that he and we may be guided and kept in the way of truth, and that our contending for the faith delivered to the Saints may be conducted with charity and patience; that we may beware of the devices of Satan and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the things which make peace and whereby one may edify another."</p>
            <p>Then Mr. Hill, at the requeſt of a number of his friends, and not being anxious to proſecute matters of this kind, withdrew his complaint againſt Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Wingate.</p>
            <p>The Church meeting was then diſſolved.</p>
