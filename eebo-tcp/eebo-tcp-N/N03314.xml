            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Capt. STANDISH was of a lower Stature, but of such a daring and active Genius, that even before the Arrival of the <hi>Massachusetts Colony,</hi>He spread a Terror over all the Tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> round about him, from the <hi>Massachusetts</hi> to <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi>&amp; from<hi>Cape-CodHar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to Narragansett.</hi> Capt.

            <p>Capt. MASON, the Writer of the following History, in which He was a principal Actor, as Chief Commander of the <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces, is said to have been a Relative of Mr. <hi>John Mason</hi> the ancient <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pequot War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it being above <hi>Threescore Years</hi> since the following Narrative was Written, near <hi>an Hundred</hi> since the Events therein related, and the State of the <hi>New England Colonies</hi> being long since greatly Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it seems needful for the present Readers clearer Apprehension of these Matters, to Observe—That in the Year 1633,&amp; 1634, several <hi>Englishmen</hi> arriving from <hi>England,</hi> at the <hi>Massachusetts,</hi> went up in the Western Country to discover <hi>Connecticut River;</hi> the <hi>next Year</hi> began to remove thither: and by the Beginning of 1637, <hi>Hartford, Windsor</hi> and <hi>Weathersfield</hi> were Settled, besides a <hi>Fortification</hi> built at <hi>Saybrook</hi> on the Mouth of the River.</p>
            <p>At that Time there were especially <hi>three</hi> powerful and warlike <hi>Nations</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>South Western</hi> Parts of <hi>New-England;</hi> which

The PEQUOTS reached from thence Westward to <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> and over it, as far as <hi>Branford,</hi> if not <hi>Quinnepiack;</hi> their Head Sachem being SASSACUS. And the MOHEGANS spread along from the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansetts</hi> thro' the Inland Country, on the Back or Northerly Side of the <hi>Pequots,</hi> between <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Nipmucks;</hi> their Head Sachem being UNCAS.</p>
            <p>The most terrible of all those Nations were then the PEQUOTS; who with their <hi>depending Tribes</hi> soon entered on a Resolution to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the <hi>English</hi> out of the Country. In 1634, they killed Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> and all his Company, being <hi>seven</hi> besides Himself, in &amp; near his Bark on <hi>Connecticut River.</hi> In 1635, they killed Capt. <hi>Oldham</hi> in his Bark at <hi>Block-Island;</hi> and at <hi>Long-Island</hi> they killed <hi>two</hi> more cast away there. In 1636, and the following <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> they killed <hi>six</hi> &amp; took <hi>seven</hi> more at <hi>Connecticut River:</hi> Those they took alive they tortured to Death in a most barbarous Manner.

            </p>
            <p>They had earnestly solicited the <hi>Narragansetts</hi> to engage in their Confederacy: very politickly representing to them, <hi>That if they shou'd help or suffer the</hi> English <hi>to subdue the</hi> Pequots, <hi>they wou'd thereby make Way for their own future Ruin; and that they need not come to open Battle with the</hi> English; <hi>only Fire our Houses, kill our Cattle,lye in Ambush and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>g entertained us in an amicable Manner: And tho' both by <hi>his Father and Mother</hi> He derived from the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> of the <hi>Pequots,</hi> and had Married the <hi>Daughter</hi> of TATOBAM their then late Sachim; yet such was his Affection for us, as he faithfully adhered to us, ventured his Life in our Service, assisted at the Taking their <hi>Fort,</hi> when about <hi>Seven Hundred</hi> of them were Destroyed, and thereupon in subduing and driving out of the Country the remaining greater Part of that fierce and dangerous Nation.</p>
            <p>Soon after the War, Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> was by the Government of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> made the <hi>Major General</hi> of all their Forces, and so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Day of his Death: The Rev. Mr. HOOKER of <hi>Hartford,</hi> being desired by the Government in their Name to deliver <hi>the Staff</hi> into his Hand; We may imagin he did it with that superiour Piety, Spirit and Majesty, which were peculiar to him: Like an ancient Prophet addressing himself to the Military Officer, delivering to him the Principal Ensign of Martial Power, to Lead the Armies &amp; Fight the Battles of the LORD and of <hi>his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Major <hi>Mason</hi> having been trained up in the <hi>Netherland War</hi> under Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX; when the Struggle arose in <hi>England</hi> between K. <hi>Charles</hi> I and the <hi>Parliament</hi> about the Royal Powers and the National Liberties; <hi>that Famous General</hi> had such an Esteem for the <hi>Major's</hi> Conduct and Bravery, that <hi>He</hi> wrote to the <hi>Major</hi> to come over and help <hi>Him.</hi> But the <hi>Major</hi> excusing himself, continued in this Country as long as he lived, and had some of the greatest Honours his <hi>Colony</hi> cou'd yield him.</p>
            <p>For besides his Office of <hi>Major General,</hi> the Colony in <hi>May</hi> 1660 chose him their DEPUTY GOVERNOUR; continued him in the same Post by annual Re-elections, by virtue of their first Constitution to 1662 inclusively. The <hi>same Year</hi> K. CHARLES II. comprehending the <hi>Colonies</hi> of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New Haven</hi> in <hi>One Government</hi> by the Name of CONNECTICUT COLONY; He in the <hi>Royal Charter,</hi> signed <hi>April</hi> 23, appointed Major <hi>Mason</hi> their first <hi>Deputy Governour</hi> till the <hi>second Thursday</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following: After which, the <hi>General Court</hi> being left to ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>After the <hi>Pequot War,</hi> he had removed from <hi>Windsor</hi> to <hi>Saybrook:</hi> But in 1659, he removed thence to <hi>Norwich;</hi> where he <hi>Died</hi> in 1672,

            <head>SOME Grounds of the War Against the Pequots.</head>
            <p>ABOUT the Year 1632 one Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> Arrived in the <hi>Massachusett</hi> in a <hi>Ship</hi> from <hi>Virginia;</hi> who shortly after was bound for <hi>Virginia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a small <hi>Bark</hi> with one Capt. <hi>Norton;</hi> who sailing into CONNECTICUT RIVER a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>two Leagues</hi> from the <hi>Entrance</hi> cast An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; there coming to them several <hi>Indians</hi> belonging to that Place whom the <hi>Pequots</hi> Tyrannized over, being a potent and warlike People, it being their Custom so to deal with their neighbour Indians; Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some occasion with the <hi>Dutch</hi> who lived at a trading House near <hi>twenty Leagues</hi> up the River, procured some of those <hi>Indians</hi> to go as Pilots with <hi>two</hi> of his Men to the <hi>Dutch:</hi> But being benighted before they could come to their desired Port, put the <hi>Skiff</hi> in which they went, ashore, where the <hi>two Englishmen</hi> falling asleep, were both Murdered by their <hi>Indian</hi> Guide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with the <hi>Bark</hi> about <hi>twelve</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>Indians;</hi> who had in all probability formerly plotted their bloody Design; and waiting an opportunity when some of the <hi>English</hi> were on

               <hi>Stone</hi> asleep in his Cabbin, set upon them and cruelly Murdered every one of them, plundered what they pleased and sunk the Bark.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Indians</hi> were not <hi>native Pequots,</hi> but had frequent recourse unto them, to whom they tendered some of those Goods, which were accepted by the <hi>Chief Sachem</hi> of the <hi>Pequots:</hi> Other of the said Goods were tendered to NYNIGRETT <hi>Sachem</hi> of <hi>Nayanticke,</hi> who also received them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Massachusetts</hi> being informed of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, sent to speak with the <hi>Pequots,</hi> and had some Treaties with them. But being unsatisfied therewith, sent forth Captain <hi>John Endicot</hi> Commander in Chief, with Capt. <hi>Underhill,</hi> Captain <hi>Turner,</hi> and with them <hi>one hundred and twenty Men;</hi> who were firstly designed on a Service against a People living on <hi>Block Island,</hi> who were subject to the <hi>Narragansett Sachem;</hi> they having taken a <hi>Bark</hi> of one Mr. <hi>John Oldham,</hi> Murdering him and all his Company: They were also to call the <hi>Pequots</hi> to an Account about the Murder of Capt. <hi>Stone;</hi> who arriving at <hi>Pequot</hi> had some Conference with them; but little effected; only one <hi>Indian</hi> slain and some <hi>Wigwams</hi> burnt. After which, the <hi>Pequots</hi> grew inraged against the <hi>English</hi> who inhabited CONECTICOT, being but a small Number, about <hi>two hundred and fifty,</hi> who were there newly arrived; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as also about <hi>twenty Men</hi> at SAYBROOK, under the Command of Lieutenant <hi>Lyon Gardner,</hi> who was there settled by several Lords and Gentlemen in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Pequots</hi> falling violently upon them, slew diverse Men at <hi>Saybrook;</hi> keeping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a constant Siege upon the Place; so that the <hi>English</hi> were constrained to keep within their pallizado <hi>Fort;</hi> being so hard Beset and sometimes Assaulted, that Capt. <hi>John Mason</hi> was sent by <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> with <hi>twenty Men</hi> out of their small Numbers to secure the Place: But after his coming, there did not one <hi>Pequot</hi> appear in view for one <hi>Month</hi> Space, which was the time he there remained.</p>
            <p>In the Interim certain <hi>Pequots</hi> about <hi>One Hundred</hi> going to a Place called <hi>Weathersfield</hi> on <hi>Connecticut;</hi> having formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with the <hi>Indians</hi> of that Place (as it was generally thought) lay in Ambush for the <hi>English;</hi> divers of them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a large Field adjoyning to the Town to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At their Return from <hi>Weathersfield,</hi> they came down the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Connecticut</hi> (Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> being then at <hi>Saybrook Fort</hi>) in <hi>three Canoes</hi> with about <hi>one hundred Men,</hi> which River of necessity they must pass: We espying them, concluded they had been acting some Mischief against us, made a Shot at them with a Piece of Ordnance, which beat off the Beak Head of one of their <hi>Canoes,</hi> wherein our <hi>two Captives</hi> were: it was at a very great distance: They then hastened, drew their <hi>Canoes</hi> over a narrow Beach with all speed and so got away.</p>

proved very successful as the Sequel may evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</p>
            <p>But yet for all this, <hi>our Counsel</hi> all of them except the <hi>Captain</hi> we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to land our Men in <hi>Pequot River;</hi> we had also the same Order by a Letter of Instruction sent us to <hi>Saybrook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> apprehending an exceeding great Hazard in so doing, for the Reasons fore mentioned, as also some other which I shall forbear to trouble you with, did therefore earnestly desire Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> that he would commend our Condition to the LORD, <hi>that Night,</hi>to direct how in what manner we should demean our selves in that Respect; He being our <hi>Chaplin</hi> and lying aboard our <hi>Pink,</hi> the Captain on shoar. In the <hi>Morning</hi> very early Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> came ashoar to the Captain's Chamber, and told him, he had done as he had desired, and was fully satisfied to sail for <hi>Narragansett.</hi> Our Council was then called, and the several Reasons alledged: In fine we all agreed with one accord to sail for <hi>Narragansett,</hi> which the <hi>next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> we put in Execution.</p>
            <p>I declare not this to encourage any Soldiers to Act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Commission, or contrary to it; for in so doing they run a double Hazard. There was a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in <hi>Belgia</hi> who did the <hi>States</hi> great Service in taking a City; but by going beyond his Commission lost his Life: His name was <hi>Grubb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nk.</hi> But if a War be Managed duly by Judgment and Discretion as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit, the Shews are many times contrary to what they seem to pursue: Wherefore the more an Enterprize is dissembled and kept secret, the more sacil to put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; as the Proverb, <hi>The farthest way about is sometimes the nearest way home.</hi> I shall make bold to present this as my present Thoughts in this Case; In Matters of War, those who are both able and faithful should be improved; and then bind them not up into too narrow a Compass:
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004033_0021_1003CDEB028D1F38"/>
For it is not possible for the wisest and ablest Senator to foresee all Accidents and Occurrents that fall out in the Management and Pursuit of a War: Nay although possibly he might be trained up in Military Affairs; and truly much less can he have any great Knowledge who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And after we had refreshed our selves with our mean Commons, we Marched about <hi>three Miles,</hi> and came to a <hi>Field</hi> which had lately been planted with <hi>Indian Corn:</hi> There we made another <hi>Alt,</hi> and called our Council, supposing we drew near to the Enemy: And being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Indians</hi> that the Enemy had <hi>two Forts</hi> almost impregnable; but we were not at all Discouraged, but rather Animated, in so much that we were resolved to Assault both their Forts at once.

            </p>
            <p>Thus were they now at their Wits End, who not many Hours before exalted themselves in their great Pride, threatning and resolving the utter Ruin and Destruction of all the <hi>English,</hi>

            <p>And here we may see the just Judgment of GOD, in sending even the very <hi>Night before</hi> this Assault, <hi>One hundred and fifty Men</hi> from their other <hi>Fort,</hi> to join with them of that Place, who were designed as some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reported to go forth against the <hi>English,</hi> at that very Instant when this heavy Stroak came upon them, where they perished with their Fellows.

            <p>Which <hi>Connecticut</hi> taking into Consideration, and well weighing the several Inconveniences that might ensue; for the Prevention whereof, they sent out <hi>forty Men</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi>John Mason,</hi> to supplant them, by burning their <hi>Wigwams,</hi> and bringing away their Corn, except they would desert the Place: ONKOS with about <hi>One Hundred of his Men</hi> in <hi>twenty Canoes,</hi> going also to assist in the Service. As we sailed into <hi>Pawcatuck-Bay</hi> We met with <hi>three</hi> of those <hi>Indians,</hi> whom we sent to inform the rest with the end of our coming, and also that we desired to speak with some of them: They promised speedily to return us an Answer, but never came to us more.</p>
            <p>We run our <hi>Vessel</hi> up into a <hi>small River,</hi> and by reason of Flatts were forced to land on the <hi>West Side;</hi> their <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams</hi> being on the <hi>East</hi> just opposite, where we could see the <hi>Indians</hi> running up and down Jeering of us.

            <p>We were so suddenly upon them that they had not time to convey away their Goods: We viewed their Corn,

Only <hi>seven</hi> of them who were NYNIGRETT'S <hi>Men,</hi> were taken. Some of them growing very outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whom we intended to have made shorter by the Head; and being about to put it in Execution; one <hi>Otash</hi> a Sachem of <hi>Narragansett,</hi> Brother to MYANTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIMO stepping forth, told the <hi>Captain, They were his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Men, and that he was a Friend to the</hi> English, <hi>and if we would spare their Lives we should have as many Murtherers Heads in lieu of them which should be delivered to the</hi> English. We considering that there was no Blood shed as yet, and that it tended to Peace and Mercy, granted his Desire; and so delivered them to ONKOS to secure them until his Engagement was performed, because our <hi>Prison</hi> had been very much pestered with such Creatures.</p>
            <p>We then drew our <hi>Bark</hi> into a <hi>Creek,</hi> the better to defend her; for there were <hi>many Hundreds</hi> within <hi>five Miles</hi> waiting upon us. There we Quartered <hi>that Night:</hi> In the <hi>Morning</hi> as soon as it was Light, there appeared in Arms at least <hi>Three Hundred Indians</hi> on the other Side the <hi>Creek:</hi> Upon which we stood to our Arms; which they perceiving, some of them fled, others crept behind the Rocks and Trees, not one of them to be seen. We then called to them, saying, <hi>We desired to speak with them,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004033_0037_1003CE1093F58710"/>
and that we would down our Arms for that end:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they stood up: We then informed them, <hi>That the Pequots had violated their Promise with the</hi> English, <hi>in that they were not there to inhabit, and that we were sent to supplant them:</hi> They answered saying, <hi>The</hi> Pequots <hi>were good Men, their Friends, and they would Fight for them, and protect them:</hi> At which we were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moved, and told them, <hi>It was not far to the Head of the</hi> Creek <hi>where we would meet them, and then they might try what they could do in that Respect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then replyed, <hi>That they would not Fight with</hi> ENGLISH MEN, <hi>for they were</hi> SPIRITS, <hi>but would Fight with</hi> ONKOS. We replyed, <hi>That we thought it was too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We then loaded our <hi>Bark</hi> with Corn; and our <hi>Indians</hi> their <hi>Canoes:</hi> And <hi>thirty</hi> more which we had taken with Kittles, Trays, Matts, and other <hi>Indian</hi> Luggage. That <hi>Night</hi> we went all aboard, &amp; set Sail homeward: It pleased GOD in a short Time to bring us all in safety to the Place of our Abode; although we strook and stuck upon a Rock. The Way and Manner how GOD dealt with us in our Delivery was very Remarkable: The Story would be somewhat long to trouble you with at this time; and therefore I shall forbear.</p>
            <p>Thus we may see, <hi>How the Face of</hi> GOD <hi>is set against them that do Evil, to cut off the Remembrance of them from
