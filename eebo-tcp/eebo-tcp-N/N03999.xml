            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth: I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</q> Yea, Chriſt had the Spirit more abundantly than all others, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. <q>For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him.</q> All Believers are anointed of God, have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpiritual and holy Unction in ſome meaſure of ſanctifying-grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <q>Now he which eſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God.</q> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. <q>But ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all things. Ver. 27. But the anointing which we have received of him, abideth in you; and ye need not that any Man ſhould teach you,</q> [the Grounds of Religion which ye have already learned, or any new Doctrines which ye have not already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived]

but as the ſame anointing teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you of all things</q> (needful to be known in order to ſalvation, or to preſerve you from being deceived or drawn away by falſe Teachers) <q>and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides this anointing common to all God's people, there is a more ſpecial Unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby certain perſons choſen and called of God to holy employment eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, are fitted and qualified with Gifts and graces for the better diſcharge of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in former times typified by material Unctions, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.12. <q>And be poured of the anointing oyl upon <hi>Aaron's</hi> head, and anointed him to ſanctifie him.</q> But Chriſt was anointed in a more large manner and fuller meaſure than any other, being choſen and called and appointed by God to the office of Mediator betwixt God and Man, which no other was capable of or fitted for, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.7.— <q>therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs above thy fellows.</q> Chriſt had a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of abundance, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. <q>In whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge. Ver. 9. For in him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q> And Chriſt had a fulneſs of Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004934_0004_100E32BDCC734568"/>
that floweth over unto his People. Like the ointment upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that ran down to the ſkirts of his garments, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 133.25. ſo there is a conveyance of grace and ſpiritual gifts from Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his members, who is like a fountain, that though it over-flows, yet ever-flows; ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth its ſtreams, and yet is full ſtill, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <q>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</q> 
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <q>And of his fulneſs have all we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and grace for grace.</q> As from the fulneſs of ſin in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> we have all received ſin for ſin; ſo from the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace in Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> all God's people receive grace for grace.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt was thus anointed <hi>[to preach good tidings to the Meek.]</hi> When man had ſinned ſad tidings were brought unto him, <hi>curſed is the ground for thy ſake,</hi> tidings of toyl and labour, tidings of Death, and of the evils contained in the threatning, tidings of wrath and ſore diſpleaſure from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God. Yet God himſelf did preach the firſt tidings of a Saviour to loſt man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. When the Lord ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that becauſe they were a ſtiff necked people, he would come into the midſt of them, and conſume them; theſe were evil tidings, and cauſe

of mourning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4. The Prophet was ſent to the Wife of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> with heavy tidings, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.6. But when man was in a loſt condition, the diſcoveries of a Saviour were the beſt and gladdeſt tidings that could be brought unto him. If God had ſaid to man, <q>I will make thee rich but I will not forgive thy ſins; thou ſhalt live long in the world, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally with me in heaven; thou ſhalt live on earth all thy days in eaſe and pleaſure, but after death in pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</q> theſe would have been heavy tidings. But for God to ſay and ſend to loſt man this news, thou haſt undone thy ſelf, but I will help thee; thou haſt loſt thy ſoul, thy God, thy happineſs, but I will reſtore thee, I will give and ſend my Son to ſeek and to ſave loſt ſinners; was not this joyful tidings? God ſent his Prophets to publiſh theſe tidings to the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7. And Apoſtles came with theſe glad tidings, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.32. And Angels, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10. <q>The Angel ſaid, fear not, behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all the people.</q> But theſe tidings were not only brought by Prophets, Apoſtles, and Angels, but by Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.1. <q>He went through every Village and City,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004934_0005_100E32C0F0775D28"/>
preaching and ſhewing the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God. <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> he is a good man, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good tidings,</q> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.27. But Chriſt, we may ſay, is a good Saviour, and bringeth good, the beſt tidings that ever were reported to the children of men. And when Chriſt, returned to heaven, he hath given commiſſion to his Miniſters to preach and publiſh the ſame tidings. As <hi>Cuſhi</hi> ſaid running in haſte, tidings my Lord the King, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.31; ſo we come to poor ſinners ſaying, <hi>tydings</hi> to you poor periſhing ſinners, <hi>tidings, tidings</hi> from God, <hi>tidings</hi> from heaven, what? what art they? are they glad tidings? may ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners expect any glad tidings? Tell us, oh tell us, what are theſe tidings that you bring? What are they? <q>Chriſt a Saviour for loſt ſinners. Chriſt a Phyſitian for ſick and wounded ſinners. Pardon for the guilty ſinner. Peace for the troubled ſinner; Life to the condemned ſinner; Heaven for the Hell-deſerving Sinner.</q> Theſe, theſe are tidings that are brought unto you! <q>Oh how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things,</q> 
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. But do you bring theſe tidings to great ſinners of a Scarlet dye? Yes, if you
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004934_0005_100E32C0F0775D28"/>
do repent, and turn to God, and accept of Chriſt upon Goſpel terms for Lord and Saviour, here are tidings in the Goſpel brought by Chriſt himſelf of Pardon and ſalvation, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. But what if we do not, hath Chriſt brought any ſad and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy tidings; Yes verily, as you may read <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <q>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</q> It was ſad tidings when news was brought that the <hi>Ark</hi> was loſt 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.19. But oh, what heavy ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings will it be to the refuſers of mercy, to the ſlighters of Chriſt and his grace, when it ſhall be told them; Now your Souls are for ever loſt, and God and Chriſt is for ever loſt, and heaven's happineſs is for ever loſt. In a word, Chriſt came principally to preach good tidings to poor ſinners; but yet he bringeth alſo terrible ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the impenitent and unbelieving.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He hath ſent me to bind up the broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted.</hi>] When man by ſin had broke Covenant with God, he broke the peace with God, and all mankind did break in <hi>Adam,</hi> and proved Bankrupts, and though all are broken by ſin, yet few are broken for ſin; all of us put up <hi>broken duties,</hi> but few of us have <hi>broken hearts;</hi> many are broken in their eſtates through proverty, and many mens bodies are broken through
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004934_0006_100E32C3F3871DC8"/>
age and ſickneſs, but yet their hearts do not break for their ſin. But this is the comfort of broken-hearted ſinners, that Chriſt himſelf was ſent to bind you up, to dreſs and to heal your wounded broken hearts. Chyrurgions may ſet and bind, broken and diſ-jointed bones, but Chriſt alone can ſet, and bind, and give eaſe to broken hearts. When by ſinning thou doſt break the commands of God, he is highly offended and provoked, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.30. <q>But the ſoul that doth ought preſumptuouſly,—the ſame reproacheth the Lord; and that ſoul ſhall be cut off from among his people. 31. Becauſe he hath deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the word of the Lord, and hath broken his Commandment, that ſoul ſhall be utterly cut off, his iniquity ſhall be upon him.</q> But when by ſorrowing and repenting thy heart is broken becauſe thou haſt broken the command of God, he is well-pleaſed with thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. <q>The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God thou will not deſpiſe.</q> When thou didſt break the command of God, thou didſt diſpiſe God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9. But when thy heart is broken from thy ſin, God will not deſpiſe thy broken-heart, but God himſelf will come and bind and heal thee,

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.18. The ſum of all is this, if thou be broken for thy ſins, thou ſhalt not dye of the wounds by ſin made in thy Soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To proclaim liberty to the Captives and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound.</hi>] This might partly refer to the temporal deliverance by <hi>Cyrus</hi> from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; but chiefly denotes the ſpiritual freedom from the bondage and thraldom of Satan and ſin by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words you may obſerve</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A choice and precious priviledge.</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and thraldom is a ſore evil, liberty as great a good; but the ſpiritual bondage and ſlavery of the Soul to Satan and to ſin, is far worſe than corporal bondage, than Turkiſh ſlavery; therefore ſpiritual liberty by Chriſt is far beyond (in its excellency and deſirableneſs) any outward deliverance from bodily bondage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Perſons that this priviledge is for.</hi> For thoſe that are Captives. The bleſſings and priviledges that ſinners have by Chriſt are ſuitable to their neceſſity, reſtoring of ſight to the blind, limbs to the lame, health to the ſick, eaſe to the pained, and liberty
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004934_0007_100E32C5AEEAA2A8"/>
to the Captive, are all ſeaſonable and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The publiſhing, declaring, and making of it known,</hi> by way of proclamation. The great God that might have kept ſinners in bonds for ever, and in priſon for ever; doth paſs an act of grace, and ſent his own Son into the World, to proclaim liberty to ſpiritual bond-men; proclamation hath been made by Chriſt himſelf, that priſoners may be releaſed, that thoſe that are bound in Chains may have their fetters knocked off, and ſuch as have been taken Captive by the Devil, the common enemy of man's ſalvation may be ſet at Liberty; and the Miniſters of the Goſpel are given by Chriſt, and ſent by him as the <hi>Heralds</hi> of the great King of Heaven and Earth, to proclaim pardon to the penitent, healing to the Wounded, eaſe to the burdened, liberty to the captives: This Chriſt did in perſon in the days of his fleſh upon earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37; and now the Miniſters of Chriſt do proclaim the ſame things in Chriſt's ſtead, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 18, 19, 20, <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> put forth a proclamation throughout all his Kingdom to give liberty to the captive <hi>Jews,</hi> to go back unto <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> to build the Houſe of the Lord, ſaying, <q>Who is there among you of all his people,

people, the Lord his God be with him, and let him go up,</q> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.22, 23. So the Lord, the King of Nations, hath made a proclamation, and put it in writing, and commands his Servants to go up and proclaim, <q>Return, ye ſinners unto me, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord God, and I will not keep anger for ever, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12.</q> I might be angry with you, as long as I am God; but if you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn, I will not. I might pour out my wrath upon you for ever; but if you will forſake your wicked ways, <q>Iniquity ſhall not be your ruin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.</q> Who is there among you, that are weary of the ſervice of ſin? you Might be received into better ſervice, and have a better reward. Who is there among you, that are weary of your Chains and Fetters? be but willing and you ſhall be freed from them. Who is there among you, that hath lain long in the Goal of Satan, in the filthy darkſom dungeon of an unconverted ſtate? behold Chriſt is come to open the priſon doors; Go ye forth, come away, ſinners, come away, not only one by one, which yet would be matter of joy, to ſee one one Lord's day, and another on another Lord's day to come out of priſon;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004934_0008_100E32C892A4B480"/>
but ſince the priſon doors are open, and Chriſt is come to knock off your fetters, come, come away by companies; come, come away in numbers; come, who ſteps out of this priſon firſt? who would not? Methinks, I ſee one, he is loth to come forth; and another he regards it not. What ails you Sirs? Is a priſon delightful? Are bonds pleaſant? is a dungeon ſo delicate, that you are loth to leave it? What ails you? ſinner! Art thou thy ſelf thine own man? Art thou in thy Wits? Thou art worſe than mad, that wilt not put off Chains of Iron, for Chains of Gold; that wilt not leave a Priſon for a Palace; thick darkneſs for marvelous, glorious, ſhining light. Do you think, if all the priſon doors in the Land were opened, and Proclamation made, that whoſoever would, might have free liberty to go forth, that any would remain therein? Oh, why then are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils priſoners, and thoſe that are captives to their luſts, the only Perſons that like and love their Bondage? that might have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, but will not? But give thy ſelf the Labour to hear what ſhall be ſaid of the miſerable condition of theſe Captives, and afterwards I hope thou wilt be more wiſe nor thy ſelf, for thy Soul, than to refuſe ſpiritual freedom, and chuſe thy Chains and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                        <hi>I. Doct</hi> UNconverted men are the Devil's Captives, being faſt bound with the chains and bonds of their own iniquity and ſin.</p>
                     <p>Preſently after the Creation of man, there was a ſpiritual war, conflict, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat betwixt man and the Devil, the place where this war began was Paradiſe, in which fight the Devil overcame, and did prevail, not only againſt our firſt Parents, but their poſterity alſo; then was man firſt carried captive, taken priſoner by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and doth remain ſo till he is reſcued, redeemed, and delivered by Jeſus Chriſt the Captain of our ſalvation. Thus wicked Men are ſaid to be <hi>taken captive by the Devil at his will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26; and keepeth them in a peaceable, quiet ſubjection to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21; and dwelleth, worketh, and ruleth in their hearts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.

                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> and the poor ſinner yieldeth obedience to him without oppoſition or reſiſtance. Thus
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004934_0009_100E32CC2AA75F60"/>
are they alſo ſaid to be <q>bound faſt in the bond of iniquity and ſin, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. <hi>and are</hi> the ſervants of ſin, and ſlaves to their own corruption and luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>and</hi> ſerve divers luſts, <hi>Tit</hi> 3.3. <hi>and are</hi> the ſervants of corruption,</q> who being overcome by Satan and by ſin, are brought into bondage by them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                     <p>In theſe particulars following, it will appear that unconverted graceleſs men are captives and bondmen to Satan and to ſin.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Captives and bondmen are diſarmed;</hi> their weapons and armour of defence are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, that they are not able to make reſiſtance againſt thoſe by whom they are taken captives and priſoners. Sirs, the enemies of your Souls are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Powerful enemies.</hi> Called Principalities and Powers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. compared to a Lion for their mighty ſtrength, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. And what is a naked and unarmed man againſt a powerful enemy?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Politick as well as powerful.</hi> Strength and ſtratagems, power and policy make an enemy very formidable. Hence Satan is compared to a Serpent for his ſubtilty and craft, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. and the old Serpent, that by the experience of many thouſand years hath obtained greater ſkill in his curſed art of tempting and deſtroying the Souls of men,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004934_0009_100E32CC2AA75F60"/>
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. And if he beguile our firſt Parents through his ſubtilty, when they were perfect in wiſdom and knowledge, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. Oh what danger is the Soul of a ſinner now in, when he is become not only weak, but fooliſh alſo? <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. The Devil hath a thouſand methods, and ſtratagems, and devices to entrap and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare your Souls, of which you read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The enemies of your ſouls are many and numerous.</hi> It is not one ſin, nor one temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor one Devil that do ſet themſelves to bring your Souls unto damnation; but many Devils, and many luſts againſt one poor unarmed ſinner; a whole Legion of Devils entered into one poor man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.30. So not one only, but many Devils might buſie themſelves to ruin and undo thy Soul.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The enemies of your ſouls are malicious as well as numerous.</hi> When the Devil was diſpoſſeſſed of his firſt eſtate, he envied the happineſs of man, and moſt maliciouſly ſet himſelf to endeavour that man might not for ever enjoy what he and his angels with him had for ever loſt. The Devil is often called the wicked one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. &amp; 5.18. But the original word ſignifieth ſomething more
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004934_0010_100E32D0EFB53608"/>
than barely wicked, a troubleſome one, or the malicious one, for the Devil through his malice is the troubler of men, being ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and deſirous to do men miſchief, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as to their Souls and everlaſting concerns.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The enemies of your ſouls are inviſible,</hi> becauſe they be ſpiritual wickedneſſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. An enemy not ſeen, nor diſcerned, is the more dangerous; that tempts you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes and you do not perceive him; that wounds you, but you do not diſcern him; ſetting upon thee ſecretly, becauſe inviſibly, before thou art aware of him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>They are indefatigable or unwearied ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> Satan hath been employed in this work of tempting and deſtroying Souls for ſome thouſand years, and yet he is not weary, ſo as to deſiſt, unto this day. This work he began but a very little after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, and this will he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly carry on to the end of the world; whilſt there are men out of Heaven and Hell, he will not leave off his ſoul-detroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtudy and endeavour; and when on earth he ſhall have no more to tempt, then ſhall he torment them for ever, that by temptations he hath got to hell; thus like a reſtleſs ſpirit he is alway <q>going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it;</q> going from one perſon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004934_0010_100E32D0EFB53608"/>
from one houſe to another, to and fro, backwards and forwards, up and down, here and there, as one that cannot be at quiet without his prey, <hi>Job</hi> 1.7. &amp; 2.2. <q>He walks about, ſeeking whom he might devour;</q> ſeeking not to devour Souls one by one, but if it may be by whole families, by whole Pariſhes, by whole Kingdoms and Nations; and ſo he doth too many in the World, where the Goſpel and a Saviour hath not been heard of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                     <p>Thus are graceleſs ſinners like a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of poor unarmed priſoners in the midſt of many malicious, powerful, and politick and unwearied enemies; that do deſign nothing leſs than the damnation of thy ſoul, the loſs, the eternal loſs of the bleſſed, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and eternal God, that deſign nothing leſs than to bring thee to a place of torment, to a fiery furnace, to a lake of brimſtone, to a place of utter darkneſs, where there ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, wo and lamentation, ſhriekings and howlings, and bitter cries for ever and ever. Oh how ſhould it pity us, to ſee theſe poor naked unarmed ſinners ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch mighty enemies, carrying them captives to a place of eternal ſeparation from God, and Chriſt, and Angels, and all the Saints of God; to ſee them going to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004934_0011_100E32D3F3C14480"/>
the ſlaughter-houſe of Hell, and to the place of dreadful execution.</p>
                     <p>Poor captivated ſouls! are you thus in the hands of your enemies, and not one piece of ſpiritual armour to ſafe-guard your ſelves? Captives lye at the mercy of thoſe whoſe ſlaves they be; but Satan hath no ſuch thing as mercy or pity to the ſouls of men; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice enough, but no mercy; cruelty enough, but no favour. If God ſhould have no mercy for you, the Devil will have none. Except the God of Mercy, and pity, and patience had reſtrained the enemies of your ſouls, they would have dragged you down to the bottomleſs pit long before this day. There is no armour of proof againſt thoſe that have taken you captive, but the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God: but this is your miſery, you have not one piece thereof, either the girdle of truth, nor the breaſt plate of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor the helmet of ſalvation; and though you may have the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the word of God in your hands, yet you know not how to uſe it againſt the aſſaults of your ſpiritual adverſaries. Think then of this, Captives are naked and unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Captives loſe the riches they had, when taken Captives.</hi> That though they were rich before, yet are made poor, and are ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004934_0011_100E32D3F3C14480"/>
of all. If a rich Merchant at Sea have many goods in a Ship, coſtly Jewels, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pearls, and be taken priſoner, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captive, he is ſpoiled of all, and loſeth all. Man at firſt was exceeding rich, rich in the knowledge of God, rich in love and likeneſs to God. The holineſs of man was his riches, the enjoyment of God was his riches, the ſpiritual endowments of man at firſt, were not to be valued with the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> with the precious <hi>Onyx</hi> or the <hi>Saphire;</hi> Gold and Chriſtal could not equal them, they were not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for Jewels of fine Gold, the <hi>Topaz</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> could not equal them, neither were they to be valued with pure Gold, Coral or Pearls were not worthy to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with them, for their price was above Rubies, as <hi>Job</hi> ſetteth forth the excellency of wiſdom, <hi>Job</hi> 28.15. to the 20th verſe. But when man was overcome by the Devil and taken captive by him, he was ſpoiled of all, all was taken from him, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came miſerably poor, loſt his knowledge of God, the image of God, the favour of God, communion with God, the gracious comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preſence of God, his abode in Paradiſe; and though before he was Lord of all, and had dominion over all inferior creatures; yet being captivated by the Devil, he loſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004934_0012_100E32D6CD00BC40"/>
his right to all, and was turned out of all. So it is with all unregenerate men, whatever be their outward riches and worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to ſpirituals they are miſerably poor, very beggars indeed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. the true riches they have not, ſuitable riches for their Souls they have not, durable riches they have not; no man is rich indeed, till he is good indeed and free indeed. God is the free-mans riches, Chriſt is the free-mans riches, the grace of the Spirit, the priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt, the promiſes of God, the treaſures laid up in heaven, theſe, theſe are the riches of redeemed perſons; but thoſe that ſtill remain captives and bond-ſlaves to Satan and to ſin, have no intereſt in them, no title to them.</p>
                     <p>If thou that readſt theſe lines be one of them, whatever be thy outward plenty and abundance, thou art wretchedly poor. Men ſay of a poor perſon, he is worth nothing; but we might truly ſay of theſe perſons, they are worth nothing, nay they are worſe than nothing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Captives are not governed by the ſame Laws as freemen are.</hi> Laws are made in favour for free ſubjects; but Laws for ſlaves and bondmen are more ſevere, and to make their yoke more heavy. Souls in ſpiritual bondage and captivity are not governed by
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004934_0012_100E32D6CD00BC40"/>
the Law of God, which is holy, juſt, and good, made in favour of, and for the good of the Lord's redeemed ones; but by the Laws of ſin and luſt, which are unjuſt, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, and tyrannical, and oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another, covetouſneſs impoſing one thing upon the ſinner, and prodigality the quite contrary. The Lord's ſpiritual freemen are under the Laws of God, but the Devils captives are under the Law of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Captives and bondmen are put to baſe employment;</hi> To toil and drudge, to dig in the Mine, to work at the Oar, very great and hard burdens are impoſed upon them. Thus it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the houſe of bondage, the taſkmaſters of <hi>Egypt</hi> denied them ſtraw, and yet required the full num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bricks, ſo laid hard ſervice upon them. But there is no work ſo vile and ſordid and baſe, as works of ſin; and yet it is the whole and only employment of ſpritual bond ſlaves, to pleaſe the fleſh and Devil, and gratifie their filthy luſts. What is baſer ſlavery than to lead a ſenſual fleſh-pleaſing life? What is more ſordid drudgery, than to be a ſervant of Satan and ſin? than to be under the commanding power of their own vile affections? to take pains to diſhonour God that made them? to work and labour to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004934_0013_100E32DAC5DA9C88"/>
undo themſelves, &amp; damn &amp; ruin their own immortal Souls? Whereas the work and employment of thoſe that are redeemed from their ſpiritual captivity, is the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, rational, high and honourable, the moſt delightful and profitable as any can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in on this ſide the everlaſting, full, and perfect ſtate of the Saints in glory; ſuch as is our <q>loving of God, converſing with the bleſſed glorious God, believing on Chriſt, applying of promiſes, living by faith, hoping, looking, longing for heaven, waiting for the glory that ſhall be revealed, and for the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our deſired and longed for Lord and Saviour, in getting aſſurance of his love, and ſolacing and delighting our ſouls with the comfort thereof when we have obtained it, in uſing utmoſt diligence to eſcape the damnation of hell, and the everlaſting torments to be endured by the Devils captives in the other endleſs world, and getting ſafe to heaven when we dye, in pleaſing God while we live.</q> Nay, the moſt diſpleaſing works to fleſh and blood are more delightful and ſweet than any, than all the pleaſures of ſin; as in <q>mourning for ſin, weeping bitterly for ſin, mortifying of ſin, praying againſt ſin, watching againſt ſin, combating and conflicting with ſin,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004934_0013_100E32DAC5DA9C88"/>
warring with Satan;</q> yea the very duty of ſelf-denial, moſt ungrateful to fleſh and blood, hath ſweetneſs in it, and bringeth in that peace of conſcience which ſurpaſſeth the choiceſt delights of the Devils bond-ſlaves.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Captives and bond-ſlaves meet with hard uſage in their hard work and baſe employment;</hi> many times are fed with bread and water, and that in ſmall allowance too, are whipt and beaten when they have put forth their ſtrength to do their utmoſt, they have ſtripes and blows inſtead of reward for what they do. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage was beaten when forced to gather ſtubble inſtead of ſtraw, could not bring in the full tale of bricks, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.14, 15, 16. So the Devil's captives that lay themſelves out moſt in the Devil's ſervice, ſhall have their wages; but what? plagues and puniſhments here and hereafter, laſhes, ſtripes and wounds. And that,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes from God in this world;</hi> they have puniſhments and judgments inflicted upon them by a juſt and righteous, angry God, who ſcourgeth them often in this life for their Sin, and plagueth them for their iniquity. So thoſe that are ſlaves unto their luſts are puniſhed with filthy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in their bodies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22. <q>He
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004934_0014_100E32DD92817CE0"/>
goeth after her <hi>(a whoriſh Woman)</hi> ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as an Ox goeth to the ſlaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the ſlocks. 23. Till a dart ſtrike through his liver, as a bird haſteth to the ſnare, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that it is for his life. 26. She hath caſt down many wounded; yea many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her. 27. Her houſe is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</q> And this you may too often ſee and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the Weekly Bills of Mortality, that theſe ſilly filthy ſlaves of luſt are rewarded with the loſs of life. So thoſe that are ſlaves to their ſenſitive appetite, and given to pleaſe their fleſh in exceſſive eating and drinking are brought to poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.21. and to death, digging their graves with their own teeth. And if they do eſcape outward judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on body and eſtate, yet they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Spiritual judgments on their Souls, as blindneſs of mind, hardneſs of heart, loſs of God's favour, under the reigning power of ſin, which are a thouſand times worſe than any bodily plagues, though leſs lamented.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes they have laſhes from their own Conſciences,</hi> being filled with inward gripes and pangs, with horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they are not able to bear, but cry out and roar, that they would rather die
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004934_0014_100E32DD92817CE0"/>
than live to feel theſe inward ſcourgings of their own Conſciences. Thoſe two ſlaves of Sin and captives of the Devil, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> when they had done the Devil's drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, the one in murdering of his Brother, the other in ſelling and betraying of his Lord, were ſo filled with inward terrors of Soul, that the one crieth out "My puniſhment is greater than I can bear," <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. and would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather be ſlain by any that ſhould meet him, than live to feel the terrors of his Conſcience; the other in the anguiſh of his heart confeſſed, "I have ſinned in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent blood"; and would rather hang himſelf and die by his own Hands, and be his own executioner, than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer what he felt in the accuſations of his Conſcience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3, 4, 5. thus theſe wretched ſlaves of Satan and Sin, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times filled with Helliſh ſorrows before they come to Hell; are not theſe then hard wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the works of Sin?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. At the laſt theſe Captives ſhall <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and eternally after death have harder wages and greater miſery than any in this life,</hi> from God, from Devils, and their own Conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>God ſhall pour out his wrath upon them;</hi> he ſhall ſupport them in their beings by his power, that they may not die under his heavy

hand, and ſhall plague and puniſh them by his Juſtice, with one hand, ſhall keep them from ſinking into nothing, and with the other ſhall inflict ſuch wrath upon them, that they would rather die than live to ſuffer and endure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Devil ſhall be Executioner of God's wrath;</hi> He that tempts them now ſhall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them then; he that ſets them now at work ſhall hereafter pay them their wages; the very company of the Devils ſhall afright them; and the preſence of ſo many Devils ſhall be no little torment to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Their own Conſciences when they come to Hell ſhall for ever vex and gnaw upon them;</hi> if now thy Conſcience be aſleep, and mercies do not waken it, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not waken it, and Miniſters cannot waken it, but thou ſinneſt, and Conſcience is ſilent; thou ſinneſt, and thy Friends reprove thee, and Miniſters reprove thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thy Conſcience doth not approve thee: but though nothing doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken thy Conſcience now, yet the flames of Hell ſhall certainly awaken it, the pains and torments there ſhall certainly awaken it; then Conſcience ſhall be at reſt no longer, and ſuffer thee to be at reſt and peace no longer; then this ſleeping Lion ſhall awake, and it will cry out and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004934_0015_100E32E0ECE2EBC8"/>
roar moſt hideouſly, and then thou canſt not go unto thy drinking bouts, to bowls and ſports, and recreations, that thou mayſt not hear the clamours and the out-cryes of thy Conſcience: And ſhouldſt thou ſay unto thy Conſcience, Peace, be ſtill, and let me alone; ſay no more unto me now, than thou didſt when I was upon the earth; what! ſhall Conſcience ſay, be at peace? Oh I cannot, I cannot, though I would yet now I cannot, God is angry, I ſee his anger, I feel his anger and the ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain of his indignation, I cannot be at peace; I was blinded, but now I ſee, I was ſcared, but now I feel, I feel ſuch heavy ſtrokes of revenging Juſtice, that I muſt cry out againſt thee for thy folly, and thy mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be a ſervant to thy luſts, and fleſh and devil that brought thee to this place of torment: God is loſt, and Chriſt is loſt, and Heaven is for ever loſt, be ſilent now! I cannot, Oh I cannot; theſe are intolerable pains, this fire burns, it burns, Oh it burns; theſe flames are hot, exceeding hot, and thou art tumbling in a lake of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, &amp; can I be ſilent in the midſt of flames, in a burning fiery furnace I cannot, I muſt not, I will not be ſilent; do not intreat me, for I cannot now be ſilent. But that which yet ſtill is worſe than all the reſt,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004934_0016_100E32E38DCE9390"/>
all this miſery is eternal, eternal, wo and alas, it is eternal; had this fire been to burn only for a thouſand thouſand years, and this pain to be endured only for a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of years, yet I muſt have made my complaint againſt thee, and accuſe thee of thy madneſs and folly, that wouldſt ſerve theſe Devils, and hearken to the temptation of theſe Devils, againſt the counſels and commands of God himſelf; that thou ſhouldſt be ſuch a very fool to buy ſhort and fading pleaſures, at ſo dear a rate as to ſuffer for them ſuch laſting pains; but when I do conſider theſe torments are not for certain years, but for eternity; here I am in flames, in reſtleſs ſcorching flames, and which is worſe, here I muſt for ever be, there is no end, there is no end; wo is me, there is no end; if I weep, my tears can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench theſe flames, do not put out this fire, they are but like the water which the Smith caſteth on his fire, that makes it burn ſo much the more; I weep but the fire burns; Oh let me call to all this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned crew, to all this curſed company of damned Captives, Weep, Weep, Weep, abundantly, come and try, you would not weep out your ſins, come and let us try if we can weep out theſe flames. Weep! ſo we do, ſo we have theſe thouſand years, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004934_0016_100E32E38DCE9390"/>
yet our tears do not put out theſe flames. Oh then there is no hope, there is no hope; Oh to think of this there is no hope, ſaith Conſcience, makes me to cry out of thy folly and thy madneſs, that would be a ſervant and a ſlave unto the Devil and thy fleſh, for which now thou art tormented in theſe flames; thou drunkeſt hard to come unto this place, thou ſweareſt hard to come unto theſe torments. Oh how didſt thou labour to undo thy ſelf! How didſt thou daily work in the ſervive of the Devil, and thy luſts! and thou art thus rewarded for thy pains. Now thou feeleſt what Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did often tell thee; now thou findeſt what God did declare, that the wages of ſin is death. Sin was thy work, Hell is thy Wages. This this is the fruit of thy doings; this is the place of miſery which the Devil and thy Sin hath led thee captive to; and while thou and I live (ſaith Conſcience) I muſt be putting thee in remembrance, that thy ſin, and thy own doings have bro't thee to this place. Thus you ſee what hard wages theſe Captives will receive for all the ſervice (as the Devils bond-ſlaves they do here) remaining captives to him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Captives and bond-ſlaves have not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and the immunities that of right do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Freemen,</hi> Many, great, and precious are
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004934_0017_100E32E84B7D2980"/>
the priviledges of God's redeemed people, purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, but thoſe that are yet in Spiritual bondage, ſervants of Sin, are not partakers of them; if ever God give ſpiritual priviledges, pardon of Sin, peace with God, well-grounded peace of Conſcience, he will make you free, and bring you out of the houſe of bondage, before he put you into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Free Citizens have ſome advantages that thoſe that are not free, have not, which if they would enjoy they muſt buy their freedom; Spiritual freedom is purchaſed indeed by Chriſt, but freely beſtowed, upon thoſe that are made free, and then, and not till then, are the priviledges of redeemed perſons conferred upon them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Captives and bond-ſlaves cannot ſatisfie the greedy deſires of their cruel exactors;</hi> tho' they work hard, and toil much, yet they never think they do enough, but are ready to impoſe double taſks ſtill upon them. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage had their taſk much increaſed, and complained unto <hi>Pharoah,</hi> he replied, <hi>Yea are idle, yea are idle, go ye therefore now and work, Exod.</hi> 5.17, 18. Spiritual captives in their bondage take much pains in the ſervice of Satan and Sin, yet theſe Taſk-masters never think that they ſin enough,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004934_0017_100E32E84B7D2980"/>
or that they do diſhonour God enough, tho' they ſin with greedineſs, yet the Devil would have them to be more vile ſtill, and to be more wicked ſtill; to ſwear more, to hate God and his people, and his ways yet more. It is true, the Redeemed of the Lord, never do ſo much but they ought ſtill to do more, to love God more and more, and to delight in God, and deſire after God ſtill more and more; but the difference is great, their Work is good, and the more the better, but the works of the Devil's bondmen are evil, and the more the worſe: and this hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Impoſer will not be ſatisfied with all the wickedneſs thou doſt commit, but will provoke thee ſtill, and tempt thee ſtill, that thou mayeſt ſink the lower, and be plagued more in helliſh torments in the life to come.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Captives and bond-ſlaves are fettered and bound in chains at the pleaſure of thoſe whoſe captives they be.</hi> When <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> took <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> "he bound him in chains, and put him in priſon till the day of his death," Jer. 52.11.

                     <p>OF the firſt. 1. <hi>The captives and bond-ſlaves of Satan are bound with the Chain of Ignorance;</hi> As the <hi>Syrians</hi> were ſmitten with Blindneſs, thought they were going after their Leader to <hi>Dothan,</hi> but he bro't them into the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and then their eyes were opened, they ſaw they were in <hi>Samaria</hi> in midſt of their enemies, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.18.19.20. You may lead a blind

man which way you will; theſe Captives are blind, and except God open their Eyes they will not ſee their miſery till they be in the midſt of Hell, they think they are going to Heaven while they live, but after death when the eyes of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſhut, the eyes of their ſouls ſhall be opened, and behold they ſee themſelves in the midſt of Hell, among Devils and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits. When the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> took <hi>Zedekiah</hi> captive he put out his Eyes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.11. and when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did take <hi>Sampſon</hi> captive they put out his eyes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.21. and when Satan ſet upon our firſt Parents, and overcame them, their eyes were put out, I mean, of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they loſt their knowledge of God, and of the way to eternal Happineſs; and all his Children to this day are born Spiritually blind, and have their <q>underſtanding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, being alienated from the life of God, though the ignorance that is in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the blindneſs of the heart,</q> Eph. 4.18. <q>In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine into them,</q> 2 Cor. 4.4. and this is one of the firſt Chains which God knocketh off, when he comes

to ſet a poor Captive at liberty, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. But this chain or cord with which they are bound is four-fold, and ſo not eaſily broken, no, not at all but by Almighty power.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Theſe Captives are bound with the chain of Ignorance of ſin. The Devil keeps from the eyes of his bond-ſlaves the evil of Sin, that they ſhould not ſee it in its own nature, in its proper deformity and evil ſhape; for Sin is ſuch a monſter, that if men did ſee it as it is, they would abhor it, for evil as evil is not deſirable; but Satan ſets it out in the paint and dreſs of pleaſure or profit, and ſo Sinners are the faſter held thereby; this way he brought Mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage, and took them captive at the firſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. and by this means he keeps them ſtill in ſlavery and captivity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are bound with the Chain of <hi>Ignorance of their miſery and danger by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin.</hi> Theſe captivated Souls are in danger of God's eternal wrath and curſe, and do not fear it; becauſe they do not ſee it; in danger of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and do not tremble at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hid from their eyes; they ſee not the evil in ſin, and conſider not the evil after ſin, but think themſelves to be ſafe, though there is but a ſingle thread of a frail
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004934_0019_100E32EE630D7320"/>
life betwixt them and the miſeries of the Damned. When ſinners eyes are opened to diſcern their dangerous condition, the conſcience awakened, they cry out, as they <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <q>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do?</q> I ſee I am loſt, tell me, Oh tell me, what ſhall I do? I am in danger of the torments of the damned, if you can, for God's ſake tell me, if you have any love or pity to a poor periſhing Soul, tell me, what ſhall I do? If you know of any way or means for me to eſcape that Hell I have deſerved, tell me; is there any pardon for ſuch ſins as mine? is there any hope for ſuch a ſinner as I have been, and as yet I am? my time is ſhort, my days are few, and I now do ſee I am as near to Hell, as to the Grave; O what ſhall I do that I may eſcape ſo great damnation! ſo the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30, 31. but while ſinners are ignorant of their miſery and danger Satan hath them faſt bound.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They are bound with the Chain of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the remedy to eſcape this miſery and danger that their ſouls are in.</hi> Chriſt is the only Saviour of loſt Sinners, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. Ignorance of Chriſt is a ſtrong bond to hold men in their ſtate of bondage. Some are groſly ignorant of Chriſt, they know not who he was, nor what he did endure, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004934_0020_100E32F1D6C70A18"/>
of his Natures, and ignorant of his Offices, ignorant of his Satisfaction, and ignorant of his Interceſſion; how ſhould theſe get out of bondage that cannot (while thus ignorant) believe on him that is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Redeemer of ſuch captives? And how ſhould they believe on him whom they have no knowledge of? others might have ſome notional knowledge of Chriſt the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that they may be able to talk of Chriſt, and of his ſufferings, and of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings for Sinners, that yet have not any ſaving knowledge of him, that do not experimentally know the power of his Death, and the power of his Reſurrection; as one might have ſome knowledge by hear-ſay of a man, that they have no acquaintance with, but are utter ſtrangers to; if you ſee your ſin, and if you ſee your miſery by ſin, yet if you do not ſee the Redeemer, have no knowledge of him, you are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtill, and faſt bound in the Devil's fetters.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They are bound in the chains of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Covenant of Grace, that was framed on purpoſe for the relief of captive ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> they know not the terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the New Covenant, how Chriſt and his benefits purchaſed by his Death, are to be applied and conveyed over unto them. Faith in Chriſt is a riddle to them; and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004934_0020_100E32F1D6C70A18"/>
while they remain ignorant of the way, means, and conditions propoſed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, how they ſhould be partakers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by Chriſt, they will remain in a ſtate of bondage and captivity; for the breaking of this cord conſider (1) the neceſſity of Spiritual knowledge, no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.11. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. (2) The excellency of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8.

                     <p>The means to get it. 1. Read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. Learn ſome Catechiſm: What do you make Children of us? you are ſo being ignorant, old in years, but Children in point of underſtanding. If thou wert an hundred years old, if thou doſt not know them it is no ſhame to learn them. 3. Set thy ſelf under the conſtant preaching of the Word, there God often opens the eyes of the blind. 4. Keep company with the people of God; they will be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with thee of things needful to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lips of the righteous feed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 5. Pray to God to open thine eyes, that thou mayſt ſee ſuch things as yet thou never ſaweſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.30, 31, 32, 33.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The Second Chain is Prejudice.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="2">2. THE Captives and Bond-ſlaves of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan are bound <hi>with the chain of Prejudice againſt the ways of God and ſerious Religion;</hi> they have miſapprehenſions of Godlineſs, hard thoughts of God, of the people of God, they judge before they try; and prejudice againſt a man's perſon makes men will not hearken to his counſel, or have to do with him, <q>I knew that thou waſt an hard, auſtere man, and therefore I hid thy talent in a napkin, there is what is thine</q> ſaid the prejudiced ſlothful ſervant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.24. Prejudice againſt a calling, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular trade, or way and manner of living, keeps a perſon from being of that calling, or entering into that way. Prejudice againſt the way of Godlineſs holds ſinners faſt in the way of wickedneſs. Slaves in <hi>Turky</hi> have good thoughts of the condition of thoſe that are free and at liberty in their own Country, and therefore are exceeding deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be in their capacity; but the ſlaves of Satan have a prejudicate opinion of the condition of God's free-men, and therefore care not to be of their Number. And there are ſeveral Links in this Chain, which we
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004934_0021_100E32F56739A040"/>
will bring forth and ſhew, how they may be broken, that poor ſinners might not be any lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger bound or detained in their ſlavery thereby</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They have this prejudice againſt the ways of God, <hi>that they are melancholly ways,</hi> if they become ſerious in Religion they muſt be mourning &amp; ſorrowing, &amp; leave their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and never have a merry day more.—This is a clear miſtake, a groundleſs preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; for firſt, though there muſt be ſorrow and mourning and repenting, yet this is in order to rejoycing. Have you not ſinned? and if you have ſinned, muſt you not, ſhould you not ſorrow? is it not reaſonable you ſhould grieve that you have diſhonoured God, provoked God, wronged and undone your own Souls? If your Child hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt you, would you have him go on in his rebellion and diſobedience ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he return unto his duty, and he be received into your favour, he ſhould be humbled, and profeſs his ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that ever he did rebel againſt you? do you expect this from your ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born diſobedient Child, and might not God expect this much more from you? and would you look upon it as an aggravation of his diſobedience to go on therein without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance, that it would be much better for him to ſorrow and return? If
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004934_0022_100E32FA5DA54F48"/>
you would judge impartially, you would determine the caſe to be as reaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and you.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Is it not better to go mourning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting to Heaven, than to go merrily and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to Hell?</hi> Had you not better mourn and have a ſad and heavy heart for ſin upon Earth, and hereafter be filled with the joys of Heaven, than to have a light heart upon Earth under the heavy weight and load of ſin, and be filled hereafter with the ſorrows of Hell? Had you not better have ſhort ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for a time, and afterwards eternal joys; than to have ſhort joys for a time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards eternal ſadneſs and ſorrows? ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you have, and ſorrow you muſt, on Earth or in Hell, here among men, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after among Devils, and the curſed crew of damned Souls. If you can avoid all ſorrow after ſin, do if thou thinkeſt thou canſt have, as merry and as light an heart in Hell, and canſt lead as jolly, jovial, pleaſant life in the midſt of ſcorching fiery flames, as now thou doſt in the way of ſin, go on and take thy courſe; but if thou canſt not, as indeed thou canſt not; and if thou couldſt ſpeak with a damned Soul that was of thine acquaintance that hath been in Hell but a Month or two, he would tell thee, that thou can'ſt not; he would tell thee, amongſt us damned wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

there is no ſinging and carouſing; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us there are no merry meetings, no juncatings and delights; no ſports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; all full of ſadneſs and ſorrow, all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their woful caſe; all bewailing their miſerable condition, one crying out, Wo is me I am undone.

Or if I think, how loth I was to ſorrow upon earth, to have my heart made heavy for my ſin, nothing would pleaſe me but my pleaſure; I was for mirth and joy, but the more I had of joy while I lived on the Earth, the more I have of ſadneſs and ſorrow now I am in Hell.

there is not one merry heart amongſt them all. Think then of this and ſee, and judge if there be any reaſon you ſhould be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt the condition of Gods free-men, or the ways of holineſs, becauſe of ſorrow and repentance there muſt be for ſin. Oh that after this, poor captive, thou mayſt be no longer bound with this chain of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; but yet to knock off this fetter, and to cut this chain aſunder, let us ſtrike the other blow.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The ways of God and holineſs are not heavy, ſad and melancholick ways:</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the foundation of Joy, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, had <hi>Adam</hi> ever a more joyful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life than when he was perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? and who are more joyful and more glad, and filled more with pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light than the Saints above that are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy? and there are no perſons upon earth have more cauſe of joy and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, than thoſe that are truly though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly holy. Who have more reaſon to rejoyce than thoſe that have made their peace with God, that do enjoy his favour and his gracious preſence? Who have cauſe to lead a more cheerful, comfortable life, than thoſe that have the pardon of their ſin, that are the Children of the everliving God? Who have more reaſon to ſpend their days

and pilgrimage upon Earth with joy and gladneſs than thoſe that are paſt the danger of damnation, and have the aſſurance, or a lively hope of being happy in the full and perfect enjoyment of the bleſſed God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forever? Do but bring forth the grounds and reaſons of your rejoycing, and ſet them over againſt the reaſons of the righteous man's joy, and then judge which of the two are more weighty and more rational. Doſt thou lead a merry life becauſe thou doſt enjoy the world? and might not a godly man much more that doth enjoy God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Art thou ſo pleaſant in thy life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt this world's delights? and might not a godly man much more that hath Heavenly delights? Methinks the thoughts of what thou wanteſt, ſhould daſh all the joy thou takeſt in what thou haſt. Thou haſt Riches, but thou wanteſt Grace; thou haſt the favour of thy friends, but thou haſt not the favour of the great eternal God; thou haſt no debts to pay, or none but what thou canſt diſcharge, but thou haſt not the pardon of thy ſin, this debt remains uncroſſed in the Book of God, and thou art never able to diſcharge this debt. Methinks the tho'ts and fears of what thou ſhalt hereafter feel ſhould damp thy joy, and in thy greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mood ſhould check thy folly and change

Is this the man, that is ſo merry? Is this the man that pleads ſo much for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight? Is this the man indeed that would ſpend his preſent time in joy and gladneſs? If this man ſhould die to day, how ſoon would his tone be altered? How ſoon, alas how ſoon, would his tune be changed?</p>
                     <p>What think you all that hear me this day, that know and underſtand the dreadful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a graceleſs, chriſtleſs, unconverted ſinner? can you ſee him ſporting with delight about the brink of Hell, and not fear and tremble, leaſt ye ſee him falling down into it? Can you ſee him ſo Jocund, when ſo near the place of utter darkneſs, and not ſtand amazed at his boldneſs and his blindneſs? Do not your hearts pity ſuch a one, though he hath no pity for himſelf? Come ſinner, judge thy ſelf, if of all men in the world thou haſt any cauſe of ſuch a

joyful life thou pleadeſt for; and whether if thou wouldeſt lead a chearful life indeed; it would not be thy wiſer, ſurer, ſafer courſe to leave thy ſerving of the Devil and thy luſts, and to break thy cords and chains wherewith thou haſt been bound, and held captive ſo many years as thou haſt been.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, what are theſe pleaſures which thou findeſt in the Creature? What are theſe joys and comforts which thou fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from any thing beſides God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God? are they not ſenſual and bruitiſh? are they not only found in the ſenſitive part of thy Soul, and not in the more noble and rational part? Doſt thou place thy pleaſure and delights in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gratifying thy ſenſitive appetite; why thy very beaſt, thy horſe, thy dog, hath this delight as well as thou? and ſome creatures more than man. I can tell thee of a man that hath tried more than what theſe pleaſures are; that had a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and greater varieties of all ſorts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf, that hath made ſuch ſearch what there is in all things under the Sun to delight the heart of man, that no man that comes after him can do more; and yet he hath left it upon record from his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that all is vanity and vexation of Spirit, and that is <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.

throughout; take thy Book and read it; his Concluſion is, that the Delights and Pleaſures fetcht from things above the Sun do far ſurpaſs and exceed all pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light taken from all things under the Sun; the ſame man that tells thee, all under the Sun is vanity, doth alſo tell thee that the ways of Wiſdom, <q>are ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all her paths are Peace.</q> Prov. 3.17.</p>
                     <p>Come then, poor captive Sinners, come and try what comforts and delights are to be found in the ways &amp; ſervice of our God. Do not judge before you try; how can you tell, what are the ways of God, before you have made experience what they be? How can you tell, there are no comforts, joys that the Saints meet with, when you were never qualified for thoſe comforts and thoſe joys? I do not perſwade you to caſt away a comfortable life, but to change it for a better; I do not perſwade you to leave delights and pleaſures, but to change them for more noble, more rational, more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, more durable delights: Come and get a real taſte and reliſh of the ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in communion with God, in the ſenſe of his love, in a right applying of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in hoping for his Kingdom; and if you do not like them better, and find them

ſweeter, then return again to your preſent comforts, and fetch them again from the ſame Objects that now you do; but then be ſure your Heart be changed, that you might taſte indeed the ſweetneſs of delights and Comforts in God, in Chriſt, in the promiſes and privileges of the Goſpel, and I dare be bold to ſay, you will then ſay theſe are better, greater, ſweeter than ever any before you found in Satan's Service, or in the way of Sin: Come therefore, come and try.</p>

taſtes of the ſweetneſs of Goſpel-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, that filleth their Souls with ſuch holy admirations, and divine comforts, that cannot be expreſſed with Words, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe that you do ſee ſo much to mourn and weep, and grieve for their ſins, they have cauſe and ground and Reaſon to rejoice, and ſo have not you that yet are captives to the Devil; and are not they in a better condition, that have ground and Reaſon to rejoice, but do not, than you are in, that do rejoice when you have no cauſe nor reaſon ſo to do? of the two I would rather have my Soul in their Soul's conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than in thine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You do not know how ſweet and pleaſant, and delightful theſe bitter Tears of Repentance are unto them that ſhed moſt of them; it is exceeding comfortable to have an Heart to mourn and grieve kindly for their Sins: their tears thou ſeeſt, but their inward peace and comfort that often follows after theſe, thou takeſt no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But how doſt thou know the true Cauſe and Reaſon of their ſorrow? Thou art apt to impute it to the way that they walk in; did ever any truly godly Soul, that leads the ſaddeſt and moſt ſorrowful

                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were Captives to the Devil ſo long, and ſerved ſin and luſt ſo long, that they lay in chains and fetters ſo long, when a Redeemer was ſo often offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and they had not Hearts to cloſe with him ſooner than they did; that they ſerved the Devil, an hard cruel maſter ſo long, and came into Chriſt, ſo good and ſo gracious a Lord, as by experience now they find him to be, and his work and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be ſo ſweet, that they came to him ſo late; if this be the true reaſon, is their ſorrow then any real reaſon of your preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt godlineſs? no verily it doth commend it ſo much the more.</p>

What if the reaſon of their ſorrow be becauſe they have made no more progreſs in holineſs ſince they came into the ways of holineſs? that they have attained no more likeneſs unto God, to no more faith and love, to no more humility and heavenly mindedneſs; they are weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you ſee. Not becauſe they are come into the ways of God, as you do think, but becauſe they have gone yet no further in them; not becauſe they have left their Sin, but becauſe they did ſin ſo much, and now can leave their ſin no more; they are ſo ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful becauſe they are no more fruitful, becauſe they are no better; aſk them if this be not the reaſon? and if ſo, is there any reaſon their ſorrow ſhould prejudice your hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt godlineſs? no verily, it doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it ſo much the more, when they that have a true and real taſte of the Sweetneſs of it, ſorrow ſo much becauſe they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to no more degrees thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What if the reaſon of their Sorrow be becauſe they can do no more for God and Chriſt, by way of thankfulneſs to him, who hath done ſo much for them as of bond-ſlaves to make them free? that God ſhould give his own only Son, and Chriſt ſhould give himſelf, his life, his ſoul, his blood for a random to bring them out of

their captivity; to deliver them from hell and wrath to come, and make them that were the other day in bondage, and liable to damnation, now meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light; and yet that they can honour him no more, might be the reaſon of their ſorrow.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What if the reaſon of their ſorrow be, becauſe they ſee ſo many ſtill remain in bonds, ſo many ſtill continue ſervants to the Devil, and to ſin, and do refuſe to ſerve and live unto the bleſſed, holy, glorious God? and is not this matter of ſorrow indeed to ſee the Devil leading precious and immortal Souls captive unto hell? that men ſhould be ſo forward to follow the Devil, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer unto eternal torments, and ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to follow Chriſt, the only Saviour unto eternal joys? theſe are mourning not that they are made free, but becauſe you and ſo many more remain captives to the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. What though the reaſon of their ſorrow be for their ſin which they did commit when they were bondſlaves to the Devil, doth this diſcommend holineſs, to bewail wickedneſs, or is this for the credit and the commendation of your ſinful way of life, that men that are ſerious and have their eyes opened, do ſee ſo much evil in it, that they

                     <p n="2">2. Another link in this chain of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice wherewith theſe captives are bound, is, the offence they take from the outward mean condition of God's redeemed people; they ſee them to be the poorer ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are full of zeal for ſtrictneſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; the rich men, and the great men, and the gallants are not of this way; this did prejudice many againſt Chriſt, that came to purchaſe and proclaim, and beſtow liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on poor captive ſinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.55. "Is not this the Carpenter's ſon"? 57. "they were offended at him." And the Phariſees were held in this bond, <hi>John</hi> 7.46.

                     <p n="1">1. Shall the greatneſs and the richneſs, and the gallantry of ſinners advantage them any thing beyond the grave, or profit them one whit in another world, or at the Bar of God; ſhall they be preſerved from Hell, and the torments of the damned becauſe
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004934_0029_100E330F95BF1F98"/>
they are rich and great, and proſper in the world? or ſhall they be ſaved or received into Heaven when they die, becauſe they were rich while they lived in the world? will not death ſtrip them of their eſtates, of their coſtly robes? will not death make theſe gallants as ghaſtly as the poor, and is there any difference betwixt the Corps of the niceſt Dame, and the pooreſt beggar? muſt not the one rot in the earth as well as the other? and be fed upon by worms? or will the very worms make any difference betwixt the one and the other? when the graves are opened, where poor and rich were buried, and rotten, and their ſkulls and bones are caſt up, can you know the bones and ſkulls of the rich from the bones and ſkulls of the poor; which it was that was clothed with ſilks, and which with rags or coarſer cloth? which it was that was fed with ſweeteſt morſels, and with greateſt delicacies, and which with harder fare and meaner diet? No, you cannor. Why then, when you ſhall be ſo ſoon equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized with the pooreſt beggar, are you ſo prejudiced by the meanneſs of Chrisſt's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; Muſt you not ſtand as naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the juſt Tribunal of an Impartial God as thoſe that now for their poverty you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and ſcorn? or ſhall you appear in your

locks &amp; curls, with which you ſo much vainly pride yourſelves? ſhall you appear with your Rings, and Jewels, and Bracelets, or be then regarded, becauſe you trick up your mortal bodies with ſuch things now? No, no, it is more likely you will then wiſh you had never had them, you had never uſed them, eſpecially ſince your heart was ſo puffed up with pride, that you diſdained Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt, becauſe many of his followers were ſo far below you in outward enjoyments of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What if the rich and the poor were ſick of the ſame diſeaſe, and there was but one only remedy for the recovering of both, would the rich refuſe the only remedy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the poor do make uſe of it? Would they rather die, and go unto their graves, or lie in pain rather than uſe the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that the meaner Sort are cured by? this is the very caſe, a Prince and a beggar, the noble and the ignoble, high and low, rich and poor, are ſick of the ſame Soul-diſtempers, all are all alike guilty of and polluted with Original Sin, all are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture children of wrath, under the curſe of the Law, have deſerved the damnation of hell; and there is but one only way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, one only Redeemer and Saviour, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. and the way and means to be

partakers of Chriſt and his benefits is one and the ſame to all; God hath not preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed one way of Salvation, to the rich, and another to the poor; but the ſame to both; muſt the poor believe, ſo muſt the rich, or be damned; muſt the poor be holy and converted, ſo muſt the rich, or elſe never ſee God, nor enter into his Kingdom; will you then rather periſh for ever, than be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame way, and by the ſame means, that the poorer ſort are ſaved by? If you are ſo ſtout and proud, and high-minded, for this Reaſon to neglect God, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and for this Reaſon to reject Chriſt, let him alone, and in the end ſee who will have cauſe to complain, God or you, and who will have the worſt of it, the poor or you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If it be the pleaſure of God, to call and convert the meaner ſort of people, to beſtow his ſon, his ſpirit &amp; his Grace upon them, what have you to do to quarrel with God, or be offended at the method of his Grace? Is not Chriſt God's own gift, and his Grace and Kingdom, and eternal life his own gift, and in his own power, and may he not give it to whom he will? what if God hath choſen the poor in this world to make them rich in faith, and to be heirs of glory, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. will you rather remain
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004934_0030_100E3313866ADA50"/>
children of wrath, and captives ſtill to Sin and Satan, than to be co-heirs with ſuch contemptible in your eyes? Who do you think will be the loſers and the ſufferers but yourſelves? if their poverty and low eſtate doth not diminiſh God's love to them, there is no reaſon it ſhould cauſe or encreaſe your prejudice againſt the only way to eternal happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is better to be a poor man, and to be a free-man than to be a rich man under cloſe reſtraint and bondage. Civil liberty is to be preferred before many enjoyments, much more is ſpiritual freedom to be valued and deſired above honours, pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the world. Is it not better to be in a low condition while you live and be ſaved when you die, than to be ungodly, though rich in this world, and damned in the next? Is it not better to go with truly gracious and believing perſons (though poor) to Heaven and eternal glory, than with chriſtleſs, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſons, (tho' rich and honourable) to everlaſting torments?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If you ſpeak of the true riches, and who are rich indeed, Believers are not poor; then the ſcale is turned, then the ungodly are the poor, and the godly are the rich; theſe have the ſureſt riches, the ſafeſt, the moſt ſuitable, and the moſt laſting, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting

riches; God is their riches; and Chriſt in whom are unſearchable riches, is their riches; and the Treaſures that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove are their riches; they are rich in grace, and rich in promiſes, and rich in ſpecial ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual priviledges; and when worldly riches ſhall fail, and ſtand you in no ſtead, will not profit nor advantage you; then ſhall their riches comfort them, remain with them; and be continued to them for ever; and is there now any reaſon why you ſhould be bound with this bond of prejudice againſt the freedom you might have by Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many whom Chriſt makes free, are poor and mean in their outward condition in the world?</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

it is a ſtrong bond wherewith wicked men are held back from entering into the way in which they might be made free; but Oh, that God would enable you to break this bond, and cut in two this Chain, by working upon your hearts ſuch conſiderations as theſe following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They have peace with God when they have trouble in the world;</hi> they have favour with God, when frowns from men; when men are their foes, God is their friend; tho' men do loath them, yet God doth love them, tho' men be againſt them, and devils be againſt them, yet God is for them; yea, all in God is for them; his mercy is for them, his Power is for them, his truth is for them; and is there not more in peace and friendſhip with God to make them happy, than in all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they have from men to make them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable? and is it not better to have one powerful, true, eternal God to be ones friend, though all the world ſhould be ones enemy, than to have ſuch a God to be ones enemy, and weak and mortal men to be ones friend; whereas if you while in your ſins be at reſt and eaſe, yet God is againſt you, his juſtice is againſt you, his truth is againſt you, and his power is againſt you; and as God's people ſhall find God to be the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004934_0032_100E3319A969C2C8"/>
ſureſt friend; ſo the wicked ſhall find him to be the ſoreſt enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though they have outward troubles, yet they have inward, joys and comforts; as they have peace with God, ſo they have peace in and with themſelves; and their joy is ſuch that no man can take it from them; their outward enjoyments and their lives they may take from them, but their comfort and their joy they cannot take from them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22. the teſtimony of their Conſcience makes them rejoice, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. they are filled with ſuch inward conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that they can triumph and ſing in their outward tribulations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. when caſt and bound in priſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.23, 24, 25. when beaten and ſcourged. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.40, 41. and the ſweetneſs of their inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts doth much abate and take away, the bitterneſs of their outward ſorrow. Their troubles you ſee, their afflictions you ſee, but their comforts you are ſtrangers to; elſe you would not be ſo much prejudiced againſt the way of holineſs for the outward evils that befall them that walk therein.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The troubles and the ſufferings of God's redeemed ones are but ſhort, but for a little, little while; but the ſufferings of the Devil's captives are long and laſting, for a long, a long, a long Eternity. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004934_0032_100E3319A969C2C8"/>
their ſufferings here, with the eternal joys they ſhall hereafter have, and they are ſhort; or with the eternal torments that the ſlaves of Sin ſhall hereafter feel, and ſo they are for a moment; at the longeſt their ſufferings ſhall laſt, no longer than their life on Earth ſhall laſt, and that will be but for a while; after a few more years or months or weeks, and all their ſorrow ſhall be over paſt and gone; and in as ſhort a time, your joy and eaſe will paſs away and return no more for ever, their ſufferings will ſhortly end, and their reſt and eaſe and joy begin, but never end, and your eaſe will ſhortly end, and your ſufferings and ſorrows will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but never end, never end. What think you now? is it not better be in trouble for a while, and afterwards be lodged in a place of everlaſting reſt, and love and joy, than live at eaſe a while in ſin, and afterwards roul and tumble in a reſtleſs Lake of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brimſtone to all eternity. If you are not of this mind now, it will not be long before you will.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The troubles of God's holy, humble, ſanctified people, they are but light as well as ſhort: True indeed in themſelves they may be heavy, and to fleſh and blood they may be heavy, but comparatively they are but light. Compare them with that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004934_0033_100E331DC9559A48"/>
Crown of Glory that ſhall be put upon their Heads, and ſo they are but light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. not worthy to be compared with it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. And compare their troubles here with the ſufferings of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's captives hereafter, and ſtill they will be found to be but light. The ſufferings of the one are from angry and diſpleaſed men, but the ſufferings of the other are from an angry and offended God: and is the arm of men to be compared with the arm of of God? the wrath of Men to the wrath of God? and can feeble man lay on ſuch blows as can a ſtrong and mighty God? Can a Child ſtrike ſuch a ſtroke as a mighty Giant can? Oh you ſhall ſhortly feel the heavy weight of God's revenging fury; and if you think it will not be ſo bad, nor ſo heavy upon you, but you ſhall do well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to bear it; tell me why then do you ſo cry out and roar under extremity of the Tooth-ach? why do you complain and ſay you cannot reſt, nor ſleep? why do you make ſo great a ſtir under a fit of Colick, Gout, or Stone? why do you not ſay, this is nothing to be born? this is eaſy to be endured? why do you then ſo frown and fret, and make ſuch bitter lamentation? but alas what is this to the torments of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? to lying in a fiery furnace? in a place
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004934_0033_100E331DC9559A48"/>
of utter darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth for ever? where the worm never dies, and the fire ſhall not be quenched? what is this to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe flames which God on purpoſe hath cauſed to burn, for the puniſhment of ſin? to lying in that place, which God on purpoſe hath provided for the ſhewing forth the glory of his Juſtice, and his Holineſs, and his utter hatred of ſin, in pouring out his fury, and his ſoreſt indignation in the puniſhment of the ſinner. Oh that God would break this bond, that hereby you might be no longer kept as bond-ſlaves to the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another Link in this Chain of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, by which theſe captives are bound is their apprehenſion of the difficulty of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties; the duties to be performed, as mortification of ſin, ſelf-denial, heavenly mindedneſs, ſervent prayer, conſtant holy watchfulneſs in the whole courſe of life, cloſe and narrow ſelf-examination, theſe and ſuch like are diſpleaſing, becauſe of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty they apprehend in them and will not be at the pains to perform them, and if they try they find it to be an heavy and a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous burden, and caſt it off again. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the breaking of this bond conſider.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:004934_0034_100E33219A68D570"/>1. It is to ſinful man, and the ſinful part of man that holy duties are ſo diſpleaſing and ſo burdenſome; it is becauſe your Souls are diſtempered, and not from any thing in the nature of holineſs; this is plain becauſe the Angels of God, that are without ſin, do not find it a burden but a pleaſure to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient unto God; and when the people of God ſhall be perfectly cured of all Soul-diſeaſes, they ſhall not find any difficulty or tedious irkſomeneſs in conſtant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual holy actings; and man as made at firſt by God, did take pleaſure, and did find great delight in his conformity to the will of God. It is plainly then from the corruption of your depraved nature, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your own hearts, that you find this difficulty in Religion and that holineſs is ſuch a burden to you; as a man that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered doth not ſavour and reliſh his food: what others taſte ſweetneſs in, is bitter unto him, the cauſe is not in the meat, but in the palate; ſhould this man cry out, my meat is bitter or rather my diſeaſe is great and dangerous; or ſhould he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his ſuſtenance, and rather die with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than receive his food? So ſhould you cry out and complain, Godlineſs is burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and Religion is a tedious taſk? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blame the corruption of your heart
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004934_0034_100E33219A68D570"/>
that what is pleaſant and delightful unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is ſo heavy and diſpleaſing unto you? do you ſay God's commands are grievous, others have ſaid and found they are not ſo, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. Do you ſay, Chriſt's yoke is heavy, and his burden not to be born? Chriſt tells you, <q>His yoke, and his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is light,</q> 
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. Do you find the ſerious conſtant ſtudy of the holy Word of God to be burdenſome to you? <hi>David</hi> found it to be ſweet, and pleaſant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.35. as ſweet to him as riches to a worldly man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.14. and <q>better to him than thouſands of gold and ſilver,</q> 
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.72. do you find God's commands to be to you as bitter as gall, others have found them to be ſweeter than honey, or the honey-comb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. are they unto you unpleaſant? they are to others more deſirable than their neceſſary food, <hi>Joh.</hi> 23.12, whence comes this to paſs, that the ſame commands of God and the ſame religious duties are ſweet to others, but bitter to you, pleaſant to others and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to you? is it not apparent that it is from the wickedneſs of your own depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hearts? and have you diſtempered your ſelves, and now cry out of the burden of the ways of God? have you done what you ought not to do, and thereby become weak
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004934_0035_100E3323B84643E8"/>
and unable, &amp; then caſt the blame upon the commands of God, that is indeed, upon God himſelf, it is not your wiſdom but your wickedneſs ſo to do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is the external part of duties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the enjoyment of God in them, that makes them to be ſo heavy and ſo burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto you; becauſe you do not get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpiritual part of religious part of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances. To pray indeed and not to meet with God in prayer, to fit and hear, to faſt and afflict the body without communion with God, this is that which is the cauſe of this tediouſneſs in Religion you do ſo much cry out againſt; but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of Religion, in loving of God, in believing on Chriſt, in meeting with God, in the deſires of the Soul after God there is ſweetneſs, and when it is thus with the Soul, it finds not duty to be a burden; but there the Soul could dwell, there it could with pleaſure ſtay and make its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode. Nay there is more true delight in denying the pleaſures of the fleſh, than in fulfilling of them. Theſe things you have no experience of, but aſk God's people, and they will tell you, this is ſo; enquire of them and they will aſſure you this is ſo; and ſhould you be thus prejudiced againſt what you do not know? If you did know,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004934_0035_100E3323B84643E8"/>
your prejudice would quickly be removed. You engage in the matter of a duty, and do not mind the manner of it, and that encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth your prejudice againſt it: Come then love God in Prayer, mourn for Sin in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; were you able and ſubjects capable of applying promiſes to yourſelves, promiſes of pardon, and promiſes of Heaven, as your own, in reading and hearing of the Word, then it would be ſweet and pleaſant. Tho' you in your unconverted ſtate do not find it to be ſo, yet do not ſay, it is not ſo, but believe them that have had experience, and come over to God and Chriſt indeed, and then with the <hi>Samaritans</hi> you will ſay, <hi>John</hi> 4.42. as they unto the Woman, <q>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that he is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world.</q> Or you will find, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kin. 10.4.5. <q>She ſaid unto the King, it was a true report that I heard in my own Land of thy acts, and of thy wiſdom. 7. Howbeit, I believed not the Words until I came and mine eyes have ſeen it; and behold the half was not told me; thy wiſdom and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity exceedeth the fame, which I heard. Happy are thy men, happy are
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004934_0036_100E3326F3E57DF0"/>
theſe thy ſervants which ſtand continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before thee, and hear thy wiſdom.</q> The fleſh doth make falſe reports of the ways of God, but come and try, and you will ſay, you heard much was ſaid againſt the tediouſneſs of Religion, and for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Chriſt's yoak, but now I find, the one half, was not expreſſed, of what might be experienced of the delight and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, which takes off the burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Set the neceſſity of being found in the ways of God againſt the difficulty of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. If a thing be difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, yet if you apprehend it to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that it muſt be done, you ſet upon it; it is a burden to ſome people to take Phyſick, but when they are ſo ſick, but they muſt take it or die, they ſet themſelves unto it. Sirs, do not ſtand diſputing, it is a difficult matter to be holy, to love God, to turn from Sin, it is a burden to you to ſerve God; hard or not hard, it muſt be done, burden or no burden, it muſt be done, or you die and that for ever. You muſt do the things that God requireth, repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, become new creatures, accept of Chriſt, be holy, or you muſt be damned; here is no trifling in the caſe: here is no arguing <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> to be admitted, theſe
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004934_0036_100E3326F3E57DF0"/>
things muſt be done, or your Souls ſhall not be ſaved; if the word of God be true, this is true. They are not my words, but the words of the true eternal God; turn and ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. What ſay you now? do you believe this to be the Word of God or no? do you believe you muſt be judged by it, be damned or ſaved according to this word? doth not God ſpeak his mind plainly, and declare his purpoſe, and his unalterable reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that you muſt turn to him or burn in Hell? that you muſt repent and believe and that quickly too, or you muſt be loſt for ever: why doſt thou poor Captive Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſtand thus delaying and loitering, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is hard to leave my ſins, to repent, a burden to give my ſelf to holy duties. Speak Sinner, in the name of God I demand thy anſwer, wilt thou do what God requires, or wilt thou not? is it not flatly neceſſary, if thou wilt be ſaved? and if it be ſo diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icult, and ſo neceſſary, why art thou ſo long before thou goeſt about it? hadſt thou not the more need to take all the time before thee to do this work that is ſo hard and yet ſo neceſſary. Why then do you put it off till you come to be ſick, and till you come
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004934_0037_100E332B84ADFF80"/>
to die? are you likely to be fit for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt work when you ſhall be fit for no work at all? doſt thou ſometime think that this is eaſy, and therefore doſt defer it to the laſt, and ſometimes think it too hard for thee to meddle with it at all? poor captive Soul! doſt thou thus turn and wind in thine own thoughts, and harbour any thing that may prolong the time of thy captivity, and bind thee faſter and faſter ſtill in thy fetters and thy chains? wilt thou ſtill ſay, it is an hard caſe, it is a burdenſome thing to be really religious, to be truly holy, then tell me further.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Will it not be an harder caſe to bear the wrath of God for ever? is duty now a burden to thee? and will not the torments of Hell be a burden to thee? canſt thou not bear the burden of a holy life; and canſt thou bear the damnation of Hell? doſt thou not think, the thoughts of the loſs of God, and Chriſt, and Heaven will be an heavy and continual burden to thee? doſt thou not think, the ſight of Devils round about thee, will not be a burden to thee? and thy conſtant hearing ſuch horrible how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſuch doleful lamentations, ſuch bitter cries of wo wo for ever wo, that we were born, what ſhall we do, what ſhall we do, wo and alas what ſhall we do, this place is
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004934_0037_100E332B84ADFF80"/>
hot, is hot, oh, oh, it is exceeding hot, this pain is great, this pain is great, oh it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, it is extream, it is extream; and which is worſe and doth encreaſe our wo and ſorrow, it is eternal too, it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal too! will not ſuch hearing of ſuch dreadful out cries be a burden to thee? doſt thou not, poor captive ſinner, think what thou ſhalt feel in pain upon thy body, by the burning fiery-flames, and the anguiſh in thy ſoul by the ever-gnawing of the never-dying-worm, will it not be a burden to thee? is it difficult to love God, and will it not be difficult to bear the wrath of God? is it difficult to ſerve him, and will it not be difficult to ſuffer from him? I tell thee, it will be the hardeſt taſk that ever thou waſt put upon, to bear the torments of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Oh, come then, ſinner, come away, though it be hard to leave thy ſins, yet do it, though it be hard to walk ſtrictly before the Lord, yet come and do it, elſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will befall thee ſhortly, that thou ſhalt ſay, is hard to ſuffer.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This difficulty that thou findeſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, is, becauſe as yet thou haſt no ſtrength but what is thine own to do them with; but if thou doſt renounce the Devil and the fleſh, and give thy ſelf to God and Chriſt, thou ſhalt have help from
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004934_0038_100E332D55AA6EB8"/>
Heaven, and then they will be more eaſy to thee. While thou art in bonds of ſin, thou haſt neither ſtrength nor ſkill to do them with, and that makes it hard, but if God make thee free, thou ſhalt have both, and then it will be eaſy if thou wanteſt ſkill, God will ſhew thee, and if thou wanteſt ſtrength, God will help thee, and then praying work, and repenting work, will go more ſmoothly forward. When God ſhall come and break and melt thy heart, it will be more eaſy to repent; when God ſhall come, and give to thee a ſight and ſenſe of thy ſins and wants; of thy want of grace and pardon, of thy want of Chriſt and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart, it will be more eaſy for thee to bewail thy ſins, and to pray and beg ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies for what thou wanteſt. God is not an hard Maſter to his ſervants, to put them upon work, and give them neither power nor reward, for he gives both to thoſe that in ſincerity give up themſelves unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. That though without Chriſt we can do nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. yet being ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by Chriſt, we can do all things in order to the ſaving of our Souls, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. and the ſpirit is purchaſed and promiſed by Chriſt, to help the weakneſſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his ſervants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. he ſhall help thee unto words in prayer, to expreſs
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004934_0038_100E332D55AA6EB8"/>
thy wants, thy heart, and thy deſires unto God, and when thou wanteſt words, he ſhall help thee, witn ſighs and ſobs, and tears, which are powerful pleadings with the Lord, who underſtandeth the ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and the groanings of his Children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have ſhewed the ſecond Chain with which theſe Captives are bound, the Prejudice of their hearts againſt the holy ways of God's Redeemed and free new-born people, and have endeavoured to cut it in twain, to knock it off; but alas this is too hard a work for man to do, for any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon earth to do, or for any Angel in Heaven to do; Sinners are ſo faſt locked in their fetters, that it requires Almighty power to break them that the captive may eſcape and be ſet at liberty. Oh that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would come and burſt and break it quite aſunder! Oh that God would come and take it off, were it but from one or two a mongſt you this day! that though you came captives in your chain, yet you might go home free-men, and at liberty; but yet ſomething is required from you, that you ſhould conſider and weigh with yourſelves impartially and deliberately what hath been ſaid, to remove this prejudice of your hearts, which makes you like your preſent cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004934_0039_100E3332455320F0"/>
ſtate, and not be deſirous to come forth from it; and if what hath been ſpoken is not ſufficient ground to ſilence theſe carnal pleas, I beg the Prayers of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me, that God would forgive my weakneſs, and pardon my unſkilfulneſs, that know no better how to deliver a meſſage from the Lord, and to pray that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I might be more fitted for this weighty work; but if there be evidence of truth in what hath been delivered and ſpoken in your ears, I charge you in the name of the dreadful and eternal God, in the name of Chriſt my Lord that ſent me, that you do not ſlight it; if I have ſpoken my own word, fling them back in my face and tell me that I lie; but if it be according to the Scripture, then ſlight them at your peril; either ſhew wherein I have erred, or elſe ſubmit unto it; but if thou whoſoever thou art, or what name ſoever thou art called by, art convinced in thy Conſcience, and thy reaſon and judgment is ſatisfied that theſe grounds of Prejudice have been made appear to be vain and frivolous, and yet ſhalt upon theſe accounts chuſe rather to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in thy captive ſtate, than come to Chriſt and be made free, and goeſt to thy Grave, and Hell, with theſe fetters on thy Soul; know that thou art hereby rendred inexcuſable.</p>

But what have you houſes of your own for, and what are your Shops for, and what is the Exchange for, but for your trades and dealing in the world?

                     <p n="4">4. ANother Chain with which theſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are bound is preſumption, vain and falſe hopes of Heaven: This is the ruin of moſt that do miſcarry for ever, a groundleſs hope that they ſhall be ſaved for ever; how few are there, be they never ſo ignorant of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004934_0044_100E33420F5C0990"/>
the way to Heaven, but yet do hope they ſhall come thither? that walk in the broad way and common road and beaten path to Hell, and yet do hope they ſhall get to Heaven; as if a man were daily travelling towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and yet were confident he ſhould come unto the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> The Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard doth hope he ſhall be ſaved; the Swearer and profane, the hypocrite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, nay, who is there but doth hope for happineſs? this is ſo ſtrong in the worſt of men, that when they would ſet forth the certainty of a thing, they do it by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as I hope to be ſaved; as if they ſhould ſay, it is as true, it is as ſure as it is true that I hope to be ſaved; and though their hope be not a true hope, yet that they hope is true. And the ſtrength of this cord appears in that theſe hopes are the laſt thing that wicked men will part withal; when they are ſo ſick, that they perceive they muſt part with riches yet they will not part with their Hope of Heaven, when they are ſo ſick, that they perceive the hour is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on wherein they muſt part with their deareſt friends, yet their hope they wiil not part withal; and when they ſee they muſt part with life, yet they will not part with hope, 'till Soul and Body be parted, the ſoul and hope will not be parted; and then

poor captives loſe their ſouls and hopes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and thus with hopes of Heaven, they do go down to Hell, and then and there they can hope no longer. Its one of the hardeſt things that Miniſters have to do, to beat down theſe falſe hopes of Heaven in our Hearers; if this were done, a great part of our work were done, if we tell you of your miſery and danger, of the wrath of God againſt ſinners, of the torments that are prepared by a provoked God for you, yet you hope you ſhall eſcape, and ward off all the threatnings of the Word with theſe vain and groundleſs hopes: if we could but get theſe falſe hopes from you, then we ſhould begin to hope that you might be delivered from your bondage, and eſcape this captivity, in which you are ſo ſtrongly held thereby; no man is faſter bound in fetters, than he that is ungodly, and yet ſtrongly and confidently hopes that he ſhall be ſaved. If you could ſpeak with damned Souls, thouſands of them would tell you, this was their ruin and their bane; ſhould you aſk them were not you told, that ſin would bring you to this place of torment? were you not told by Miniſters and by God himſelf, that you were in the way to miſery and damnation? what would they reply? <q>Yes, yes, we were often
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:004934_0045_100E33456BC5C7B0"/>
told, and we were plainly told, but this was it that did undo us, we hoped it would be better with us.</q> Shall I then attempt to break this bond aſunder? but becauſe man can but ſhew unto you the vanity of your hopes, Oh that God himſelf would come and powerfully convince you by his Word and Spirit, that your hopes are vain and groundleſs hopes, that you may be no longer kept in thraldom by the Devil, by theſe fetters of falſe hopes of Heaven. I know that this is a manifold twiſted Cord; many things there are that you do bottom theſe hopes upon; but if I ſhall ſhew from the Word of God, that they are no better grounds and reaſons of hope, than graceleſs perſons might alledge, and many now in Hell once had to ſay, and did, as well as you, that then you will no longer ſuffer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to delude and to deceive you, and keep you as his captives in a ſtate of bondage. Only let me aſk you firſt, whether you will believe that that is true, that God ſpeaketh in his Word, or will you dare to ſay, that what is contained in the Scripture is forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and a lie; if you ſay the latter, God ſhall ſhortly convince you of the truth thereof; the flames of Hell ſhall ſhortly convince you, and the pains and torments you ſhall ſhortly feel ſhall powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:004934_0045_100E33456BC5C7B0"/>
you, that all theſe ſayings of God are true: If you ſay the former, that God's word is true, I do not doubt to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that your hope is falſe, if you do agree to try your hopes by the word of God, by which you and I and all muſt be ſhortly tried, and acquitted or condemned according to this Word, I do not doubt to ſhew that Satan hath befooled you all this while; God hath as plainly told you, that in an unconverted ſtate, without faith in Chriſt, without repentance and reformation, you cannot be ſaved, this is as plain as can be ſpoken, and yet contrary to God's revealed will, will you hope you ſhall be ſaved? which do you think ſhall be proved falſe, God's word or your hope, that is contrary to his word? both cannot be true. Will a Drunkard ſay, God's word is falſe; no, he will not, then thy hope is falſe. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. Where God doth plainly ſay, and poſitively lay down for a certain truth, and which within a few years, or months, or weeks, all the Drunkards, Whoremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngers, and graceleſs perſons in the world without exception of any one (dying ſo) ſhall find to be ſo, that they ſhall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom of God. Come then, you that ſay, you hope to be ſaved, as well the preciſeſt of you, all come and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

your reaſons, and in the fear of God ſeriouſly weigh the anſwers that ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One Link in this Chain of falſe hopes by which theſe Captives are bound, is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion and miſapplication of the mercy of God; thou ſayeſt, God is a merciful God, and is ready to ſhew mercy to his creature; it is true in me, there is no merit, but in God there is mercy, and God did not make his creatures to damn them, God did make me, and therefore I hope that he will ſave me. Is this all thou haſt to ſay in ſuch a weighty matter? why thou thinkeſt thou art redeemed from thy bondage, and ſhalt be free for ever from the torments of the Damned? that thou mayſt be no longer bound with this Chain. Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Devils themſelves and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſouls in Hell themſelves can ſay as much as this: Poor damned Devils do know that God is a merciful God, and that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew mercy to the penitent and the humble ſinner. Devils and damned Souls can ſay, that they are God's creatures, and yet notwithſtanding, they are miſerable, and muſt be ſo for ever; and this is the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their miſery, that though God is merciful, yet they are for ever damned; this cuts them to the heart, that a merciful
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004934_0046_100E33471BB0F188"/>
God condemned them, and ſentenced them down to eternal torments; what is that to them, that God is merciful in himſelf, and ſhews mercy unto others, if he is not merciful unto them? and what is it unto thee, that God is ſo, if thou by reaſon of the continuance in a ſtate of unregeneracy, ſhalt not be benefited by his mercy? I know <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> is a difference betwixt the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hell, and wicked men on Earth? the damned in Hell are paſt a poſſibility of mercy, but ſo are not you; they ſhall have no more tenders of mercy, which you yet have, but then you muſt repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, which they were not, or elſe you you ſhall have no ſaving benefit by God's mercy, as they had not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God might be infinite in mercy, though thou (and thouſands ſuch as thou art) do periſh in thy bondage, and be for ever damned. What a proud blaſphemous tho't is this that God ſhould not be merciful, except he take thee reaking in thy ſins, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he take thee off thy Ale-Houſe-Bench, and put thee into Heaven. The greatneſs of God's mercy is not manifeſted ſo much by the number of the perſons that ſhall be ſaved, as by the way and method which he ſaveth them by. If God had ſaved but one man out of all the many millions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without his own deſert, and contrary
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004934_0047_100E334A571ADF08"/>
to it, by the death of his own Son, it would have been a plain demonſtration of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. Muſt thou meaſure the mercy of God by thy being ſaved, or not ſaved, while thou walkeſt contrary to his Laws, and to his revealed Will? This is, as if a <hi>Malefactor</hi> that for murder hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death, and is to be tried for his Life, yet hopes he ſhall eſcape, becauſe the Judge is a merciful man, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Judge proceedeth to paſs a ſentence of death upon him, you will all acknowledge he might be a very merciful man; and that the Priſoner was a fool, from the mercy of the Judge to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he ſhould eſcape the execution due unto him for the violation of the Law. So it is in this caſe, which is eaſieſt to apply.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God is juſt and true, as well as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and gracious, &amp; why mayſt thou not fear that God will damn thee, becauſe he as a juſt God, as well as hope that he will ſave thee becauſe he is a merciful God? You do not conceive of God aright, when you conſider him to be merciful without juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and to be gracious without truth, there are both in God. This merciful God hath ſaid, Except you repent and turn from ſin, you ſhall find no mercy from him; and what ſhall become of God's Truth, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:004934_0047_100E334A571ADF08"/>
to his Word he ſhould ſave the without repentance, and while thou goeſt on in thy ſinful ways? muſt God falſifie his word to ſave thy Soul, never hope for it, for he will never do it. Where God proclaims his mercy to the penitent, he doth alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his juſtice, and his jealouſie, and his fixed reſolution that the guilty ſhall not go free. <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.6, 7. and that he is full of fury to the wicked, as of mercy to the godly; and that as he reſerveth a Crown for the one, ſo alſo wrath for the other, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though God be merciful, yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth conditions in the Goſpel, which you muſt come up unto, if you will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his mercy: And God is reſolved that if thou wilt not have mercy upon the terms of mercy thou ſhalt never have it. When thou ſhalt come to put in thy claim for mercy, Lord have mercy on me, for thou art a gracious God; yes may God ſay, and ſo I am, and thoſe that have repented and believed ſhall find me to be ſo, but did I not alſo tell thee what manner of perſon thou ſhouldſt have been, holy, humble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, if thou wouldſt be ſaved by my mercy, but that thou wouldſt not be: therefore now I have no mercy for thee. God may ſay unto thee, did I ever promiſe thee or any
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:004934_0048_100E334DAFD59EE8"/>
other, that I would ſave thee, or them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance and faith in Chriſt my Son? did I ever promiſe that I would pardon the Impenitent? that I would ſave the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that finally perſevere therein? If I have, produce my words, alledge my promiſe; when and where, and by whom did I ever make thee ſuch a promiſe? and if I have not, as indeed I have not promiſed any ſuch thing, why waſt thou ſo vainly confident of my mercy? therefore take thy anſwer and be gone? for I tell thee I will have no mercy on thee. <hi>Luke.</hi> 13.25, 26, 27. mercy it ſelf will not ſave thee, but in the way of mercy propounded in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whereas thou ſayeſt, God did make thee, therefore he will ſave thee, conſider, the vileſt ſinner in the world upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhould go to Heaven, yea, every one of them. The Whoremonger whom thou thy ſelf wilt condemn might plead this as well as thou; and ſo thou wilt make the way to Heaven broader than ever God did make it. Moreover if thou hadſt continued ſuch a one as God did make, he would then have made thee happy indeed for ever. God made thee holy and upright, but thou haſt rebelled againſt him: God did make thee a Creature, but he did not make thee a Drunkard; he did not make thee a

Worlding, nor a Lyar, therefore let God's creature be holy, and God will not damn his creature; but if thou be a drundard, or an hypocrite, and God ſhall damn the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard or the hypocrite, what will become of God's creature. God doth peremptorily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this, and I will give it thee in his own words. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11—"It is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour." Is not this directly contrary to the reaſon of thy hope? wilt thou then plead this no more, while thou continueſt in thy ſin, and let not Satan keep thee bound with this cord any longer? if thou doſt, remember it hath been told thee, that this is but a ſandy foundation of thy hope, that thou ſhalt have the everlaſting mercy that ſhall be ſhown to God's redeemed ones, that are indeed delivered from their bondage and captivity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another Link in this Chain of falſe hopes whereby Captives are bound is a ſtrong (though falſe) perſwaſion of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the death of Chriſt the Redeemer. If you aſk many carnal, ignorant and ungodly perſons why they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they ſhall be ſaved, they will tell you, becauſe "Chriſt died for ſinners, and I am a ſinner (ſaith one) God help me, as

all men are, yea I am the chief of ſinners, and therefore I hope it ſhall go well with me;" and ſo will a ſecond ſay, and a third, and multitudes will give no better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, without care or knowledge of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of Chriſt unto them, and the virtue and power of it, for the killing of their ſins; and thus the very means for the redeeming of captives is abuſed to make their bonds the ſtronger, and keep them faſter bound in their Captivity.</p>
                     <p>By way of Conceſſion it is granted, (1) that "the dea of Chriſt, and the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made to the juſtice of God thereby is the only meirtorious cauſe of mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his bondage and of Salvation," and whoſoever is ſaved, is ſaved by Chriſt's death, for there is no other Saviour nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer beſides him, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. and if Chriſt had not died, we had certainly been for ever captives without redemption. (2) It is true that this Redeemer is offered unto all where the Goſpel is preached, none are excluded from the offers of grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and benefits of Redemption, and his death ſhall be ſufficient and effectual for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from bondage, and making of them free that do obey his call, and accept of him for Lord Redeemer, as offered in the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.

                     <p n="1">1. If this were enough to prove your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation, becauſe Chriſt died for Sinners, and you acknowledge your ſelves to be ſuch, then the damned ſouls in Hell might have hope of being delivered and ſaved; for they know that Chriſt died for Sinners, and they are now ſenſible that they are Sinners and miſerable, the pains they feel do convince them that they are ſinners. I know (as I have ſaid) that there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the ſtate of Devils and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souls, and of ſinners upon earth, Chriſt is preached to the one, and not to the other, freedom from bondage is poſſible to the one but not to the other, mercy doth entreat, and the Spirit doth ſtrive, and patience doth wait upon the one, but not upon the other; mercy and patience hath done with them for ever; no more aſking them, what? will you have Chriſt now? and will you be pardoned now? which yet thro' mercy is not your condition; but yet as to the ground of your plea for Redemption and Salvation by Chriſt, (before alledged) [Chriſt died for ſinners and you are ſinners]
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:004934_0050_100E33549F070610"/>
what is the difference? all men upon earth, and the damned in hell, that ever heard of Chriſt might ſay as much; and is it not matter of great aſtoniſhment to ſober ſerious men, to ſee poor ſinners bound ſo faſt in a captive-ſtate with this vain confidence of being ſet free by Chriſt, and yet can ſay no more than damned Souls might ſay, [That they are ſinners, and Chriſt died for ſinners.]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider that all ſhall not be ſaved by the death of Chriſt that are ſinners.

Know and underſtand that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Redemption, &amp; the compleating of all in ſalvation at the laſt is propounded by God in the Goſpel conditionally, and why then, ſhould you be ſo confident, when you have not come up unto the condition? there is pardon to be had by the blood of Chriſt, but there is a condition, without which you ſhall never pardoned, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. there is Salvation by Chriſt, but there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without which you ſhall never be ſaved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. there is juſtification to be had by the

Chriſt did not die, that ſinners meerly as ſinners ſhould be ſaved, for then all ſinners ſhould be ſaved, and that which is the reaſon of men's condemnation ſhould be a qualification of men's Salvation; but Chriſt did die, that believing ſinners might be ſaved, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and returning ſinners might be ſaved; Chriſt did die, that unholy ones might be made holy, and ſo be ſaved; that unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers might believe, and ſo be ſaved; and not that unholy and impenitent, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving perſons living and dying ſo ſhould have Salvation by his death.

and repairing of the Image of God in the Soul are neceſſary to Salvation in their place, as the death of Chriſt is neceſſary in its place, and for its end. As when many perſons be in bondage, and are taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that cannot give a ranſom for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the King's Son pays it down for them, but the King and his Son do propound cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conditions to the Captives, that if they will acknowledge him to be their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and will become his ſervants and his ſubjects, and be obedient to his Laws, they ſhall have the benefit of the ranſome, but not elſe; now ſo many as ſhall refuſe theſe conditions, muſt remain, and die, and periſh in their fetters, though a ſufficient ranſome were given for Redemption; ſo it is in this caſe, which is eaſy to apply.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you therefore, Sirs, do not any longer flatter and deceive your ſelves with ſuch groundleſs hopes of being delivered by the death of Chriſt from your ſlavery and bondage, without faith in him, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for your ſin.

as thoſe ſhould do, that do believe you muſt give an account to God at the great day, for what you hear, and how you do obey it; I charge you therefore in the name of the great eternal God, whoſe Truths I do declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that you do not hence forward hope for deliverance from Hell and wrath to come though Chriſt hath died, except you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, become new creatures, forſake your ſin, be ſanctified and made holy; and love him above all, and count all things but droſs in compariſon of the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt; that you do not continue drunkards, and yet hope you ſhall be ſaved, that you do not continue to love your ſins, and the world more than Chriſt, or remain unholy and unconverted, and yet think or hope that Chriſt's death ſhall ſave your Souls. If you do, and if you will ſtill ſo do, let God be witneſs for me, and let all thoſe that fear God in the Congregation be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for me, and let the conſciences of theſe Captives themſelves be witneſſes for me, that I have plainly from the Word of God given warning to you, that you do not periſh by this deceit; bear witneſs that I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that thoſe that have been Drunkards, Swearers, Profane, Lyars, Hypocrites, if they do repent and turn, become holy and believing perſons, they may, they ſhall be

Lord Jeſus open unto us! Lord Jeſus now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us with thy ſelf, ſave us, Oh ſave

us now from yonder place of torment, from yonder flaming fire, from yonder Lake of burning brimſtone! Oh ſend us not down to yonder dreadful place, for we truſted in thy merits, and hope to be ſaved becauſe thou hadſt died! Methinks I hear Jeſus the Judge reply to the priſoners at the bar, No, oh no, there is no room for you in Heaven; there is no entrance for ungodly men into the holy place; there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for any ſuch in the Kingdom of my Father; who bid you truſt to me for mercy, without believing on me? who bid you hope for Heaven becauſe that I was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without holineſs and repentance? Had you any warrant from me in my word ſo to do? or did my Miniſters whom I did ſend unto you tell you from me, that you may be ſaved by my death, though you did not repent, believe, nor were converted? did they? which is he? what is his name? Lo, here they ſtand, point him unto me, that did preach ſuch Doctrine to you. My Miniſters come forth, what do you ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Priſoners at the bar? Lord we told them in thy name that there was a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome paid for captives by thy bleſſed ſelf, and that thou waſt willing they ſhould have the everlaſting benefit thereof; and we did ſtudy for them, pray for them, and preach

But did you ever tell them that they ſhould be ſaved by my death, though they continued in their ſins; though they had no faith in me, though they were not ſanctified, nor converted? Oh no, our bleſſed Lord, we never did, we never did, there they ſtand before thee, they cannot ſay we ever did preach ſuch Doctrine to them; but on the contrary, we told them from thy word which we made the rule and matter of our Sermons, and turned them to the places, where thou haſt ſaid, without holineſs they ſhould not ſee thy face with comfort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. We bid them turn to <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. where thou toldſt them thy ſelf, that <q>he that believeth not ſhould be damned,</q> and to many more ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of thy mind to ſinners. Lord there ſtands one that did uſe to hear me, and he can not deny it; and there ſtands another that was uſed to hear me, and turned to the Chapter and the Verſe, and turned it down, as if he would have obſerved what thou haſt declared, Lord there he ſtands, he cannot
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:004934_0053_100E335A1142A3E0"/>
deny it, yea Lord, here is a whole cluſter of them ſtand together, that were wont to hear me, and there is not one amongſt them all that can deny but they were told of what now they find; and here are thoſe that did believe on thee through our preaching of thy Word, that can ſay and witneſs for us that we told them of the neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace, and faith in thee: In the ſame Sermon that we preached that thou didſt die for ſinners; we alſo told them that they muſt take thee for their Lord, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey thy Laws, and reſign their hearts and wills, and love, and all to thee, but they would not do it; but they never did it; this is the evidence that we give againſt the priſoners at the bar. Come then ye cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, is this true, or is it not? Yes, Lord our conſciences do compel us, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thy Miniſters did declare ſuch things unto us. Did they ſo? why then did you not believe them? go, get you gone, go get you down to your deſerved torments. Come hither, ye my glorious Angels take the Priſoners at the bar, that in their life-time were fettered and bound with chains of ſin. Now come ye, hither and take them, bind them hand and foot, and caſt them into utter darkneſs; drive them from my preſence; away with them,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004934_0054_100E335E4562B150"/>
away with them; come ye damned Devils, you took them captive, and kept them in their ſinful bondage. I would have redeemed them, and knockt off their fetters from them, but they would not hearken unto me, and now I will not hearken unto them, come take them then, and drag them down to the place of puniſhment, where you and they ſhall be for ever.</p>
                     <p>Oh woful Souls! poor wretched Sinners! ah poor condemned priſoners! how do they tremble? how do they hang down their heads? How are their countenances chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? what hideous out-crys? what doleful lamentations will there be at that day, and eſpecially by thoſe that hoped for Heaven, but their hopes are diſappointed? Methinks I hear them ſay, is all our hopes come to this? Is this the end of all our confidence? Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners we were to the Devil and our luſts, we might have been made free, Wo unto us that ever we were born, that we did befool our ſelves, and that theſe then tempting, and now tormenting Devils ſhould ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool us, contrary to the plain declarations of the Will of Chriſt, we ſhould ſo confidently hope for life and for ſalvation by him, while we did refuſe him for our Lord, and to yield obedience to him. Oh now we are aſhamed of our hope, of our vain and fooliſh
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004934_0054_100E335E4562B150"/>
hope, yet thus it is, we were deceived, and we are now diſappointed. Now farewell Chriſt for ever, now farewell Heaven for ever, and now farewell hope for ever. Hope we did, but now can hope no longer, but now can hope no more for ever. Farewell all ye holy bleſſed Angels, ye ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing for ever, while we ſhall be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever. Farewell all ye Saints of God, ye that are the Lord's redeemed, that once were captives as well as we, but ye were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the Blood of Chriſt, and were ſanctified and now are ſaved for ever, ye ſhall rejoyce, but we muſt mourn, ye are bleſſed, but we are curſed, ye ſhall be with God and Chriſt your Redeemer for ever, while we ſhall be with the Devil and his Angels for ever. Farewell, farewell, adieu, adieu, to all eternity.</p>
                     <p>Beloved hearers, if this ſhall be the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful end of vain and groundleſs hopes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable and unſcriptural confidence in the death of Chriſt, without faith and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying grace, be no longer kept as captives bound by this Chain of falſe hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another Link in this Chain of falſe hopes wherewith theſe captives are bound, is, that they have oftentimes great trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and inward terrours of mind after
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004934_0055_100E3361CB4905D8"/>
they have committed ſin, I have ſaith one, been troubled for my Oaths, and cried God forgive me, and if I have been drunk ſaith another, I have been troubled for it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it breaks my ſleep, and ſometimes I cannot eat in peace; nor think of my ſin but my heart is filled with horror at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it; and therefore I hope that I am redeemed by Chriſt, and got looſe from my bondage-ſtate, and that God will have mercy on me, and will ſave my Soul. I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Falſe repentance is a ſtrengthning of falſe hopes, and many times the more the ſinner is troubled for his ſin, the faſter he is bound in his ſinful captive ſtate; the more tears do fall from thine eyes, the faſter are thy fetters lockt on thy Soul, becauſe as true repentance maketh way for a well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peace of conſcience, and for ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſo a falſe and counterfeit repentance afterwards makes the ſinner more ſecure, and doth ſtrengthen his miſtake concerning his ſpiritual condition, he hath ſinned, and he hath ſorrowed, and now he thinketh all is well; and the Devil hath him faſter in his hold than he had before.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Terrours of Conſcience for ſin, though great and grievous, in ſo much that thou art reſtleſs and weary of thy life, are no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004934_0055_100E3361CB4905D8"/>
that of a captive thou art made free. Haſt thou ever been ſo much troubled as was <hi>Cain?</hi> or haſt thou ever been ſo filled with amazing horrors as was <hi>Judas?</hi> and yet theſe were captives to the Devil ſtill, and are bound in chains of ſin, and guilt, and puniſhment, to this day, and ſo ſhall be for ever; and who have greater terrors, reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and reproaches from their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, than the damned in Hell? and theſe terrors in thy ſoul and conſcience, might be the forerunners and beginning of thoſe helliſh horrors thou ſhalt be filled with in another world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But what are thy terrors and thy tears, the agonies and anguiſh of thy heart, without an inward change? What are all theſe legal fits of ſorrow, while thou art the ſame man in ſinning ſtill, and thy love the ſame unto thy ſin; and when the temptation comes, thy courſe and practice is the ſame? if thou wouldſt wear the ſkin from off thy knees by going often to confeſs thy ſins, and weep thy ſelf blind, and pine away with ſorrow; yet if thy heart do ſecretly like thy ſin, and thou ſtill art not inwardly renewed, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteſt of nor cloſeſt with Chriſt by faith; whatever thy apprehenſions are of thy good condition thou art ſtill a captive to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, eſpecially when one while thou ſeemeſt

with ſorrow to lament thy ſin, and another while doſt with pleaſure and delight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſin lamented; doſt commit the ſin, and then confeſs it; confeſs it, and go on again to commit; and ſo like a ſlave indeed, runneſt round in the Devil's Mill betwixt confeſſion and commiſſion of thy ſins; whereas in a true penitent there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the heart and the reformation of the life, a loathing and a leaving of the ſin lamented, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. &amp; 18.30, 31. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.7. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another Link in this Chain of falſe hopes, wherewith theſe Captives are bound, is, in that they have good meanings, and good wiſhes and deſires; and though they cannot diſcourſe as others can, nor have thoſe gifts that others have, yet they thank God their hearts are good, and ever were even from their childhood, and though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not utter themſelves, yet they have it in their hearts. Thus the Devil keepeth ſome in this fetter and this bond; but towards the breaking of it. Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Many have gone to hell with ſuch good meanings in their hearts, and with ſuch good wiſhes in their mouths; as <hi>Balaam</hi> for one, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10. <q>Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</q> Who would not wiſh to be forever happy?
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004934_0056_100E3363646F3988"/>
and who would not wiſh to be freed from eternal miſery, pain, and torment? But theſe things are not got with ſuch lazy wiſhes; neither do you approve of them in your idle ſervants, that ſit ſtill and wiſh their work were done.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But can your meaning be good, in many of your wicked acts, and in your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neglects? What good meaning is it in thee, to keep Chriſt out of thy heart? to prophane God's Sabbaths? What good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haſt thou, in neglecting to make thy peace with God? in not ſeeking after grace and fitneſs for Heaven?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If thy meaning were good, this doth not make thy action good, nor thy life good; and can it then prove thy condition to be good?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If thy heart were good, thy life would be ſo too. The life indeed might be good before men, where the heart is bad before God; but if the heart be good before God, the life will be good before men; for <q>a good tree bringeth forth good fruit</q> 
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.17, 18. and you not ſeeing the badneſs of your hearts, is an evidence that yet they are not good; and the more you juſtifie the goodneſs of your hearts, in the neglect of your duty, it is the clearer demonſtration that yet they are not good; and that thy heart
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004934_0057_100E33652374C458"/>
which thou vainly thinkeſt is the beſt part in thee, is indeed the worſt of all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9.10. Thou a good heart ever ſince thou waſt born! then there hath been a good Devil ever ſince he ſinned, and when he ceaſed to be good.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whereas thou ſayeſt, Thou haſt good things in thy heart, though thou canſt not expreſs them with thy tongue. What is thy heart ſo full of good? and is it ſo locked up there, that there is no vent for it? What! neither by works nor words? neither by lip nor life? A likely matter! If thou art pinched with hunger, thou haſt words enough to expreſs the ſenſe of thy wants, and if thou art ſick, thou haſt words enough to expreſs the ſenſe of thy pain: When the Phyſician comes and aſketh after the ſtate of thy body, thou canſt quickly reply, O ſick, ſick, Sir I am exceeding ſick; I am in pain, in pain Where? O here in this part, and in this; my back, my bowels, my head, my heart, is full of pain. But if a Miniſter come and enquire into your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate, you reply, Truly Sir, I have good things in my mind and in my heart, but I cannot expreſs them to you. What! not at all? What! nothing of this good boaſted of? no, not in broken language! But if we follow you to your Shops, there
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:004934_0057_100E33652374C458"/>
you want no words, there your tongues go glib: Who have words at command more than you? You can talk roundly of the World, of your Goods, and your Eſtates, of your Furniture and Apparel; but in the things of God you are mute. This is plain, it is not for want of words in theſe, but for want of a work of God upon their hearts. Therefore let not the Devil keep thee any longer bound with this chain, a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the goodneſs of thy heart, thy wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and thy meanings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Another Link in this chain of falſe hopes wherewith theſe Captives are bound, is on the contrary, in that they have ſtrong parts, great knowledge in the things of God, are very full of good diſcourſe; for the Devil hath ſeveral Fetters for his ſeveral Priſoners; and ſeveral Chains for ſeveral Captives, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ways and wiles to keep them in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and this is not the meaneſt nor the weakeſt, when men take gifts for grace, and common grace for ſpecial. But to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cutting of this chain, conſider,</p>
                     <p>There might be notional knowledge of the things of God, where a man never had any experimental taſte and reliſh of them. A man that never yet repented, might be able to tell you what Repentance is; and a man that is not converted, might tell you
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004934_0058_100E33682A8B28B8"/>
much of the Method of the Spirit in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of a ſinner. Many can talk of God, that never taſted any ſweetneſs in him; and many can diſcourſe of Heaven, that ſhall never enter into Heaven. The Head might be full of knowlege, when the heart is empty of Grace; might talk of faith, of the nature of it, of the actings of it, of the excellency of it, of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and effects of it, and yet have no Faith; and ſo of Love, and other graces, and yet have no Love, nor any other grace. The greater is your knowledge, the greater is your ſin, and the greater will be your miſery if it be ſeparated from practice and obedience, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47, 48.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have heard what a ſtrong bond falſe hope of Heaven is, and on what grounds it is built, and by what reaſons it is ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, and how they are removed: What ſay you now? will you continue ſtill bound with this cord, and ſtill be kept thereby in your Captivity? I doubt yet many of you will. Drunkards, for all this hath been ſaid, will hope for heaven and ſalvation ſtill; and Swearers and Prophane perſons will go on in their ſinful courſe, and yet hope ſtill for Heaven and Eternal life. Therefore becauſe this Fetter is ſo ſtrong, if poſſible to knock it off from theſe captive ſinners, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me to theſe few following queſtions.</p>
                     <p n="1">

What if Chriſt himſelf in perſon were now amongſt you, and preaching to you, and telling you with his own mouth, that theſe alledged grounds of thy hopes of Heaven, and redemption by his blood, were not ſound nor warrantable, wouldſt thou after this hope thou art redeemed, and ſhalt be ſaved? If Chriſt were viſibly preſent, and you ſhould hear him with your own ears telling you, that the Drunkard is a captive to the Devil, &amp; ſhall not be ſaved; would you ſay, No, we are not in bondage to the Devil, or our ſins, and therefore will hope we are redeemed and ſhall be ſaved? Wouldſt thou believe Chriſt himſelf? or wouldſt thou not? If thou wouldſt not, how ſhall I hope thou wilt hearken to my words? If thou ſayeſt thou wouldſt believe him, why then wilt thou not believe what Chriſt hath indeed already ſpoken, and left recorded in his Word? The ſame Doctrine that Chriſt preached in perſon in the world, is faithfully recorded in the Goſpel. In his Sermon that he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Mount, he tells you, that <q>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſs exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven,</q> 
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. And doth the righteouſneſs of groſs ſinners, yea or cloſe hypocrites, either exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:004934_0059_100E336C7A03FD60"/>
of the Phariſees and the Scribes, who walked ſo ſtrictly, that many would have judged, if but two men ſhould be ſaved the Scribe ſhould be one and the Phariſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? What Chriſt's Doctrines was, ſee again <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3.5. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. And yet when Chriſt tells you, "Except ye repent, ye ſhall periſh;" and <q>except ye believe, ye ſhall be damned; and except ye be converted, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of God;</q> you do remain captives ſtill; and do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor believe, nor are converted, and yet will you hope you are freemen, and ſhall be ſaved? The truth is, if you do not believe Chriſt's Miniſters preaching Chriſt's own words, neither would you believe Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <q>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me</q>; not to hear is to deſpiſe, and whom do you deſpiſe when you do not hear and obey the Doctrine preached according to the Scripture? is it poor mortal men? No but you deſpiſe Chriſt, and God himſelf. Believe me then, or believe rather Chriſt himſelf, that tells thee, without converting grace thou ſhalt be damned, and except thou art converted do not hope thou art delivered out of thy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:004934_0059_100E336C7A03FD60"/>
or that thou ſhalt be ſaved, and ſo be befooled by the Devil, and thereby be kept ſtill in bondage by him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What if God ſhould ſend an Angel from Heaven to thee, and tell thee while thou art a drunkard, ſwearer, prophane, a liar, an hypocrite, a worldling, art unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Thou art a captive to the Devil, and abiding ſo, ſhalt not be ſaved? Wouldſt thou after ſuch a meſſage from God by a glorious Angel, ſtill hope thou art made free, and ſhalt be ſaved? Or would you then leave your ſins, and look after Grace, and make it your buſineſs to get out of bondage? Why, if an Angel ſhould come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he would preach this Doctrine to you, the very ſame that is contained in the Word of God, or elſe a bleſſed Angel would be a curſed Creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. But behold, you have a ſurer and more certain way of knowing the mind of God, and that is the Scripture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. For if an Angel came from Heaven, you would be doubting whether he came from God or no; but that the Scripture is from God, we have plain, full, and undeniable reaſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and the Truth is, if you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture, neither would you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an Angel that ſhould come from Heaven.</p>

What if thou couldſt with ſafety draw near to the gates of Hell, and take a View of thoſe thouſands there in reſtleſs torments, that lived once as now thou doſt, and wert perſwaded that they were redeemed and made free, and that they ſhould be ſaved, as confidently as now thou art; Wouldſt thou ſtill continue in thy ſinful ſtate and courſe of life, and yet hope, after ſuch a ſight as this? That though thou ſaweſt ſo many thouſands damned before thee for the ſame ſins as thou liveſt in, wouldſt yet be confident, that thou ſhalt be delivered? Poor ſinner! what ſhall I do for thee? What ſhall I ſay unto thee? Will nothing convince thee, nor awaken thee on this ſide the flames of Hell? Wilt thou believe none of theſe truths, till thou ſhalt feel them all made good upon thee? Wilt thou be more brutiſh than thy very Beaſt, which thou canſt not force nor drive into a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire? And yet when thou art told there is a fire that is kindled, into which the ſlaves of ſin and Satan ſhall be caſt, will volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily walk in that way that leads thee to it? What if God ſhould take thee to ſome place, and bid thee ſtand and ſee ſo many millions rolling in a lake of Brimſtone, and bid thee ſtand, and hearken, and hear their groans and hideous howlings, their doleful outcries,

Methinks ſuch ſights and hearings of ſuch things, ſhould awaken and alarm thee: Why, tell me then, Why, ſhouldſt thou not believe the True Eternal God, as well as thy own Eyes and Ears? Such are there that died without Repentance and Faith, that died in their bondage-ſtate; and the ſame God that hath already damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, doth alſo threaten thee for the ſame ſins with the ſame damnation; and yet ſhall Satan ſtill keep thee bound with this falſe hope of a better place?

What if God ſhould ſend one of thy Acquaintance and Companions that hath been in Hell a year or two, a month or two, one that thou waſt wont to ſwear and ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with, to drink with and carouſe, whoſe Corps not long ſince thou followeſt to the grave; whoſe ſoul when ſeparated from the body, went down to Hell; ſhould come to thee and ſay, I was wont to be merry and jovial in thy company; with thee I was wont to game and ſport, and waſte and ſpend my precious time, and I hoped I ſhould be ſaved when I died, as now thou doſt: But wo is me, I was miſtaken to my everlaſting ſhame and ſorrow; I find I was deceived; I find I did but flatter and delude my ſelf; I would not believe it, but now I find it; I would not believe it, but now I feel it. Miniſters did warn me of this place, and told me I was going thither, but I would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced till I came to Hell: I hoped ſtill I ſhould go to Heaven, but now I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, alas, when it is too late to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; I am at laſt convinced. Believe me, though a damned ſoul, believe me, the Word of God is true, the threatnings of God are true, and what your Miniſters preach out of God's Word concerning ſin, and miſery by ſin, it is all true; believe me now, that have been in Hell ever ſince the

I died, that the bondſlaves of the Devil, that dye in their captivity, do all go down to this dark and dreadful Dungeon. If one of thy Neighbours not long ſince departed and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhould thus appear to thee in thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the ſilent night, and bring thee ſuch tidings as theſe, wouldſt thou believe him and repent, and refuſe thence forwards to be a Servant and Slave unto the Devil? It may be thou thinkeſt thou ſhouldſt believe this Doctrine then, and take warning and reform and mend thy ways. Tell me then, Should not the True Eternal God of Heaven be believed ſooner, rather, more, than a damned ſoul in Hell? But certain it is, if thou wilt not believe the Scriptures, nor the Miniſters of God that preach the Truths of God unto thee, nor repent and turn from the drudgery of the Devil to the ſervice of the Lord, neither wouldſt thou do it if one came to thee from the dead, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.27, to the end.</p>

Or wouldſt thou ſtill live as now thou doſt, and hope again upon the ſame grounds as now, that thou ſhouldſt not the ſecond time be caſt into that place of torments?

Poor Priſoner! what doſt thou think of it? what ails thee? why art thou no more concerned at the hearing of theſe things? wilt thou ſtill remain in the fools paradiſe? why do I preach, and why doſt thou come and hear, if thou wilt not regard what is ſpoken to thee from the word of God, in the name of God? Oh how hard a thing is it, to ſtand and view ſo many Souls, and think after all the ſtudy, pains, prayer, and preaching, for you and to you, ſo many ſhould ſtill be in the Devils fetters, and are going in chains to the priſon of hell, and bound faſt in ſin to a place of everlaſting torments? Oh how ſhall I do to bear the thoughts of your damnation? O it is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it is a burden, it is indeed a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to my Soul to think that any of you ſhould be damned; that you ſhould go from hence to hell; from a place of Solemn worſhip to a place of torment and of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. Do you think it is not enough to break a poor Miniſters heart, to preach and labour that your bonds may be broken, and your ſouls eſcape and ſet at liberty, and after all you are in fetters ſtill?

ſome do hearken and obey, were it not that ſome give great grounds of hope that they are leaving off the Devils ſervice, and that their Chains are broke, it would be a ſore temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to preach no more; but alas! that though ſome are ſet at liberty, what ſhall we do for the reſt that ſtill remain in bonds? eſpecially in this, that is ſo ſtrong, a falſe perſwaſion that you are already free, and falſe hopes that you ſhall be for ever ſaved.

"The Hypocrites hope ſhall periſh," 14. <q>Whoſe hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe truſt ſhall be a ſpider's web.</q> If your hope periſh, ſhall not your Souls pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh too? If your hope be cut off, will not your Souls be cut ſhort of Heaven hoped for? if your hope be as a Spider's web, can it be a ſure hope? can the Spider's web ſtand before the broom? God at furtheſt with the beſom of Death ſhall ſweep your hope away.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is <hi>Job</hi> 11.20. <q>But the eyes of the wicked ſhall fail and they
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:004934_0064_100E337B493AB778"/>
ſhall not eſcape, and their hope ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</q> Thou poor Captive, lookeſt for heaven, but thy eyes ſhall fail before thou haſt it; thou lookeſt for happineſs, but thou ſhalt look thy eyes out, before (without being made free by Chriſt) thou ſhalt enjoy it; thou hopeſt thou ſhalt eſcape wrath and hell, but thou ſhalt not eſcape; it is the true infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God that ſaith, thou ſhalt not eſcape, and thy hope ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt, in theſe reſpects:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A man is loth to give up the Ghoſt: it is the laſt thing he doth. Thou art loth to give up thy falſe hopes of heaven; except God prevent it, it will be the laſt thing thou wilt do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A man muſt give up the Ghoſt, tho' he be never ſo loth to do it; he would not die, but he muſt; thou muſt at laſt give over hoping; though thou keep this hope till thou dieſt, yet then thou ſhalt hope no more; it is as impoſſible for you to keep theſe hopes forever, as it is for you to live upon earth forever.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A man that gives up the Ghoſt, by all the power on earth cannot be called to life again. When thy Soul and Body part, then thy ſoul and hope ſhall part, and thou ſhalt loſe both hope and ſoul together. The
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:004934_0064_100E337B493AB778"/>
parting of the Soul and Body is a ſad part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the parting of the ſoul and hope is a ſadder parting; and when thy ſoul hath parted with its hopes at death, hope ſhall never return again; thy Soul parted from thy body ſhall return to it again, but not thy hope unto thy ſoul; thy body falls and ſhall riſe again, but there ſhall never be a reſurrection of thy hope.</p>
                     <p>Some tranſlate theſe words thus, <q>And their hopes ſhall periſh at the expiration of the ſoul.</q> The ſinner ſhall breathe out his ſoul and hope at once. Theſe words [The giving up of the Ghoſt] are but two words in the Hebrew Text; and the one ſignifies not only the ſoul, but alſo the breath, or a puff of wind, and the other, ſignifieth to blow, which imports, that the hope of wicked men, the Devil's Captives, ſhall be but as a puff of wind, or as the blaſt of a man's mouth: and one of the words doth ſignifie ſometimes to grieve and to be ſad; ſo the hope of theſe Captives ſhall end in ſorrow and ſadneſs; it ſhall make him ſad, to puff and blow, that he truſted for ſuch great and weighty things as Heaven and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon ſuch ſlight and ſlender grounds. Again, the Hebrew Word hath another ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, to deſpiſe, and loath, and nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a thing; this may teach us, that though
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:004934_0065_100E337EA8EB1130"/>
theſe captives do now think well of their hope, yet at laſt they ſhall loath it, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it, as a man will do ſome rotten and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury thing. Now you will not loath your ſins, but hereafter you ſhall loath your very hope: now you will not loath your ſelves for your iniquity, but hereafter you ſhall for your folly.</p>
                     <p>The third Text is, <hi>Job</hi> 27.28. <q>For what is the hope of the hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul?</q> yea, what is it indeed? thou haſt gained riches, and thou haſt gained in a way of hypocriſy, which men could not judge of, credit and eſteem, a name of a good, and holy, zealous man! but what is this gain, or what is thy hope, though thou haſt gained the name of being religious, when God taketh away thy ſoul? from whence? from thy Body; whither? to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal torments; what will be your hope then? and will you ſtill be bound by this chain? this hath had a greater proportion of time than can be allowed to the reſt, becauſe I judge it to be one of the ſtrongeſt bonds in which multitudes are carried captive to the helliſh priſon.</p>

The devil uſeth various, yea, contrary means and methods to hold faſt ſinners in their bonds; if he can, he will keep them from a ſight and ſenſe of ſin and miſery thereby: If he cannot, but God openeth a ſinners eyes and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his conſcience, the Devil will ſet out his ſins with all the aggravations of them, but endeavours to keep from the ſight of Chriſt; ſometimes perſwading ſinners that their ſins are not ſo great, but they may do well enough, ſometimes that they are ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that there is no hope, nor help for them: ſometimes he blinds their eyes that they ſee no need of a Saviour; ſometimes he ſhews them their ſin in a multiplying or magnifying Glaſs, that a Saviour can do

The mercies of God are more and greater than thy ſins, let them be never ſo great, never ſo many; thy wickedneſs doth not exceed God's Goodneſs; his goodneſs is the goodneſs of a God, and his mercy the mercy of a God, and therefore Infinite, without bounds, limits, or meaſure. It is as eaſy for Infinite mercy to forgive many ſins as few, and great as ſmall; the Sea co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth great Rocks as well as the ſmalleſt Sands. If thou haſt a multitude of ſins, God hath a multitude of mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1. if thou haſt manifold ſins, God hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold mercies, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.19. if thou haſt abundantly ſinned, God can and will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7, 8. if thy ſins be ſins of all ſorts, of all ſizes, God can and will forgive iniquity tranſgreſſion and ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. only be thou willing, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily willing to leave thy ſins, only be thou willing, ſoundly willing, unfeignedly will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to accept of mercy, as it is tendered to thee, and of Chriſt the Redeemer as he is offered to thee, and the number, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy ſin ſhall not hinder thee from pardon and ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The merits of Chriſt the Redeemer are fully ſufficient to purchaſe pardon for thy ſins, were they more, and greater than they be. Dareſt thou ſay thy ſinnings are more

than Chriſt's ſufferings? or that thy debts for which thou art in bonds are more than Chriſt the Surety for poor captives is able to ſatisfy and pay? Chriſt hath more pardons, than thou haſt ſin; more healings than thou haſt wounds; there is more in Chriſt to ſave thee, than in thy ſins to condemn thee: thy ſins, are but pennies in compariſon of the pounds that Chriſt hath to pay. Come forward then poor captive ſinner, approach nearer to thy Lord-Redeemer, come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, why doſt thou go from him? come, and though thou doubt, yet do not deſpair. If thou hadſt not been a ſinner, thou wouldſt have ſtood in no need of a Saviour; and the greater ſinner thou haſt been, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter haſte thou ſhouldſt make unto a Saviour: methinks I hear Chriſt calling to thee, poor ſinner, why art thou thus diſmayed at the ſight and thoughts of thy iniquities! come unto me, and I will help thee! why art thou thus caſt down, at the remembrance of what a ſinner thou haſt been, and what wickedneſs thou haſt done? come, I have healing for thy wounds, I have plaiſters for thy ſores; come to me, I will ſurely help and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:004934_0067_100E338350D6F960"/>
and I will get and give thee pardon of thy ſins. Methinks I hear him ſay, thou crieſt out becauſe thou haſt ſinned, and if thou hadſt not, there had been no need of my coming from heaven to earth, there had been no need of my dying on the Croſs. Art thou a ſinner? I knew thou waſt, and therefore I came on purpoſe for to help thee: art thou a loſt ſinner? I know thou waſt, and therefore I came to ſeek thee: art thou a captive bound in fetters? I know thou waſt, and therefore came to eaſe thee, and releaſe thee; only be but heartily willing to receive me for thy Prophet, Prieſt and King; and conſent to the conditions of the Goſpel, and do no more deſpond as if there were no hope, nor help for thee; come hither, and ſee me in my ſweat and agony; come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and behold the wounds made in my ſide, my feet, my hands, my heart and all, and theſe I ſuffered for ſuch ſinners; look through the wounds made in my ſide, and ſee if thou canſt not there ſee Love in my heart, and pity in my heart to poor return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners: what did I ſuffer for, and what did I bleed and die for, but to help and ſave poor ſinners? come, to me, and I will be thy friend; come to me, believe on me, receive me, and God will be thy friend. So then poor captive Soul, if thou be willing

indeed, willing to leave thy ſins, thy fetters and thy bonds to reſign thy will, thy love, thy heart to Chriſt, make him thy end, and take him, for thy Lord Redeemer, there's no reaſon thou ſhould deſpair of pardon and ſalvation; let not then Satan keep thee in this bond, from coming unto Chriſt, to be ſet at liberty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thy ſins and thy wickedneſſes, are not greater, are not more than all the ſins of all the elect of God were that are now in Heaven, and yet mercy hath pardoned them, and yet Chriſts merits hath purchaſed life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them, and they are now in poſſeſſion of it: if thou haſt out-ſinned any one ſingle man, yet haſt thou committed more, or greater ſins, then all the ſins of all the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions now in glory, put them all together; and yet hath God been able and willing to pardon them, and Chriſt able and willing to ſave them? if thou wilt repent and believe, as they did thou ſhalt be ſaved as they are! if thou wilt leave thy ſins and be converted, as they were, do not deſpair, nay, do not doubt, but thou ſhalt be happy as they be. Haſt thou ſinned more than <hi>Adam</hi> did, that at one blow did wound and kill ſo many ſouls, as never man did the like, no, nor never ſhall again? Haſt thou ſinned more than <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> read and judge, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.1 to

Haſt thou ſinned more than <hi>Peter,</hi> that did ſwear and curſe he know not Jeſus? or more than <hi>Mary Magdalen?</hi> or if thou couldſt ſay, thou haſt ſinned more than any one of theſe, yet haſt thou ſinned more than all theſe put together, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thouſands more? thou canſt not ſay it. Why then, what is the matter with thee, that thou ſitteſt in thy chains lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy ſelf, ſaying, there is no hope for me, there is no help, no merry for me? what! no hope for a ſinner, and a Saviour by thee? no help, no deliverance for a Captive, and the Ranſom paid, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer come unto thee, waiting that thou wouldſt be but willing to receive him for thy Lord and Saviour, and he is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee. Say, O ſay then, what did this tempting Devil mean, one while to draw into ſin, becauſe it was no great matter he did tempt me to? and what now doth this accuſing Devil mean, that when he hath wounded me, would perſwade me, there is no healing for me? O my ſoul! once this enemy did befool thee, when he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, thee, thy condition was ſo good that thou didſt not need to fear, and now ſhall he befool thee, to make thee think thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004934_0069_100E338AC6895318"/>
is now ſo bad, that there is no reaſon why thou ſhouldſt hope? Tell him, O tell him, that yet his condition is not thine; though thou haſt ſinned, as he hath done, yet there is a Saviour offered unto thee, that never was, that never ſhall be offered unto him; Oh my ſoul! Satan is bound in this chain of deſpair himſelf, and it never can be knocked off; tell him then, O mine enemy thou canſt not repent, and therefore canſt not hope; thou canſt not believe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore canſt not be ſaved; Chriſt did not die for thee, but he died for ſinful men, that ſhall have the benefits of his death by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him; Oh I will now repent, and by the grace of God I will believe, and while the Devil doth deſpair and would hold me from going unto Chriſt, by deſpairing too; yet ſince there is mercy in God and merit in Chriſt, whereby others have been ſaved, and this offered unto me, God doth call me, and Chriſt doth call me, and the Spirit ſtriveth with me to come to Chriſt, and mercy is promiſed if I do, and pardon is promiſed if I do; why then ſhould I ſit here lamenting of my doleful caſe? or why do I ſit here deſpairing of mercy? I will ariſe and go and venture to caſt my ſelf on Chriſt, and truſt my ſoul with him. If I ſtay here from Chriſt, I am ſure I ſhall
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:004934_0069_100E338AC6895318"/>
periſh; but if I go, it may be I ſhall live. Did I ſay it may be, oh God hath declared in his word that if I do repent, and believe, that it ſhall be, that I ſhall be ſaved. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve therefore as thoſe four Lepers, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.3.4. that ſaid one to another, <q>Why ſit we here until we die. If we ſay we will enter into the City, then the famine is in the City, and we ſhall die there; and if we ſit ſtill here, we die alſo. Now therefore come, and let us fall into the Hoſts of the Syrians: if they ſave us alive, we ſhall live; and if they kill us we ſhall but die.</q> If thou ſitteſt ſtill in thy natural ſtate, and wilt not go to Chriſt, thou ſhalt ſurely die, and if thou goeſt to him, thou needs not ſay I can but die, for if thou goeſt, thou ſhalt not die. So then (though all this be no ground to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any to go on in ſin, and yet hope for Heaven, who were ſpoken to before, yet) all this is reaſon of encouragement to thoſe that have already ſinned, and are penitentially grieved that they have ſo done, that they ſhould now deſpair as once they did preſume; and the Lord grant that as you have been convinced and awakened, that you might be no longer kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage by preſumption, ſo now you might go to Chriſt the Redeemer of Captives, and

                     <p n="3">3. ANother Chain wherewith many of theſe Captives are bound is their ſatisfying themſelves with a moral blameleſs life; faith one, I live peaceably among my neighbours; I defraud no man, I am juſt in all my dealings; I give to every one their due; ſaith another, I am no drunkard, no ſwearer, no open profaner of Sabbaths, no man can lay any thing to my charge, nor ſay black is my eye. Many ſinners reſt here, and do perſwade themſelves their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is good and do not think that they are in bondage to the Devil, and ſo do not look out after Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Though all this be good in it ſelf, yet it doth not argue that thy condition is good, becauſe it is not ſufficient to ſalvation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as God requireth this and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more; nay, much more than this that thou mayſt be meet for Heaven; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the breaking of this bond, Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Negative holineſs is not a ground of hope for future glory, nor a proof of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:004934_0070_100E338F0DE1ECB0"/>
good condition. Negatives in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to affirmative Precepts will damn, but negatives in reference to forbiding Precepts will not ſave. There are commands of God enjoyning you to repent, and believe, to pray and to forſake ſin; your not repenting, not believing will undo your ſouls; and there are commands enjoyning you to be no drunkards, to be no ſwearers, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud, nor over reach others in your dealings; now if you be no drunkards, yet if you are not believers you are ſtill in Satan's bonds: you muſt not only not do evil, but you muſt alſo do that which is good. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.42.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If thou art of an unblameable life, yet thou haſt a corrupt and ſinful heart; if thou, hadſt been free all thy life long from every actual ſin, (as thou art not) yet there is ſin enough in thy heart to ſink thee to the loweſt hell. There is heart-adultery, and heart-murder, pride of heart, and unbelief in thy heart; ſo that though thou ſayſt, fair is thy life, yet God doth ſee, that foul and filthy is thy heart; and it is not unblameableneſs; of life only, but purity of heart too, that muſt qualifie you for the enjoyment of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
                     <p>Haſt thou wronged no man? what! nor God neither? doſt thou give to every man
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:004934_0071_100E3391E0D58868"/>
his due? what! and to God too? thy heart is God's due, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. doſt thou give to God thy heart, which is his due? thy love and obedience is God's due, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37. doſt thou indeed give theſe to God? thy time, and ſervice, and religious worſhip is God's due. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10 doſt thou deny theſe unto God, and yet boaſt thou giveſt to every one their due? or doſt thou look upon it as an evil, to withhold from man, that which doth belong to him, and is it not a greater evil to without from God, that which doth belong to him? wilt thou pay to men, and rob God, and yet hold thy ſelf guiltleſs? wilt thou be righteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, and unholy towards God, and yet hold thy ſelf innocent? whereas the ſame God that doth command thee to live ſoberly towards thy ſelf, and righteouſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, doth alſo charge thee to be holy towards him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. What if thou art at peace with all men, if thou art not at peace with God? art thou not a captive ſtill? what, if thou art in charity with all the world (as thou makeſt thy boaſt) if thou haſt no love to God? art thou not in fetters ſtill? what if thou beareſt no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in thy heart to any man, yet if thy heart be full of hatred and enmity to God, hath not the Devil yet faſt hold on thee? Didſt
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:004934_0071_100E3391E0D58868"/>
thou never read <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.18, 19, 20. that that Moraliſt ſaid as much as thou doſt ſay, and yet he remained ſtill in the bonds of his Iniquity? Didſt thou never read <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. where the Phariſee boaſted unto God himſelf, that he <q>was not as other men are, that he was no Extortioner, no Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, nor unjuſt, and yet being not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied was faſt bound in the guilt of ſin</q>? A moral man without converting, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace, is like a Swine in a fair Meadow; that though it be not there wallowing in the mire yet it is a ſwine ſtill. Oh then ſtay not here; ſince there are many now in hell that were not common drunkards, ſwearers, nor profane debauched perſons, let not Satan keep thee any longer bound in thy captive ſtate with this bond of thy applauded moral converſation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Another Chain with which ſome Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are bound, is their reſting in religious and holy duties; theſe go a ſtep higher than the former, and yet are as faſt bound as others be, and faſter too; for when many groſs ſinners are delivered from captivity, and their bonds are broke, Hypocrites are faſt intangled with chains of their own making. Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdom of God, when Hypocrites are ſhut out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31 as Paul compared
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:004934_0072_100E3394ECB20440"/>
himſelf with others 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22.23. <q>Are they Hebrews? ſo am I. Are they Iſraelites? ſo am I. Are they the ſeed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> ſo am I. Are they Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt?—I am more, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours more abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons more frequent, in deaths oft.</q> So hypocrites comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thoſe that are ſet at liberty by Chriſt in reſpect of all external duties, and common gifts conceiting that therefore they are free too, are the faſter bound. Are God's free-men much in prayer? ſo am I, ſaith the Hypocrite. Are they frequent in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? ſo am I. Are they admitted to all Ordinances, and received into Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip by the godly, ſtrict, and careful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt? ſo am I. Do they talk and diſcourſe of God, and Chriſt, and Heaven? ſo do I, and more than many of them do. Do they ſuffer for Religion, and have been in bonds and priſons for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhipping of God? So have I.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſtrong bonds, and the more they pray and hear, the ſtronger are their bonds, while they are praying and hearing, the Devil is binding theſe captive-hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſo much the faſter, and this is their miſery more eſpecially, that theſe Chains which are made for their cloſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:004934_0072_100E3394ECB20440"/>
they do look upon as chains of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and do glory in them. For the breaking of this Bond, Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The external performance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties hath been done by many now in Hell, ſome of the now damned ſouls when in their bodies, were often preſent at Sermons as well as you, and often on their knees as well as you; and yet were then in the bonds of ſin, and you alſo yet may be, and are now in chains in utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which God in mercy grant you may never be. Outward duties may be done to God, when there is inward prevailing love to ſelf, to ſin, and to the world; it is not ſo much the matter as the manner of your duties, that argues your freedom from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, not what you do, as for what end you do them, that doth diſtinguiſh the Devil's captives from the Lord's free-men, Chriſt plainly tells you, that not every one that makes a profeſſion of Religion ſhall be delivered from the priſon of Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22, 23. and that the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt into outer darkneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. Know therefore though you ſhould hear ten thouſand Sermons, and make as many prayers, yet without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward real change by converting grace upon your hearts, except you love God above all,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:004934_0073_100E33968A552C10"/>
and chuſe and prize Chriſt before all, that you may not be releaſed from captivity for the preſent, nor ſaved hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is no certain judgment can be made of your ſpiritual ſlavery or freedom by the thoughts that others have of you. Men judge charitably, but God judgeth certainly. Men judge of your hearts by your actions, but God judgeth of your Actions by your hearts; you might be admitted among the pureſt Congregation and yet not admitted into Heaven. If Chriſt himſelf were upon the earth thou mighteſt be an hearer of Chriſt, and yet a captive to the Devil. Chriſt tells you as much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26, 27, 28. And I pray you, what is it to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded or approved by men, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God? You are not to ſtand or fall, to be damned or ſaved by what men think of you, but by what God knows of you. Remember <hi>Judas,</hi> that carried himſelf ſo amongſt others, that the reſt of the diſciples did rather ſuſpect themſelves than him, ſaying, Lord is it I? and another, Is it I, when Chriſt told them, one of them ſhould betray him. Remember him and beware, that as others are bound cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives with the bonds of open and viſible ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that you remain not bound with the bonds of hidden and ſecret Hypocriſie.</p>

                     <p n="8">8. ANother Chain by which ſome are held captive is the Examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And theſe are either the examples 1. of thoſe that lived formerly, or 2. thoſe that are now alive. And ſaith one, <q>I am of the ſame Religion as my fore-fathers were; my Father, and my Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were of this way; and who will ſay our fore-fathers were not Redeemed nor are ſaved? who will ſay our fore-fathers died captives and are gone down to hell? will any zealous Preacher of them all condemn our Fore-fathers?

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if we look unto this preſent age, ſaith another, <q>the greateſt part of the world live as I do, or worſe; and if my condition is not good, God help many others: will God ſend ſuch multitudes to hell? and if I be damned, wo be to thouſands, it will be others caſe as well as mine;</q> Both theſe ways are perſons held in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity; towards breaking then of this Bond and cutting off of this Chain, conſider in anſwer to the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="146" facs="unknown:004934_0074_100E3399F1EB5BA0"/>1. We have nothing to do to paſs any ſentence upon your Fore-fathers, they are out of the reach of our preaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations: them we leave to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment of God, who hath diſpoſed of them before this day to the places where they muſt for ever be; and God doth not ſend us to tell you, whither your Fore-fathers ſouls are gone; our Meſſage is to you that are yet alive, and our buſineſs and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to tell you of your ſin and miſery, and to call you unto repentance, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the conditions of peace to be made betwixt God and you: to tell you, what you muſt be, and what you muſt do to eſcape the Damnation of Hell, and to be partakers of the Redemption which Chriſt hath purchaſed for poor captive ſinners.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You might be of the ſame profeſſion of Religion as your Fore-fathers were, and they might be ſaved, and yet you might be damned; they might be redeemed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and yet you remain captives ſtill. Your Fore-fathers profeſſed faith in Chriſt, did pray to God, and performed religious duties unto God, as you profeſs to do; and yet if they did theſe things ſincerely, and you hypocritically, they in reality and you in ſhew, their ſouls are now in glory and at reſt, where your ſouls notwithſtanding
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:004934_0074_100E3399F1EB5BA0"/>
may never be. Many of the ſame age make the ſame profeſſion, and yet ſome are good, and ſome are bad, ſome are made free, and ſome continue captives: as the five fooliſh Virgins made the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as the wiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1 to 13. and <hi>Judas,</hi> as the reſt of the Diſciples; and yet the one was captivated, while the others were Redeemed; and ſo it may be with perſons that live and profeſs in ſeveral ages.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But why ſhould you content your ſelves in being ſuch as your Fore-fathers were? though I do not, dare not, will not ſay that they are damned; yet are you ſo ſure that they are ſaved? are you all ſure, that all your Fore-fathers did believe, and did repent; that they were all ſanctified and ſaved? if ſo, ſurely that age was better than this, and better it would have been to have lived then, than Now. But if they did not believe, did not repent, would you then go to the place where now they are? or would it be any eaſe to your pain, to meet any of your Fore fathers there? your wiſeſt, ſafeſt courſe, is not to ſay, we will live as our Fore-fathers did, but as God in his Word doth command and direct you to do.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But why might you not be wiſer and better than your Fore-fathers were? Were they perfect in Wiſdom and goodneſs? If

they were not wiſe indeed for heaven and their ſouls, and if they were not good indeed, you muſt be wiſer and better than they were, or you ſhall not be ſaved. If they were truly wiſe and good, it was their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and their grief that they were no wiſer, and no better, and why ſhould that be a fault in you to be wiſer than they were, which they complained of as a fault in themſelves that they were no wiſer, and no better than they were?</p>
                     <p>Beſides, would you not be richer than your Fore-fathers were? and greater and more honourable in the World if poſſible you can? Do not you labour for greater Eſtates than they had, had they much or had they little? had they little, would not you have much? had they much, would not you have more? If you would be richer and greater, why may you not endeavour to be wiſer and to be better than they were?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. What if ſome of your Fore-Fathers ſhould come from the Dead, and tell you they were miſtaken, and deceived, and are damned, and have been in Hell ever ſince they died, would you think your ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned then to be wiſer and to be better than they were? if your Father or your Fathers Father ſhould come to any of you, and ſay, Oh! do not flight Chriſt as we did, do not

you our poſterity remain in a natural ſtate as we did, and are now ſuffering the wrath of God, and the vengeance of eternal flames; Oh do not follow our example, nor lead your lives as we did, and neglect to worſhip God in your families, or do it by the halfs, careleſly and negligently as we did, leſt you come to the ſame place of torment, as we are condemned into, and muſt be in for ever: take the Scripture for your rule, and not our example; do not follow us, oh do not follow us in ſin, in careleſs neglect of God and Chriſt, leſt you follow us to hell and to damnation too. If you content your ſelves to live and die as we did, captives to the Devil; and your children after you, content themſelves to follow and to imitate you, as you do to imitate and follow us, the race that did deſcend from us will be damned from one generation to another. Would you after ſuch warning as this, plead your Fore-fathers examples no more? let not then the Devil lead you any longer captives by this bond of their example, as if this were more binding than the commands of God.</p>
                     <p>For the breaking of the other piece of this Cord wherewith the Devil binds his Captives; the examples of thoſe that live in the ſame age, the moſt live as I do, will

God damn ſuch multitudes if it go ill with me, God help many others. Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The moſt, are not the beſt. The greateſt number is of the bad ſort of men. Chriſt's flock is but little, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. while the Devil hath great droves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14. If thou wilt follow the multitude they will lead thee to a place of ſorrow, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. At the day of judgment there will be no eſcaping in a croud. Thou ſhalt not ſpeed the better becauſe multitudes ſin as well as thou; If thouſands continue cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Devil, they ſhall all be damned? God will damn millions of men, rather than falſifie his Word, if Men ſin in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they ſhall ſuffer in companies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Multitudes are carried Captives to Hell, will not make thy Chains the lighter, nor thy pains the eaſier: when thou art in hell, to lye there and look round about thee, and ſee multitudes there beſides thy ſelf, will be no mitigation of thy torments. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes ſinning doth not leſſen thy ſin, and multitudes being Damned will not leſſen thy Damnation. God hath wrath enough for thee and them: though he pour out more upon millions, than they can bear, yet he hath enough to inflict on thee, and more than thou canſt endure. Wouldſt thou be in Turkiſh ſlavery, becauſe more are there
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:004934_0076_100E33A24EB169E0"/>
beſides thy ſelf. Seriouſly ponder this, and let not Satan keep thee captive to bear others company.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Another Chain wherewith theſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are kept in their bondage-ſtate, is their purpoſing hereafter to repent and forſake their ſins. In thy Childhood thou didſt purpoſe to repent when thou ſhouldſt come to man's eſtate; then, when thou ſhouldſt be old, and now, when thou comeſt to be ſick and die, and thus from thy Birth to thy Death, thou continueſt a Captive to Satan, and to ſin thou waſt born a Captive, and by theſe delaying purpoſes dieſt ſo. To break this bond, Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Who was it that did aſſure thee that thou ſhalt certainly live to that time in which thou purpoſeſt to repent? Did God or Man? Man cannot; God doth not want to tell ſinners how long they ſhall live. How comeſt thou to have this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above others? no, I have not. No? what? and yet purpoſe to repent, and ſhake off the Devil's bonds hereafter, when thy body might be in thy grave, and thy ſoul in hell before that time may come? where will be thy repentance then? are not as young as thou art, gone down into the pit of grave and hell too? Go and view the burial places of the dead, meaſure and ſee if
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:004934_0077_100E33A4A22B1200"/>
there be no grave as ſhort as thou art, and many graves of Infants there. Thou art here to day and mighteſt be in eternity to morrow. Now alive, to morrow mayſt be dead. All fleſh is compared to graſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.30. to a vapour, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15. Was not he a fool that reckoned he had many years to live, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19, 20? When thou goeſt to bed, how knoweſt thou, that thou ſhalt riſe any more? when thou falleſt a ſleep that thou ſhalt awake, till the Trumpet ſound, and the call be, Ariſe ye dead and come to judgment?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How knoweſt thou that when thou ſhalt be ſick, that thou ſhalt have the uſe of thy Reaſon and Underſtanding? if not; where is thy repentance then? haſt thou not often ſeen ſick perſons to be deprived of their underſtanding? Not capable of aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or receiving of counſel and advice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is repentance in thy own power? or canſt thou repent when thou liſt? canſt thou? the more thou art to blame, the more is thy ſin, and ſhame, that thou doſt not now repent. Canſt thou not? the more is thy folly, to put it off as tho' thou couldſt: Nay, the longer thou continueſt in thy ſin, the harder thy heart will be, and the harder is thy heart, the harder work
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:004934_0077_100E33A4A22B1200"/>
will it be for thee to break it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Doſt thou read of any more than one only man that did repent at laſt, a dying hour in all the word of God? Is there any ſpoken of for this beſides the Thief upon the Croſs? if thou haſt but this one ſingle example, why wilt thou venture thy eternal ſtate upon this?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Doth not thy purpoſing to repent and leave the ſervice of Satan and ſin hereafter imply a preſent reſolution that yet thou wilt not repent? and that yet thou art reſolved to go on in ſin? and is it not more wickedneſs to reſolve to be a ſervant to the Devil and thy luſts till thou art ſick or old, than goodneſs in thee, to purpoſe then to be a ſervant of God? when thou wilt have neither time, nor ſtrength to do him any ſervice in; no, nor heart neither. Judge if this be reaſonable; and if not, let not Satan keep thee Captive by this any longer.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Is it fit thou ſhouldeſt give the firſt of thy time and ſtrength to Satan rather than to God? Is it not wickedneſs to ſay, I will firſt ſerve the Devil, and after him God? ſhall God have the Devil's leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? wilt thou give the Devil the beſt of thy time and God the dregs?</p>
                     <p n="7">

                     <p n="8">8. If you be poor, would you not be preſently rich? and if in pain, would you not have preſent eaſe? And is not God and Chriſt, and Grace more deſirable?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If you had drunk a cup of poyſon, would you not have a preſent remedy to ſave your lives?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Might not God give thee up to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Judgment, to hardneſs of heart, and to the reigning power of ſin, and ſay be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. and ſay his Spirit ſhall ſtrive no longer with thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Another Chain that keeps them faſt indeed is their unbelief, a wilful refuſing to accept of Chriſt, the only Lord-Redeemer as he is offered to them in the Goſpel. This is the Chain that binds the guilt of all other ſins upon their ſouls. To break this Bond, Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no other Redeemer than Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. If you will not own him, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto him, you muſt periſh in your Bonds and die without Redemption. For other ſins the wrath of God comes upon men, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.6. But by reaſon of Unbelief the wrath of God abideth on them, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. and they abide in their Captivity.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="155" facs="unknown:004934_0078_100E33AA1E29AA18"/>2. This is greateſt folly. Is it not folly to prefer bonds before liberty? eſpecially when you might come out free, freely; without any price paid down by you, but by the ranſom which the Redeemer hath already given to God, and the benefit offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you: But you thruſt the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from you, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi> that came to bring them out of bondage, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.27.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This is higheſt Ingratitude; That the Son of God ſhould be bound, that thou mayſt not be for ever bound: he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thou mayſt be acquitted; he ſuffered that thou mayſt be ſaved, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to thee, the benefit of his Redemption, and calls, and commands and waits for thy acceptance; but thou preferreſt the world and ſin before him; and would rather keep thy ſins with chains of bondage, than accept of him for Lord and Saviour with a crown of Glory. Thou ſeeſt by this time, what are the Bonds with which Satan hath held thee bound ſo long: Oh now beg they may be broken? if not, Conſider further that which followeth.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HAving ſet before you the reſemblance of Sinners to Captives, and ſeveral of the chains by which they are bound in this cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; I ſhall next proceed to ſhew you wherein the condition of theſe Captives is far worſe than any Captives, under the Sun beſides; and I beſeech you in the fear of God, ſeriouſly weigh your danger, and in good ſadneſs conſider your miſery before you are paſt remedy, recovery, and redemption. If all I have already ſaid be forgotten, and hath been ſlighted by you; yet do not ſtop your ears, ſtiffen your necks, and harden your hearts againſt what ſhall further be propounded to you to awaken your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. In reſpect of civil Liberty you are all free-born, and many of you are free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; but yet being Satan's Captives, and Sin's Bond-men, your caſe is deplorable; though yet through Mercy tendered to you, and waiting to this day upon you, it is not deſperate. If it ſhould move compaſſion in us to hear of any carried captive by a cruel Enemy, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s eyes were filled with
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:004934_0079_100E33ABDFD84860"/>
tears, and his heart with ſorrow, when he did conſider of the captive-ſtate of God's people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.17. <q>But if ye will not hear it, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for your Pride, and mine eye ſhall weep ſore, and run down with tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord's flock is carried away captive.</q> 
                        <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.18.— <q>hear, hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my ſorrow; my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</q> Much more ſhould it be lamented with abundant tears and ſorrow of heart, that ſinners are capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the Devil, by how much this cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity is ſorer than any other; as appeareth by theſe particulars following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is ſpiritual bondage, and the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the ſoul: If a man be a ſlave to men, they have Power only over his body and outward Man, his ſoul may be free: the more noble the ſubject is, the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous is the bondage. Things that concern the ſoul, if good, they be the beſt, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of bleſſings to the ſoul are the beſt promiſes, and mercies for the ſoul are the beſt mercies; ſo if things that concern the ſoul be bad, they are the worſt: Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt the ſoul are the ſoreſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and puniſhments upon the ſoul are the ſoreſt and the heavieſt puniſhments;
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:004934_0080_100E33ADA62D6060"/>
and the loſs of the Soul is the greateſt loſs, Matth. 16.26. <q>What is a man profited if he gain the whole World, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</q> It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have the body fettered with as many chains as it could carry, if the ſoul be free, than to have the body be at liberty to go up and down where you will, if the body be in Bondage to Satan and to Sin: Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is thy Soul, thy only, precious and immortal Soul that is in chains; and canſt thou be at reſt, eat, drink and ſleep, with ſo much peace, while thy ſoul is carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? Canſt thou be ſo merry and ſo jovil with fetters on thy ſoul? Canſt thou buy and ſell, and trade with ſo much earneſtneſs after wordly gain, while Satan hath poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy ſoul? If thy lands were mortgaged wouldſt thou not be careful to redeem them? If thy Jewels were in pawn, wouldſt thou not be mindful to have them to be reſtored to thee? What! doſt thou prize and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue a few acres of Land, the very earth thou treadeſt upon, above thy ſoul? are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Jewels, better than this one only Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of thy Soul? Wouldſt thou not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with pity to ſee Malefactors (whoſe time of execution is approaching) card and dice, carowſe and drink, and ſing with chains rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:004934_0080_100E33ADA62D6060"/>
at their heels; And haſt thou no pity for thy ſelf, and no compaſſion for thy ſelf whoſe time of death and execution draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh, and will quickly come, and yet canſt be ſo light-hearted, when the Devil hath thy ſoul in worſe than Iron-fetters? Doth not this lightneſs of thy heart plainly prove the hardneſs of thy heart? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, thou hadſt better have thy body poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by a thouſand Devils, or torn by a thouſand Devils into a thouſand pieces, than to have thy precious ſoul led captive by the Devil, and held his Priſoner by the reigning power of any one luſt whatſoever. Wilt thou think of this, It is thy Soul that is a Captive, and in bonds?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This captivity and bondage to Satan and to Sin, is worſe than any other, in that theſe Captives are not ſenſible of their thraldom; do not lament themſelves, nor bewail their own condition, though it be ſo bad, ſo very bad. The children of Iſrael did groan and ſigh by reaſon of their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.22. When <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was bound with fetters, and carried captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he was ſenſible of the fetters on his body, that had before no ſenſe of the bonds of ſin, with which he was held in bondage by the Devil. And how do poor Captives ſigh and groan under Turkiſh
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:004934_0081_100E33B083C082A0"/>
ſlavery, and bitterly lament becauſe of the hard uſage they are under? And how do many Priſoners grieve and take on that they ever did that fact for which they are in Irons? Do men need to ſpend many hours, and make many long Orations, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a Captive amongſt the Turks of the ſadneſs of his condition there? But how many hours muſt a Miniſter ſpend in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and in preaching, before theſe Captives can be brought to a ſenſe of their own woful and miſerable condition? Before he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that indeed they are in this captivity? It is indeed but here and there one amongſt a multitude that do ſee it, believe it, and bewail it. Who is witneſs of your groans, and of your tears? When did you complain to God or man of the fetters and the bonds of ſin that have been ſo long upon your ſouls? When didſt thou retire to thy Cloſet, and there lament thy woful caſe? Is not this a dreadful caſe to be near to Hell, and not to ſee it? to be near to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and not to fear it? to be led by the Devil in the chains of ſin, to a place of torment, and to be not at all ſenſible whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are going? Shall nothing but the flames of Hell convince thee of thy bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? Wilt thou not believe the Devil is leading thee to Hell, till thou ſeeſt, and
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:004934_0081_100E33B083C082A0"/>
findeſt, and feeleſt, that thou art there? Wilt thou not yield that thou art of the number of Satan's Captives upon earth, till he brings thee to the Lake of burning Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and look round about thee, and then to thy eternal ſorrow ſee, that thou art one of the number of the captivated ſouls in Hell? This makes thy captivity the ſorer, and thy bonds the ſtronger, that thou art not ſenſible of thy bondage.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. So doth this too, that thou art a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary bond ſlave to Satan and to Sin; thou art the Devil's ſervant, and art willing to be ſo; in bondage, and art willing to e-main therein; thou mighteſt have liberty, but thou wilt not. Thou art like the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that plainly ſaid, I love my Maſter, I will not go out free; and would rather have his ears bored through with an Awl, and ſerve him for ever, than be made free, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.5, 6. Slaves in <hi>Turkey</hi> are there againſt their wills, it is not matter of their choice; Captives they be, but they are not willing Captives; they do not love their fetters, nor their chains, nor the work and ſervice that they are put unto: but thou art in Captivity to Satan, and thou loveſt to have it ſo; thou drudgeſt in his ſervice, and doſt love to do it; but what wilt thou do in the end thereof? <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.31. Others
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:004934_0082_100E33B3B107BE18"/>
are by power and force taken and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captives, but thou doſt voluntarily yield thyſelf to be a ſlave; for Satan could not have taken men captive, nor hold them therein, without their own conſent. Like <hi>Ahab,</hi> thou doſt ſell thy ſelf for a ſlave, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21.20. and what doſt thou ſell thy ſelf, thy ſoul, a captive for? For a little profit and for a little ſhort and momentary pleaſure? That thou mighteſt gratify thy luſts for a while, and pleaſe thy palate and thy fleſh for a while, thou art contented to be a ſlave for ever. When a man is taken captive, yet his will is not taken; when his body is fettered, yet his will is not overcome; he hath a will to reſiſt ſtill, if he had but power; he hath a will to have off his chains, though he cannot; and a will to eſcape, and be ſet at liberty, though there is none to lay down a ranſom for him: But the Devil's captives have no will to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or freed from their bondage, though there be a ranſom paid, and the benefit of it be offered unto them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is a plenary and full Captivity; all the Sinner is in bondage, not only the will, but all the powers and affections of the ſoul; ſo that there is nothing in him free. If a man be in bondage to men, his thoughts might be free, and his affections might be
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:004934_0082_100E33B3B107BE18"/>
free to love God, to delight in God, to deſire after God. But ſatan's captives have no freedom to any thing that is ſpiritually good and pleaſing unto God; therefore this is a ſore bondage.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Theſe captives are Children of the Wrath of God; whereas others that are Captives to men, might be Children of the Love of God; as they love and delight in God when they be in chains, ſo God may love and delight in them. If a man's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition be never ſo bad, yet he might comfort himſelf with the thoughts of God's love to him; though I be in priſon, yet God loves me; and though I be in chains, yet God loves me: But the Devil's Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives do not love God, nor are beloved by him. A love of good-will God hath had to many of theſe Captives, a love of Purpoſe to do them good in delivering them from their bonds; but a love of complacency and delight, ſo that God ſhould take pleaſure in you while you are voluntarily and totally the Devil's Slaves and Servants, there is not in God towards you. O did you but know the Wrath of God, the Fury of the Lord, what it is, how great, how intolerable; Could you pleaſe your ſelves in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which you are the objects of his
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:004934_0083_100E33B6C2726760"/>
wrath? As there is no love like to the love of God; ſo there is no wrath like to the wrath of God; therefore that Condition (be it what it will) is not ſo bad in which you may be the object of God's love, as that condition is in which you are and muſt be the objects of his wrath.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Death doth not deliver Satan's Captives from their thraldom and their bondage, but doth ſtraiten their Bonds, and ſtrengthen their chains and puts them into an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Redemption for ever. If a ſlave be no way delivered while he liveth, yet he is freed when he dies; death will bring him a releaſe, and give him a diſcharge; <hi>Job</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <q>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling; and there the weary be at reſt. There the priſoners reſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they hear not the voice of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor. The ſmall and great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter.</q> When the King of Babylon had taken <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dikiah</hi> captive, and bound him in fetters, he put him in priſon till the day of his death, and then he was his priſoner no longer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.12. But theſe are Captives till they die, and which is worſe, are Captives after death. The others might ſay, and comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therewith. Well, this is hard, but it is not laſting; this is bitter, but it will
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:004934_0083_100E33B6C2726760"/>
have an end; though it laſt as long as life ſhall laſt, yet death will come, and then we ſhall be releaſed; but theſe may ſay, It is bad while we live, and it will be worſe when we die: if we are not delivered while we live, death will not, death cannot deliver us. Therefore this is worſe than any other bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A worſe and more dreadful Priſon is prepared for the Devil's Captives, than any ſlaves on earth can be caſt into. Hell is the Priſon appointed and prepared for all Captives that are not made free by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. Several things makes this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon worſe than any other.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Priſon prepared for theſe Captives is a cloſe Priſon. Now you are like to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners that ſometimes might walk abroad with their Keeper with them. Now thou art a Priſoner at large, that walkeſt up and down, thou in thy chains of ſin and guilt, and the Devil thy Keeper doth attend and watch thee whitherſoever thou goeſt; if thou comeſt to a Sermon, thy Keeper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with thee, to prevent thy breaking looſe, and when thou goeſt from the Sermon, to tempt thee to return to thy courſe of ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But hereafter thou ſhalt be a cloſe Priſoner, not ſuffered to ſtep out for ever; and ſo cloſe ſhalt thou be kept that none
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:004934_0084_100E33B9A29349B0"/>
ſhall come at thee, to viſit or to comfort thee. It is an alleviation of a Priſoner's grief, though he hath not liberty to go out and ſee his friends, yet his friends might come and ſee and viſit him; but neither ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed unto you, when once you are cloſe priſoners in hell. Thy friends on earth will not be deſirous of thy company, or thy viſits after death, if thou hadſt the liberty to come forth; ſuch viſits of damned Souls would be a burden, and diſquietment, and a terror to the living; that would then rather wiſh that thou waſt confined to thy priſon, than to be permitted to come forth to diſturb them by thy viſits: Neither ſhall any be ſuffered to come and comfort thee, if they would; and indeed, none would be deſirous, nor venture ſo far as to come to hell to comfort thee, if they might. Though the rich man deſired that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might come and comfort him with one drop of water, it would not be granted to him, for he was a cloſe Priſoner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24, 25. Beſides, there is a great gulf fixed between them and the Saints above, that there is no paſſing from the one place to the other, <hi>ver.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a dark priſon, a very dungeon, a place of utter darkneſs, a place where there is thickneſs and blackneſs of darkneſs forever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Jude v.</hi> 13. Darkneſs add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:004934_0084_100E33B9A29349B0"/>
to the diſcomfort of the condition they muſt be in, in that Priſon forever. It was an amazing Judgment on the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to be under thick darkneſs for three days, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.22, 23. What a dreadful dungeon would this world be without the light of Sun, or Moon, or Stars, or Candle, though you were not in pain, nor want of other outward enjoyments, yet it would be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable place to continue in. Oh then, what will be the ſadneſs, frights, and fears of theſe captives for ever, that ſhall be in pain, in torment, and in darkneſs forever. If a man were to live all his days in a Palace, there to have rich Proviſions to feed upon, and beds of down to lodge upon, but yet to be always in the dark, would be a great affliction to him: Oh then, what will it be to live in pain and darkneſs too? to lie and roul &amp; tumble in a bed of flames, in a lake of Brimſtone, and in darkneſs too? to be amongſt Devils, and this in darkneſs too? and muſt not that be a place of darkneſs for ever, where the light of God's countenance ſhall not ſhine upon the priſoners there forever?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a filthy Priſon, full of noiſom ſtenches, and unſavoury ſmells; priſons are filthy places, very offenſive to the noſtrils, but the ſtench of the Brimſtone ſhall be more troubleſome to the priſoners there than
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:004934_0085_100E33BCD8FEB268"/>
the moſt ſtinking dungeon to any upon earth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is a ſtrong priſon; As it is ſo cloſe that none can come to them to comfort them, ſo it is ſo ſtrong that not a priſoner ſhall eſcape, or break through, or get out to all eternity; if once theſe priſon-doors be ſhut, and if Chriſt that hath the keys of death and hell, do once put thee in, and turn the key upon thee, there is no opening them for ever. Now you are bound in chains of your own making, even of your ſins; but hereafter you ſhall be bound in chains of God's making. And there are four Bars or Bolts upon the priſon-gates of hell, that the priſoners ſhall be filled with deſpair of ever coming forth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This priſon-gates ſhall be made forever faſt and ſtrong by the counſel and decrees of God; God hath ordained, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of thoſe captives that die before they are made free, ſhall be eternal; it is the unalterable will of God, that they ſhall lie in chains for ever; God's purpoſe muſt be changed before their chains can be broken or the priſoners delivered: But God is a God that doth not change, he will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame for ever; therefore the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners muſt abide by it for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="169" facs="unknown:004934_0085_100E33BCD8FEB268"/>2. This priſon-gates ſhall be made faſt and ſtrong by the juſtice of God. Juſtice ſhall keep the priſon-door, that not a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall come forth till he hath made ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his ſin, till he hath paid his debts to the uttermoſt farthing, and that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be. When the priſoner hath been there a thouſand years, and ſhould beg, and pray, 'Lord, I have been here a thouſand years, it is a long time, a long time, O methinks it is a long time ſince the day I came into this place; my time of ſinning ſeemed ſhort, it was indeed but ſhort; but my time of ſuffering ſeemeth long; now therefore Lord let me come forth.' No, ſaith Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, yet I am not ſatisfied. And when the other thouſand years be paſt, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſhould again petition for his liberty, the ſame anſwer will be returned; No, ſaith Juſtice, for yet I am not ſatisfied, and till that be done, thou muſt abide in priſon. Muſt I Lord? then there is no hope.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This priſon-gates ſhall be made faſt upon the priſoners by the Truth of God. God hath told you in his Word, that this fire burns for ever, and that the ſinner that is not ſanctified ſhall be caſt into it, to lodge there for ever. The truth of God is is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal truth; and ſo long as the Word of
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:004934_0086_100E33BEB622BBF0"/>
God abideth true, ſo long ſhall theſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives continue in this priſon.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This priſon-gates ſhall be made faſt and ſtrong by the power of God. There ſhall be no getting out by force, nor by any oppoſition that they can make; the ſame power that ſent them thither, ſhall keep them that they ſhall neither die in this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor eſcape out of it. If then the gates of this priſon be faſtened by the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Decree of God, by the Juſtice, Truth, and Power of God, the priſoners might ſet their hearts at reſt, or rather ſhall never be at reſt, becauſe they never ſhall come forth from priſon.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This priſon is far worſe than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priſon, becauſe of the company that is there; and yet in many priſons there is a very wicked crew of ſwearing, curſing, and curſed company; if a godly man were in ſome priſons amongſt ſuch company, the company would be a greater affliction to him, than the priſon. But if the company of Devils, and Souls hating and blaſpheming God, be wicked company, this ſhall be found in hell, all bad, not one good amongſt the millions that are there; as in heaven, all good, not one bad amongſt the thouſands that are there. Here theſe captives ſin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and they ſhall be in priſon all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:004934_0086_100E33BEB622BBF0"/>
one curſing and crying out againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that ever they were on earth acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them. Nay, then the Devil and his Slaves ſhall be in priſon together, the conqueror and the conquered both caſt into the Lake of Brimſtone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The remembrance of the facts for which theſe captives ſhall be caſt into this priſon, will make it worſe than any other. To remember, here we are for obeying the Devil rather than God, for hearkening to the temptations of the Devil, when we ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped our ears againſt all the cries, and calls, and counſels of God; had we but heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the voice of mercy, to the entreaties of Chriſt, or to the exhortations of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, we had now been free from this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and this pain. Had we ſerved God as diligently, daily, and faithfully as we ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Devil, we had been now in a better place, and we ſhould now have had a better reward. Oh, What are we damned for our pleaſing of our fleſh to the diſpleaſing of God! Do we ſuffer eternal pains for our folly, in preferring the ſhort pleaſures and profits of the world before God, the greateſt and the chiefeſt good; for my pleaſing of my palate! This is the fruit of my drinking bouts! The wine in the glaſs was not ſo ſweet, as the wrath of God in this cup is
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:004934_0087_100E33C4939FBA38"/>
bitter, which I have been a thouſand years a drinking off, but cannot drink it up. Oh better I had had ſo much ſcalding lead pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down my throat, than thoſe pleaſant cups for which I am now in greateſt pain. The thoughts of what they ſhall be in priſon for will make the priſon the more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The remembrance of a price and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom that was given for captives, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof often tendered unto them, will make this priſon more intolerable; There and then to remember, the Son of God came down from Heaven and did give himſelf, his blood, his ſoul, to redeem ſinners out of bondage, and this was tendered unto me, ſaith one, and to me ſaith another, but I like a curſed and unthankful wretch did ſlight it and refuſe it, ſaith one; and I like a miſerable Caitiff did prefer my ſins and luſts before the Redeemer, ſaith another! we were often warned of this place, and often aſked and intreated to accept of Chriſt, and deliverance by him; time was, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Name of God did come unto us Sabbath after Sabbath, and in his name did offer liberty unto us; how often did they aſk us, to be willing to leave our bonds, how earneſtly did they beg that we would be but willing to have our fetters
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:004934_0087_100E33C4939FBA38"/>
knocked off, and if we had been but will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſhould have been done; but that time is paſt, thoſe ſeaſons are gone, and here we lie bound in fetters for ever. O time, time, whither art thou fled? Can it not be recalled, can it not be recalled? O no, no, it cannot be recalled: and thoſe offers never ſhall be repeated, but to our greater aggravation, by the gnawing worm.</p>

THE ſecond general Head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the glad tydings to theſe miſerable Captives, is that there is Liberty to be had by Chriſt; or, that it is by Chriſt, and had by Chriſt alone that poor captive ſinners are delivered and ſet at liberty. Had it not been for Chriſt, we muſt have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Bonds, and remained in perpetual ſlavery while we had lived, and been for ever bound in chains of darkneſs, when we die. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. applied to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>John</hi> 8.36.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:004934_0088_100E33C7260667D0"/>Man might be conſidered in a four-fold State.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In his firſt condition as created by God: then man was a free-man, bondage came in by ſin: when man ſinned he loſt his freedom. And in this eſtate there was a three-fold liberty that man had.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Man was free from ſin; not the leaſt ſpot or ſtain by creation in this pure nature of man; he was then free from pride, and free from the inordinate love of the world, and from every thing offenſive &amp; diſpleaſing to God. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. — God made man upright. The uprightneſs of a man renewed by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace denotes the ſincerity of his heart, though there be ſin inherent in him. So <hi>Job</hi> was an upright man, <hi>Job</hi> 1.1. But the uprightneſs of man at firſt created by God denoteth the perfect Image of God in the preſence of that which was good, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all ſin. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Man had a freedom or liberty of will, to will and to do what God did require from him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A freedom from all miſery, calamity and puniſhments. Man had then a freedom from ſickneſs, from ſorrow and from afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and death; for all theſe are the fruits of ſin: Man had never been in bondage to theſe; if he had not become a bondſlave to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:004934_0088_100E33C7260667D0"/>
Satan and to ſin. And in this ſtate man had no need of a Redeemer, becauſe he was not then a captive.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Man might be conſidered in a ſtate of Corruption, and ſo his condition is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what it was in his firſt eſtate; as before he was free, ſo now he is a ſlave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at liberty, but now in bondage; and this bondage is oppoſite to the former three fold Liberty.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In man there is now a bondage to ſin, in ſlavery to his own luſts and to his own vile affections, that there is no part in him free from ſin; his underſtanding is not free from ignorance, darkneſs and error, his will is not free from obſtinacy and rebellion, his affections are not free from diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, hating what he ſhould love, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what he ſhould hate, ſhunning what he ſhould deſire, and deſiring what he ſhould ſhun, rejoicing in that which ſhould be the matter, cauſe and reaſon of his ſorrow, and grief, and grieving and being weary of that which ſhould be the matter of his delight and joy. This is man's ſinful bondage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The very will of man is inthralled. That though man hath a liberty of will as to natural actions and to civil actions, and to outward and ſpiritual actions, he can come and hear if he will, he can ſet upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:004934_0089_100E33CA4F07BB88"/>
duty of prayer if he will: he can read the Word of God, if he will, yet he hath no liberty of will to ſupernatural actions without the grace of God as to believe on Chriſt, to love God above all; man muſt have a will as well as a power from God to do theſe things. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <q>It is God that giveth us to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</q> And this is a ſore bondage, tho' a natural man feel it not, and is not ſenſible of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In bondage by reaſon of puniſhment, being liable to all the curſes, plagues and puniſhments threatned for ſin in the Word of God, both in this life and that which is to come, to ſickneſs, and ſorrows, to pain and griefs, to death at laſt, and to hell and damnation after death. And in this eſtate man doth need a Redeemer, and a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and is utterly and eternally undone if he be not delivered from this bondage.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Man might be conſidered in a ſtate of grace as recovered by Chriſt, as renewed and reſtored by the Spirit of God; for God doth not ſuffer all men to remain in their bondage, and thoſe that are redeemed and recovered muſt not aſcribe this to their own free will but to the free grace of God. And in this eſtate Man is made partaker in part of the fruits of Redemption by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="177" facs="unknown:004934_0089_100E33CA4F07BB88"/>4. Man might be conſidered in a ſtate of Glory. And there the Saints are all free, and altogether free, they have perfect liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſin, from ſorrow, from temptations to ſin, from all inclination to ſin, from a poſſibility of ſinning: and in this eſtate the Saints of God do fully and eternally enjoy the fruits of Chriſt's Redemption, and of his giving of himſelf a ranſom for them.</p>
                     <p>Qu. 1. What it is that we have not a liberty from by Chriſt the Redeemer? There are many things that Chriſt did not come to purchaſe or proclaim liberty from while we are in this life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. None of God's Elect are freed by Chriſt from being born in original ſin; we are not born free, but are made free; even thoſe that are deſcended from free men in Chriſt, are by birth in ſpiritual bondage: for grace doth not come by blood, but by the will of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. No man ſince the Fall, except Chriſt the Redeemer hath been free from this ſinful contagion that hath infected all mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.17, 18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt doth not free us in this World from the indwelling of ſin: Chriſt doth free all Believers from the reigning power of ſin, Rom. 6.14. but not from the conflicting power of ſin, no, nor altogether from the captivating power of ſin; the Lord's free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:004934_0090_100E33CD660903C8"/>
might ſometimes be overpowred with a temptation, and with a corruption, and in a particular combat be carried captive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. nor doth Chriſt free us at all from the indwelling of ſin. As God did not preſently free the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Nations that did vex them, nor drive them out at once, but by degrees, he left ſome of them to prove them and to humble them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.28, 29. ſo all God's redeemed and free ſervants do ſtill experience the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſin and corruption, and do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain thereof and cry out becauſe of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. There are ſtill reliques of pride and unbelief, and hardneſs of heart. Thus we are not free from diſtracting thoughts in holy duties, nor from all dulneſs of affection, and deadneſs of heart in the ſervice of God. This <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> reſerved for the ſtate of glorious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the life to come, when we ſhall be and live in the immediate preſence of the bleſſed God above, and ſhall live in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of him immediately that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from our Captivity and Bondage.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt hath not freed us from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, but rather doth engage us to it. Wicked men judge this to be liberty to live as they liſt, and to walk and act as they pleaſe, in gratifying the luſt and pleaſing of the fleſh. This is not liberty but licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:004934_0090_100E33CD660903C8"/>
this indeed is the bondage that Chriſt came to deliver us from. Oh how is the blind world miſtaken, when they take their very bondage for their liberty! The ſtricteſt Service of God is the greateſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.45. It is not a liberty from duty, but from ſin and miſery, that Chriſt came to purchaſe and proclaim, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18. The moſt under the very Goſpel do live in the conſtant omiſſion of duty, and commiſſion of ſin, as if Chriſt came to give them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo to do: which yet they might have done if Chriſt had never come.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This ſpiritual freedom by Chriſt doth not exempt us nor excuſe us from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we owe to men in the places and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations wherein God hath ſet us. Indeed the Lord's free-men muſt not be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of men, ſo as to pleaſe men in that in which they will diſpleaſe God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. but yet one that is the Lord's free-man might be in the place of a ſervant to man, and ought to follow his calling and mind his Maſters buſineſs, and that with greater care and conſcience than others do, even to ſuch Maſters as be the ſervants of ſin, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5, 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. And to ſuch Maſters that are the Lord's free-men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1, 2.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="180" facs="unknown:004934_0091_100E33D1FB0B8E08"/>5. Chriſt doth not free us from afflictions nor from troubles from men. Chriſt hath no where told us, he came to free us from ſcorns and from reproaches; from priſons, and from tribulations; but the contrary, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. laſt. All God's Freemen will be hated by the Devil's Slaves; and we ſhall not be freed from them, till we be out of their reach, and that will not be till we get to Heaven. Thoſe that have ſpiritual li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty might loſe their civil liberty: as a man might have a civil liberty, but not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; a man might be free of a City, free of a Company, and yet not free by Chriſt: ſo a man might be in priſon, bound in chains there, and yet be ſpiritually free; <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the priſon, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the den, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the dungeon, and yet all the Lord's Free-men. When Chriſt calls to many in their bondage to come to him to be made free, they would indent with Chriſt that they ſhould enjoy freedom from croſſes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſufferings; which becauſe Chriſt doth not free his followers from, they had rather have their freedom from ſufferings in their bondage, than ſufferings with ſpiritual freedom.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chriſt doth not give us freedom from temptations of the Devil, that we ſhould be no more buffetted by that wicked one.
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:004934_0091_100E33D1FB0B8E08"/>
Chriſt himſelf was not free from temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Satan, nor from perſecutions from men. Reſiſt the Devil, watch and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his temptations, for you are not like to be freed from them, 'till you get to Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Chriſt doth not free us from the ſtroke of death: the Lord's free-men muſt be bound with death's bonds as well as others, Our ſouls and bodies are not free from diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, your bodies are not free from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but yet we are freed from the ſting of death; and death is not the ſame to the Lord's Free-men, as it is to the Devil's Bond-men.</p>
                     <p n="2">Q. 2. What is the liberty that we have by Chriſt? This ſhall be managed in ſpeaking to theſe two particulars. Firſt, As this liberty and freedom is privative. Secondly, As it is poſitive; or, what we are freed from; and what it is that we are freed to.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What it is that believers are freed from by Chriſt; and theſe are great and ſore evils, and ſuch as would have made us unſpeakably and eternally miſerable if Chriſt had not freed us from them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath delivered us, and ſet us free from the power of Satan, that he hath no more rule in us as formerly he had; he
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:004934_0092_100E26BE58084090"/>
did rule in our hearts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. And we did yield voluntary ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him; but Chriſt hath bound this ſtrong man, and ſpoiled him of his goods, and hath diſpoſſeſſed him, and turned him out of our hearts, from dwelling, reigning, ruling there, as in a Throne; this Chriſt came to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15; he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from the Juſtice of God, by price and purchaſe; from Satan, by power and by a mighty hand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath ſet us free from ſin; not for the preſent, or in this life from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of ſin, as you heard before; but in theſe two reſpects</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By Chriſt believers have a freedom from the guilt of ſin. We are free from the obligation that lay upon us to eternal torments; ſo that now we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into condemnation for our ſins; our many ſins are all pardoned, our great and heinous ſins are all forgiven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.33, 34. Many might accuſe, the Devil might accuſe, and Men might accuſe, and Conſcience might accuſe, and the Law might accuſe us; but Chriſt hath ſo freed us, that none can condemn. O what a bleſſed Piece of our freedom lieth in this! What wouldſt thou have done to have anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered for thy ſins? What wouldſt thou
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:004934_0092_100E26BE58084090"/>
have done to bear the puniſhment of thy ſins? Indeed thou couldſt neither anſwer for thy ſelf, nor yet have born the wrath of God due to thee for thy ſin. Oh then ſee the everlaſting obligation laid upon thee to love this bleſſed Chriſt, to prize, and value, and eſteem this once crucified &amp; now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſt, that hath taken off this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thee; he hath freed thee from one obligation, and thereby laid upon thee another; he hath freed thee from an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to eternal condemnation, and hath laid down upon thee a ſtrong and laſting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation to love him, and to praiſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his love and grace to thee forever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath ſet us free from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin. The Sinner was the Captive, and Sin the Lord and Conqueror; but he that is made free by Chriſt, is become the Conqueror, and Sin the Captive; the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory indeed is not yet compleated, yet ſin is dethroned; the ſinner when a captive was in chains; but now made free, ſin is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bound. Sin was delighted in, but now it is abhorred; ſin was voluntarily yielded unto, but now reſiſted and oppoſed; ſin was welcomly entertained, but now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and bewailed; it was looked upon with pleaſure and content, but now it is beheld with a ſorrowful heart, and with a
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:004934_0093_100E33D7637368B0"/>
weeping eye; it is become the burden and the grief, that before had the love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of the ſinner's heart; it is now prayed againſt, and watched againſt, and endeavoured againſt, that before was indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and allowed, and provided for, and willingly ſubmitted to. Now ſaith the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ſinner, my hard heart is a burden to me; my proud and unbelieving heart is a burden and a grief unto me; my vain and worldly heart is a burden and a trouble, and a ſorrow to me; he is freed from the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of ſin, Rom. 6.14.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Chriſt hath ſet believers free from the curſe of the Law. The Law hath its uſe under the Goſpel; by it we come to the knowledge of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, and 5.20 by it we are convinced of our miſery, that by ſin we have deſerved death and damnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. that we might ſee the neceſſity of Chriſt, and haſten the more to him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. It ſerveth for a rule to direct us in our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for a glaſs in which we ſee imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our duty and obedience, that we might not reſt in them, nor truſt unto them for life and ſalvation. But from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſentence and curſe of the Law, Chriſt hath made believers free, by being made himſelf a curſe for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 13.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="185" facs="unknown:004934_0093_100E33D7637368B0"/>4. Chriſt hath ſet believers free from the hurt of death. The Lord's Free-men muſt die as well as the Devil's Bond-men; but Death will be another thing to a Free-man, than it is unto a Captive: ſo that which is formidable to a ſinner, is deſirable to a Saint. Chriſt hath taken away the ſting of Death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. of an Enemy is become a Friend; and Death, that is one of the plagues that befall the Devil's Captives, is become part of the Charter of the Lord's Free-men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.22.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Death to Free-men of the Lord is the utter abolition of their ſin; it ſhall free them from the very being and in-dwelling of ſin: when the ſoul ſhall be ſeperated from the body, all ſin, and all corruption ſhall be ſeparated from the ſoul: whereas the Devil's bond-men die in their ſin, and after death do ſtill retain their hatred unto God, their enmity to Chriſt, and are more confirmed and hardened in it than before.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Death to the Lord's Freemen puts an end to all their ſorrow and affliction, to all their troubles and their ſufferings. It is God's Handkerchief, whereby he wipes away all tears from the eyes of his redeemed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. but at death the ſorrow of the Devil's Captives doth begin, or is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:004934_0094_100E33DBE92700F0"/>
if they were at eaſe while they lived, they ſhall be in pain when they die: if they did roar and ſing while they lived, they ſhall roar and lament after death: Death takes them from their riches, from their friends, and from their pleaſure, and whatſoever was dear unto them in this world's enjoyments, and puts them into a place of pain and torment, a place of utter darkneſs, where they ſhall for ever weep and howl, and fruitleſly lament their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate, and their irrecoverably-loſt-hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Death to the Lord's Free-men is the gate to glory, and their paſſage and entrance into eternal life: It is the opening of the door to let them into their Father's houſe; a Meſſenger ſent by God to fetch them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence of their God and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to live, and reign, and dwell with him forever, that their freedom here begun might be conſummated and perfected in heaven. In that very day they die, they are admitted as free Citizens of the glorious Kingdom of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Death to the Lord's Free-men ſhall come in the beſt time. All men die in God's time, whenever he appointeth; but the redeemed by Chriſt ſhall die in the beſt time, when their work is done, and when
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:004934_0094_100E33DBE92700F0"/>
God ſeeth it is better for them to die than to live; God takes the beſt time and fitteſt ſeaſon for the removing of his by death out of the world: But the wicked ſlaves of ſin and Satan are cut off in a bad time, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they die; it is a bad time to them, becauſe whenever it is, they go that day to hell, and to eternal torments; the day of their diſſolution, is the day of their damnation; and will not that be the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt day they ever had? they die before their work is done; before they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and before they have repented, and that muſt be a ſad day whenever it comes. Men cut down Weeds at any time, but the Corn in the beſt time, in the fitteſt ſeaſon, when it is ripe to be carried into the barn.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Death to the Lord's Freemen hath loſt its terribleneſs. And though all God's redeemed are not actually and totally freed from the fears of death, but ſometimes kept in bondage through the fears of death; yet they have grounds and reaſons why they might not fear it: But the Devil's Captives have always cauſe and reaſon to be terribly afraid of death; and if they be not, it ariſeth from the blindneſs of their minds, and the hardneſs of their hearts. "It is a wonder that men ſhould be as near to hell
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:004934_0095_100E33E11C73A160"/>
as to the grave, and yet not be afraid to dye; It is a wonder, that men ſhould be as near to an endleſs miſerable life, as they are to the end of this ſhort uncertain life, and yet their fears ſhould not prevent their ſleeping in the night, and their jovial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments in the day-time." The Devil hath blinded them as well as bound them, and that is one reſon of it. But theſe cannot upon any ſolid, rational, and religious grounds be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> from the fears of death. But ſo may the Lord's freemen, and this they have from and through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chriſt will ſet believers free from the grave by a joyful reſurrection; that though they come under the ſtroke and power of death, and are lodged in the grave for a while, yet it ſhall be but for a while. Death and the grave ſhall not always have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over their body. Death doth bind them, but Chriſt will looſe theſe bonds, and will ſet them free; as Chriſt did break the bonds of death, for death was not able to hold him in his grave, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24, So he will knock off the fetters of death from all his, and bring them forth, and make them happy; and this as ſurely as he himſelf is riſen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.13. &amp;c. And not only free them out of the grave, but alſo from
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:004934_0095_100E33E11C73A160"/>
thoſe evils and imperfections that in this life their bodies are ſubject to; that though they ſhall have the ſame bodies for ſubſtance that now they have, yet they ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bodies as to the qualities that they then ſhall have.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then Chriſt will free them from that mortality that now they are ſubject to; now liable to death every day and hour, but then they ſhall dye no more for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then Chriſt ſhall free them from all pain and ſickneſs, from cold, and hunger, and thirſt they are now often ſenſible of; their head ſhall never ake, their hearts ſhall never be ſick, no part in the leaſt pained to all eternity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then Chriſt ſhall free them from a neceſſity of food to ſuſtain them, and of nouriſhment from the uſe of creatures, by which they are repaired and ſupported daily on this ſide the grave, but on the other ſide of the grave they ſhall need this no more than the Angels do in heaven.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then Chriſt ſhall free them from that wearineſs that now our bodies often feel, and do groan under; for he will make them ſtrong and powerful bodies. Now-a-days work in the ſervice of God doth weary our bodies; but hereafter though they ſhall be imployed through an endleſs eternity, in
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:004934_0096_100E33E343C51E50"/>
praiſing and glorifying of God, they ſhall neither be weary of it through wickedneſs, nor weary in it through weakneſs, for as much as Chriſt will free them from both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Chriſt will then ſo free them from all imperfections that they ſhall be made like to Chriſt's glorious body. And can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire greater freedom for our bodies, than to be made like to Chriſt's glorious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chriſt doth free all his from the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell, that when the Devils Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſhall be pained and tormented by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and unſpeakable puniſhment, row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and tumbling, ſhrieking and howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with bitter cries lamenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the redeemed of Chriſt ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be touched with the flames of that fire; the ſecond death ſhall have no power over them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. Chriſt will take care, that thoſe that love him above all, and chuſe him before all, ſhall never come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.18. Oh what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is this, to be freed from Hell! Oh what grace and kindneſs is this, to thoſe that once were Captives, and had deſerved it, and were in danger of it, that by Chriſt they ſhould be freed and delivered from it! Oh what mercy would the damned, that have
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:004934_0096_100E33E343C51E50"/>
felt the pains and puniſhment of hell, think, ſay, and confeſs it to be, if they may be let out and freed from it: But they are in it, and ſhall never be delivered from it; but the Lord's free-men are out of it, and ſhall never be caſt into it; ſo great is the liberty we have by Chriſt the Redeemer of Captives, in reſpect of what we are freed from.</p>
                     <p>What are the poſitive beſſings that by Chriſt we are made free unto. For Chriſt did come to poor ſinners, to redeem them when Captives, not only that they ſhould not be miſerable, but that they ſhould alſo be happy. Theſe things are many and great and glorious; let me give you a taſte in theſe few:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By Chriſt believers have freedom and liberty to come to the throne of Grace. A burden to wicked graceleſs hearts it is, to come and pray to God, are backward to it, weary of it, as if it were a part of their ſlavery and bondage, to come and beg for mercy for their Souls, for pardon for their ſin, for converting and renewing grace now, and for eternal endleſs glory hereafter. Judge of this as you will, yet know it coſt Chriſt dear to purchaſe this liberty for us; it is not only a duty that we muſt, but it is a real priviledge that we may, have the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:004934_0097_100E33E64D699418"/>
freedom to come to God upon our knees, to beg for ſpecial, ſpiritual, temporal and eternal mercies. Would not a poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, that hath deſerved to dye, account it a priviledge to have liberty as oft as he will, and when he will to have liberty of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs unto the King, to prefer his petitions to him, and beg for a pardon of his fact, and for the ſaving of his life; and all this with hope of ſpeeding and obtaining what he doth petition for? When man hath ſinned, he was driven out of Paradiſe, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid becauſe of guilt, and there was no freedom for the rebellious ſinner without Chriſt, to come before a provoked angry God with hopes of mercy; but there is a new and living way now found out for you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, 21, 22. that you might come with freedom, and aſk with freedom of ſpirit, and with freedom of ſpeech, what Chriſt hath purchaſed for you, and God hath promiſed to you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. You may with freedom come to God, and tell him all your grievances, and all your burdens, and all your temptations, and all your wants, and open all your heart unto him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By Chriſt believers have a freedom and a liberty to apply the promiſes of the Goſpel to themſelves. Theſe promiſes are
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:004934_0097_100E33E64D699418"/>
many, great, and precious promiſes, of many, great, and precious things, and you are free to them all; not only free to read them, but free to apply them to your ſelves, and to live upon them, and to wait and hope for the fulfilling and performance of them. Here is a promiſe of pardon, and it is made to me; a promiſe of more grace and of perſeverance, and it is made to me, a promiſe of eternal life and glory, and the bleſſed glorious God hath made it unto me, and by Chriſt I may freely apply it, and build and reſt upon it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By Chriſt we are made free to all the priviledges of redeemed people. Theſe are alſo many, great, and precious; very many, very great, and very precious priviledges.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Believers by Chriſt are free to a ſtate of friendſhip and favour with God. As there is a freedom betwixt friends, ſo there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his redeemed by Chriſt, that are partakers of the benefits of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; from a ſtate of enmity to a ſtate of friendſhip and reconciliation; God is no more your enemy, nor you any longer ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, a peace is made by Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and your ſouls, and this is a firm and laſting an everlaſting peace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21. Now with comfort thou mayeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, though men do hate me, yet God
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:004934_0098_100E33EAABC761D8"/>
doth love me; though men are my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet God is my friend, my ſureſt and my ſafeſt friend.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By Chriſt Believers are free to a ſtate of Juſtification, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is freely imputed to them. That as the Devil's Captives are under the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, ſo the Lord's free-men are under the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs and obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21; and you are free to truſt to, and to plead the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for your Juſtification in the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By Chriſt believers are made free to a ſtate of Sonſhip, and the priviledge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption. Of Slaves you are become not only Servants but Sons; of the children of the Devil, are become the children of God; of the children of God's wrath, the children of his love. Men may redeem Captives but do not adopt them for their children, but all that Chriſt redeems, have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to become the Sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. 2 Cor. 6. latter end.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By Chriſt believers are free to have communion with God in his Ordinances. God is no longer a ſtranger to them, nor they any longer ſtrangers unto God; but have ſweet converſe and fellowſhip with God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. They come to duty, and meet
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:004934_0098_100E33EAABC761D8"/>
with God in duty; in praying, hearing, and receiving, they have experience of the gracious, powerful, and heart-quickening, and ſoul-comforting, chearing, ſoftning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit of God, and of the goings forth of their Souls in love unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after, and delight in God. And when it is ſo, how ſweet is this unto their Souls!</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By Chriſt believers are free to a right to heaven &amp; to the enjoyment of the bleſſed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God for ever in his Kingdom. They are made free to the happineſs of the life to come; they ſhall have free admiſſion into the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſe; the gates of heaven ſhall be ſet wide open for their departing Souls, freely, without any ſtop or hinderance, they are free in part now, and they ſhall be perfectly free among the Saints in glory when they dye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. This glory is prepared for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34; and they are prepared for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. And what ſhall be your happineſs then, is beyond the power and ability of any man upon earth fully to declare unto you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. It might be better done by a glorious Angel that is in poſſeſſion of it, than by a ſinful (though ſanctified) man, that lives, and waits, and hopes, and prayeth in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it. Yet the very names by which it called, might help you to ſome
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:004934_0099_100E33EE243E7CF8"/>
conceptions of the greatneſs of its excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and glory: (1) It is called a Crown, and that which far ſurpaſſeth all earthly Crowns, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.5. a Crown of life, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. a Crown of righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. a Crown of Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. (2) It is called a Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. (3) It is called our Maſters joy, <hi>Mat</hi> 25.21, 23. (4) It is called our Fathers Houſe, and the houſe of the Father of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. (5) It is called the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. (6) It is the purchaſe of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. (7) It is called, eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Beſides theſe names by which it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, dwell in your thoughts upon one Text that ſets it forth, till you find your hearts to be affected with it, and long to be poſſeſſed of it, and that is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, where you obſerve how the Apoſtle proceeds by ſteps to come to the top-expreſſion of this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which you are made free.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is called glory. Now free in grace, then in glory. The tho't of that glory would darken and diſgrace the greateſt glory of this world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is called a weight of glory; not a burdenſome weight, not a weight to weary you; are your afflictions weighty? ſo ſhall
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:004934_0099_100E33EE243E7CF8"/>
your glory be: but afflictions are but light, if compared to the weight of glory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is an exceeding weight of Glory; it doth exceed all worldly glory.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is a more exceeding weight of glory; more than can be conceived.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is a far more exceeding weight of glory.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is eternal too. All this is not for a little while only, or for ſome thouſand of years only, but for ever and for ever. The glory of the world, as it is but light, if weighed with this; ſo it is but fading and tranſitory and but ſhort, if compared with this that is eternal. Thus you have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle view (and alas it is but little) of the poſitive freedom and liberty that you have by Chriſt.</p>

THen ſearch your hearts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine narrowly and throughly what you are, bondmen, or freemen, or free; whether yet Captives, or redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet at liberty. The Miſery of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Captives you have heard doth exceed the miſery of Captives by men. And

the good eſtate of ſuch as are made free by Chriſt, you have alſo heard; now ſay to thy ſelf, Tell me, O my Soul, which of theſe two is thy ſtate and thy condition; one of them is thy condition, but which it is, is worthy of thy ſtricteſt ſearch, and moſt diligent enquiry. Are thy fetters knocked off, and thy bonds broken, and thy chain cut, and thou delivered? or art thou yet held faſt by them! Take heed, O my Soul, of being miſtaken in this point. If thou takeſt it for granted, that thou art made free, when yet thou art in bonds, and leaveſt thy body in this miſtake, thou art loſt for ever; if on the other hand thou ſayeſt thou art a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtill, when thou art made free, thou will loſe the comfort of thy freedom, and wilt ſpend thy time and life in complaints, and griefs, and fears, which thou ſhouldſt ſpend in praſing and admiring God for his love and mercy in bringing thee out of thy captivity.</p>
                     <p>For your help herein take theſe few marks to try your ſelves by, for the reſolution of this queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Freemen have their ſpiritual eye-ſight reſtored unto them. When Chriſt opens the priſon-doors to let the Captives out, he doth alſo open their eyes, to let them ſee that in ſin, in God, in Chriſt, in grace and
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:004934_0100_100E33F109C9EBA0"/>
holineſs, that before they never ſaw. That the redeemed Captive crieth out, Oh I never thought my heart had been ſo bad, ſo bad, ſo very bad as now I ſee it is: I never thought, that ſin had been ſo vile, ſo very vile, and ſo deformed as now I plainly ſee it is: I never thought that Chriſt was ſo excellent, and ſo neceſſary, ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me, as now I ſee he is; Oh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he is now altogether lovely, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſirable after I have had a view of the beauty and the excellency of Chriſt, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks all the glory of the world, and all the delights in pleaſure and ſin is darkened, and doth vaniſh and diſappear. Oh how was I blinded in my captivity, that I never ſaw the excellency of Chriſt, and deformity of ſin till now, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18, 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When Chriſt breaks the bonds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with poor Captives were held, he alſo break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their hearts that they have been kept and held thereby in the ſervice of Satan and ſin, from God and Chriſt ſo long. As the eye doth ſee and weep, ſo the heart doth conſider, and bleed, and grieve at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his former folly and ſin. Oh what did I do to ſin againſt this bleſſed, gracious, merciful God! Oh what did I mean ſo long to ſtop mine ears againſt all
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:004934_0101_100E3443DA852388"/>
the calls, and wooings, and intreatings of this Lord-Redeemer, who was ſo kind to ſuffer, bleed, and dye for ſuch a wretch as I, for ſuch a wretch as I, for ſuch a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, diſobedient, and delaying wretch as I. Oh there is no love like his, there is no mercy like to his, there is no kindneſs like to his! Oh why did I ſlight him ſo much, ſo long, ſo very much, ſo very long as I have done! Oh what a fool was I, to prefer the world, the pleaſures and the profits of the world, before this bleſſed Redeemer! Oh what a beaſt was I, to prefer my very luſts and ſins, and the ſervice of the Devil, before this glorious, gracious Saviour, and the ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him that died to deliver me from my bondage! O Lord I am grieved that ever I did ſo; it is the burden and the breaking of my heart that ever I did ſo; Oh now I could waſh my ſelf in tears at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my folly and my madneſs! but if I ſhould, that will not waſh me from my guilt, and from my filth; and becauſe that would not do, this bleſſed Saviour ſhed his blood for the cleanſing of me from my guilt and my pollution. I weep but not enough; my heart is troubled, but not enough, my Soul is humbled within me, but not enough, for ſo great rebellion againſt, and ſlighting of this Lord Redeemer. But I am troubled
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:004934_0101_100E3443DA852388"/>
becauſe I am no more troubled; Lord I grieve, becauſe my heart is yet ſo hard, and can grieve no more; my ſin is bitter unto me now, which once was ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to my Soul.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such as are made free by Chriſt are delivered from the reigning power of ſin. For it is impoſſible to be a willing voluntary ſervant of ſin, and yeild obedience to the Law of ſin, and to be made free by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16, 18. Doth ſin command you, and you obey? hath ſin the chiefeſt room and place in your affections and your hearts, you are then yet in your bondage.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Such as are made free by Chriſt have reſigned up themſelves, their hearts, their love, their all to him, accept of him for Lord as well as for their Saviour, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to take him in all his Offices, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt and King, and giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, do become his ſervants and conſequently yeild obedience to him; they have changed their maſter, and they have changed their work and ways, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new creatures, having new hearts, wills, and affections, ends and deſigns, than what they had before. For the Condition of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being partakers of Chriſt's Redemption is their believing on him, and conſenting to

him as Lord and Saviour, chuſing him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, and loving him above all; and if this you do not do, you are yet in your bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to Satan and to ſin.</p>
                     <p>For is it not reaſonable, you ſhould be his Servants that brings you from this ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? And if he purchaſe and buy you out, is it not reaſonable, you ſhould take him for your Lord, and obey him? and that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, ſubmitting to all his Laws, even to thoſe that are moſt ſpiritual, and croſs to your corrupt hearts &amp; moſt beloved ſins; not pick and chuſe, but to have reſpect unto them all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. conſtantly, not by fits and ſtarts, not only when in ſtraits and ſickneſs, but at all times to have the frame, and bent, and inclination of your hearts to yield obedience to Chriſt, your Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: freely and voluntarily as matter of your choice; from a free principle of love, becauſe you love him, you will pray to him becauſe you love him, you will hear from, and wait and attend upon him, rejoicing when you pleaſe him, grieving when you do offend him.</p>
                     <p>If by theſe things you diſcover what you are, bond or free, I ſhall cloſe the whole with an Exhortation to both ſorts, both bond and free.</p>

                        <hi>Uſe</hi> of Exhortation, 1 To you that art bound, that you would look after ſpiritual freedom; young men that have hard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, long to be made free; and thoſe that be in priſons and chains, long to be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſhall any of you be content to bide in your thraldom? what will ſin do for you? and what will Satan do for you that you are ſo loth to leave their ſervice? Is the Redeemer come, and wilt thou not mind him? hath he paid the ranſom, and waiteth for thy acceptance of him, and wilt thou ſtill refuſe him, and the liberty and freedom thou mayſt have by him, and canſt not have without him? What ſay you Sirs, you young and old? ſhall I have your anſwer? will you be made free, or will you continue in your bondage? if thou wilt, thou mayeſt; be but willing, and thy chain ſhall be taken from thee. If thou will not remember liberty was offered to thee, &amp; thou didſt refuſe it, thou wouldſt not be free. Though thou haſt been a very vile ſinner, and rebellious, yet thou mayeſt be made free <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. Do theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Labour to convince thy ſelf that thou waſt born in bondage, a ſlave by nature to Satan and Sin. The Phariſees did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they were in bondage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

did not look out to Chriſt to be made free, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.33. This is the undoing of multitudes, that they conclude their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be good, when it is not ſo; and they conclude before they try. Did you but ſee your bonds, and underſtanding your ſlavery, Miniſters would have hopes that by their Sermons they may do you good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Work upon thy heart by ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, thy miſery and deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition while thou art in a ſtate of bondage. When by diligent ſearch thou haſt found thy ſelf in a bondage-condition, hold thy thoughts unto this ſubject till thou art awakened and affected with it; think with thy ſelf, and ſay, Oh my ſoul! being <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     <p n="3">3. Set thy ſelf under the preaching of the word, and conſtantly attend upon God, and come to the hearing of the word, as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> an Ordinance of God, and look upon faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters as the Ambaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt, that come to you in the Name of Chriſt, as having Authority from God to propoſe the Goſpel-conditions of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:004934_0103_100E33F31D7D2DD8"/>
from Captivity, and to treat with you in the Name of God about your being made free. So indeed it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. You come to hear a man's Parts; but you do not look upon them as perſons in Office, having a commiſſion from God to propound Articles of Peace betwixt God and you; to treat with you from God, and in the Name of God, about your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, and your deliverance from your preſent bondage, and future torment. Did you believe this, would you ſit and ſleep as if what were delivered to you were not worth the hearing and regarding? or would you ſit and hear, and go away and ſlight all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     <p n="4">4. Make application of the Word of God, when you hear it, unto your ſelves. This is ſpoken unto me, this is my miſery, and this is my condition, and this is my danger; and mercy offered to ſinners, is offered unto me; and Chriſt is tendered unto me to help me out of my woful ſtate of bondage. The Miniſter maketh Uſes of the Doctrine he delivers, but all this is ineffectual, till you take it and lay it home to your own hearts: for want of this, you ſit and hear like people not concerned; you ſit and hear without affection, and go away without the due and powerful effect of the Word upon your

hearts. Let Conſcience tell thee, thou art the Drunkard, the Hypocrite, the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; that is threatned and in danger of damnation.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Look up to God through the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and beyond the Miniſter that doth ſpeak unto thy heart and conſcience. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might ſpeak, and Conſcience might not ſpeak; Miniſter and Conſcience might both ſpeak; Conſcience ſeconding the Miniſter, that ſaith, Thou art in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition while thou art in ſpiritual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: Yes, ſaith Conſcience too, ſo thou art; and yet till God ſhall ſpeak, thou wilt not hearken. Oh then when you come to the place where ſinners are made free, look up to God that he would ſpeak unto your hearts.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Pray to God that he would have mercy on thee, and pity thee in thy bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and help thee out. As a poor priſoner, looks through the grates to Heaven, and ſay, Lord, ſome pity for a poor Priſoner, ſome relief and help for a poor Captive. Lord, I am in chains of ſin, but cannot break them, held faſt by Satan, oh let me not periſh; oh let me not live and dye in this ſpiritual bondage? the ranſome is paid for my redemption, I give my ſelf to thee, upon my knees, I do reſign my ſelf, my

will, my love, my heart, and all to thee. Sinner, Wilt thou, when thou comeſt home, not ſit and talk vainly, and not ſit idly as heretofore; but go apart, and beg of God for mercy, and do it earneſtly; for it is for thy life, thy Soul.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Exhortation: To you that are ſet at liberty; Your priviledge is a ſingular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and calleth for ſomething ſingular from you. You were debtors to God, and priſoners to his Juſtice, and were liable to everlaſting impriſonment in the life to come; but Chriſt hath made you free, and you are free indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36. Stir up and awaken your ſelves to theſe following duties.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Be thankful unto God and Chriſt, that of bond-men you are made free. If a Captive were delivered out of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlavery by the means of another; or a man expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a perpetual Impriſonment for his debt, another ſhould free him from the priſon, and the danger thereof; What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of thankfulneſs would he abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly utter, ſaying, O Sir, I ow my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe, and freedom from my future dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, unto you. I ſhall never forget your kindneſs while I live. I do acknowledge I have not ſuch another friend that have done the like for me, in all the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Foraſmuch then as the difference of being
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:004934_0105_100E33FA15451950"/>
a debtor to man; of being expoſed to a priſon upon earth, and to the priſon of Hell, is unſpeakably great, methinks you ſhould think how ready Chriſt was for to engage and to become your Surety, to die for you, that you might live, to be bound for you, that your Bonds might be broken, and your ſoul eſcape, and not have your heart affected with his love, and your tongue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his praiſes? <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <q>Who is this that engaged his heart to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto me? ſaith the Lord.</q> Who is this Forward Engager, that is ſo willing and hearty in this work? It is one that is able and mighty to ſave, to redeem by price and power, poor Captive Sinners, even the only Son of the ever bleſſed God; and ſo he is ſaid to be our Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. A Surety is one that undertakes for, or gives aſſurance in the behalf of another; one entring into Bond and ſtanding engaged for another to do and to perform for another, what he was bound to do. Among men Suretiſhip is a dangerous thing; he diſſures his own eſtate that is ſurety for another, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.15. <q>He that is ſurety for a ſtranger ſhall ſmart for it: and he that hateth ſuretiſhip is ſure.</q> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuretiſhip is thus among men, yet Chriſt would become a Surety for us to God
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:004934_0105_100E33FA15451950"/>
himſelf, to bring us forth from our Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: and that you might be the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and inflamed with his love, conſider how far he acted for poor Captives beyond whatever man did for any man.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How many Captives Chriſt engageth for! How many millions he became a Surety for, for their ranſome and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! one man might be bound and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Surety for one, or two, but who will be Surety for thouſands? I eſpecially if you add,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The greatneſs of the Debt of thoſe he became a Surety for; One man might he perſwaded to be Surety for another, if the Debt be ſmall; but if it be for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and for millions, men are ſhie, but if it be for multitudes that owe ſuch great ſums, every one ſo much, who will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be Surety for them? but if they be in Priſon or in Bondage there they lie for want of money of their own, or Suretiſhip from another. But Chriſt became Surety for multitudes, and each one owed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that it doth paſs the ſkill of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Arithmetician to caſt up the total ſum that one of theſe Priſoners were in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage for.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt knew moſt certainly that he ſhould pay undoubtedly the Debt of all, he
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:004934_0106_100E33FD9F106868"/>
became a Surety for. Many men are Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for others, hoping they ſhall never be called upon for the Debt, but that the Debtor will pay it himſelf; ſome will be bound for a man, whom they judge to be worth as much as they owe and more too; but if it be a poor man, not worth one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and his debt be thouſands, who will then become Surety for him? a Priſoner he is, and ſo he is like to be: and if any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bound for another, and pay the debt for him, what trouble doth this cauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? it breaks his ſleep, and he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with himſelf, that ever he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bond, and ſaith it ſhall be a warning to me, while I live, how I become a Surety for another; I thought him able enough, elſe I would not have brought my ſelf into ſuch ſnares.</p>
                     <p>But all this was known to Chriſt, when he did become our Surety. He knew our beggary and our poverty, that we could not contribute the ſmalleſt mite, towards the ſatisfaction to be made in order to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Captives from their Bondage; and he knew that God would not ſpare him, but exact the utmoſt from him, and yet he did voluntarily undertake our ranſome. Oh what love was this!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt became a Surety for you, when
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:004934_0106_100E33FD9F106868"/>
you were a ſtranger to him. He did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to releaſe you out of your Bonds and Fetters when you had no ſpecial actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al relation to him, Some men will not be Sureties for their moſt intimate acquaintance, and near relation, not for a Brother, father, ſon, but for a ſtranger who will do it? here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then admire the love of Chriſt that when you were in Chains of ſin and guilt, and a ſtranger too, Chriſt did undertake and did pay a ranſome for you.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yet more to affect your heart, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that Chriſt did ranſom you from your Captivity when you were an enemy unto him. A man might poſſibly take ſome pity on a ſtranger, but an enemy that hates him, and that would and doth diſhonour and reproach him, who would be deeply engaged for him? yet Chriſt did this for you, when you were enemies unto Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Yet to raiſe your admiration and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection more, Conſider Chriſt did become a Surety for you, before you did or could deſire any ſuch kindneſs at his hands. What Man or Angel could have thought of the ranſoming of Captives by the Son of God becoming the Son of Man, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf redeem us by his blood? How long
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:004934_0107_100E33FFB33A6910"/>
might you aſk, how many might you go to, and how many entreaties might you uſe before you can prevail with one to be engaged for much, when you have nothing of your own? but Chriſt did this for us all, before any man had any ſuch deſire in his heart, thought in his mind, requeſt in his mouth, that he would do ſo great and wonderful a kindneſs for us.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Chriſt did this alone, without any other engaging with him. Men require counter-ſecurity. If I be bound for you (ſaith one) you ſhall find another to be bound with me, to be bound to me, to ſave me harmleſs; or you ſhall make over ſuch houſes, or ſuch lands for my ſecurity, that if I be called upon, or the Bond be put in ſuit againſt me, I might ſave myſelf: But as Chriſt did tread the wine-preſs of God's wrath alone, ſo did he alone undertake to ranſom and redeem us from our bondage and captivity.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Chriſt did never repent of this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, nor deſired to ſtand bound no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Men engaged for others, when they fear they will fail, make all means they can to get out of the bond, and to ſtand ſurety no longer; they will ſcarce ſleep till they have got themſelves free, though the party that is the principal debtor be arreſted and
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:004934_0107_100E33FFB33A6910"/>
put in priſon. But Jeſus Chriſt our Lord-Redeemer and Surety, to bring us out of bondage was canſtant to the death; and when <hi>Peter</hi> did diſſwade him from ſuffering (which was the payment of our ranſome) how ſharply did Chriſt rebuke him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21, 22, 23? Yea he was deſirous of the time of actual performance. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.50. <q>I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed.</q> Chriſt never ſaid, it doth repent me, that I did ever undertake to ranſom Captive ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; God ſaid indeed, it did repent him that he made man. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. but Chriſt never did repent that he had engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to redeem ſinners.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Conſider what it was that was tha price that Chriſt did give to make you free from your captivity. Men might be Surety for men to pay a ſum of money; but Chriſt became our Surety to the ſhedding of his own moſt precious blood. Men might give ſome money to redeem a Captive from Turkiſh ſlavery; but Chriſt himſelf, his Life, his Soul and Body, to bring us from our bitter bondage, and miſerable captivity. Thus take ſome time to ponder upon the Lord your ſurety, that did ſo freely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ranſoming of your captivated Souls. Which was the fourth head to get your
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:004934_0108_100E34042DB61E30"/>
hearts affected with this priviledge of being ſet at liberty.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Conſider, That God was pleaſed to accept of the undertaking of Chriſt, and what he hath laid down for your ranſom from captivity. God might have exacted the debt from man that did owe it. It is a voluntary act for a man to become a ſurety, no man is to be compelled to it; and it is a voluntary act of the creditor to accept of ſuch a ſurety, they are both free and at their choice; but when the one offers himſelf to become bound, and the other doth accept of his ſuretiſhip, then is the debtor or priſoner relieved.</p>
                     <p>It was free love in Chriſt to become our Redeemer, it was grace in God to accept of Chriſt's ranſome for us. The Son might have ſaid, Man hath ſinned, why ſhould I ſuffer? Man hath deſerved the wrath of God, let him undergo it: And the Father might have ſaid, Man hath tranſgreſſed my Law, and violated my Covenant, and I will make him ſruffer for it; they have brought themſelves into bonds of miſery, and they ſhall lie therein, and they that ſinned, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall die. Oh wonder then at this bleſſed agreement between the Father and the Son, for the bringing forth poor Souls in Bondage from their Captivity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="215" facs="unknown:004934_0108_100E34042DB61E30"/>Sixthly, From all the former it follows the Salvation of ſuch as are made free, is ſure and certain. Heaven now belongeth unto you; and the glory above you have a title to; Doth Satan object againſt you, that you have ſinned, and deſerved to lie in everlaſting Chains, you might reply: it is true, but Chriſt is my Surety and Redeemer, and hath ſet me free? Doth the Law of Conſcience accuſe you, you might anſwer all from the Ranſom of your Redeemer. Do you fear the Juſtice of God, why your Debt is paid by your Surety, and then the Debtor cannot be caſt into Priſon. The Surety and the Debtor in Law are but one Perſon, and the Surety is liable to make ſatisfactory payment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.26, 27, and Chriſt hath done it, and you diſcharged.</p>
                     <p>God hath given ſome to Chriſt, whom he is to bring to Heaven; and they ſhall not periſh, <hi>John</hi> 6.38, 39, 40. as <hi>Judah</hi> did engage to <hi>Jacob</hi> for <hi>Benjamin; Gen.</hi> 43.9. <q>I will be Surety for him, of my hands thou ſhalt require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and ſet him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.</q> And therefore when <hi>Benjamin</hi> was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Joſeph, Judah</hi> pleads hard, and offers himſelf to abide in his ſtead and to be
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:004934_0109_100E3406F9FB1FD8"/>
a Bondman there; ſo that <hi>Benjamin</hi> might return to his Father with his Brethren <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.33. Chriſt hath undertaken to bring all thoſe out of their Bonds and Fetters, which the Father gave unto him, and to ſet them in Heaven before him. The price is paid, the Bonds are broken, the Chains fallen from your Souls, in which you were held while unconverted: as he hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Priſon-doors that you might come forth, ſo he will open to you the Palace gates that you may enter in: for hopes hereof be thankful, be exceeding thankful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord your Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>Second Exhortation. The next Duty I would preſs upon you is, to be compaſſionate, and to put on tender bowels of pity towards thoſe that yet are bound in the Fetters and Chains of their ſin and guilt; whileſt you do rejoice in that you are free, do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to commiſerate them that yet are Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let Miniſters think of this when they are ſtudying for, and praying for, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their people, how they be in Bondage and in ſlavery, and that except their Chains be looſed &amp; their Fetters, broken and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, their ſouls are loſt for ever, and that they will be faſter ſhortly, bound hand and Foot and caſt into a place of outer and
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:004934_0109_100E3406F9FB1FD8"/>
eternal darkneſs; ſome ſerious and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts of their preſent danger, and their future miſery would put more life into all we do for their recovery and prevention of their everlaſting condemnation. Should we then preach unto them with ſuch luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, as if we were telling them a tale, or ſaying ſuch things in that manner, as if we did not believe our ſelves the things we do declare? or as if it were no matter I whether our hearers did believe, receive and obey the Meſſage we deliever to them or no? when yet they be the great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty truths of everlaſting Life or Death: to preach a Redeemer to Captive ſouls what ſkill and life, and love doth it require? what zeal and pity to their Souls doth it call for? Oh that God would pardon the want of theſe in me, give me that belief of their eternal ſtate and ſeriouſneſs of heart, that I may ever ſpeak and preach the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to enſlave ſinners, as to thoſe that are undone for ever, except they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to come to him, ſubmit to him, accept of him, and give up themſelves to be His wholly, and to be his only that hath paid the ranſom for their deliverance. When ſome years ſince I was called occaſionally to preach to the Priſoners in New-gate, and ſaw my Hearers come in Fetters, and heard their
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:004934_0110_100E34091D847908"/>
Chains ratling at their heels, methoughts it was an affecting ſpectacle to ſee men before me that were ſhortly to be called to the Bar of Men, and be tried for their lives, and ſome likely to be ſentenc'd to death and put to execution: but if we do behold our Hearers ſtanding before us, though free from ſuch material Chains of Iron, yet bound faſt in their luſts and ſins, that conſider they muſt be ſhortly tried at the Bar of God, and if not delivered by Chriſt, muſt receive a ſentence of death, baniſhed from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the bleſſed God, caſt down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and damned Spirits, it ſhould move us to pray for them, weep over them, and preach unto them, with greateſt pity and compaſſion. To ſtand and view ſo many perſons, amongſt whom many are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Captives, whom he is leading Fettered to eternal perdition, ſhould raiſe in our hearts ſtrong workings of affection towards them, and ſpeak unto them with that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and tender love, as becometh thoſe that are ſpeaking in the Name of God to loſt ſinners, in order to their recovery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from Captivity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let Parents that are made free, pity and compaſſionate their Children that yet are bound. If any of your Children ſhould be laid in Irons for ſome Fact committed
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:004934_0110_100E34091D847908"/>
againſt the Laws of men, and carried bound to Execution, would not this like a Sword pierce your very hearts, be matter of grief and trouble to you? would not tears plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully flow from your eyes, and bitter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations from your mouth, that ever you ſhould bring forth, and bring up children that ſhould end their days in ſuch reproach and infamy to you and them? or if any of you had a Son abroad, and you ſhould hear he were taken Captive by the Turks, or were in the Spaniſh Inquiſition, what ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of tears! what ringing of hands! what ſmiting on the breaſt would theſe tidings make! what dolorous complaints and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous moans would you make! ſaying, Oh my Son, my Son, my poor afflicted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Son, thou art fallen into the Hands of barbarous and cruel men; thou art put to drudgery and ſlavery! O my Son, my Son, what ſhall I do for thee, my Son. O that I could give or find a ranſom for him! if all I have would ſet him free, he ſhould not lie in Chains and Fetters, nor continue in that ſore Captivity! Why, you Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents! would you thus lament the miſery of your Children's body, and do you make nothing of the miſery of your Children's ſouls! would you thus take on, and grieve and mourn for their outward Bondage,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:004934_0111_100E340DF88204C8"/>
which is conſiſtent with the good condition of their ſouls, and will ſhortly have an end, and yet it is nothing to you, to ſee them in their ſpiritual bondage, captivated by Satan, and in danger of being caſt into an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dungeon of black and thick Darkneſs! Oh why do you not ſpeak to them, and tell them of their miſery and their remedy; how they came into this condition, and how they may get out of it? why do you not day and night plead with them, inſtruct them, and exhort them, that they may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Torments of Hell hereafter, by being brought out of their bondage now? why do you not pray to God, that he would make them free? why do you not plead at the throne of grace, and ſay, Lord I have Children that are Satan's Captives, my poor Children are faſt bound in Fetters of ſin, in the Bonds of iniquity, O thou God of grace that haſt ſhewed favour unto me, ſhew fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to my children alſo! Oh that they may be releaſed! Oh that thou wouldſt pleaſe to pity them in their Bondage, and for the ranſom of thy Son let them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd and by the powerful workings of thy Spirit have their wills ſubdued, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to accept of the only Redeemer; him thou didſt ſend to proclaim Liberty to Captives, Oh that by thy grace thou wouldſt
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:004934_0111_100E340DF88204C8"/>
cauſe them to come in, and lay hold upon the mercy granted in the Proclamation of the Goſpel, that they might not periſh in their Bonds.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let Maſters that are made free and ſet at liberty have compaſſion on their ſervants that are fettered in their Chains of ſin. They are not only bound to you (to be ſo bound is in order to their good and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) but are alſo bound in the Cords of their Iniquity, which is their preſent ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and tendeth to their eternal miſery; doth it not pity you, to ſee your Servants, to be ſervants of the Devil, and in bondage to their luſts? doth not your Hearts work within you to conſider that any under your Roof ſhould be drudges unto Satan? or do you ſee this, and have you nothing to ſay unto them all the week long, to make them apprehenſive of their Danger, and ſenſible of their miſery? is it enough for you to teach them the ſkill and art of your trade, and at the expiration of ſeven years to make them free, while you do neglect to help them (as inſtruments under God) out of the thraldom of Satan and of ſin? or can it ſatisfy you that they have at the end of their Service to you, the freedom of the City or Corporation where you and they do dwell, while they are not brought into the liberty
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:004934_0112_100E3410EFAB4710"/>
of the Sons of God? or can you have peace in the neglect of your duty, to think they came into your family Bond-ſlaves to ſin, and after ſeven years time, they go out as they came in? or ſhould you not endeavour that they may be ſpiritually free, while they continue ſervants unto you? Oh how would they have cauſe to bleſs God for you, and that ever they came within your doors, and dwelt within your walls, if they may ſay, when I firſt became a Servant to my Maſter, I was a Servant to my luſts alſo, but by his inſtructions, admonitions, and example, I became a ſervant of God, before I ceaſed to be a ſervant unto him? If it ſhould be otherwiſe, let it not be through your neglect; for as it will not be without ſin and miſery to your ſervants, ſo neither will it be without guilt on you.</p>
                     <p>The like I might urge upon other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, acquaintance and friends, huſbands to have compaſſion on their Wives, wives on their huſbands, one Neighbour on another; you that know what it is to have been in theſe Bonds, and what it is to be made free, do your utmoſt to help and ſuccour them that be in chains of ſin, and know not the evil of it, nor the good of the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and therefore mourn not under the one, nor deſire to be bro't forth into the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="227" facs="unknown:004934_0112_100E3410EFAB4710"/>Third Exhortation. Were you in Bonds, and are they broke? in Fetters and are they knocked off? then walk in the whole courſe of your lives as becomes a ranſomed and redeemed people. It will not become you to live and act as others do; as there is a wonderful difference between your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the condition of others, ſo there muſt be between your Converſation and the Converſation of others. See that you be humble, holy, heavenly: ſee that you be fruitful in every good work: faithful to your Lord Redeemer, and be no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with thoſe Sins and ſnares you are delivered from. Now you are enlarged, walk cloſe with God, holy ſtrictneſs is the greateſt and the trueſt liberty. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.45. <q>I will walk at liberty: for ſeek thy Precepts.</q> Remember he that hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to liberty, gives you not leave to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, but to tread in the paths of piety. Go on then, hold on your way, continue and perſevere therein to the end, and when the Servants of Sin, at the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Death, and the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall be bound in a place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pain and torment, you ſhall be free in a Place, a Palace of Reſt and Light, of Life and Love, ſinging, ſounding forth the everlaſting Praiſes of your Redeemer.</p>
