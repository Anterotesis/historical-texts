            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF RULE To guide the Common People of NEW-ENGLAND How to order themselves and theirs in the Small Pocks, or Measels.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>small Pox</hi> (whose nature and cure the <hi>Measels</hi> follow) is a disease in the blood, endeavouring to recover a new form and state.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This nature attempts—1. By Separation of the impure from the pure, thrusting it out from the Veins to the Flesh.—2. By driving out the impure from the Flesh to the skin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The first Separation is done in the first four dayes by a Feaverish boyling (Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of the Blood, laying down the impurities in the Fleshy parts which kindly effected the Feaverish tumult is calmed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The second Separation from the Flesh to the Skin, or <hi>Superficies</hi> is done through the rest of the time of the disease.</p>
            <p n="5">5 There are several Errors in ordering these sick ones in both these Operations of Nature which prove very dangerous and commonly deadly either by overmuch hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature beyond its own pace, or in hindering of it from its own vigorous operation.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Separation by Ebullition in the Feaverish heat is over heightned by too much Clothes, too hot a room hot <hi>Cordials,</hi> as <hi>Diascordium, Gascons powder</hi> and such like, for hence come <hi>Phrenzies,</hi> dangerous excessive sweats, or the flowing of the Pocks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one overspreading sore, vulgarly called the Flox.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The same seperation is overmuch hindred by preposterous cooling that Feaverish boyling heat, by blood <hi>letting, Glysters, Vomits, purges,</hi> or <hi>cooling medicines.</hi> For though these many times hasten the coming forth of the <hi>Pox,</hi> yet they take away that supply which should keep them out till they are ripe, wherefore they sink in again to the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly danger of the sick.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If a <hi>Phrensie</hi> happen, or through a <hi>Plethoric</hi> (that is fulness of blood) the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood be hindred, and thereupon the whole mass of blood choaked up, then either let blood, Or see that their diet, or medicines be not altogether cooling, but let them in no wise be heating, therefore let him lye no otherwise covered in his bed then he was wont in health: His Chamber not made hot with fire if the weather be temperate, let him drink small Beer only warm'd with a Tost let him sup up thin <hi>water-gruel,</hi> or <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pottage</hi> made only of Indian Flour and water, instead of <hi>Oat-meal:</hi> Let him eat <hi>boild Apples:</hi> But I would not advise at this time any medicine besides. By this means that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive <hi>Ebullition</hi> (or boyling of his blood) will by degrees abate, and the Symptoms cease; If not, but the blood be so inraged that it will admit no delay, then either let blood (if Age will bear it) or else give some notably cooling medicine, or refresh him with more free Air.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But if the boiling of the blood be weak and dull that there is cause to fear it is not able to work a Separation, as it's wont to be in such as have been let blood, or are fat, or Flegmatick, or brought low by some other sickness or labour of the (<hi>Gonorrhea</hi>) run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reins, or some other Evacuation: In such Cases, <hi>Cordials</hi> must drive them out, or they must dy.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In time of driving out the <hi>Pocks</hi> from the Flesh, here care must be had that the <hi>Pustules</hi> keep out in a right measure till they have attain'd their end without going in again, for that is deadly.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In this time take heed when the <hi>Pustules</hi> appear whilst not yet ripe, least by too much heat there arise a new <hi>Ebullition</hi> (or Feaverish boyling) for this troubles the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out, or brings back the separated parts into the blood, or the Fleshy parts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated are disabled from a right suppuration or lastly the temper of the blood and tone of the Flesh is so perverted that it cannot overcome and digest the matter driven out.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Yet on the other hand the breaking out must not be hindred, by exposing the sick unto the cold. The degree of heat must be such as is natural agrees with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the fleshy parts: That which exceeds or falls short is dangerous: Therefore the season of the year, Age of the sick, and their manner of life here require a discreet and different Consideration, requiring the Counsel of an expert Physician.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But if by any error a new <hi>Ebullition</hi> ariseth, the same art must be used to allay it as is before exprest.</p>
            <p n="14">14. If the <hi>Pustles</hi> go in and a flux of the belly follows (for else there is no such danger) then <hi>Cordials</hi> are to be used, yet moderate and not too often for fear of new <hi>Ebullition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. If much spitting (<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>) follow, you may hope all will go well, therefore by no means hinder it: Only with warm small Beer let their mouths be washed.</p>
            <p n="16">16. When the <hi>Pustles</hi> are dryed and fallen, purge well, especially if it be in <hi>Autumn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. As soon as this disease therefore appears by its signs, let the sick abstein from Flesh and Wine, and open Air, let him use small Bear warmed with a Tost for his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary drink, and moderately when he desires it. For food use <hi>water-gruel, water-pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> and other things having no manifest hot quality, easy of digestion boild Apples, and milk sometimes for change, but the coldness taken off. Let the use of his bed be according to the season of the year, and the multitude of the <hi>Pocks,</hi> or as sound persons are wont. In Summer let him rise according to custome, yet so as to be defended both from heat and cold in Excess, the disease will be the sooner over and less troublesome, for being kept in bed nourisheth the Feaverish heat and makes the <hi>Pocks</hi> break out with a painful inflamation.</p>
            <p n="19">19. In a colder season and breaking forth of a multitude of <hi>Pustules,</hi> forcing the sick to keep his bed, let him be covered according to his custome in health, a moderate fire in the winter being kindled in his Chamber, morning and Evening: neither need he keep his Arms alwayes in bed, or ly still in the same place, for fear least he should sweat which is very dangerous especially to youth.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Before the fourth day use no medicines to drive out, nor be too strict with the sick; for by how much the more gently the <hi>Pustules</hi> do grow, by so much the fuller and perfecter will the Separation be.</p>
            <p n="21">21. On the fourth day a gentle <hi>Cordial</hi> may help once given.</p>
            <p n="22">22. From that time a small draught of warm milk (not hot) a little dy'd with <hi>Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron</hi> may be given morning and evening till the <hi>Pustules</hi> are come to their due greatness and ripeness.</p>
            <p n="23">23. When the <hi>Pustules</hi> begin to dry and crust, least the rotten vapours strike inward, which sometimes causeth sudden death; Take morning and evening some temperate <hi>Cordial</hi> as four or five spoonfuls of <hi>Malaga wine</hi> tinged with a little <hi>Saffron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. When the <hi>Pustules</hi> are dryd and fallen off, purge once and again, especially in the <hi>Autumn Pocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="25">25. Beware of anointing with <hi>Oils, Fatts, Ointments,</hi> and such defensives, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corrupted matter in the <hi>Pustules</hi> from drying up, by the moisture they fret deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the Flesh, and so make the more deep Scarrs.</p>
            <p n="26">26. The young and lively men that are brought to a plentiful sweat in this sickness, about the eighth day the sweat stops of it self, by no means afterwards to be drawn out again; the sick thereupon feels most troublesome disrest and anguish, and then makes abundance of water and so dyes.</p>
            <p>Few young men and strong thus handled escape, except they fall into abundance of spitting or plentiful bleeding at the nose.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Signs discovering the Assault at first are beating pain in the head. Forehead and temples, pain in the back, great sleepiness, glistring of the eyes, shining glimmerings seem before them, itching of them also, with tears flowing of themselves, itching of the Nose, short breath, dry Cough, oft neezing, hoarseness, heat, redness, and sense of pricking over the whole body, terrors in the sleep, sorrow and restlessness, beating of the heart, <hi>Urine</hi> sometimes as in health, sometime filthy from great <hi>Ebullition,</hi> and all this or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these with a Feaverish distemper.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Signs warning of the probable Event. If they break forth easily, quickly, and soon come to ripening, if the Symptomes be gentle, the Feaver mild, and after the breaking forth it abates. If the voice be free, and breathing easie, especially if the Pox be red white distinct, soft few, round, sharp top'd, only without and not in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts; if there be large bleeding at the nose. These signs are hopeful.</p>
            <p n="29">29. But such signs are doubtful, when they difficultly appear, when they sink in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when they are black, blewish, green, hard, all in one, if the Feaver abate not with their breaking forth if there be Swooning, difficulty of breathing, great thirst, quinsey, great unquietness, and it is very dangerous, if there be ioyn'd with it some other malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feaver, called by some the pestilential Pox: the <hi>Spotted Feaver</hi> is oft joyned with it.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Deadly Signs if the <hi>Flux</hi> of the <hi>Belly</hi> happen, when they are broke forth, if the Urine be bloody, or black, or the <hi>Ordure</hi> of that Colour; Or if pure blood be cast out by the Belly or Gumms: These Signs are for the most part deadly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These things have I written</hi> Candid Reader, <hi>not to imform the Learned</hi> Physitian <hi>that hath much more cause to understand what pertains to this disease than I, but to give some light to those that have not such advantages, leaving the difficulty of this disease to the</hi> Physitians <hi>Art, wisdome, and Faithfulness: for the right managing of them in the whole Course of the disease tends both to the</hi> Patients <hi>safety, and the</hi> Physitians <hi>disired Success in his Administrations: For in vain is the</hi> Physitians <hi>Art imployed, if they are not under a</hi> Regular Regiment. <hi>I am, though no</hi> Physitian, <hi>yet a well wisher to the sick: And therefore intreating the Lord to turn our hearts, and stay his hand, I am</hi>
