            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN the following ſermon was compoſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, the author had not the moſt diſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, nor expectation that it would ever undergo the preſs. It was delivered on different ſabbaths, that is, as two ſermons, though compoſed as one: and the author had juſt the ſame ſimple intention in it, as all his other miniſtrations to his flock, viz. to promote the cauſe of truth, piety and virtue among thoſe to whom he miniſters. Some time after, he received the following addreſs,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, I preſume, the indiſpenſible duty of all rational creatures, to praiſe God in that manner to which the powers of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reſpectively, enable them. And I preſume alſo, that among all the ranks of rational creatures of which we have any knowledge, and who have either retained their innocence, or have return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God after offending him, it will be found, that praiſe maks a principle part of their devotion. Thus Jehovah ſays, that when he laid the foundations of the earth, "the morning ſtars ſang together, and the ſons of God ſhouted for joy."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Job. 38, 7.</note> And from the viſions which the Apoſtle John had of the heavenly world, it plainly appears, that angels and the ſpririts of juſt men made perfect are chiefly employed in the pleaſing exerciſe.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Rev. 5, 9.—1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>With regard to the church on earth, it is evident, that compoſitions in praiſe of God, were made and uſed in the early periods of it; ſome of which, on great and ſingular occaſions, are tranſmitted down to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:046389_0004_1021573F28D1C888"/>us;<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Exod, 15 chap.</note> and in after times, when the church was more fully organized, a large collection of ſuch compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was uſed in Divine Worſhip, formed chiefly by David, the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael. Under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel diſpenſation the duty of the church, and of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, in this, as in other reſpects, is ſtill more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed. Chriſt the Lawgiver and Pattern of his Church, ſung an hymn with his diſciples after he had inſtituted and celebrated the ordinance of his ſupper: and his Apoſtle expreſſly enjoins it upon all, not only in my text, as you have heard, but alſo in his epiſtle to the Epheſians, in theſe words, "And be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſs; but be filled with the ſpirit; ſpeaking to yourſelves in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging and making melody in your heart to the Lord."<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Epheſ, 5. 18, 19.</note> Moreover, comparing this paſſage with the text, it will appear, that <hi>praiſing God</hi> is an act of worſhip which ſhould be performed both in public and in private: for as in the one we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to teach and admoniſh one another, ſo in the other to ſpeak to ourſelves in pſalms, hymns, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But it may be enquired—Do all theſe expreſſions, <hi>pſalms, hymns</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual ſongs,</hi> ſignify one and the ſame thing; and particularly, do they mean the Book of Pſalms contained in the old Teſtament, excluſive of all others?</p>
            <p>The ſolution of this is of conſiderable importance —And to it I anſwer, that theſe terms neither mean one and the ſame thing originally, nor have we any reaſon to conclude that they reſer to any one ſyſtem or collection of compoſitions whatever, which was extant in the Apoſtles days for praiſing God, and excluſive of all others.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>pſalm</hi> originally means <hi>a compoſition of muſical notes, tune</hi> or <hi>air</hi> performed upon an inſtrument
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:046389_0005_10215740B38F2478"/>of muſic, and was not neceſſary to be accompanied with either words or voice. It is derived from a <hi>root</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>to ſtrike gently,</hi> or more with a certain agitation; becauſe the ſtrings of muſical inſtruments require to be ſtruck or moved with the fingers or other inſtrument for that purpoſe. David was finely ſkilled in inſtrumental muſic, as well as in poetry: and it is undeniable that throughout the Jewiſh diſpenſation, eſpecially in his time, inſtruments of muſic were uſed in the worſhip of God. On this account it was, that the compoſitions of David, and of others, which were uſed by the Jewiſh Church, were called <hi>pſalms,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whilſt the choir and others ſung the words, the muſicians always performed the tune upon ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. Hence it is that we find them directing their compoſitions to the muſician, to be performed on ſuch or ſuch an inſtrument. And hence alſo it is, that they ſo frequently call upon the church to praiſe God with timbrel, pſaltery, harp, organ, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A <hi>hymn</hi> is a poetical compoſition, or verſes, made to celebrate ſome perſon, or action, or to bewail ſome mournful event; without any regard to muſic. It is deſigned to be read or recited; and although it may be accompanied with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n inſtrument, or the voice, yet theſe are not neceſſary to its origmal deſign.</p>
            <p>The meaning of the term <hi>ſong,</hi> is univerſally known—it is always deſigned for the voice—to be ſung with an air ſuited to the meaſure of the verſe. But the Apoſtle directs that the ſongs of chriſtians ſhould be of a particular kind, as to their ſubject matter, viz. <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;</hi> that is to ſay, ſongs on ſpiritual ſubjects—ſubjects calculated to give religious inſtruction, and to raiſe, or quicken devotion in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>I well know there are many who ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtle, by all thoſe various terms, meant nothing more, nor leſs than the Book of Pſalms contained in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:046389_0006_10215743377B79D8"/>the Old Teſtament. But this is mere opinion: nor have I ever ſeen, or heard any thing in ſupport of it, but opinion, or bare aſſertion.—There are no authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic records, ſacred or profane, which prove that the pſalms of David bore theſe various titles, or were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated by them.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">To be ſatisfied reſpecting the truth of this ſentiment, the candid reader may conſult thoſe writers, ancient and modern, who have treated this ſubject expreſsly, ſuch as Theophylact and Hierom among the ancients—Calvin and Edwards among the moderns. Their own opinions and conjectures, or the opinions and conjectures of others equally deſtitute of authority, is all the evidence they produce to prove that the Apoſtle here means the pſalms of David, excluſive of all others. And it is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that, however they agree in this opinion, no two of them agree as to which of theſe compoſitions were called pſalms, which of them hymns, which of them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſongs;—nor why they obtained theſe different epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets. Hierom ſays pſalms contain moral ſubjects which we ought to practiſe. In direct oppoſition to him, Doctor Edwards ſays, it is a term of great latitude, and is uſed for all thoſe ſongs which contain in them the praiſes of God and ſet forth his ſacred attributes and perfections, and in any way expreſs devotion, or contribute to piety and holineſs. And Calvin, differing from both, alledges that theſe compoſitions which were accompanied with a muſical inſtrument, were called pſalms—Again, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom aſſerts, that an hymn has for its ſubject ſacred things, ſuch as we ought to contemplate and meditate upon. Dr. Edwards ſays that thoſe compoſitions, which were more complete than pſalms, were called hymns; being of a more ſingular and peculiar ſtrain. And Calvin defines it thus, "a ſong of praiſe whether ſung with a high voice or otherwiſe." Once more, Hierom concludes, that ſpiritual ſongs belong to natural things which we ought to debate and diſenſs. Dr. Edwards explains them as being ſtill more perfect compoſitions than even hymns; and as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their ſubject matter the perfections of God as they reſpect us; flow from a ſpiritual frame and to be ſung with great emotion of ſpirit. And ſtill differing from theſe, Calvin ſays, that ſpiritual ſongs are ſuch pſalms as not only contain praiſes, but exhortations, and other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<p>As vague and unſatisfactory is the conjecture of thoſe who alledge that the Apoſtle uſed theſe different terms in conformity to the Hebrew diſtinction of the book of pſalms, by the terms Mizmorim, Tehillim, and Shu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im. For, if it ſhould be even granted, that ſuch a diſtinction was authoritative and general among the Jews, yet neither will this prove that the Apoſtle meant the ſame thing; nor, indeed, do all the various and contradictory expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are given of theſe words, accord with his phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Some ſay, the Mizmorim were pſalms which treated of various ſubjects—others, that they were ſuch as were attended with inſtruments. Some, that the Tehillim only mentioned the praiſes of God—others, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The only places where the word is uſed, are my text—the fifth chapter and nineteenth verſe of the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, and Marks and Matthews Goſpels, where they record that Chriſt ſung an <hi>hymn</hi> with his diſciples, after the inſtitution and celebration of his ſupper.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Matt. 26, 30—Mark 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.</note> Now in all theſe places, there is no one conſideration from the ſcope of the context, or otherwiſe, to make it certain, or even ſo much as likely, that the Old Teſtament pſalms were meant by it. Some, indeed, have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that what Chriſt ſung, after the celebration of his ſupper, was the Jewiſh <hi>Hallel,</hi> beginning with the 113th and ending with the 118th pſalm. But this is ſtill <hi>opinion</hi>—an opinion, too, very ſlenderly founded: for the only reaſon aſſigned is, that the Jews always ſung this portion of the pſalms when they celebrated their paſſover feaſt. And ſurely it is very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſoning, to conclude, that becauſe the Jews ſung <hi>this</hi> on <hi>that occaſion,</hi> therefore the Saviour ſung the ſame, when he had ſet that ordinance entirely aſide, and had inſtituted a quite different one in its room.—It is juſt ſuch reaſoning as if one were to ſay, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are <hi>different,</hi> therefore the concluſion muſt be the <hi>ſame.</hi> Divine wiſdom has not ſeen it fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord particularly, what the Saviour ſung on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but as he had then inſtituted a <hi>new ordinance,</hi> of which there is no hint in the Old Teſtament, I leave it with every one to judge for himſelf whether it be not moſt probable that he himſelf compoſed the hymn he ſung; eſpecially as none of the pſalms directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to that ordinance; and eſpecially, too, as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:046389_0009_1021574B4D630C38"/>who record the tranſaction, call it, uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>an hymn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole,—as theſe <hi>terms</hi> originally ſignify different things—and as there is no <hi>evidence</hi> that the book of pſalms, uſed by the Jews, ever obtained, or was known by theſe various titles; but that, on the contrary, indeed, the title, <hi>pſalms,</hi> was appropriate to it: it will be obvious to conclude, that the Apoſtle did not, by all theſe <hi>terms,</hi> mean that book, excluſive of all others; nor, indeed, any one ſyſtem, or collection of compoſitions then extant. The plain, eaſy, natural, unſophiſticated ſenſe of the words is, <hi>every kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred poetry,</hi> whatever denomination it might come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether pſalm, or hymn, or ſpiritual ſong; and not only thoſe which were then compoſed and in uſe in the chriſtian Church, but alſo thoſe which, from the fullneſs of the word of Chriſt dwelling in believers, they might be enabled, from time to time, to compoſe for their mutual edification, and the glory of God.— And agreeably to this, I ſhall ſubmit the following pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe of the whole verſe, "Let the word of Chriſt, the glorious goſpel,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">When this diſcourſe was compoſed, I thought it was not neceſſary to ſay a ſingle word to prove that the word of Chriſt, ſignifies the Goſpel, particularly; this ſenſe of it being ſo obvious, ſo natural, and ſo agreeable, to the uniform language of the New-Teſtament. I find, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſince, that it has been interpreted as meaning the whole of Divine Revelation; with a view to ſtrengthen the opinion, that the Apoſtle, by the terms, pſalms, hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, meant the book of pſalms exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. Let it, therefore, be obſerved, that this phraſe in the plain and native import of the words, has ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a reference to what God has revealed to us in theſe laſt times, by his SON, as diſtinguiſhed from what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Prophets under former diſpenſations (ſee Heb. 1.1, 2.) that one ſhould certainly have ſome very clear and unequivocal proof, before any other ſenſe be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. None ſuch, however, has been, and I preſume, none ſuch can be given. At any rate, it is no proof, to aſſert roundly, that it means the whole of Divine Revelation; and then exerciſe the invention to find reaſons why it may have, inſtead of proving that it actually has this meaning. —The truth is, not only the native ſenſe of the words, but almoſt innumerable parallel places, both in the context, and elſewhere (compare, among many others, Mark 8, 38) Luke 9, 26. John 5, 24; 8, 31. Acts 13, 26. Rom. 10, 8. 2. Cor. 5, 19. Eph. 4, 20, 21. Col. 1, 5. Heb. 2, 3. prove that ſuch phraſes always refer to the diſcoveries made under the goſpel, as contradiſtinguiſhed from thoſe made under the Jewiſh diſpenſation—conſequently, that is a mere arbitrary interpretation to extend it any further here. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And content not yourſelves with reading or reciting theſe poetical compoſitions, but accompany them with your voice—ſing them to ſuitable airs; yet ſee to it that this external exerciſe be attended with grace in the heart—with ſouls attuned to the matter of the ſong; for as it is addreſſed to the Lord who knows every ſentiment of the heart, it will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him unleſs accompanied with inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>

With regard to the <hi>manner</hi> of performing this duty, I ſhall not trouble you with the controverſy, whether inſtruments of muſic ſhould be uſed in chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian worſhip, or not.

            <p>Once more, our praiſes as well as prayers, ſhould be offered in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:046389_0013_1021575632FAE358"/>ſouls ſhould directly rely upon, and have expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to him, as the only <hi>way</hi> for periſhing ſinners to approach God, and as the only meritorious cauſe of our acceptance with him. We ſhould be exerciſed toward him according to the diſcoveries which we have reſpecting <hi>his perſon—his character—his offices;</hi> and particularly make uſe of his NAME as our great <hi>plea</hi> with God. That is, that <hi>new manner</hi> of approaching the Moſt High, by that new and living way which Chriſt hath conſecrated through the vail of his fleſh, which is peculiar to the chriſtian diſpenſation—which ſaints under the law were not inſtructed in—and which is not to be found in their prayers or praiſes. All this is evident from the following ſcriptures—"And whatſoever ye ſhall aſk in <hi>my name,</hi>" faith the Saviour, "that will I do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

            <p>Theſe are remarkable paſſages, declaring the duty, and the privilege of chriſtians, beyond what was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the Jews, or even to Chriſt's own diſciples
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:046389_0014_10215759413324E8"/>before that time. "Hitherto," ſays he, "ye have aſked nothing in <hi>my name.</hi>" This was the caſe in the Jewiſh worſhip, and is ſo ſtill with them. "But the time cometh when I ſhall ſhew you plainly of the Father." The time referred to here, was very probably the day of Penticoſt. "At that day," adds he, "ye ſhall aſk in <hi>my name.</hi>" And it is very remarkable that the Apoſtle in the verſe following my text, expreſſly applies this command to ſinging the praiſe of God, as well as to other religious exerciſes; for having enjoined this duty he immediately adds, "And whatſoever ye do in word or in deed, do all in <hi>the name</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by him."</p>
            <p>Second. We are to enquire into the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of the praiſe we offer to God. This, indeed, is ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and manifold, that a particular detail of it, is not to be expected. In the general we may obſerve, that as God alone is the <hi>object</hi> of all religious adoration and praiſe, the <hi>matter</hi> thereof ſhould conſiſt of thoſe things which have reſpect to HIM, either conſidered in himſelf, or in his diſpenſations to ourſelves or to others. But as God hath made various diſcoveries of himſelf to fallen man, with gradually encreaſing light and fullneſs, <hi>the matter</hi> of our praiſe ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the clearneſs and fullneſs of the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we enjoy. This, indeed, I take to be ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent—Hence many things become the <hi>matter</hi> of the chriſtians praiſe, which were not, and indeed could not be a ſubject to the faints under former diſpenſations, becauſe they were not revealed. As an example of this, take the hymn which the apoſtle John addreſſed to the Saviour, "Unto him that loved us, and waſhed as from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his Father, unto him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:046389_0015_1021575B0C94F668"/>Where do you find ſuch a ſubject of praiſe before the Goſpel Diſpenſation?—The truth is, little of the real and ſpiritual glory of God—the doctrine of the Trinity —the eternal device of mans ſalvation—the manner of accompliſhing it in the incarnation, life, actions, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, ſufferings and death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, interceſſion and mediatorial kingdom of the Saviour— his final coming to judge the world—the form of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in that awful ſcene—the future ſtate of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked—the diſpenſation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit—his perfection, grace, and ſaving influence.—I ſay, little of theſe things, and of many more that might be mentioned, was diſcovered to mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the birth of Chriſt, <hi>in compariſon of what was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards revealed.</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">If any one has read the ſcripture ſo inattentively, as to need a particular proof of this; let him conſider the following paſſages, 1 Cor. 2 chapter, from the 7th to the 13th verſe. Here the Apoſtle calls the Goſpel, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, a myſtery, hidden till that time; and that thoſe things which eye had not ſeen, ear heard, and of which it had not ſo much as entered the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, before that time, were then revealed to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles by the Spirit, and by them declared plainly to men, that they might know the things which were freely given them of God. In like manner he declares (2 Tim. 1, 10.) that it is by the Goſpel life and immortality are brought to light. And to mention no more, Chriſt, after having promiſed to ſend the Comforter, tells his Diſciples, (John 16, 12, 13, 14,) that when he ſhould come, he would lead them into all truth—and ſhew them the things of Chriſt. But if all neceſſary truth, and the things of Chriſt had been revealed before, this extraordinary diſpenſation of the Spirit to the Apoſtles would have been a very uſeleſs thing.</note> And all theſe are proper <hi>matter</hi> for chriſtian praiſe according to the ſtate of the church —of families—and of individual perſons from time to time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:046389_0016_1021575DE2E85EF0"/>
Thirdly. The <hi>end</hi> we ſhould have in view, in ſinging the praiſes of God, is two-fold, viz, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and reſpecting ourſelves—As it reſpects God, (which is the primary end) we ſhould have in view to extol and honor him—to ſhew forth his glory in the moſt exalted ſtrains—to magnify his great name, which deſerves to be exalted above heaven &amp; earth—to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and declare his ſupreme perfection, his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion, his univerſal agency; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to celebrate his matchleſs wiſdom, love and grace in the decree of man's ſalvation.</p>
            <p>As it reſpects ourſelves, the deſign is, to elevate our affections—enliven our graces—expreſs and promote our ſpiritual joy—and to compoſe the diſtractions of a troubled ſpirit. To this, the exerciſe has a native ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; eſpecially when in concert, we have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>harmony,</hi> and the enlivening ſound of many voices united. It is natural, too, when the heart is full of joy, to give it vent this way, and accordingly the Apoſtle exhorts, "Is any merry let him ſing pſalms<note n="(a)" place="bottom">James 5, 16.</note>. Moreover, the Apoſtle, in my text, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions another end with regard to ourſelves and others, viz. <hi>inſtruction,</hi> "teaching and admoniſhing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſays he, in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs." To this purpoſe alſo, the ordinance is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuited. Moral &amp; religious truths, and indeed, any matter whatever, thrown into plain &amp; agreeable verſe, generally makes a more laſting impreſſion on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, than proſe compoſitions; and when they are frequently repeated, or ſung, the effect will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally more laſting and ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. I ſhall now proceed to lay down ſome principles for the regulation of our conduct in this important part of worſhip. And</p>

It would ſurely be monſtrous confuſion, if every one, in a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping aſſembly were to ſing an air different from all the reſt; &amp; as mankind are not taught by nature to ſing, all, any one air, it is therefore neceſſary, that they who ſing together, ſhould previouſly qualify themſelves for it by learning.

               </gap>ings being equal, to perform the duty. Inattention to this principle, has almoſt ruined our pſalmody; it has rendered that part of divine worſhip, which, in its own nature, is the moſt exalted and pleaſurable, in fact, the moſt dull and unedyfying. Many perſons, and ſome of them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, truly religious, either through miſtake and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or lazineſs and indolence, perſuade themſelves that if the heart be devout, it is no matter what the found of the voice is. But ſurely David was of a very different opinion when he exhorted thus, "ſing unto him a new ſong, play ſkilfully with a loud noiſe"<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſalm 33.3.</note>.— There is certainly as much propriety in making any ſort of founds with an inſtrument, when that is uſed in divine worſhip, as in making any ſort of ſounds with the voice, when we ſing his praiſe: and the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which plead for ſkilfullneſs in the one caſe, will alſo plead for it in the other. We have obſerved, that ſinging was deſigned to aid and promote, as well as to expreſs the feelings of the heart: conſequently, the more exquiſite the muſic is, the more powerful, to this purpoſe, will its influence be. To be convinced of this, you need only conſult your own frame, as it is the workmanſhip of God. The author of our being has conſtitued us ſo, that we naturally and indeed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily perceive and reliſh harmony in ſounds, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:046389_0018_102157628F8EA2B0"/>are offended with diſcords, juſt as we taſte ſweetneſs in honey, bitterneſs in gall—ſmell an agreeable odour from the roſe: an offenſive one, from a putrid carcaſe. If you give this conſideration its proper weight, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, it will perſuade you, that we ſhould cultivate church muſic to ſuch a degree, as to carry it on in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert,</hi> that is to ſay, in different parts and various ſounds ſo ſet together as to produce <hi>harmony.</hi> This is the perfection of muſic—and the capacity to perform it, and the taſte to reliſh it when performed, is peculiar to man. The creator hath given to ſome other animals a power to ſing; but none of them diſcover any capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for <hi>harmony:</hi> never has any choir of them been heard to perform any thing like it. In this, man ſtands as <hi>really</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the lower creation, as in the power of ſpeech, or any other faculty.—I aſk now, ſhall this pleaſing, this diſtinguiſhing capacity never be called forth to exerciſe? Is this part of the divine workmanſhip uſeleſs and vain? It not, where and when ſhall it be employed? Shall it be only in folly and vanity, or mere amuſement? Or rather, ſhould it not be conſecrated to the ſervice of that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whoſe workmanſhip it is? I will venture to leave it with every one candidly to decide.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, cultivate church muſic ourſelves, and promote the cultivation of it in our children. The earlier in life any one begins, the greater progreſs he will make; and hence, thoſe ſocieties are certainly to be commended, who make it a part of ſchool education, and have their children trained to ſing, at the ſame time they are taught to read; nor do I expect to ſee this art flouriſh as it ought, until this practice becomes general. In the mean time, the uſual mode of ſchools for grown perſons ſhould be kept up, under proper regulations, and capable teachers.</p>
            <p>Secondly. It is the duty of <hi>all</hi> to ſing the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:046389_0019_10215764E2CA6710"/>praiſes of God. This is evident, both from reaſon and ſcripture. The Supreme Majeſty of Heaven and Earth is infinitely worthy to be praiſed by every rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creature; and no perſon on earth can be in ſuch a ſituation, or ſtand in ſuch a relation to his Maker, as not to be under obligations to praiſe him. Even under the Jewiſh diſpenſation, although particular choice of ſinging men and ſinging women were appointed, yet David himſelf calls upon <hi>all,</hi> without exception, to praiſe, "Let the people praiſe thee, O God, let <hi>all</hi> the people praiſe thee."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſalm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> Under the goſpel diſpenſation, the duty is ſtill farther inculcated, in terms which equally apply to <hi>all,</hi> as in my text, and in the epiſtle to the Epheſians already quoted. It is therefore wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to neglect a duty ſo exalted; ſo pleaſing, and to which we are under ſo many endearing obligations.— And it is certainly ſhameful, for a profeſſor of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to be ſilent, when others are ſinging the praiſes of God around him; as if he had no more concern in this ſublime act of worſhip, than to amuſe himſelf.— Such conduct betrays a heart very inſenſible of the divine goodneſs, if not totally deſtitute of real piety. The ſpirit of true religion breathes thus, "It is good to give thanks unto the Lord, and to ſing praiſes unto thy name, O Moſt High."<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Pſalm 92, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </note> If we have taſted that the Lord is gracious, we will delight to ſing his praiſe, and think that we have ſuſtained a loſs, both as to profit and pleaſure, if at any time we have been abſent, when his part of divine worſhip has been performed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the family or church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. We ought to ſing in a <hi>continued air:</hi> and not interrupt the muſic by parcelling out the pſalm or hymn, or ſpiritual ſong, line by line. This is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo unnatural a mode, that I am perſuaded nothing but dire neceſſity could have ſuggeſted, or introduced

               </gap>t into the church. In the middle denturies of the chriſtian aera, learning was almoſt entirely baniſhed from Europe: ſcarcely a trace of it was to be found but in the monaſteries, and among the clergy. When after this learning began to revive, ſo rare a thing was it to find, <hi>among the common ranks of men,</hi> a perſon who could read, and ſo highly was it eſteemed, that, although one had been convicted of a capital crime, yet if he could read, he was acquitted—his council urged in his behalf, this plea, "legit ut clericus," <hi>he reads as a clergyman,</hi> and if, upon trial, it was ſound true, the court abſolved him from puniſhment. In this ſituation matters were when the reformation took place, and for a conſiderable time after; ſo that the officers of the church were obliged to have recourſe to this expedient, viz. to appoint a clerk, who could read, to parcel out the pſalm, line by line, to the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate congregation, in order that all might join in this important part of divine worſhip. But behold the force of cuſtom, and its prevalence even over reaſon and common ſenſe. We adhere to this mode ſtill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the neceſſity which introduced it, and which alone could juſtify it, is long ſince ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Many evils attend this mode of ſinging—It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes time unneceſſarily—prevents the pleaſure and advantage of ſinging a larger portion of a pſalm than that, to which, in this way, we are obliged to conſine curſelves—it, in a great meaſure, deſtroys the muſic, and conſequently, mars the effect it is deſigned to have on the heart, and unleſs we have the compoſition by memory, it leaves us often to ſing without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what, until the next line comes out to given us the ſenſe—It is ſurely high time for us to lay aſide this childiſh mode of praiſing God—Let each one, or at moſt, every two or three, bring a pſalm book to the worſhip of God, that ſo, having the ſubject before
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:046389_0021_1021576B5ADEAD68"/>our eyes, we may ſing without interruption, and drop that unnatural mixture of reading and ſinging which now mars and diſgraces our pſalmody.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. We, whoſe great advantage it is to live under the Goſpel diſpenſation, ought not to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> ourſelves to that ſyſtem of pſalmody which was framed for, and exactly ſuited to that diſpenſation of divine grace under which the Jews were placed, and which was, <hi>comparatively,</hi> obſcure and imperfect.</p>
            <p>This principle I ſhall eſtabliſh by the text itſelf—by neceſſary conſequence from other parts of ſcripture— and by the difference of the two diſpenſations from each other.</p>
            <p>The language of my text is very ſtrong to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Apoſtle enjoins it upon chriſtians, that they be richly furniſhed, or extenſively acquainted with the <hi>word of Chriſt</hi>—thoſe important diſcoveries which the Goſpel makes; and that this rich furniture of Goſpel knowledge ſhould not be, in them, a uſeleſs treaſure, as a ſpring ſhut up or fountain ſealed, but that it ſhould be communicated, and flow out for the inſtruction and edification of one another; and particularly, that it ſhould be thus employed in their ſongs of praiſe and other poetical compoſitions. Now, my brethern I with you to conſider, how it is poſſible to practice this injunction, while we <hi>confine</hi> ourſelves to the Jewiſh pſalmody. Were you to undertake to inſtruct any perſon in the way of ſalvation for periſhing ſinners, which God hath appointed: and would lead him to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>fe and godlineſs—to faith and the practice of a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian: would you take <hi>this</hi> ſyſtem of pſalmody for your rule; or would you uſe the New Teſtament for that purpoſe; and that whether the inſtruction was to be delivered in poetical, or proſe compoſition? Indeed, we not only grant, we maintain in the fulleſt manner
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:046389_0022_1021576DCB5467E8"/>that there are many propheſies of, and references to the Saviour, in the book of pſalms; but at the ſame time we muſt alſo maintain, that, inſtead of learning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Goſpel by theſe, it is by the light of the Goſpel we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, and learn how to apply them. Let us ſuppoſe a perſon, who knew not what religion we profeſſed, were to come into our worſhipping aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, week after week, yea, year after year, and hear our ſongs of praiſe:—would he, by them, learn the word of Chriſt? Would he, at leaſt, conclude, that that <hi>word</hi> dwelt in us richly? Or rather, would he not, from this part of our religious ſervice, form the ſame opinion of us, that he would of an aſſembly of worſhiping Jews? From our ſermons and our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, indeed, he might learn our profeſſion, and the <hi>word of Chriſt;</hi> but the Apoſtle enjoins, that we ſhould teach this particularly in our praiſes. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſk again, how can we teach one another the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſcoveries of the Goſpel, or evidence that it dwells in us richly, by our ſongs and praiſe, when yet theſe ſongs contain not theſe diſcoveries, but muſt themſelves, be underſtood by a previous knowledge of the word of Chriſt: and when yet the ſubject matter of our pſalms, and our mode of expreſſing it, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame as theirs, who reject the Goſpel alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? The principle may alſo be ſupported by <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence</hi> from other parts of ſcripture. To this purpoſe, let me lead your attention, particularly, to the fourteenth chapter of Paul's firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians. The profeſſed deſign of the apoſtle, in this chapter, is to regulate the Corinthian church in the exerciſe of their <hi>ſpiritual gifts.</hi> Among theſe he mentions the gift of <hi>dictating a pſalm</hi> to be ſung in public worſhip (compare verſes 15, and 26.) Now, if chriſtians ſhould ſing no compoſitions in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, but thoſe contained in the Book of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:046389_0023_10215771149E2320"/>pſalms uſed by the Jews, there could be no need, nay, there could be no room for a ſpiritual gift, <hi>i. e.</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary inſpiration, to enable them to propoſe a pſalm to be ſung in divine worſhip; for upon this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every compoſition they ſhould uſe, was written for them long before. But it is as evident as words can well declare, that there was in the firſt age of chriſtianity, ſuch a <hi>gift,</hi> and various chriſtians were divinely inſpired to utter a pſalm in the public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; from which it neceſſarily follows, that the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church was not <hi>confined</hi> to the Jewiſh ſyſtem of pſalmody in the apoſtles days; and if it was not <hi>then,</hi> I would wiſh to know by what authority it is confined to that ſyſtem <hi>now.</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">I have ſcarcely ever met with a more groſs and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable perverſion of the ſcripture, than that which repreſents the apoſtle, in the above cited chapter, as condemning and correcting the Corinthians for introducing new pſalms at all into divine worſhip. The paſſage particularly choſen to ſupport this miſerable interpretation, is the 26th verſe, where the apoſtle ſays, "How is it, brethren? When ye come together, every one of you hath a pſalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation." The judicious reader will immediately ſee, that if the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle meant to reprove the Corinthians for practiſing any the of theſe things, he reproves them for the whole; for they are all mentioned together in the ſame point of view: and where, then, will the cenſure ultimatels fall? It will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>cient to prove that the apoſtle is not cenſuring the uſe of theſe extraordinary gifts. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and ſubſequent parts of the chapter ſhew, that it was the abuſe of them—the diſorderly mode of exerciſing them, which prevailed in the Corinthian church, that he here ſets himſelf to correct—and the diſorder was plainly this— Whilſt one was delivering a pſalm to be ſung in the public aſſembly, with which he had been inſpired, another roſe up and delivered a doctrine which had, in the ſame manner, been dictated to him,—a third, perhaps, would ſpeak in an unknown tongue,—a fourth, relate a revelation with which he had been favoured, and ſo on. Hence, two or three, perhaps four or five perſons would be ſpeaking at the ſame inſtant of time, which not only produced conſuſion, but prevented all edification. Therefore the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, that they ſhould exerciſe theſe gifts, and deliver the things with which they were reſpectively cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon the whole, this paſſage of ſacred writ eſtabliſhes, beyond all contradiction, that, under the adminiſtration of the Apoſtles, and by the immediate inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, the Church of Chriſt was directed to uſe other pſalms than thoſe of David, in Divine worſhip. And it is more than probable that chriſtians continued in this practice for, at leaſt, three hundred years after the firſt plantation of Chriſtianity. Doctor Moſheim, one of the moſt accurate and credible eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians, aſſerts that it was not till in the fourth century, that the pſalms of David were introduced into chriſtian worſhip; and that even then they were only uſed among other hymns that had been in practice<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Moſh.

Once more, this principle may be eſtabliſhed by the conſideration of the <hi>difference</hi> of the two diſpenſations (the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian) from each other. This is a topic on which the Apoſtle Paul, eſpecially, dwells much. He expreſsly terms the Jewiſh diſpenſation, the miniſtration of death, and, of condemnation<note n="(a)" place="bottom">2. Cor. 3.7, 9.</note>— a ſtate of bondage, and ſervitude<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Gal. 4.3, 7, 9.</note>—ſays that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only the ſhadow of good things to come<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Heb. 10, 1.—</note>&amp; that the ritual of religious worſhip inſtituted under it, was <hi>weak and poor elements, a worldly ſanctuary, and carnal ordinances</hi>

But in the paſſages juſt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, he terms the goſpel diſpenſation, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the ſpirit—the miniſtration of life, and, of righteouſneſs—a ſtate of freedom and ſonſhip.

            <p>Now, it muſt be particularly obſerved that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſyſtem of pſalmody, was exactly ſuited to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation under which that people were placed; and that <hi>many</hi> of them have ſuch expreſs reference to the peculiarities of the Jewiſh worſhip—have thoſe <hi>ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> of it which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>worldly, weak, poor,</hi> &amp;c. ſo interwoven with their very ſubject matter, that they cannot, univerſally, ſuit the goſp diſpenſation which is ſo widely different from the Jewiſh, as we have heard; and under which theſe ordinances are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aboliſhed<note n="(b)" place="bottom">It is a ſtriking mark of unerring wiſdom which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all the works and ways of God, both in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and moral world, that he adjuſts one thing exactly to another, according to the time, place, relation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and other circumſtances of men and things, and the end he deſigns to accompliſh. This is evident in the pſalms of David when viewed as a ſyſtem for the Jewiſh diſpenſation:—for that, they were perfect and compleat: but, on this very account, they are not ſuitable, as a ſyſtem or liturgy, for New Teſtament worſhip,
<p>Some have been cenſured, as having uſed contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diminutive epethets when ſpeaking of the pſalms of David. If any have really done ſo, i. e. if they have uſed other phraſes than they are warranted in by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſcriptures, or with a view to pour contempt upon any part of the oracles of God, let them receive all that cenſure and reproach that can be heaped upon them. All ſuch conſures, I hope, I ſhall eſcape, as, in repreſenting the difference between the two diſpenſations, I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly uſued the language of the Holy Spirit in the ſcripture.</p>
               </note>. I beſeech chriſtians ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with what propriety they can <hi>now</hi> call upon one
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:046389_0028_1021577CF3800560"/>another to praiſe God with the harp, the pſaltery, the timbrel and dance, with ſtringed inſtruments, organs, and loud ſounding cymbals—and to blow up the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in the new moon; when at the ſame time, they mean not at all to do any ſuch thing?—Upon what principles can we <hi>now</hi> intreat God to do good to Zion which this declaration in our mouths, that then he ſhould be pleaſed with whole burnt offerings and bullocks which the church would offer upon his altar?—Under the Jewiſh diſpenſation, ſuch offerings were proper— they were Divine ordinances—and the pious worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers not only expreſſed them in words, but intended, &amp; actually performed them; but no chriſtian believes he ſhould preſent ſuch offerings, or if he did, that they would be pleaſing to God. Can we, conſiſtently with truth, ſay, in our ſongs of praiſe, that ſparrows and ſwallows build by the altar of God—and that they are bleſſed who travel through the dry valley of Baca, dig wells in it, and collect the rain in pools to ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with drink, whilſt they are coming from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant part of Judea, to celebrate the annual feſtivals at Jeruſalem? Whilſt the Jewiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>economy laſted, this could be ſung with truth; but now it cannot—theſe things exiſt no more<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſalms, 81.2, 3—98. 5, 6.—150.3, 4, 5.—51, 18, 19—66.13, 14, 15.—84.3, 4, 5.</note>. Many ſimilar inſtances might be produced; but theſe are ſufficient to illuſtrate the truth I am eſtabliſhing. If it ſhould be ſaid, that we ought not <hi>now</hi> to ſing theſe, and ſuch like pſalms in their literal meaning, but ſhould goſpelize them; and that many do actually thus paraphraſe and expound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſing them:—then I reply, that this, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, gives up the point, and eſtabliſhes the very <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> I am pleading for. It is a tacit acknowledgment that ſome of the pſalms at leaſt, in their plain &amp; lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:046389_0029_102144AA9EA88E78"/>ſenſe—the ſenſe in which, it is certain, they were uſed under the former diſpenſation, are not ſuited to goſpel times. And, methinks, the moſt zealous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders for the propriety of ſinging theſe pſalms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception ſhould conſider a moment, whether they themſelves ſing them in reality, when they drop any part of their original meaning, and ſubſtitute their own notions in its room. Certainly, <hi>mere words</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtitute prayer nor praiſe—They both mainly conſiſt in the ideas of the mind and ſentiments of the heart: and if theſe be different from the original mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the compoſition we uſe, it is not that compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſomething elſe which, in truth, we offer to God. But notwithſtanding that praiſe does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in <hi>mere words,</hi> yet when we have words enough to expreſs our meaning plainly and pertinently, it muſt be very abſurd, if not a kind of mockery, to approach the Moſt High with expreſſions in our mouths to which we have either no meaning at all, or one very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from their obvious ſenſe, and that which they were originally intended to convey.</p>
            <p>But beſide all this, and ſuppoſing there was not a ſingle reference to the ceremonies of the Law, in the pſalms of David, yet I preſume every one muſt grant they are far ſhort of the fullneſs and clearneſs of the Goſpel: and from this conſideration I plead, that chriſtians ſhould not <hi>confine</hi> themſelves to them. The difference between the diſcoveries made under the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, &amp; under the chriſtian diſpenſation, maybe fifty illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the imperfect knowledge we have of a perſon who has always appeared <hi>vailed</hi> to us, in compariſon of that which we have when all the teatures and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of his face are clearly reſlected to our eye from the brighteſt mirror.

            <p>It is <hi>neceſſary</hi> that prophecy ſhould we obſcure—if
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:046389_0030_10215782F0C087A0"/>it were not, the moral agency of man muſt be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to the accompliſhment of the predicted events. And it is the nature of an introductory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to be, <hi>comparatively,</hi> imperfect. This, in truth, is the fact, in the caſe before us; for, as I have already proved, there are many objects of knowledge, and ſubjects of praiſe diſcovered in the goſpel, which are not to be found in any part of the Old Teſtament. So that, if we <hi>confine</hi> ourſelves to the pſalms of David, we ſhall exclude from our ſongs of praiſe, the diſtiaguiſhing glories of the goſpel, and ſtill hold the <hi>vail</hi> upon the lovely face of the redeemer—we ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateſully reject the light, and reſolutely continue in the obſcurity of the former diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>And now, probably, you will be ready to enquire, what ſhall chriſtians ſing; and what ſhall be the rule of their direction in this important part of religious worſhip? To this I anſwer, juſt as your ſhorter cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm anſwers the queſtion, <hi>What rule hath God given for our direction in prayer?</hi> In like manner, the whole word of God is of uſe to direct us in praiſe; but the ſpecial rule of direction is the Goſpel—the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. Or, more particularly, thus, Although we ought not to <hi>confine</hi> ourſelves to the pſalms of David, as I hope I have proved to your ſatisfaction, yet there are <hi>many of them,</hi> and other parts alſo of the Old Teſtament, which ſo excellertly expreſs the exerciſes of a pions and devout heart, and ſo ſublimely extol the Moſt High, without any reference to the peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of that diſpenſation which is now aboliſhed, that they contain <hi>matter</hi> peoper to be ſung to the end of the world. To theſe ſhould be added thoſe glorious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of praiſe which the <hi>Goſpel alone</hi> reveals. And there are chriſtians qualified to form all theſe into plain and agreeable verſe. It is then the buſineſs of the, Church, that is to ſay, the Supreme judicatory thereof
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:046389_0031_102157848B54D930"/>to examine and judge of theſe compoſitions; and, having ſelected ſuch of them as they ſhall deem proper and ſufficient, <hi>appoint</hi> them to be uſed in public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This ſame collection may alſo ſerve, generally, for family, and even the moſt ſecret praiſe. I ſay, <hi>generally;</hi> for I openly declare, that in private, a chriſtian is not bound to <hi>confine</hi> himſelf to any collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch compoſitions; but that, if he has a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to compoſe a pſalm, hymn, or ſpiritual ſong, he has a right ſo to do, and to ſing it in praiſe, juſt as he has a right to uſe his own words in prayer. And when any perſon ſhall diſprove the one, I will alſo, from the ſame principles diſprove the other. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
            <p>Fifth. To remove any difficulties or objections which may ſeem to lie againſt the preceeding view of the ſubject. To ſome, this branch of the ſubject may, very poſſibly, ſeem quite unneceſſary: and, indeed, from the manner in which I have treated it, I preſume, an anſwer may be found, either directly, or by eaſy conſequence, to any objection that can be raiſed againſt it. Nevertheleſs, leaſt any one ſhould be perplexed with difficulties ſpeciouſly propoſed, I ſhall ſtate thoſe which I have not ſo directly obviated.</p>
            <p>Firſt. It is ſaid, that if we do not ſing all the pſalms of David, or introduce any others into the worſhip of God, we ſhall weaken the authority of that ſacred book, and aid the cauſe of deiſm.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo then, my brethren, that we weaken the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of all that ſcripture which we do not practice as it was once done? Then, indeed, we muſt obſerve all the laws and ordinances reſpecting the diſtinction between clean and unclean beaſts—waſhings—ſacriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces —circumciſion—the paſſover—and in one word, <hi>all the ceremonial and judicial law of the Jews,</hi> which conſtitutes a conſiderable part of ſacred ſcripture.—
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:046389_0032_10215787F5D91860"/>Theſe were all divine inſtitutions—binding upon, and actually practiſed by the church of old. And yet, after all, I preſume, the objectors themſelves would deem it an abomination to practice ſome, at leaſt, of theſe things now. With what face then can it be ſaid, that we weaken the authority of the pſalms of David, <hi>merely</hi> becauſe we do not uſe them as a ſyſtem of pſalmody in goſpel times, as they were appointed to the Jews? Let it he obſerved alſo, that there are many ſongs recorded in the Old Teſtament, and ſung by the church then, which are not to be found in the book of pſalme; ſuch as the ſong of Moſes on paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the red ſea<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Exod. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5.</note>, and more that might be mentioned. Is the authority of theſe weakened becauſe neither Jews nor chriſtians ſing them now? I preſume, not, This is the very objection in effect, which was bro't by the Jews and judaizing teachers againſt the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Chriſt, when they taught that the Jewiſh ritual of worſhip and all their ceremonial ordinances were aboliſhed. But, I think, there is no chriſtian now, who believes they were guilty of the charge. And if they were not, I beſeech you to conſider ſeriouſly, how it can lie againſt any, <hi>merely</hi> for ſinging thoſe pſalms which have ſo direct and immediate a reference to thoſe ordinances—have ſo much of that aboliſhed ritual interwover with the very ſubject matter of them, that if the one ceaſes to exiſt, the other neceſſarily ceaſes with it, i. e. as to its fitneſs and obligation to be practiſed in goſpel times. Nay, my brethren, we
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:046389_0033_1021578A5ABEAE00"/>revere the ſacred ſcripture in all its parts—the Old as well as the New Teſtament; and regard it as the oracles of the only living and true God. But we deſire to regard and uſe it according to its true end and deſign; not confounding and mixing together thoſe things which God has ſeparated—not blending Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm with chriſtianity; but by giving every thing its proper place, both as to faith and practice, according as it reſpects the diſpenſations that have ceaſed, or as it regards that <hi>laſt and beſt,</hi> under which we live, and which alone declares the worſhip and ordinances which the King and head of the Church hath appointed for his followers, now<note n="(a)" place="bottom">The above objection, in ſubſtance, has been advanced in another form, thus, "Whatever is ſit to be read, is fit to be ſung; if therefore we may not ſing all the pſalms of David, neither muſt we read them, and thus we ſhall reject them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely." Nothing can be more weak and abſurd than this cavil. Reading and ſinging are quite dictinct ordinances in their nature, and often in their object and end. Singing in praiſe of God, is, in its nature a direct and immediate act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip and adoration; reading is not ſo.—In ſinging praiſes, God is the immediate object, and the primary end, is to celebrate his ſupreme glory and perfection, in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and in his works and ways; in reading, the primary end is inſtruction and edification. Singing is a natural, and an appointed mean of expreſſing our ſpiritual joy; read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not ſo; and hence, when one is in this frame, the Apoſtle does not enjoin it upon him to read, but to ſing pſalms (Jam. 5.13). From this, it is eaſy to ſee, that many things may be ſit matter for reading, which would be very improper to be ſung in praiſe to God. I ſhall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this by an example—It is undoubtedly proper to read every part of ſcripture; but ſuppoſe a perſon were to take the firſt chapter of the firſt book of Chronicles, for inſtance, and ſing, as an act of religious worſhip and praiſe to God, the genealogical line of deſcent from Adam to Noah, from thence to Abraham,—then trace the line through Iſhmael a little,—then turn to Eſau, trace the line through him a while, and conclude with a liſt of the Kings and Dukes of Edom. Or, ſuppoſe he were to take the ſecond chapter of the book of Ezra, and ſing in like manner, the numbers of theſe who returned with Zerubbabel from the Babyloniſh captivity—together with the names of the towns and diſtricts to which they reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively belonged, and the number of the horſes, camels, aſſes, and knives<note n="(a)" place="bottom">This particular is in chapter 1, 9.</note> which they brought with them to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem—What would you think of the exerciſe? Or what opinion would you conceive of the performer? You would ſurely conclude, that he was diveſted of reaſon, or that he intended to turn the duty of ſinging the praiſes of God, into ridicule.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Second. It is objected, that the plan I have pled for, is ſubſtituting human compoſures in the room of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:046389_0034_1021578D83B6D9F8"/>Divine inſpiration, and will be attended with many dangerous conſequences.</p>
            <p>This objection ariſes from an entire miſtake of the point. There is an eſſential difference between the <hi>matter</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> of every ſubject. Hence, the ſubject matter of a pſalm may be divine, i. e. by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration: and the form of it, merely human:— and this is actually the caſe in that ſyſtem and verſion of pſalms, which the objectors themſelves contend for. By the <hi>form</hi> of a pſalm, I mean the phraſes choſen to expreſs the ſenſe—the manner and order of arranging the words and ſentences—and the meaſure of the verſe. Now, ſuppoſing that God had dictated to David, Aſaph, and others, <hi>all this,</hi> as well as the ideas or ſubject matter of the pſalms, yet this would only be the caſe in the original language in which the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was made: ſo ſoon as ever they were tranſlated, the <hi>form</hi> was changed, and became human. This is
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:046389_0035_1021578FE4D2C200"/>ſtill further evident in the poetical verſion which we have hitherto uſed; many of the words and phraſes are even different from thoſe uſed in the proſe tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the form is merely human; unleſs we ſuppoſe Rouſe was divinely inſpired when he verſified the pſalms, and that the Holy Spirit dictated to him the very phraſes and meaſure of his verſe; which, I am ſure, no man of ſober ſenſe ever believed. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, therefore, to a demonſtration, that the form of David's pſalms, as they ſtand in our verſion, is human, although the ſubject matter of them is divine. Now, this is preciſely the caſe in the pſalms, hymns, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſongs formed from ſuitable parts of ſcripture in general, and particularly from the New Teſtament, as I have mentioned before: the form—the compoſition, will be human; but the ſubject matter, divine. For ſurely every chriſtian believes, that the goſpel is from heaven—that it is given by divine inſpiration, in as high a ſenſe as the book of pſalms, or any other part of ſcripture. And it is certain, that the ſubject matter of it is much more clearly and fully diſcovered, than the matter of David's pſalms; for many of them were prophetic, which is always obſcure; and many of them typical, which it is often difficult to unfold.</p>
            <p>As for dangerous conſequences there are none at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this mode, more than any other, in which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect creatures are concerned. Certainly the ſenſe, the mind of the Holy Spirit in the New Teſtament, can be as faithfully preſerved and expreſſed in a poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, as in a proſe tranſlation or diſcourſe. And I leave it with every one candidly to judge, whether there is not much more danger of mingling our own fancies, and miſtaken notions with the matter of our praiſe, when we expound the pſalms of David for ourſelves, or depend upon the expoſition of every preacher;— than when we have the ſubject in ſo plain a dreſs as not
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:046389_0036_102157942FBD6F80"/>to need an expoſition— when we have it conſtantly in poſſeſſion, ſo that we can leiſurely compare it with the unerring ſtandard—and when too, it has received the approbation of the ſupreme judicatory of the church.</p>
            <p>Third. It is ſaid, that Chriſt and his diſciples uſed the pſalmody of the Jewiſh church—And that if he had deemed it unfit for the goſpel diſpenſation, he would have given his church a new ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of this objection has no force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt and his diſciples during his abode on earth, were under the Jewiſh diſpenſation, to which that pſalmody was ſuited. Hence they obſerved the ceremonial law, but this does not oblige us to obſerve it. The point here is not, what was proper under the law, but what is ſo under the goſpel. Beſide, it can never be proved that the Saviour confined himſelf to that ſyſtem: and as I have already obſerved, it is more than probable he compoſed an hymn at the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of his own ſupper.</p>
            <p>The other part of the objection, viz. that if he had deemed the Jewiſh pſalmody unfit for the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an diſpenſation, he would have given his church a new ſyſtem, I totally deny; and for this plain reaſon, becauſe it was not <hi>neceſſary.</hi> And that it was not neceſſary, I hope the following conſiderations will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you.</p>
            <p>The gracious Saviour has provided and left in his word, and by the <hi>ordinary influences</hi> of his Holy Spirit, ſufficient furniture of light, gifts, and graces, for all the parts of religious worſhip, without leaving a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem or liturgy, in the preciſe words of which, we ſhould either pray, or praiſe, or preach. Indeed, in the firſt age of the chriſtian church, when as yet the full revelation of all things which pertain to life and godlineſs was not made, nor the canon of New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſcripture collected together; extraordinary aid
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:046389_0037_10215795C2155340"/>was neceſſary, and was accordingly afforded in every part of divine worſhip, whether praying, praiſing, or preaching. This is evident from many parts of the New Teſtament, particularly from the 12th and 14th chapters of Paul's firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready referred to. But when the canon of ſcripture was compleated, with a fullneſs and clearneſs ſo great, that he who runs may read and underſtand, this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary aid ceaſed; and even thoſe inſpired prayers, hymns, and ſermons, are not recorded, And can we need a more ſatisfactory proof, that liturgies compoſed for theſe purpoſes, are not neceſſary <hi>now?</hi> Let not chriſtians depreciate their privileges, nor think meanly of their advantages: If you do, you will neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them wiſely, nor feel that gratitude to your God and Saviour for them, to which you are under ſo many endearing obligations. I repeat it, therefore, the church now, and individuals, have furniture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, <hi>in the ordinary way,</hi> for all the worſhip they are called reſpectively to perform—a furniture rich, abundant, and overflowing. The Goſpel reveals the ſubject matter in the fulleſt and cleareſt manner— the Holy Spirit, as a ſpirit of hight, of ſanctification, and of comfort, is more abundantly communicated, than under former diſpenſations—inſomuch, that the weakeſt <hi>true</hi> chriſtian now, has a more compleat knowledge of Gods merciful purpoſe and device for the ſalvation of fallen man—the method of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſhing it—and the acceptable way of a ſinners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Moſt High, than the greateſt Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prophet. Probably, by ſome, this will be thought <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> yet it is not bolder than I am warranted to uſe, both by the Old &amp; New Teſtament. To prove this, obſerve the ſtrong language of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah, "Moreover the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the ſun, and the light of the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:046389_0038_102144D1D6CBC120"/>ſun ſhall be ſeven-fold, as the light of ſeven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and healeth the ſtroke of the wound."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Iſai. 30, 26.</note> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evident, from the whole preceding context, than that this refers to goſpel times, and is a prophetic deſcription of the happy circumſtances of the Jews when they ſhould embrace the goſpel; and as <hi>light,</hi> when the term is uſed figuratively, almoſt univerſally means <hi>knowledge</hi> and underſtanding, the obvious ſenſe of the paſſage is, that when they ſhould be converted to chriſtianity, their knowledge would as far exceed what they, under the law, poſſeſſed, as the light of the ſun exceeds the light of the moon, or as the light of ſeven days or ſeven ſuns collected, exceeds the light of a ſingle one <hi>(b).</hi> Still more ſtrong is the language of Zechariah, "In that day ſhall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and he that is<note n="(a)" place="margin">This paſſage has been interpreted as if by the moon, was meant the type, and by the ſun the anti-type—that both are to be kept in immediate view under the goſpel—and that both will thus be better underſtood.—For, ſay theſe expoſitors, on this plan we ſhall have the type and the anti-type mutually ſhining upon and illuſtrating each other, like the ſun and the moon. And all this is ſaid to prove, that we ſhould uſe the typical language and ceremonial references of the book of pſalms, in chriſtian worſhip. This is, truly, as ſtrange an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation as one could well imagine. Sure I am, the holy ſpirit never uſed ſuch an unnatural figure, as upon the above hypotheſis, this would be. For, let me aſk, did any perſon ever ſee it, or is it a truth, that the moon ſhines upon the ſun, and adds to his light and ſplendor? No ſurely. On the contrary, her faint rays are all borrowed from him—when he appears in our horizon, ſhe is immediately eclipſed, diſappears in the blaze of his refulgent orb, and becomes uſeleſs to us in point of communicating light—It is only in his abſence that ſhe is, or can be beneficial in this reſpect. It is juſt ſo in the other caſe. When the glorious SUN of righteouſneſs hath ariſen, and is ſhining upon as with meridian brightneſs, types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ſhould ſlee away—they may injure, but profit us they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not— and like the moon, which, by being interpoſed, hides ſomething of the ſun's light, even ſo theſe, ſo far as they are made the immediate objects of our contemplation, will obſcure our views of the redeemer.</note>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:046389_0039_102144D436A8B0E8"/>feeble among them at that day, ſhall be as David; and the houſe of David ſhall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Zech. 12, 8.</note> It will not be diſputed, I preſume, that this refers to ſpiritual and religious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages under the goſpel; advantages ſo far ſuperior to what were enjoyed under the law, that the feeble, the weakeſt chriſtian among the Jews when converted to the faith, will be as David, in point of religious attainments—and the houſe of David, the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced chriſtians among them, as the angel of God in compariſon of David. The language of the New Teſtament is ſtill more expreſs to this purpoſe. Our Lord ſpoke to his diſciples thus, "For I tell you, that many prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them, and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them."<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Luke 10, 24.</note> If this was the caſe with regard to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, long before the full diſplay of goſpel light, and when, as yet, they were but babes in chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; how much more muſt it be ſo with thoſe who enjoy the noon day light of the Goſpel. In another place our Lord thus declares, "for I ſay unto you, among thoſe that are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptiſt: but he that is leaſt in the kingdom of God is greater than he."<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Luke 7, 28.</note>—
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:046389_0040_102144D6E3ECB378"/>The kingdom of God, or, the kingdom of Heaven, as Matthew, in a parallel paſſage, record it,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Matt, 11, 11, 12.</note> is but another expreſſion for the goſpel diſpenſation, which is evident, both becauſe our Lord almoſt always uſes it in this ſenſe, and becauſe the following verſe in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews's goſpel confines it thereto. John the Baptiſt neither wrought miracles, nor predicted future events to any ſuch degree as many prophets that had ariſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; conſequently, the only point in which he was ſuperior to them all, was his ſuperior knowledge of goſpel myſteries, and if the leaſt in the kingdom of God, the weakeſt true chriſtian under the full light of the goſpel, be greater than John, it muſt be in the ſame ſenſe, that is to ſay, he is acquainted with many things in the plan of ſalvation which were not revealed to John himſelf; and therefore, ſuch a chriſtian knows much more of theſe glorious things than the greateſt Old Teſtament prophet. Theſe ſcriptures will, I hope, ſatisfy you that I have not aſſerted too much. And if ſuch be the furniture of the chriſtian church, and of its weakeſt members—ſuch their tranſcendent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages beyond what was enjoyed under any former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation—can it be true that they have not ſufficient means for praiſing God, without having a liturgy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for them in an extraordinary way; or without having recourſe to that ſyſtem of pſalmody, which, in compariſon of the diſcoveries and light of the goſpel, is but as the duſky twilight to the perfect day? Judge ye.</p>
            <p>Fourth. It is objected by ſome, that it is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to attain ſufficient ſkill in muſic, to ſing in the manner I have pled for, that the bulk of each congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation will be prevented from joining in the public praiſe of God—that part of worſhip, muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a ſelect choir—and, we will become ſo fond
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:046389_0041_102144D89B399EA8"/>of the muſic as to neglect the exerciſe of grace in the heart.</p>
            <p>My brethern, if any one of theſe things <hi>neceſſarily</hi> attended the mode I have recommended, I would give it up at once. But ſure I am, this is not the caſe.— I well know that mankind are prone to extremes, as well on the one ſide, as on the other. This is actually the caſe with us now, and we have ſunk to one extreme in our mode of performing this duty: for I can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive in what more miſerable manner we could perform it, ſuppoſing us to ſing at all. And muſt we not attempt a reformation and ſeek to do right, for fear of running into the oppoſite extreme? It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fallacious to reaſon againſt the <hi>uſe</hi> of any thing, from the <hi>abuſe</hi> of it. That ſome may pay more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the muſic than to the frame of their heart, I readily grant, but ſurely the muſic is not the cauſe of this; on the contrary, as I have ſhewn, it is deſigned and calculated to aid and promote theſe gracious frames. We may alſo err by introducing ſuch a variety of tunes into public worſhip, &amp; in ſuch quick ſucceſſion, that the greateſt part of the congregation cannot be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them. But it is eaſy to guard againſt this evil —there is no neceſſity for changing our airs every month, nor every year—Yea, and ſuppoſing us never to change them, yet this ſhould not prevent us from ſinging, with <hi>propriety,</hi> thoſe we do uſe. And I muſt farther maintain, that to learn to ſing thus with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, neither requires uncommon talents, nor extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary pains—It is as eaſy, as the mode we uſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we adopt the proper method of learning, and the teacher underſtands his buſineſs; and in this, I ſpeak from certain knowledge. To ſing, as I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed various parts muſt, indeed, be performed together: but it is not neceſſary that thoſe who ſing one part, ſhould be able to ſing the others—to that one, if they
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:046389_0042_102144DBF39CD078"/>pleaſe, they may confine themſelves to every tune—and it is as eaſy to learn one part as another. To ſome, indeed, this mode will be much eaſier than the preſent, when all are confined to one part: for as there is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the parts ſuited to different voices, as they are fine or courſe, high or low, there is an opportunity of a choice according to the natural tone of the voice; in conſequence of which, the performing of it will be more eaſy and pleaſurable. And now, where is the extraordinary difficulty in all this? There is none.— Moreover experience and facts prove the practicability of it. I do not recollect that I ever heard a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or even private family of Germans ſinging the praiſes of God, but they ſung in concert, and made harmony—Are we ſo dull and ſtupid that we cannot learn to do the ſame? I am ſure, we are not. But the truth is the prejudice of education, or the want of proper diſpoſition to the duty lies at the bottom of the objection. Had we that delight in ſinging the praiſes of God, and that deſire to qualify ourſelves in the beſt manner for the performance of the duty, that many of us have in learning, empty, ſilly ſongs, or other as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable things, we would not make mountains of molehills; we would cheerfully devote ſome of that time to the acquiſition of the ſkill, which many trifle away in ſuch purſuits as will fill them with unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anguiſh when they are called to render their final account.</p>
            <p>And now, to conclude—Let every one receive, with reverence, the word of exhortation, and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly apply himſelf to carry the apoſtle's direction into practice. If you believe the goſpel to be divine, you will certainly own, that the treaſures of it are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ſuperior to all the treaſures of earth—that they will enrich and make you happy, when the other will vaniſh like an empty pageant, or amuſing dream whem
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:046389_0043_102157998736B5D0"/>one awaketh. Let us all exerciſe ourſelves daily in learning more and more of the <hi>word of Chriſt,</hi> which is able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, and to furniſh us abundantly, through the influences of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for every word and work. Particularly, let us uſe it for our direction and edification, in ſinging the praiſes of our God and Saviour, as furniſhing us with <hi>matter</hi> for the moſt exalted ſtrains the church, on earth, can raiſe. Let us be much employed in this delightful exerciſe—let the voice of praiſe be heard in our habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as well as in the church—and let us not grudge to ſpend a little time and pains to qualify ourſelves for ſinging ſkilfully, with an harmonious noiſe.</p>
            <p>Let us be ready to fall in with, and promote every attempt to improve our pſalmody, in agreeableneſs to the <hi>word of Chriſt.</hi> If the principles I have laid down be true, certainly our pſalmody needs improvement. In this ſentiment I am not ſingular. Many pious, and enlightened chriſtians have long wiſhed for pſalms, hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, more in the ſtyle, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and light of the goſpel, than the pſalms framed for the Jewiſh diſpenſation. At length Dr. Watts aroſe, and gave the world an imitation of David's pſalms, in the language of the New Teſtament; as alſo a number of hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, formed on other parts of ſcripture, eſpecially the goſpel. His performance was highly eſteemed by many; and as much condemned by others; not, ſo far as I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe there was any thing heterodox in it, but becauſe the author had advanced, and attempted to bring into practice, the principles I have endeavored to eſtabliſh. His compoſitions, however, were ſoon uſed, in religious worſhip, public and private, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chriſtians as well of our own, as of other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; altho' the ſupreme judicatory of our church had not, as yet, given an expreſs ſanction to them. At
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:046389_0044_1021579C20A1CE38"/>length our Synod took up the matter judicially, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee to examine the different verſions of the book of pſalms, to which they could have acceſs, and from them to ſelect ſuch a collection as they ſhould judge beſt; and to lay it before Synod at a future meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for their conſideration. In purſuance of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, the committee proceeded on the buſineſs, and after a conſiderable time, reported to this purpoſe, that having compared ſuch verſions as they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they did not apprehend any ſo well calculated for chriſtian worſhip, as that of Dr. Watts, as amended by Mr. Barlow, of New-England. The verſion, thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, was then laid before Synod for their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, after mature deliberation, gave it their judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſanction, as you may ſee in a printed extract from their minutes, bound up with the ſaid verſion. The committee had alſo added a book of hymns to this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but it was laid aſide, not becauſe Synod diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the thing in itſelf, but becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome parts of the collection appeared to them exceptionable. Very probably a collection of this kind will yet be added— and indeed, my brethren, ſo many are the peculiar and intereſting diſcoveries of the goſpel—ſo many the paſſages which contain the moſt fit and excellent <hi>matter</hi> for chriſtian praiſe, that until we have hymns and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſongs formed upon them, I am clearly perſuaded, and I truſt, by this time, ſo are you, our pſalmody will be <hi>incompleat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, as we have the opportunity now, of advancing a conſiderable ſtep in the improvement of our pſalmody, let us chearfully and thankfully embrace it, and walk in the light and liberty wherewith our divine Lord hath made us free, to the honour of his precious name, and our own greater edification. Let us endeavor to diveſt ourſelves of prejudice and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion—and give the verſion a fair and candid exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:046389_0045_1021579EA49D0C00"/>This is ſurely the leaſt that, in reaſon and conſcience, you can do, whether you view the matter with regard to Synod, or to yourſelves; for altho' Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod has not pretended to force this verſion on any congregation or individual, yet, methinks, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is due to the judgment of that <hi>body</hi> to which we profeſs ſubjection in the Lord. And then, remember that you are deeply and perſonally intereſted in this matter, as accountable to God. For if, after you have been favored with the cleareſt diſcoveries of the way of a ſinner's approach to God, and acceptance with him, you are found not walking according to the <hi>goſpel,</hi> and eſpecially, if after being warned and admoniſhed, you obſtinately reject, or careleſsly neglect the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of improving, you will not be able to anſwer for it to your final Judge.</p>
            <p>In examining the verſion now recommended, I hope you will keep in view the things you have now heard. But, above all, ſeek by earneſt prayer, the direction of the Holy Spirit, whoſe office it is to take of the things of Chriſt, and ſhew them unto us—that he would lead you in the path of duty—and teach you, and the whole church on earth, the truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
            <p>And now unto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood; and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his Father; unto him be glory and dominion forever and ever, Amen. Yea, unto God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, be undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided honours and eternal praiſes. <hi>Amen.</hi>
