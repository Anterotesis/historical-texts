            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Introduction.</head>
            <p>ONE principal deſign of the preſent edition of this little book is, to preſerve a Complete Hiſtory of a BATTLE or FIGHT, which, though in <hi>itſelf</hi> but trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet, in its <hi>iſſue</hi> or <hi>conſequences,</hi> has been juſtly deemed of great importance; it is an intereſting incident in the hiſtory of New-england. To attempt a march of upwards of an hundred miles, through a wilderneſs, into a foreſt, where not a friendly but or civilized inhabitant were to be met with, where Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and wolves were "lords of the ſoil!" where "dangers preſt on every ſide!" this was a forlorn and deſperate adventure, big with danger, reſerved for the daring genius of an intrepid <hi>LOVELL.</hi> Who, though he fell in the conteſt, by this enterprize, opened a road into a wide extended country, rich in ſoil, in climate healthy; and pointed the way to the ſettlement and civilization of this (at that time deſolate and uncultivated, but now) pleaſant and populous country.</p>
            <p>This enterpriſing adventure of Lovell was begun in April, and his Fight with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was on the <hi>8</hi>th of May, <hi>1725.</hi> By the beſt information which could be obtained from
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:036392_0003_1009E1FFE3A16A08"/>
Indians who were in the Fight, there were about Eighty of the Savages oppoſed to the brave Lovell with only thirty two men! who killed forty five of the Indians, with their Chief Captain, <hi>Paugus,</hi> and put the reſt to flight. Never was a battle ſuſtained with more fortitude and courage, than was this on the part of Captain Lovell and his men; they were engaged the whole day with nearly three times their own number of Savages, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a victory over them!</p>
            <p>There was not, at the time of this battle, a <hi>white</hi> inhabitant within fifty miles of the ſcene of action! Saco was the neareſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of white people! and the whole of this now civilized country, was then a wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended waſte, clothed with Nature's rudeſt wild attire!</p>
            <p>In the ſummer of <hi>1763,</hi> Mr. Nathaniel Smith moved his family into Fryeburg; this was the firſt family of white people which erected a habitation in the country, vulgarly called <hi>Pigwacket.</hi> On the <hi>20</hi>th Nov. of the ſame year, Meſſrs. Samuel Oſgood, Moſes Ames, John Evans, and Jedediah Spring, moved into Fryeburg, from Concord in New-hampſhire, through a rough, hilly country, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:036392_0004_1009E2035CF7F460"/>
for <hi>50</hi> or <hi>70</hi> miles; Mr. David Evans and Mr. Nathaniel Merrill, (then young men) accompanied them, as firſt ſettlers. Theſe were they, who encountered the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, the fatigues, the ſufferings, the loſſes, of the firſt ſettlement of this new country— Theſe were they, who lived, like "<hi>a band of brothers,</hi>" in friendſhip, who formed the <hi>firſt happy ſociety,</hi> on this (till then) <hi>deſolate</hi> plain—who eſtabliſhed themſelves in the boſom of an extenſive wilderneſs, and conſtituted the <hi>Firſt Civil Family</hi> of a howling foreſt. They laid the foundation for a large ſettlement, which all of them have had the pleaſure to behold increaſing to a populous and wealthy land. To them, and to thoſe worthy Matrons who, with heroic courage and fortitude of ſoul, ſet hardſhip and danger at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and rear'd with tender care a race of hardy ſons—to their ſpirit of enterprize, we are indebted for the enjoyment of this flouriſhing country— May their days roll on in peace, may they ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy eaſe, and plenty; and when in a good old age, they ſhall be called to the land of their fathers, may they depart with the good will and honors of all who participate in the Fruits of their Firſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The neareſt White Neighbors which theſe firſt ſettlers had for a long time, were at Saco; and with thoſe even they had no communication—
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:036392_0005_1009E205A7B09178"/>
their neareſt place of reſort to obtain thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of neceſſity which they could not forego, was Sanford; nearly ſixty miles diſtant!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>With what pleaſure can they look back to the infancy of the country which they firſt planted! and what a ſatisfaction muſt they enjoy, when they contraſt their preſent ſcences of eaſe and plenty with thoſe when the</hi> fatigues of hunting <hi>gave but the ſcanty meal! The recollection of thoſe days, muſt give a zeſt to the enjoyments of the preſent, which none can realize but thoſe who have ſeen villages grow up, the Arts and Sciences flouriſh, where themſelves were the fellers of the foreſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>1764,</hi> a few more families moved into Frye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and in <hi>1765</hi> the population began to increaſe with conſiderable rapidity.</p>
            <p>In October <hi>1774,</hi> the people of Fryeburg invited the Rev. <hi>WILLIAM FESSENDEN</hi> to ſettle with them; and in October <hi>1775,</hi> he was ordained to the work of the Miniſtry—He has continued in a happy Union with his people—and has ſeen the number of families in Fryeburg increaſe from ſixty to <hi>one hundred and eight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In March <hi>1791,</hi> twenty five of the inhabitants of the towns of Fryeburg Conway and Brownfield, aſſembled for the grand purpoſe of eſtabliſhing a Grammar School—they agreed upon a mode; opened a ſubſcription for the purpoſe, which was <hi>filled</hi> the very day it was <hi>opened—[Heaven ſmil'd upon their plan]</hi>—a building was erected and completed,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:036392_0006_1009E20972A339F0"/>
an Inſtructor was engaged, and on the <hi>15</hi>th day of November, <hi>1791,</hi> a School commenced with <hi>Fifty</hi> ſcholars. In February <hi>1792,</hi> it was incorporated with academic privileges, by the Government of this Commonwealth, with the liberal donation of <hi>twelve thouſand</hi> acres of land, to which <hi>three thouſand</hi> acres more were added in <hi>1793.</hi>—The funds of this Inſtitution (which are increaſing) are ſufficient for the ſupport of a Preceptor, &amp;c. and will continue ſo as long as value ſhall be attached to Land.</p>
            <p>This country, whoſe inhabitants are now nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, robuſt and hardy, was, before Lovell's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, nothing but a dreary, waſte a howling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, the <hi>Land of Indians</hi>—But now, on the very plain where the fam'd <hi>Paugus,</hi> the Chief of thoſe ſavage tribes, held his dreary reign, and danc'd in midnight <hi>pow-wows,</hi> there is erected an Acad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, (a <hi>Seat for the Muſes,</hi>) where the <hi>Sons of Apollo</hi> may quaff the Pierian Stream—In this Academy, the Polite and Uſeful branches of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are taught—Youth, and others, are inſtructed in Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography, Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Aſtronomy, and the Languages, with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed facility and propriety, by an able Maſter, whoſe <hi>works</hi> are his beſt eulogium: he ſhares the love and eſteem of his pupils, and he has ever had the approbation of the authority of Colleges where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them have been admitted as acknowledged good ſcholars.</p>
            <p>This academy affords an eaſy mean to all claſſes of people to give their children a good education;
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:036392_0007_1009E20B08639540"/>
the whole expenſe for tuition is only <hi>1½</hi> dollar per quarter; and boarding, &amp;c. for thoſe who want, may be obtained on eaſy terms.</p>
            <p>There has been alſo a Printing Office lately eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed in Fryeburg, and this Hiſtory of Lovell's Fight is from a Preſs within two miles of the place where he fell—But, from the <hi>ſmall</hi> Funds of the Proprietor, this eſtabliſhment is not in ſo <hi>flouriſhing</hi> progreſs as could be wiſhed—it is, however, hoped that it may not fail—The expenſe of eſtabliſhing and <hi>carrying on</hi> this Buſineſs is great—and a <hi>general</hi> patronage alone will be ſufficient to ſupport it— <hi>A Preſs in Pigwacket,</hi> is deemed a <hi>novel</hi> adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by thoſe elder towns whoſe towering ſpires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it a <hi>remote wilderneſs</hi> but thirty years ago! Yet, they may reſt aſſured that, if <hi>every Head of a Family in Pigwacket</hi> will ſay, This Preſs ſhall have my ſupport, I will take the Newſpaper, and now and then buy my children a "Friendly Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor," a "Lovell's Fight," or ſome other little book; if every Man in Pigwacket only, would <hi>do thus,</hi> (and every one might, all are able, the expenſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually</hi> is a mere trifle) the Preſs in Pigwacket ſhould not <hi>ſtop</hi> until the owner became <hi>blind,</hi> or [worſe] turn'd <hi>Jacobin!</hi> But, as "<hi>without the Rain from Heaven, the Corn ſhall WITHER on its Stalk</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſo alſo <hi>without the OIL of Public Aid, Printing Preſſes will</hi> Creek <hi>with RUST.</hi>— That this may never be; but, that the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> may continue to "<hi>bud and bloſſom as the roſe;</hi>" ſhall be our "Conſtant Prayer."</p>

            <byline>By the Rev. Mr. SYMMES, of Bradford.</byline>
            <p>WHEN Joſhua, with his brave ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had diſcomfited Amalek, with the edge of the ſword, (while Moſes, with the rod of God in his uplifted hands, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Aaron and Hur, made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the God of Armies on the top of the hill) the Lord ſaid to Moſes, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearſe it in the ears of Joſhua, Exod. xvii. 14. For this would be an unſpeakable encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to that renowned general, in his wars with the aborigines of Canaan.</p>
            <p>Now from this ſtory we learn, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Iſrael would prevail againſt their enemies, they ſhould all, their magiſtrates and miniſters eſpecially, lift and keep up the hand of prayer;<note n="*" place="bottom">Agreeable to which made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon intelligence of great numbers of Indians coming down on the frontiers and the march of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our companies in ſearch of them; at the inſtigation of his honor the Lt Gov and the Miniſters of Boſton, the public lecture there, on the <hi>29</hi>th of April<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was turned into a day of Prayer, which was but nine day before the fight at Pigwacket—the ſucceſs whereof ſhould therefore be aſcribed with thankfulneſs and praiſe to God, and gracious anſwer of the humble prayers of his people, and improved at their further encouragement.</note> But alſo, that the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:036392_0009_1009E2106B735638"/>
remarkable preſervation and ſucceſs of ſoldiers in fighting the Lord's battles, are very proper to be commemorated, for the honor of God, and the encouragement of his ſervants, in future expeditions and military actions.</p>
            <p>In conſideration hereof, I have the more eaſily complied with the requeſt of ſome of the hearers of the enſuing ſermon, that it might be accompanied with a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Memorable Occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>And though I at firſt propoſed only to reprint the Relation of this Action, given us in the public newſpapers; yet, having been favored with a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from the valorous Captain Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſome others of good credit, that were in the engagement, I hope it will not be unacceptable to any, and am ſure it will be very grateful to ſome, to have the account publiſhed with ſome enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and particularly to make a public record of the names of thoſe courageous Soldiers, who have ſo nobly play'd the man for their country; ſeveral of whom have been grievouſly wounded, and others have died in the field of battle, or of the
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:036392_0010_1009E212E7014A60"/>
wounds they received there—all of whoſe names I am perſuaded the greateſt part of the country will allow, deſerve to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unenvied to poſterity, with bright encomiums.</p>
            <p>It is to be deſired that all who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Pigwacket to their own houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, will conſider and ſhow what great things God has done for them. And that they and all our brave ſoldiers, will ſtill take for their Motto, when going forth to War, the inſcription made by Moſes on his altar of gratitude, after the defeat of Amalek JEHOVAH-Niſſi, The Lord is my Banner.</p>
            <p>I have related the ſtory of the action at Pigwacket, in a ſtyle adapted to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of telling it, and according to the beſt information I could obtain; and hope there are no material, I am ſure there are no willing or careleſs, miſtakes in it. And I have only to add:—That whoever conſiders the diſtance our people were at from any Engliſh ſettlement, in a howling wilderneſs, and very far in the enemy's country, who were at home, and more than double the number of our men;—
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:036392_0011_1009E216705BD648"/>
their fighting from morning till night in a long, hot day—the number of killed and wounded, amongſt whom were ſome who were perſons of diſtinction on both ſides; will doubtleſs grant that this action mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its a place in the hiſtory of our Neweng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land wars. If any judge I have obſerved ſome circumſtances of this action too mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely, I have only to ſay, if ſome ſuch perſons, or their relations had been in the action, it is poſſible they would not have been of this opinion. However, thoſe who I am firſtly obliged to gratify, will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily come into their ſentiment in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And I muſt beg of the others to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me this wrong, and that they would only conſider, the different taſte of readers, and conſequently the extreme difficulty, if not impoſſibility, of pleaſing every body, in a performance of this nature. And yet none would be more willing to do it, than the unworthy author, who is a hearty lover of his country, and of all good men of every denomination.</p>

            <head>LOVELL's FIGHT.</head>
            <p>IT was about the 16th of April, 1725, that the brave and intrepid Captain JOHN LOVELL began the arduous and perilous undertaking, of marching from Dunſtable to Pigwacket, with forty ſix men under his command.</p>
            <p>They had travelled but a ſhort diſtance before TOBY, an Indian, falling ſick, was obliged to return, which he did with great reluctance.</p>
            <p>When they had marched as far as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toocook, Mr. William Cummins, of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, became ſo diſabled by a wound that he had received from the enemy ſome time before, that the Captain diſmiſſed him, together with a kinſman of his to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him back.</p>
            <p>They proceeded on to Oſſapy, and at this place Mr. Benjamin Kidder, of Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, falling ſick, the Captain made a halt, and tarried while they built a ſmall forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for a place of refuge to reſort to if there ſhould be occaſion. Here he left his doctor, a ſerjeant and ſeven other men, to take care of Kidder. And they left at
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036392_0013_1009E21BD24C3FF8"/>
this place alſo, a conſiderable quantity of their proviſions, to lighten the loads of the men and facilitate their march; and which they intended ſhould ſerve as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit on their return.</p>
            <p>With his company now reduced to on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thirty four men with himſelf, Captain Lovell, not at all diſheartened by his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, proceeded on his march from his fortification at Oſſapy for Pigwacket, about forty miles diſtant from ſaid fort, through a rough wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>The names of thoſe who proceeded on from Oſſapy, and who engaged PAUGUS, with his gang of about eighty Indians, are as follow, (except one who, like a coward, ran from them at the beginning of the engagement, and ſneaked back to the fort, and whoſe name is unworthy of being tranſmitted to poſterity)—Theſe are the names of thoſe brave fellows, who boldly and ſucceſsfully contended with more than twice their number, viz.</p>

            <p>From the Thurſday before the battle, the company were apprehenſive they were diſcovered and dodged by the enemy; and on Friday night, the watch heard the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians about the camp and alarmed the company, but it being very dark, they could make no further diſcovery.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the eighth of May, while they were at prayers, very early in the morning, they heard a gun; and ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after they eſpied an Indian on a point, that ran into Saco Pond.</p>
            <p>They now concluded that the deſign of the gun, and the Indian's diſcovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was to draw them that way—They expected now without fail to be attacked, and it was propoſed and conſulted, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it would be prudent to venture an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with the enemy, (who they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were now ſufficiently alarmed) or endeavor a ſpeedy retreat. The men generally and boldly anſwered, "We came out to ſee the enemy; we have all along prayed God we might find them; and we had rather truſt Providence with our lives,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036392_0016_1009E22824FDFC68"/>
yea, die for our country, than try to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without ſeeing them, if we might, and be called cowards for our pains."</p>
            <p>The Captain readily complied to lead them on, though not without manifeſting ſome apprehenſions; and, ſuppoſing the enemy were ahead of them, (when, as it proved, they were in the rear) ordered the men to lay down their packs, and march with the greateſt caution, and in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt readineſs.</p>
            <p>When they had marched about a mile and a half, or two miles, Enſign WYMAN eſpied an Indian coming towards them, whereupon he gave a ſignal, and they all ſquatted, and let the Indian come on. In a ſhort time, ſeveral guns were fired at him; upon which the Indian fired upon Captain LOVELL, with beaver-ſhot, and wounded him mortally, (as is ſuppoſed) though he made but little complaint, and was ſtill able to travel, and at the ſame time wounded Mr. Samuel Whiting — Enſign Wyman immediately fired at and killed, the Indian, and Mr. Frye and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcalped him.</p>
            <p>They then marched back towards their
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036392_0017_1009E229A9523B58"/>
packs, (which the enemy had found in the mean time and ſeized) and about ten of the clock, when they came pretty near to where they had laid them, at the north eaſt end of Saco Pond, on a plain place, where there were few trees and but little bruſh, the Indians roſe up in front and rear, in two parties, and ran towards the Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three or four deep, with their guns preſented: The Engliſh alſo inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented their guns, and ruſhed on to meet them. When they had advanced to within a few yards of each other, they fired on both ſides, and the Indians fell in conſiderable numbers, but the Engliſh, moſt if not all of them, eſcaped the firſt ſhot, and drove the Indians ſeveral rods. Three or four rounds were fired on both ſides; but the Indians being more than double in number to our men, and having already killed Captain Lovell, Mr. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, (only ſon of Major Fullam of Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton) Enſign Harwood, John Jeſts, Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Kittridge, Daniel Woods, Ichabod Johnſon, Thomas Woods, and Joſiah Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, and wounded Lieutenants Farwell and Robbins and Robert Uſher, in the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036392_0018_1009E22B2DCBB588"/>
place where the fight begun, and ſtriving to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the reſt, the word was given, to retreat to the pond, which was done with a great deal of good conduct, and proved a great ſervice to the Engliſh, (the pond covering their rear) though the Indians got the ground where the dead of our party lay.</p>
            <p>The Fight continued very furious and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, till towards night—The Indians roaring and yelling and howling like wolves, barking like dogs, and making all ſorts of hideous noiſes —The Engliſh frequently ſhouting and huzza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they did after the firſt round. At one time, Captain WYMAN is confident, the Indians were diverting themſelves in powowing, by their ſtriking upon the ground, and other odd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—but Wyman creeping up, and ſhooting the chief actor, broke up their meeting.</p>
            <p>Some of the Indians, holding up ropes, aſked the Engliſh if they would take quarter; but were briſkly anſwered, that they would have no quarter but at the muzzles of their guns.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the afternoon, the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Mr. Jonathan Frye, (only ſon of Captain James Frye, of Andover) a young gentleman of a liberal education, who took his degree at col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, 1723, and was chaplain to the company, and greatly beloved by them, for his excellent performances &amp; good behavior, and who fought with undaunted courage, till that time of day, was mortally wounded. But when he could
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036392_0019_1009E22CCEB81100"/>
fight no longer, he prayed audibly ſeveral times for the preſervation and ſucceſs of the reſidue of the company.</p>
            <p>Some time after ſunſet, the enemy drew off and left the field to our men. It was ſuppoſed and believed, that not more than twenty of the enemy went off well. About midnight, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh aſſembled themſelves, and upon examining into their ſituation, they found Jacob Farrar juſt expiring by the pond, and Lieutenant Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins and Robert Uſher unable to travel.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Robbins deſired his companions to charge his gun and leave it with him, which they did; he declaring that, As the Indians will come in the morning to ſcalp me, I will kill one more of them if I can.</p>
            <p>There were eleven more <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Engliſh, who were badly wounded, viz. Lieutenant Farwell, Mr. Frye, Serjeant Johnſon, Timothy Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon, Joſiah Johnſon, Samuel Whiting, Elias Barron, John Chamberlain, Iſaac Lakin, Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer Davis and Joſiah Jones; but they however marched off the ground, with the nine others who received no conſiderable wounds, viz. Enſign Wyman, Edward Lingfield, Thomas Richardſon, the two Melvins, Ebenezer Ayer, Abiel Aſten, Joſeph Farrah and Joſeph Gilſon. Theſe all proceeded on their return for the fort, and did not perceive they were way-laid or purſued by the enemy, though they knew our men had no proviſion, and muſt therefore be very ſaint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:036392_0020_1009E23082169778"/>Four of the wounded men, viz. Farwell, Frye, Davis and Jones, after they had travelled about <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mile and a half, found themſelves unable to go any further, and with their free conſent, the reſt kept on their march, hoping to find a recruit at the ſort, and to return with freſh hands to relieve them.</p>
            <p>As they proceeded on, they divided into three companies one morning, as they were paſſing a thick wood, for fear of making a track by which the enemy might follow them. One of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies came upon three Indians, who purſued them ſome time; meanwhile Elias Barron, one of this party, ſtrayed from the others, and got over Oſſapy river, by the ſide of which his gun caſe was found, and he was not heard of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Eleven, in another party, reached the fort at Oſſapy; but to their great ſurprize, found it deſerted. The coward who fled in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the battle, ran directly to the fort, and gave the men poſted there, ſuch a frightful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had happened, that they all fled from the fort, and made the beſt of their way home.</p>
            <p>Solomon Kies alſo came to the fort. When he had fought in the battle till he received three wound, and had become ſo weak by the loſs of blood that he could not ſtand, he crawled up to Enſign Wyman, in the heat of the battle, and told him, he was a dead man; but, (ſaid he) if it be poſſible, I will get out of the way of the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036392_0021_1009E232D6689E38"/>
Indians, that they may not get my ſcalp. Kies then crept off by the ſide of the pond to where he providentially found a canoe, when he rolled himſelf into it, and was driven by the wind ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miles toward the fort; he gained ſtrength faſt, and reached the fort as ſoon as the eleven before mentioned; and they all arrived at Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable on the 13th of May, at night.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of May, Enſign Wyman, and three others, arrived at Dunſtable. They ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered greatly for want of proviſions. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that they were wholly deſtitute of all kinds of food, from a, Saturday morning till the Wedneſday following; when they caught two mouſe-ſquirrels, which they roaſted whole, and found to be a ſweet morſel. They afterwards killed ſome patridges and other game, and were comfortably ſupplied till they got home.</p>
            <p>Eleazer Davis arrived at Berwick, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; that he and the other three who were left with him, waited ſome days for the return of the men from the fort, and at length, deſpairing of their return, though their wounds were putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſtank, and they were almoſt dead with famine, yet they all travelled on ſeveral miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, till Mr. Frye deſired Davis and Farwell not to hinder themſelves any longer on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for he found himſelf dying, and he laid himſelf down, telling them He ſhould never riſe more, and charged Davis, if it ſhould pleaſe God to bring him home, to go to his father, and tell
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036392_0022_1009E235D7B1DF48"/>
him, that he expected in a few hours to be in eternity, and that he was not afraid to die.— They left him, and this amiable and promiſing young gentleman, who had the journal of the march in his pocket, was not heard of again.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Farwell, who was greatly and no doubt deſervedly applauded and lamented, was alſo left by Davis within a few miles of the fort, and was not afterwards heard of. But Davis, getting to the fort, and finding proviſion there, tarried and refreſhed himſelf, and recovered ſtrength to travel to Berwick.</p>
            <p>Joſiah Jones, another of the four wounded who were left the day after the Fight but a ſhort diſtance from the ſcene of action, traverſed Saco river, and after a fatiguing ramble, arrived at Saco, (now Biddeford) ematiated, and almoſt dead from the loſs of blood, the putrefaction of his wounds and the want of food. He had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon the ſpontaneous vegetables of the foreſt, and cramberries, &amp;c. which he had eaten, came out at a wound he had received in his body. He was kindly treated by the people at Saco, and recovered of his wounds.</p>
            <p>Several of the Indians, particularly <hi>Paugus</hi> their Chief, were well known to LOVELL's men, and frequently converſed with each other during the Engagement. In the courſe of the Battle, <hi>Paugus</hi> and John Chamberlain diſcourſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with each other; their guns had become foul, from frequent firing; they waſhed their
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036392_0023_1009E23927C6CCE0"/>
guns at the pond, and the latter aſſured Paugus that he ſhould kill him; Paugus alſo menaced him, and bid defiance to his inſinuations: when they had prepared their guns they loaded and diſcharged them, and Paugus fell.</p>
            <p>A ſon of Paugus, after it had become a time of peace, went to Dunſtable, to revenge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death, with the death of Chamberlain— He did not go directly to Chamberlain's, but to the houſe of a neighbor, where he tarried ſeveral days, upon ſome pretended buſineſs, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign might not be diſcovered; his errand was however ſuſpected, and a hint given to Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain—who cut a port-hole above his door, through which he very early one morning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an Indian behind his wood pile, lying with his gun pointing directly to the door; and it was ſuppoſed that the ſame muſket which had conveyed the mean of death to the boſom of the great Paugus, alſo proved fatal to his ſon, as he was not afterwards heard of</p>
            <p>It is alſo reported of this Chamberlain, (who was a ſtout and a courageous man, and who uſed to ſay that he was not to be killed by an Indian) that he was once fired at by an Indian, as he was at work in a ſaw mill, at night; he was in a ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſition, and did not diſcover the Indian till he fired, who was ſo near him that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately knocked him down with a crowbar, with which he was ſetting his log.</p>
            <p>After the return of the Engliſh from their
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036392_0024_1009E23BA4DADC38"/>
fight, Col. TYNG, with a company, went to the place of action, where he found and buried the following men, viz. Captain John Lovell, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign Jonathan Woods, Enſign John Harwood, &amp; Robert Uſher, of Dunſtable; Jacob Fullam, of Weſton; Jacob Farrar, and Joſiah Davis, of Concord; Thomas Woods, Daniel Woods, and John Jefts, of Groton; Ichabod Johnſon, of Woburn; Jonathan Kittridge, of Billerica.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Joſiah Farwell, of Dunſtable, Mr. Chaplain Frye, of Andover, and Elias Barron, of Groton, were wounded, and died by the way in attempting to return home.</p>
            <p>Col. Tyng found where the Indians had bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied three of their men, which were dug up, and one of them was known to be the bold Paugus, who had been a great ſcourge to Dunſtable.</p>
            <p>Enſign Wyman was rewarded with a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Commiſſion after his return; and every man was crowned with the grateful thanks of their countrymen, for this heavy blow given to a plundering ſavage foe, the common enemy of their country.</p>

            <p>THE book before us is entitled the ſecond of Samuel, not that it was written by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prophet of that name; for it contains a hiſtory of what came to paſs after his death; of which we have an account in the 25th chapt. of the former book; but the latter part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with the whole of this book, are ſuppoſed to be written by Nathan or Gad, or by Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah or Ezra. And probably it is called the Second of Samuel, by the Hebrews, becauſe it is a continuation of the hiſtory began by him; and ſo, being a ſupplement to the hiſtory of Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, it goes under his name; as is uſual in ſuch caſes now a days.</p>
            <p>In the chapter before us, we have a very cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrated elegy; of which our text is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And here we may obſerve,</p>

The Sweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael was a Poet, as well as muſician; and has given us a noble ſpecimen of his admirable poetic genius, in the mournful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em before us. But we are to conſider him here not only as a finiſhed poet, but as an eminent ſervant of God, even the man after God's own
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036392_0026_1009E23F17E3DC28"/>
heart; who duly conſidering the works of the Lord, and regarding the operations of his hands, has ſet us a very bright example, how to behave upon, and what improvement to make of, the death of uſeful men; eſpecially of ſuch as not only have jeoparded their lives unto death, but nobly laid down their lives in the high places of the field, in the ſervice of their king and country —David lamented with this lamentation.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Obſerve the ſubject and occaſion of this elegy, viz. the death of Saul and Jonathan, who with many of their army fell down ſlain on Mount Gilboa, 1 Sam. 31.1, 2, 3. Tidings of this ſlaughter being brought unto David, he was greatly affected therewith, and (as was cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amongſt the Hebrews on ſuch ſorrowful occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) David took hold on his clothes and rent them, and likewiſe all the men that were with him. And they mourned and wept and faſted until even, for Saul and for Jonathan his ſon, and for the people of the Lord, and for the houſe of Iſrael, becauſe they were fallen by the ſword. Context 11 and 12 ver. And having done juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice on the young Amalekite that brought the news, who by his own confeſſion had ſtretched forth his hand to ſlay the Lord's anointed, he further gave vent to his grief, in the elegant compoſition before us.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Obſerve the matter and ſubſtance of this elegy: or, what David ſaid on this great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. And firſt he utters this mournful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036392_0027_1009E241CE0F8878"/>
The Beauty of Iſrael is ſlain upon thy high places! ver. 19. Expert ſoldiers are no inconſiderable part of the beauty of Iſrael. Then follows a very pathetical exclamation, which is thrice repeated, v. 19, 25, 27, and is the burthen of the ſong, How are the mighty fallen! We have then his wiſh, with the reaſon of it, that the tragical news might not be publiſhed, v. 20. Tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkelon: leſt the daughters of the Philiſtines rejoice, leſt the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph. The Imperative mood is uſed in the beginning of the verſe for the Optative, after the manner of paſſionate mourners, who often wiſh for things impoſſible. And by this form of ſpeech David rather expreſſes his deteſtation of what was done, than ſorbids the doing of it: q. d. O that this doleful ſtory had never been told in Gath! for ſo it ſurely was, 1 Sam. 31.8, 9, 10. We have next David's imprecation, on the place of the defeat, with the reaſon of it, v. 21. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let there be rain upon you, nor fields of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; for there the ſhield of the mighty is vilely ſlung away. Some think this only a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urative ſpeech, ſuppoſing the very heavens and earth had a kind of ſenſe and feeling of this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; others think it a prophetical curſe, that took effect accordingly, even as our Saviour's, denounced on the barren fig tree. But this has been confuted by Brochard and others, who have
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036392_0028_1009E24627AFFD08"/>
been upon the place. We may therefore look upon it, as only an hyperbolical imprecation.</p>
            <p>David then goes on to commend Saul and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan, for their wonderful ſucceſs at arms v. 22. From the blood of the ſlain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the ſword of Saul returned not empty.— They were won to be victorious over their ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies. And that it is otherwiſe now, and that theſe valiant men are fallen, argues that God is angry; which ſhould awaken his people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. He further celebrates (as, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to one another and union in death, v. 23. ſo,) their agility and courage. They were ſwifter than eagles, they were bolder than lions. They were ſwift and nimble to purſue their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to avoid danger; and ſtrong and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant to reſiſt and overcome ſuch as dared to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them. Briefly, he commends Saul for his royal bounty to the daughters of Iſrael, whom he calls upon to lament him, v. 24. Even the daughters of Iſrael had been wont to bear their part in Saul's triumphs, and now it became them to mourn his fall. As all ſhare in common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, ſo all ſhould be ſuitably affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Finally, David particularly laments over Jonathan, profeſſing his deep diſtreſs for him, the dear affection between them, and the pleaſure he took in his converſation, v. 25, 26</p>
            <p n="4">4th, Obſerve ſome of the properties of this elegy. And firſt, it is extremely elegant, the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036392_0029_1009E247AC69F308"/>
ideas are very bright, and well adapted; the phraſes are very expreſſive and emphatical, and hence the whole <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> very moving and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical. And particularly, where he ſpeaks of his friend Jonathan, nothing can be more ſoft and tender, and expreſſed with a greater pathos. And what more paſſionate than his repeated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, How are the mighty fallen! Thoſe valiant and renowned commanders, Saul and Jonathan, with their brave and undaunted ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that fell with them. So that the Weapons of War are periſhed, i. e. thoſe who wielded them are dead. And what will weapons do, without men of ſkill and courage to handle them, for their country's preſervation and defence, and the ſuppreſſion and extirpation of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies?</p>
            <p>Again. The whole Poem is ſufficiently brave and manly. David ſhows himſelf a man of a great ſoul, now that Saul's day was come to die, and God had delivered him out of his hands; and Saul could now no longer perſecute and hunt him as a partridge on the mountains, as he had a long while done; (for as in the grave the weary ſervants of God are at reſt, ſo, bleſſed be God, when the wicked are lodged there, they ceaſe from troubling) I ſay, though David was now delivered, he ſcorns to trample with inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feet on the monument of the dead, and boaſt over a breathleſs corpſe; but buries all the faults
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036392_0030_1009E24AAD2D6248"/>
of Saul in perpetual oblivion, in the land of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, lays aſide all ſpleen, and heartily mourns his country's reproach and loſs, though the very means of his own deliverance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, (a noble inſtance of public ſpirited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and commemorates what was commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even in Saul. For, <hi>de mortuis, nil niſi bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> None that are men after God's own heart, will unneceſſarily rip up the faults of others; and ſpeak evil of thoſe that cannot ſpeak for themſelves. Thoſe that are not thus tender of the reputation of others, may juſtly fear that others will be as free with them, when they are ſilent in the grave.</p>
            <p>But then it is alſo a martial poem: it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a martial air. The ſubject is entirely military. He laments his heroes, conſidered in their military character. He celebrates their military accompliſhments and atchievements. And he dedicates it to the militia of Judah, as in the parentheſis in the preface, 18th v <hi>alſo he bade them teach the children of Judah the uſe of the bow.</hi> Whence it is evident, That David in the midſt of his mourning, is not unmindful of what was neceſſary for the good of the commonwealth: Teaching us, not to be ſo overcome with grief, on ſuch ſorrowful occaſions, as to forget our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and neglect means for our own or our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's ſafety.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, This Elegy is very ancient. It
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036392_0031_1009E24D6193EE98"/>
was written about eight and twenty hundred years ago. And according to ſome chronologies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the famous Iliads of Homer, who was the very father of all the Heathen Poets, and ſaid to be born in the reign of Solomon the ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. It is then one of the firſt born of elegies, and venerable for its antiquity. It is ſaid to be recorded in the book of Jaſhe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. the Juſt or Upright. We read of it Joſh. 10 13. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this book was continued from <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to age, as a collection of State Poems, (ſay ſome) or of the memorable acts of God's worthies; and tho' laid up at length in the temple (as Joſephus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) yet being not canonical, is now loſt.</p>
            <p>Finally, To remark no more characters of this poem, it is a ſcripture elegy: for though we do not ſuppoſe it at firſt written by inſpiration; yet being agreeable to the will of God, was adopted (if I may ſo expreſs it) by the Holy Spirit, who inſpired thoſe that inſerted it in the ſacred pages, ſo that it is now a part of Canonical Scripture, And thus it is probable the penman of the chron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icles collected many things out of the book of Jaſher, being guided therein by the unerring ſpirit of God. And though the name of God is not to be found in this elegy, yet it is conſonant to religion, and approved by God; and hence we learn, that what is ſpoken or written by the ſervants of God, may be very agreeable to the will of God, and for his glory, though the name
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036392_0032_1009E2501323DF30"/>
of God or Chriſt is not to be found therein — Thus the book of Eſther wherein are no leſs than ten chapters, has not the name of God in it.</p>
            <p n="5">5th, Obſerve the main ſcope and deſign of this elegy. And there are two things more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that David had in view, after the glory of God, his ultimate end. Firſt, To perpetuate the memory of Saul, and his dearly beloved Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan, his boſom friend. "Great indeed was the love between Damon and Pythias; for when Dionyſius the tyrant, had on ſome occaſion ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his reſolution that one of them ſhould die, and permitted Damon to go home and ſettle his affairs before his death, provided he could find one to be ſurety for his return; Pythias forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with offered voluntarily, and put himſelf in the tyrant's power. Damon coming back preciſely at the time appointed, Dionyſius did ſo much admire their mutual fidelity, that he pardoned both, and prayed that he might be admitted the third into their friendſhip." But the love of David and Jonathan was more divine and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, than that of theſe brave heathen philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. We have the account of its commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 Sam. 18. begin. And it came to paſs when he [David] had made an end of ſpeaking to Saul, that the ſoul of Jonathan was knit with the ſoul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own ſoul. And Saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036392_0033_1009E25360C8AB70"/>
houſe. Then Jonathan and David made a cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant, becauſe he loved him as his own ſoul. And Jonathan ſtript himſelf of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even to his ſword and his bow, and to his girdle. For ſuch a friend, one would even dare to die. To be ſure, David would have the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of this juſt man bleſſed. He would have him had in everlaſting remembrance. And be here does his part, that it might be ſo, and the event was agreeable to his pious deſire, for wherever the Bible is enjoyed, this elegy is ſtill to be found on record for a memorial of him.</p>
            <p>But then David had a further reach than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to embalm the name of his friend, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the remembrance of Saul, for his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Jonathan and to his country; For, by this elegy, or funeral ſong, David deſigned to fire the ambition of his contemporaries and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, to ſeek to excel in chivalry; and to fire them alſo with zeal to proſecute the war againſt the barbarous Philiſtines, and to avenge the death of their ſovereign, and ſeveral of the royal family, and many other gallant ſoldiers; and to defend themſelves, againſt their inſults and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations. Agreeably in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>entheſis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, v. 18. He bade them teach the children of Judah the uſe of the bow. The beſt interpretation of which paſſage (ſays Junius) is, that it expreſſes the deſign of David, that this
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036392_0034_1009E256578D30A8"/>
ſong, being put into the hands of Judah, it might ſerve to excite and provoke them to addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to martial exerciſes, and to acquire ſkill in the uſe of the bow, which is here put for as warlike weapons then in faſhion. And may the ſame uſe be made of the diſcourſe, you are now reading, to provoke all among us, of a military character, to inure themſelves to the uſe of the Gun, and all ſuch exerciſes as may accompliſh them for ſervice in the doleful war, we're un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily involved in.</p>
            <p>Having, obſerved theſe things in General in this elegy, I come now to remark from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of it.</p>
            <p>That the fall of brave and ſucceſsful warriors in the field of battle, is very much to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the people of God, in whoſe immediate ſervice they loſt their lives. We ſhould lament over them with this lamentation, How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed! Firſt, It is ſometimes the lot of the braveſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and of ſuch as have been very ſucceſsful, to fall at laſt, or be ſlain in the field of battle. Saul had been a brave warrior, and did worthily in the beginning of his reign. The hiſtory of his deliverance of Jabeſh Gilead when Na<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſh the Ammonite came up and encamped againſt it, is very noble and brave, 1 Sam. 11. begin. He diſcovered both great courage and conduct, in that whole action: at the 11th. we read, Saul
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036392_0035_1009E2591A6D78F0"/>
put the people in three companies, and they came into the midſt of the hoſt in the morning watch, and ſlew the Ammonites, until the heat of the day; and it came to paſs that they which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were ſcattered, ſo that two of them were not left together. Thus he effectually raſed the ſiege of poor Jabeſh-Gilead, and delivered the city. And when ſome hot-headed people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Samuel that the malecontents ſhould be put to death, who had ſaid, Shall Saul reign over us? Saul very generouſly ſuppreſſed the motion, and ſnubbed thoſe that too officiouſly propoſed it; ſaying. There ſhall not a man be put to death this day! And as he was once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the ſlaughter of the Philiſtines the women came out of all the cities of Iſrael, ſing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tabrets, with joy and with inſtruments of muſic; and the women anſwered one to another as they played, and ſaid, Saul hath ſlain his thouſands. We read alſo of Jonathan, that he ſmote the garriſon of the Philiſtines that was in Geba, 1 Sam. 13.3. And in the beginning of the 14th chapter we are informed how Jonathan and his armourbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, did miraculouſly ſmite the Philiſtines. And in the context, ver. 22. David gives them this encomium, From the blood of the ſlain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Janathan turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not back, and the ſword of Saul returned not empty. And he calls them, the mighty, and the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036392_0036_1009E25B6DC291B0"/>
flower or beauty of Iſrael. Now theſe brave, ſucceſsful ſoldiers were ſlain in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at laſt, upon mount Gilboa.</p>
            <p>And, not to mention any other inſtance, thus "Guſtavus Adolphus, ſtiled the great King of Sweden, who took for his motto, If God be for us, who can be againſt us? And who was an incomparable warrior, venturous ſometimes even without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and eſpecially in war, would neglect his life and perform rather the duty of a ſoldier than of a general; and to excuſe himſelf would ſay, The armies ſlight the danger they ſhare in with their king; and that if Generals do not act in perſon, they can never atchieve a glittering reputation; and that ſuch as ſhun death, meet it oftner than they that ſeek it; that Julius Ceſar was never wounded in battle, though he ever fought in the foremoſt ranks of his troops; and that Alexander the Great marked out the way with his own blood, that led him to the empire of the Eaſt; and that to be as famous as theſe great men, he ought to be no more timorous than they: this great man, after he had obtained divers victories over the Danes
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036392_0037_1009E25DF70B1850"/>
and Poles and Muſcovites, and received thirteen wounds before thoſe of which he died, was at length ſlain in a battle with the Germans, having firſt almoſt got the victory, which his army completed after his death. And thus the Great Guſtavus died, in the 38th year of his age, 1632, whilſt victory (as one expreſſes it) lay bleeding by his ſide.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The fall of brave and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoldiers is very much to be lamented by the people of God. There is a time to weep, as well as a time to laugh. And every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon. Now when brave and ſucceſsful ſoldiers are ſlain in the field of battle, who have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Providence as Inſtruments of checking the pride and inſolence, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening the force, and thinning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and diſcouraging the hearts of the enemies of God's people, and of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lives, liberties and properties of the Iſrael of God; and might if God had ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them been a further ſcourge to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, and defence to the people of God, by contending with the enemy in battle; it is very proper and highly reaſonable ſuch
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036392_0038_1009E26229255728"/>
eſpecially in whoſe immediate ſervice they have courageouſly ventured, and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly laid down their lives ſhould lament their death. And the contrary is, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent? how ſottiſh? how ſtupid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable? Now whatſoever things are lovely, decorous and of good report, chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſhould love and practiſe theſe things, Phil. 4.8. The civilized heathen will riſe up in judgment againſt Chriſtians; yea, and the barbarians alſo, if they do not do ſuch deſerving perſons the honor of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their untimely death. It is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and manly to do ſo: but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, indeed, inhumane, and worſe than heatheniſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is juſt and equal, for the people of God to lament the death of brave and ſucceſsful ſoldiers ſlain by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in their ſervice. Tears and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lamentations are a debt we owe them. They have dearly merited this piece of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from their people. It is but juſt, to ſhed tears for them, that have ſhed their hearts blood for us. And ſurely, if they deſerved the applauſe and commendation of all while they lived; they ought to be
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036392_0039_1009E263DB9BA850"/>
honored with the lamentations of all when they are ſlain in the high places of the field. And the law of equity calls for it. Surely it is to do as we would be done by; or as we ſhould deſire any of our dear relatives ſhould be treated, in like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. If it had been the lot of any very nearly related to us (and it has been ſo) to be ſlain in battle, or ſea-fight, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man for their GOD; ſurely a due notice taken of their death, by the people of God, would be what we ſhould expect and be pleaſed with. Now whatſoever we would that men ſhould do to us, we ſhould do the ſame to them; or, we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs a golden rule. But if this rule be out of faſhion with any; yet</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Agreeable lamentations for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert and ſucceſsful ſoldiers ſlain in war, are very uſeful and advantageous. It is a comfort to their bereaved relatives, when they obſerve that the people of God do greatly bewail the death of their friends, and heartily ſympathize with them, though their loſs may poſſibly be in ſome reſpects irreparable; yet this ſhould and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute not a little, to alleviate their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036392_0040_1009E26813C1D0C8"/>
eaſe their diſtreſſed minds, and dry up their tears.</p>
            <p>And then, it is a ſpur to Virtue. When ſurviving ſoldiers (and particularly ſuch as have been eye-witneſſes of the fall of their brethren, and ſought with uncommon bravery, and were either wounded, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually expoſed in the ſame battle, with thoſe that are ſlain) take notice that the death of their officers or fellow ſoldiers is deeply reſented by the people of God, that they ſtill ſpeak of them with great honor in their lamentations; this will animate them, we hope, to do worthily, and rather die with honor, if called to battle, than live with diſgrace; &amp; for their cowardice, have the offer of a wooden ſword, and be branded with the infamous character of cowards, even by the weaker ſex.</p>
            <p>Whereas, on the other hand, it is a great aggravation of the affliction of diſtreſſed mourners, when they obſerve that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality only give the news of their friends death the hearing, but ſeem as ſtoical and unconcerned about it, as if their lives were of no value.—Such inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is very exerciſing to ingenuous
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036392_0041_1009E2699777C448"/>
minds and ſuch as have any ſenſe of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. Beſides ſuch a ſordid inſenſibleneſs is very diſcouraging to our brave ſoldiers. Who could be willing to venture their lives for ſuch ungrateful people!</p>
            <p>Finally, It is pious and ſcriptural to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the death of ſuch brave and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoldiers, whoſe lot it is to be ſlain at laſt in the field of battle, God expects we ſhould lay to heart the death of all our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures: that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart, Eccl. 7.2. And particularly, we are obliged to lament the death of eminently uſeful men, though they die quietly in their beds, and come to their graves in a good old age, like as a ſhock of corn comes in, in it's ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. How much more ſhould we mourn their loſs, when ſlain in battle, in the midſt of their days, or in the very flower of their age, while their breaſts were full of milk, and their bones were moiſtened with marrow. It is a ſore judgment when God ſuffers ſuch to fall by, and into the hand of the enemy, and does not cover their heads in the day of battle. This is an awful frown, and argues the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036392_0042_1009E26C2B667170"/>
of God. Hence he threatened the men of Anathoth, that ſaid to the prophet Jeremy, propheſy not in the name of the Lord, that their young men ſhould die by the ſword, Jer. 11.21, 22. and alike threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he denounced againſt Moab, Jer. 48 15.—His choſen young men are gone down to the ſlau'ter, ſaith the King, whoſe name is the Lord of Hoſts. And when the wrath of the Lord was riſen againſt Iſrael, for their meaſure-filling ſin, in mocking the Lord's meſſengers, deſpiſing his words and miſuſing his Prophets, it is ſaid, 2 Chron. 36.17. Therefore he brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the King of the Chaldees, who ſlew their young men with the ſword. Now what greater cauſe of mourning and lamentation than the manifeſtations of God's diſpleaſure? If the Lion roar, who will not tremble? but alas, who can ſtand when God is angry! and he highly reſents it, when his people are inſenſible under the tokens of his holy anger: if they cry not, when he corrects them. He ſays to ſuch, why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more, Iſa. 1.5. and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036392_0043_1009E26DC9F5CA18"/>
again, they are not humbled unto this day, Jer. 44.10.</p>
            <p>Beſides, we have many ſcripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and examples that teach us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the occaſion under conſideration. When God threatened Iſrael, by the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prophet, that a people ſhould come from the North Country, that ſhould lay hold on bow and ſpear, being cruel, and having no mercy: Jer. 6.22, 23. It is added, ver. 26. O Daughter of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, gird thee with ſackcloth, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thyſelf in aſhes: make thee mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as for an Only Son, moſt bitter lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;—Surely then, there ſhould be a proportionable lamentation, when ſeveral choſen young men, and ſome very promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and hopeful, are actually flain by men of the Chaldean Character. Another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we have, Jer. 9.17.—Conſider ye, and call for the mourning women.—Let them make haſte—that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids guſh out with waters—and teach your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation. For death is come up,—to cut off the young men from the ſtreets.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036392_0044_1009E272544D1908"/>
And even the carcaſes of men ſhall fall as dung upon the open field—and none ſhall gather, or, bury them. This evinces, that God calls to mourning when young men fall by the ſword, and the mighty in the battle. And then to mention no other Scriptures, our text and context is a full and direct proof of our doctrine. For, as was obſerved before, this mournful ſong was David's lamentation over thoſe that were ſlain by the Philiſtines on mount Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the Application. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, If it is ſometimes the lot of the moſt valiant and ſucceſsful ſoldiers, to be ſlain at laſt in battle; then they that gird on the harneſs ſhould not boaſt as they that put it off. This was well obſerved by Ahab to Benhadad King of Syria, 1. Kings 20.11. All ſuch prepoſterous boaſting is evil; very fooliſh and ominous, and commonly followed with fatal conſequents. Boaſting Benhadad had cauſe and leiſure in his inner chamber to think of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my miſerably broken a firſt time, and ſlain with a great ſlaughter, by a company of ſtriplings, under the command of Ahab
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036392_0045_1009E274B0734260"/>
their King: and a ſecond time totally rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; an hundred thouſand footmen being ſlain in one day by the Iſraelites; and twenty ſeven thouſand more by the falling of a wall upon them; and he reduced to ſuch abject circumſtances, as to beg quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by his ambaſſadors with ſackcloth on their loins and ropes on their heads. How was the ſcene now changed, and his tune turned, 1. Kings 20. And thus we find the ſwaggering Goliah, who defied the armies of the living God, one minute curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing David by his Gods, and diſdainfully ſaying, <hi>Come to me and I will give thy fleſh to the fowls of the air, and to the beaſts of the field</hi>; and the next minute tumbling head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with his face upon the earth: and the beauty of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cutting off his Head with his own ſword, 1 Sam. 17.1,—51.</p>
            <p>God allows us indeed, in our ſpiritual warfare, (and in extraordinary caſes, as, in David's, anſwering the challenge of the Giant, in a carnal warfare alſo) to triumph before the battle and to ſay, thanks be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For in all theſe things we are more than conquerors thro'
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036392_0046_1009E2768B2B8328"/>
the Captain of our Salvation, whoſe is the Victory, and who hath loved us, and will give it to us!</p>
            <p>But without particular Revelation, not now to be expected, none can tell, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the many, or the few; the ſtrong or the weak; the righteous or the wicked; the friend or enemy will get the day in the field of battle. Boaſting then, upon the going forth of armies, is to be condemned; both in ſuch as go forth to war, and in ſuch as tarry at home, on their account.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The moſt ſkilful, dexterous, courageous and ſucceſsful ſoldiers, had need to be truly religious and well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death; ſeeing they are not invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, but as liable to die as others. An Indian bullet will kill a hero, a champion, as eaſily as a faint hearted coward: a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or Chaplain, as ſoon as a bringer up of the front half files; or the moſt inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or private ſoldier. There muſt indeed be the ſwiftneſs of the eagle, the ſubtilty of the fox, the ſtrength and boldneſs of the lion, as well as the grace of the chriſtian, to conſtitute a brave ſoldier; and every devout chriſtian, that is fit for heaven, is
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036392_0047_1009E2791195C908"/>
not moſt fit to go forth to war. But, though ſuch as are deſtitute of grace may poſſibly be ſtout ſoldiers and noble commanders, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well of their prince and country; and in anſwer to the prayers of God's people, in whoſe cauſe they are employed, they might fight val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iantly, and play the man for their people, and tread down the enemy; yet if they are ſlain, they cannot groundedly expect ſalvation. Seeing then our ſoldiers carry their lives in their hands, when they go forth to war, and are ſtill liable to be ambuſhed, wherever they travel in the vaſt howling wilderneſs, and, killed unexpectedly, as well as ſlain in a pitched battle, they had need be always ready not only to fight, but to die, and make their appearance before God. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, they ſhould now believe in Chriſt, and repent of all their ſins, and ſo get into, and keep in good terms with God, who can eaſily preſerve them, though a thouſand fall at their ſide, and ten thouſand at their right hand; and can cauſe one of them to chaſe a thouſand, and two of them to put ten thouſand to flight.</p>
            <p>The wretched Jeſuites or friars, are wont (it is ſaid) to abſolve their deluded Proſelytes, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Indians, when they come forth to war againſt us: and flatter them with the promiſe of an immediate paſſage to Paradiſe, without any ſtop at purgatory, if they fall in battle: and theſe deluſive hopes may poſſibly animate them, to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036392_0048_1009E27BA519D938"/>
fight with great fury in their engagements with us. And many private ſoldiers and inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the campaigns in Chriſtendom, meerly from the proſpect of applauſe, promotion, or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre; or for thirſt after revenge, and a vain opinion that fighting in a good cauſe, and on the right ſide they ſhall ſurely be happy in the next world, if they are killed in battle, have poſſibly been led on to fight with undaunted reſolution, and the utmoſt intrepidity. Surely then the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of pure Religion, ſuch as ſerving God and their Country; having God to go before them, and fight for them, and either to cover their heads, or, receive their departing ſouls to the bleſſed manſions above, where there is no adverſary nor evil occurrent, where they ſhall reſt from their labours, and their works ſhall follow them, muſt needs be ſufficient, by the influence of the holy Spirit that dwelleth in all real Chriſtians, to cauſe to wax valiant in fight, and to raiſe them above the fear of what Earth or Hell can do unto them.</p>
            <p>So then, a well grounded perſuaſion of a part in Chriſt, and an Intereſt in the favour of God, is what all that go forth to war, would do wiſely to give all diligence to obtain.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Since the beſt of ſoldiers are liable to be overcome and ſlain in war, it ill becomes the people of God to put their truſt in man. Tho' it is their duty and wiſdom to employ and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age expert ſoldiers; yet it is their ſin and folly
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036392_0049_1009E27E45D28638"/>
to truſt in them. As it is idolatry for ſoldiers to truſt in their arms, or in their dexterity and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to handle them; or in one another; ſo it is idolatry for the people of God, in whoſe ſervice they go forth, to truſt in them. For, alas! what is man, whoſe breath is it his noſtrils, and wherein is he to be accounted of? His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his duſt; in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, all his projections and reſolutions, and accompliſhments for war, periſh.</p>
            <p>Surely then, it is the greateſt folly for a people to truſt in their forces, how well ſoever qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſpirited and equipped, and how ſucceſsful ſoever they have been. For, every creature is that to us that God makes it to be; and unleſs God give help, vain is the help of man, Jer. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 23. Truly in vain is ſalvation hoped for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. And we know who has ſaid, Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm—But bleſſed is the man, that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is, Jer. 17.5, 7. Agreeably we find the People of God, reſolving, in the name of our God we will ſet up our banners. And whilſt ſome truſt in Chariots and ſome in horſes, we will remember the name of the Lord our God, Pſal. 20 5, —7. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, through thee we will puſh down our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: through thy name we will tread them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036392_0050_1009E2812E86FED8"/>
that riſe up againſt us, Pſal. 40.5. and Pſal. 60.12. through God we ſhall do valiantly, for he it is, that ſhall tread down our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Men may fail us, be overcome, and utterly fruſtrate our expectations: but, if we truſt in God, we may pray with Aſa, when Zerab the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an came againſt him, with an hoſt of a Thouſand Thouſand, and three hundred Chariots; Lord, (ſaid he) it is nothing with thee to help whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us O Lord our God, for we reſt on thee, &amp; in thy name we go againſt this multitude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail againſt thee. The Lord of hoſts is immortal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible; he has all Creatures at his Command, and can cauſe the Stars in their courſes to fight againſt the Enemies of his people; and ſell Siſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra into the hand of a woman. In a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord pleaſeth that he doth; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better to truſt in him, than to put confidence in man, Pſal. 118.8.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Are the braveſt and moſt ſucceſsful ſoldiers, liable to fall in battle, ſuch then as are preſerved in military expeditions and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſafely returned to their families and friends, ought to ſtudy what they ſhall render to the Lord, and take heed, they dont forget his benefits, but that all their days they perform their vows. It is the Lord that has covered their heads in the battle; it is the Lord that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036392_0051_1009E285A4D55240"/>
their lives from deſtruction, when thoſe, no more expoſed than they, are fallen, and gone down to the Grave and ſhall come up no more, and return to their houſes no more. O that all ſuch as have experienced the diſtinguiſhing favor of heaven, would praiſe him for his goodneſs, and not content themſelves to deſire thanks to be returned for them in the public aſſemblies of God's people, though that is commendable, but that they would endeavour to live the praiſes of God. It is very diſpleaſing to God, when his people do not render to him according to his ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efits, 2 Chron. 32.25. David celebrates the praiſes of God, for preſervation and ſucceſs in war, Pſal. 18. &amp; Pſal. 144 begin.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Hence the people of God ought to aſcribe to him the Glory of all their ſucceſs in war. His is the victory &amp; he gives it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will. He furniſhes men with military ſkill &amp; courage, teaches their hands to war and their fingers to fight. He finds out the Enemy for his people, and gives a preſence of mind to their forces; and if they are not ſwallowed up quick, when men, vaſtly ſuperior in number, and other advantages riſe up againſt them, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord is on their ſide, Pſal· 124. Again, we find Deborah and Barak giving Glory to God, for avenging his people in the defeat of Siſera &amp; his hoſt, Judg. 5. and how often is David the famous warrior of Iſrael, harping on this ſtring as we noted before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:036392_0052_1009E287296FA698"/>God highly reſents it, when his people ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their own drag: when they aſcribe that to inſtruments that is due to God alone. This no doubt often provokes God, to deprive a people of their choſen ſoldiers. For he is a very Jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, and will not give his Glory to another. And as the former paſtor of this Church would ſay of Miniſters, we may ſay of ſoldiers, people kill them two ways: either by aſcribing too much, or too little to them: idolizing of them.</p>
            <p>Finally, Let us all religiouſly lament the fall of the Brave LOVELL, and ſeveral of his Gallant Company, that offered themſelves willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. Let us take up this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over them, how are the mighty fallen! and if we would herein approve ourſelves to God, let us conſider that theſe brave men (though I hope, we have many left as capable of ſerving their Country) yet they were no conſiderable part of the beauty and ſtrength of New-England. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, being wholly a ſtranger to moſt of them, I cannot pretend to give their character; yet it is evident to the Country, they were men formed and raiſed up by Providence to ſerve us in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Enemy, of whom we may ſay as of the wild aſs, the wilderneſs yieldeth food for them and for their Children, Job 24.5.</p>
            <p>Theſe our worthy friends could endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as good ſoldiers: and were well <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the fatigues of long march, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036392_0053_1009E289D63D5FE8"/>
winter and ſummer. Some of them were well acquainted with the woods, &amp; with the cuſtoms and lurking places of the Enemy, &amp; were might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily ſpirited to purſue them, &amp; God did gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly preſerve &amp; proſper them this laſt winter in two expeditions, firſt, delivered two <hi>Indians</hi> into their hands, &amp; then ten ſtout fellows as you all remember, whom they killed, without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any harm from them. This was the Lord's doings and marvelous in our eyes! and in this laſt engagement, they were inſpired with a great deal of bravery and good conduct, &amp; their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany crowned with wonderful ſucceſs. Now to loſe ſuch experienced ſoldiers, and men ſo reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the Country, is a great loſs.</p>
            <p>Again, Let us conſider, that this is the finger of God. Let not any ſay prophanely and athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtically, it is the fortune of war: or, as a good man ſaid on a bad occaſion, the ſword devoureth one as well as another, 2 Sam. 11.25. For tho it is true the battle is not to the ſtrong, and time and chance happen to all men, yet the hand of the Lord, is herein gone out againſt us, there are tokens of his dſipleaſure to be ſeen in this affair. That this brave company, ſhould be ſo weakned by leaving ſo great a number with one that fell ill, and that at ſo great a diſtance from them. That one of the Company ſhould ſo unhappily leave <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the beginning of the fight, &amp; bring ſuch we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe left behind, that occaſioned
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036392_0054_1009E28B746982D0"/>
their immediate return; when their continuance there, might have been ſuch an unſpeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to thoſe that ſurvived the battle. And indeed, it appears a frown, that they ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo far with ſo ſmall a number at that ſeaſon of the Year, when the Enemy are capable of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubſiſting in bodies, than in the winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I ſay, the hand of the Lord appears in all this, that ſo many brave men ſhould deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to battle and periſh.</p>
            <p>But then we are alſo to conſider. Why the Lord's anger againſt us is not turned away; but his hand ſtretched out ſtill. Have not our ſins as really ſlain our magnanimous ſoldiers, as ever, David ſlew Uriah the Hittite by the ſword of the children of Ammon? and ſhould we not hear the rod, and him that hath appointed it: and conſider in this day of adverſity, what we have done; and humble ourſelves and pray and ſeek God's face? thus did David and his men, as in the context. And the men of Jabeſh Gilead, 1 Sam. ult.</p>
            <p>Should we not endeavour to find out and put away the accurſed thing from the midſt of us? &amp; turn to him that ſmites us? ſhould we not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by ſuch providences to get our peace made with God, and engage and ſecure his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence with us, under our preſent dark views?</p>
            <p>How many calls have New-England <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:036392_0055_1009E28F8E9BD670"/>
the Pulpit, and by the Preſs alſo, from Year to Year; to remember whence we are fallen and repent &amp; do our firſt works! how many Election Sermons have been publiſhed amongſt us, filled with ſolemn warnings, moſt earneſt exhortations and ample teſtimonies for God, and againſt the provoking evils of the land! but alas, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſtill acting the part of the deaf Adder, or as the Prophet expreſſes it, they refuſe to hearken, they pull away the ſhoulder and ſtop the ear that they ſhould not hear, Zech. 7.11. How many hate to be reformed? yea hate to be told by thoſe that have good right, full power, &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority to do it, wherein we ſhould be, &amp; what is to be done that we may be a reformed People. How ſad is it, if all the notice taken by the generality of people, of the ſolemn meſſages ſent to them from the Lord God of their fathers, is only to give them the hearing and either humm or hiſs the Preacher and his performance, pretty much as they ſtand affected to him; and it may be with ſome conſiderable formality, give him thanks for his ſermon (and then he comes off mighty well!) however if they carry the matter ſo far as to Print the ſermon, yet perhaps they do not put it in practice! but now dont they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves that hear, &amp; read God's word, but do it not? or, what meaneth that ſaying, Jam. 1.22.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, by the ſore judgement of war,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036392_0056_1009E292714A2618"/>
and particularly by the fall of our brethren, we are now weeping over, God is loudly calling upon us, to amend our ways and doings. And God expects we ſhould all in our places endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or a reformation, that we ſhould do our part in this work: and if we do ſo, whatever be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, God will ſet a mark upon us, and our labor ſhall not be in vain in the Lord. Let not any then be diſcouraged, becauſe ſome proper eſſays and noble efforts have miſcaried and proved abortive. Neceſſity is laid upon us: New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land muſt reform, or without a ſpirit of prophecy any one that obſerves the ſigns of the times, may I think, evidently foreſee, that in one twenty Years more the glory of New-England as New-England, will be much more than hitherto, if not totally Eclipſed. God in his infinite, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign mercy, prevent it!</p>
            <p>But then, our ſoldiers that are fit to go forth to war, and may probably be called forth, you my brethren in an eſpecial manner are obliged to take the alarm given you by the late Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Be prevailed with if you have not yet done ſo, to caſt away the weapons of your rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt Heaven, (for there is no making peace ſword in hand) and come as with ropes about your necks, and lie in the duſt, if there may be hope; and there is hope in Iſrael con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you. Now is your time to make ready for Death. You will have other work to do,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036392_0057_1009E295356D9CC0"/>
when engaged in battle. And beſides, every battle of the Warrior is with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood: hearing the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous yellings and ejaculations of the Enemy, and the groanings of deadly wounded men, &amp; ſeeing them lie all bathed in their gore, may awaken you to cry to God and make your vows: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, that is no time for conſideration, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and deliberate reſolution to forſake ſin and return to God. This ſhould be done now! &amp; then as you ſhould be excited by this awakning providence to yield yourſelves to the Lord; to make haſt and not delay to believe in Chriſt, &amp; ſecure an intereſt in him: ſo, you ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to ſee that you have good arms and kept in good order, with good ſtore of ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; inure yourſelves to military exerciſes, eſpecially to the art of ſhooting, &amp; be always ready, that you may iſſue out at an hour's warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many and great are the tranſgreſſions of the people of our land; as a people, great has been and is our backſliding from the ways of God's teſtimonies; we have revolted from our God more and more; theſe things are for a lamentation, and call for an amendment of our evil doings—To conclude, when the ſword of the enemy is reeking with the blood of our brave countrymen, the ſurvivors ſhould cleave wholly

to the Lord, that ſo his anger may be turned away from us, and the ſword of the enemy be no more the ſcourge of our land; O may God haſten the time when the alarm of war ſhall no more be heard in our land; but that the people thereof may fit in ſafety every one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own vine and figtree, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude from any quarter.</hi>
