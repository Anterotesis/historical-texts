            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

With the same view, I here present you, with a real Model; not as the Standard of Perfection; for that, like the Beauty of Bodies, is not to be discovered in any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; but as an Exemplar of the happy Combination of many of those Moral Beauties, which constitute the perfect Character.

            <p>IS there a Å¿pectacle under Heaven, Å¿o intereÅ¿ting to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, as that of a free and numerous people putting on the enÅ¿igns of mourning, and with one accord, pouring forth their Å¿orrows for the loÅ¿s, they have Å¿uÅ¿tained in the death of a beloved and honored Fellow-Citizen? Such, is the Å¿pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, which America this day preÅ¿ents. Glorious Å¿pectacle! Glorious to humanity, which has diÅ¿played virtues capable of exciting Å¿uch univerÅ¿al, Å¿uch heart-felt veneration and love. Glorious to you, citizens of America, who thus honour your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves by evincing the high value you entertain for exalted merit.â€”Great God! On this day, whoÅ¿e riÅ¿ing Å¿un, we, of late, hailed with joyful acclamations, as uÅ¿hering in the morn, which gave birth to the illuÅ¿trious WASHINGTON, but which now, Å¿ad emblem of all things human, is Å¿et apart to bewail his loÅ¿s, and to retrace the energies of his departed Å¿oul;â€”on this day of woe, permit me to expreÅ¿s the conÅ¿olation, which Å¿uch a triumph of virtue excites within my heart. I behold a young, but enlightened people teÅ¿tifying, with one voice, their Å¿incere devotion to virtue; I Å¿ee the flame of an ardent love for what is truly great and good, burÅ¿ting forth from every boÅ¿om; I Å¿ee a people, but juÅ¿t beginning to move in their political orbit, giving the Å¿ureÅ¿t teÅ¿timony, that the love of virtue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the breaÅ¿t of every citizen, and that they poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s a force, which will retain them throughout their long career, in the path of Å¿ocial felicity, and Å¿ocial greatneÅ¿s. I Å¿ee, from this principle, this Å¿incere love of virtue, the future glories of my country already to commence. It will be, if preÅ¿erved in all its Å¿trength, the Å¿hield of liberty, the protecting Angel of the republics of this weÅ¿tern world; it will render them for ever illuÅ¿trious for patriotiÅ¿m, for heroic deeds, for arts and for Å¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. It is thus that they will defy the decrepitude of old age; it is thus, that they will be perpetually renovated in youth; and under the guidance of thy Providence, O God! It is thus, they will Å¿hew to the aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed world, that the love of virtue has Å¿natched from death, amid his dread conqueÅ¿ts, one victory more. May this love be ever cheriÅ¿hed with a holy zeal! May it ever be the diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing characteriÅ¿tic of Americans, to pay to it the homage, which is due. May this day ever Å¿erve to recall the bright example of a WASHINGTON; and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037876_0004_100F5F60EDA326B8"/>
to renew, in the hearts of Å¿ucceeding generations, that love for virtue which animates the preÅ¿ent.</p>
            <p>Ah! My friends and fellow-citizens, I am Å¿enÅ¿ible of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of addreÅ¿Å¿ing you, upon this mournful occaÅ¿ion, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner correÅ¿pondent to your feelings. But the love of my country, veneration for thoÅ¿e rare qualities which dignify and ennoble man, and which diffuÅ¿e Å¿uch bleÅ¿Å¿ings throughout Å¿ociety; and above all, the invitations of religion, give to me a momentary confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. ThoÅ¿e virtues which once animated the heroes of America in the day of battle, now animate the miniÅ¿ter of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of truth and of juÅ¿tice.â€”It is true, that genius and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence have already exerted their powers in calling to memory the Å¿plendid talents, the meritorious actions of the deceaÅ¿ed; and that they have depicted them with a glow of colouring, which I dare not attempt; but, the Å¿ubject can never become trite, it can never be exhauÅ¿ted. Let us then endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e qualities, which diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed our deceaÅ¿ed fellow-citizen, as the hero, the patriot and the Å¿age; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view Å¿ome of the important Å¿cenes through which he paÅ¿Å¿ed; and let us Å¿earch, for the grief we feel in his loÅ¿s, a conÅ¿olati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the recital of the wonders of his life. It is a cuÅ¿tom wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all free Å¿tates, and which the moÅ¿t celebrated in antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty religiouÅ¿ly obÅ¿erved, to be mindful of their anceÅ¿tors, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol them with merited panegyricks, and to honor them on Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions as the preÅ¿ent; that by doing juÅ¿tice to the actions of the dead, they may excite the virtues of the living.</p>
            <p>If indeed, the illuÅ¿trious WASHINGTON, whom all Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca deplores, and whom the whole civilized world will honor with their eulogies, had obtained only that celebrity, which extraordinary talents in war, in arts and Å¿ciences, or in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics confer; if he had not been diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed for his firm adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the truths of religion; if he had not Å¿erved his God with a zeal worthy of his Å¿uperior underÅ¿tanding, however full of glory he might have been in the eyes of man, religion could not have added her voice to the general plaudit. But religion joins in the univerÅ¿al woe; Å¿he weeps over the tomb of WASHINGTON, great in arms, great in peace, great in piety; and amidÅ¿t her Å¿orrows, feels a gleam of conÅ¿olation in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his eulogium.</p>
            <p>I. With the life of WASHINGTON is connected a new aera in the hiÅ¿tory of man. He Å¿eems to have been called forth by Heaven, as the inÅ¿trument of eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing principles, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in Å¿ocial happineÅ¿s, and which muÅ¿t and will pervade the civilized world.</p>

When young he was trained to hardihood and to arms; he was educated in the Å¿chool of war, and thus prepared for that mighty conflict, which Å¿hook the pillars of a diÅ¿tant throne. The government which nurÅ¿ed the youthful warrior, nurÅ¿ed a SampÅ¿on, who was one day to break its fetters, and burÅ¿t it's cords aÅ¿under. Virginia Å¿aw in her youthful Å¿on traits of that character, which was to become the admiration of the world; the morning of his life gave the well founded hope, that the meridian of his day would Å¿hine with augmented luÅ¿tre, and that his Å¿etting Å¿un would leave a long tract of glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.â€”Great talents Å¿oon manifeÅ¿t themÅ¿elves by the force with which they take their direction. David, when a youth, Å¿ought out the lion and the bear as Å¿ubjects for his valour, and voluntarily joined himÅ¿elf to the armies of IÅ¿rael to be inÅ¿truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the arts of war. WASHINGTON Å¿ought out the warrior of the wilderneÅ¿s, and at an early age, provoked his courage and his Å¿tratagems.<note n="*" place="bottom">GENERAL WASHINGTON was born on the 22d of February 1732, N. S. When a youth, he was entered a midÅ¿hipman, on board a BritiÅ¿h veÅ¿Å¿el of war; but relinquiÅ¿hed his nautical views, in conÅ¿equence of the entreaties of his friends. Before he attained his twentieth year, he was appointed Adjutant of one of the three diÅ¿tricts, into which Virginia was then divided, with the rank of Major. In his 21Å¿t year, he was Å¿ent by Governor Dinwiddie, with plenary powers to examine into the encroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reported to have been made by the French and Indians, on the Frontiers of Virginia; to treat with the latter, and to warm the former againÅ¿t future aggreÅ¿Å¿ions. His journal and report to the Governor have been publiÅ¿hed. The next year, 1754, he was appointed Colonel of a Regiment, raiÅ¿ed for the defence of the Frontiers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he Å¿ignalized himÅ¿elf at Fort-NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, by a Å¿ally, in which he defeated an army much Å¿uperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to his own. In 1755, he acted as Aid-de-Camp, to General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, and attended him in that capacity in the battle, in which he fell. Not an officer, whoÅ¿e duty obliged him to be mounted that day, except Colonel WASHINGTON, eÅ¿caped death or wounds. The conducting of the retreat devolved upon him; it was effected with a judgment, which acquired him a high reputation, both in Great-Britain, and America. Such was the fatigue he underwent in the day of action, and the Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding night, that he was obliged, the next morning, to be Å¿upported on his horÅ¿e with cuÅ¿hions.â€”The government of Virginia, Å¿oon after this period, gave him the command of all the troops raiÅ¿ed, and to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The fatal battle in which Braddock fell, was only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to thoÅ¿e torrents of blood, which flowed from the conteÅ¿t of two vaÅ¿t, but rival powers. WASHINGTON, now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of all the forces raiÅ¿ed in Virginia, continued the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of military glory, which he had Å¿o happily commenced, until his conÅ¿titution, naturally Å¿trong and robuÅ¿t, became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated, by inceÅ¿Å¿ant fatigue, and the unuÅ¿ual hardÅ¿hip to which he was expoÅ¿ed. He was thus compelled to retire from the Å¿ervice of his country, attended with the Å¿incere regret of all his companions in arms. But this retirement was only a preparation for the auguÅ¿t theatre, upon which he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to appear. It would be delightful, could we attend him in this retirement; could we here trace out the Å¿teps which his philoÅ¿ophic mind purÅ¿ued in the acquiÅ¿ition of uÅ¿eful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Hitherto Turenne, Malborough and Eugene, had been his preceptors. I know with what ardency in the early Å¿tage of his life, he followed them thro' every campaign, retraced their battles, and thus Å¿erved under thoÅ¿e illuÅ¿trious men. WASHINGTON has often been Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to have made, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus, a Fabius or an Emilius his prototype. I believe, that he was himÅ¿elf deÅ¿tined to be a high example to mankind, and that the native Å¿trength of his own mind Å¿oated above imitation; but Å¿till it is probable, that his knowledge in tactics was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfected during this period of retirement, by cultivating an acquaintance with the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed commanders of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern times. Nor can it be doubted, that politics, the true principles of all lawful governments, and eÅ¿pecially the rights and intereÅ¿ts of America, often occupied his active and penetrating mind. No one had a firmer hold of the chain of cauÅ¿es and effects. No one Å¿aw with more clearneÅ¿s, the aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing progreÅ¿s of America, in population and in wealth; or better knew how to eÅ¿timate the operating cauÅ¿es. Perhaps his eagle eye Å¿aw, that this vaÅ¿t continent could not long revolve round a Å¿mall Å¿pot in the ocean. But, whatever may have been the pre-Å¿entiment of his mind, it is certain, that in this retirement, he cultivated all thoÅ¿e Å¿ocial virtues, which attach man to man, and faithfully diÅ¿charged thoÅ¿e duties which a good citizen owes to his country; nor is it leÅ¿s certain, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, without interruption, the active friend of religion, and at no time forgetful of his God.</p>

During this retirement, a blind policy was preparing the way for an event the moÅ¿t important in the annals of the world. It is wonderful to conÅ¿ider, how often the agency of cauÅ¿es, which men put in motion, produce reÅ¿ults the moÅ¿t oppoÅ¿ite to their intentions, and which baffle all calculation. Ambition forms her plans of Å¿ubjugation, and anticipates her triumphs; but, they are controuled by an all wiÅ¿e and over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; inÅ¿tead of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and miÅ¿ery, there often Å¿pring forth liberty, Å¿ocial order and Å¿ocial happineÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>That war, in which WASHINGTON had taken his firÅ¿t leÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons in the military art was concluded, in the year '61. The proÅ¿perity of the American colonies had continued to flow with a quick current amid all the devaÅ¿tations of war. The progreÅ¿s of population, of commerce, of improvement in the moÅ¿t uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all arts, agriculture, had received an impulÅ¿e, which could not be reÅ¿trained. An enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿tic affection for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-country had taken deep root. The Å¿ons of America had fought and conquered with the armies of Britain. Their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and their intereÅ¿ts had been interwoven with new Å¿trength during the hour of danger and the triumphs of victory. But the tide of affection did not long continue at the height to which at had riÅ¿en. An attempt in '64, to tax America, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unconÅ¿titutional and incompatible with political liberty, arouÅ¿ed the vigilance of the colonies.</p>
            <p>At this criÅ¿is, obÅ¿erve, fellow-citizens, Virginia firÅ¿t Å¿aw the lurking poiÅ¿on, and firÅ¿t dared to propoÅ¿e the firÅ¿t American CongreÅ¿s that ever met. At her requeÅ¿t it met at New-York in '65. By the wiÅ¿dom and the firmneÅ¿s of that CongreÅ¿s, the particular meaÅ¿ure, which had excited Å¿uch irritation in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, was abandoned. But the abandonment was attended with a declaration, that the right of Britain to bind America by laws and Å¿tatutes, was unlimited, or extended to all caÅ¿es whatever. An aÅ¿Å¿umption of power, Å¿o big with diÅ¿grace and ruin, was viewed by America with horror and indignation. In vain did reaÅ¿on and eloquence, on both Å¿ides of the Atlantic, demonÅ¿trate and deplore the calamities, which would enÅ¿ue from an attempt to enforce this aÅ¿Å¿umed right. It was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.â€”The patriotiÅ¿m of BoÅ¿ton foiled the attempt, and whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inÅ¿idious bait in the briny deep. Infatuated councils Å¿aw not, that an obÅ¿tinate perÅ¿everance in this mad Å¿yÅ¿tem of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ambition, would give to the world an example the moÅ¿t inÅ¿tructive; an example which would rouÅ¿e nations from their lethargy, Å¿hew to them their own Å¿trength, teach them thoÅ¿e
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037876_0008_100F5F6BF3238998"/>
primeval rights which men hold only from nature's charter, and awake the Å¿pirit to vindicate them.â€”Then was the voice of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heard. Then was heard the thunder of that eloquence, which Å¿hook this continent. His great Å¿oul, burning with the concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered rays of wiÅ¿dom and of patriotiÅ¿m, firÅ¿t proclaimed the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated treaÅ¿on againÅ¿t the majeÅ¿ty of the people. Immortal Locke! Thine was the glory to arm the orator with the Å¿acred panoply of truth. Nor to him alone were thy energies confined. Thy hallowed page dear to liberty, to virtue, and to religion, Å¿hed intellectual light over this weÅ¿tern world, and taught a leÅ¿Å¿on congenial to the firÅ¿t Å¿entiments of man. The American mind too, nurÅ¿ed in the boÅ¿om of independence, Å¿purned any other controul than that which was founded on legitimate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. At this eventful criÅ¿is, Virginia again Å¿tood fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t in the cauÅ¿e of liberty. Like another Athens watching over the Å¿afety of all Greece, and inÅ¿piring courage by her councils, Virginia firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ed a CongreÅ¿s of the different Å¿tatesâ€”</p>
            <p>It met. A dreadful appeal to Heaven drew near. A day of mourning and interceÅ¿Å¿ion was appointed, and obÅ¿erved with an awful Å¿olemnity. "God! Give the people one heart and one mind, firmly to oppoÅ¿e every invaÅ¿ion of American rights," was the prayer then enjoined and addreÅ¿Å¿ed to the throne of grace. In vain were the reaÅ¿onings and the entreaties of that auguÅ¿t AÅ¿Å¿embly of Å¿tateÅ¿men, patriots and heroes who were now conÅ¿ulting for the general intereÅ¿ts of America, and who Å¿o eminently diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed themÅ¿elves for their moderation, their firmneÅ¿s and their wiÅ¿dom. WhoÅ¿e breaÅ¿t is Å¿o callous as not to be touched with the noble Å¿entiments, the profound reaÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the manly energetic Å¿tyle, the Å¿acred ardor in the cauÅ¿e of liberty which have immortalized their records. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to all generations, and will remain for ever, monuments of human genius and human virtue. Virginia Å¿aw that the moment had arrived, when the rights of freemen, Heaven's Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred gift, were to be yielded or defended with a courage wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Å¿uch a prize. "To die Å¿he Å¿aid, is common to all, but to die bravely is peculiar to few. Let us not then regard our lives as what properly belongs to us, but by expoÅ¿ing them for the public cauÅ¿e, let us acquire a renown which Å¿hall be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and truly our own. Let us again prove, that an handful of freemen contending for their rights, is more powerful than a hoÅ¿t, numerous as the Å¿ands of the Å¿ea, laboring with infamy to infringe them."â€”A third time Å¿he roÅ¿e in all the Å¿trength of liberty, and firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ed the declaration of Independence.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037876_0009_100F5F6D77C3DD18"/>
Nay, Å¿he alone, with a patriotic courage, which aÅ¿toniÅ¿hes even at this day, took the bold reÅ¿olution to Å¿ever herÅ¿elf from Britain, and to meet every danger in defence of her rights. The great council of America, Å¿oon Å¿aw the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of a Å¿imilar deciÅ¿ion.â€”America, be thou Independent; take thy place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations of the earth, was the high decree. Nor let it be forgot, that the voice of WASHINGTON, Å¿anctioned the decree.â€”To arms, to arms, re-echoed throughout the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. At this awful moment, when the Å¿word was to reek with kindred blood, what were the agonizing pangs which wrung every heart!â€”Ah! Ye whom the hand of Providence hath Å¿till preÅ¿erved to this day, ye can tell; ye can recall the memory of times, which tried men's Å¿ouls. But the Å¿pirit of America, like the daring eagle, mounted as the Å¿torm advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, pierced the thick clouds with inbred lightning fraught, and from aloft, beheld the promiÅ¿ed land of liberty and peace. It was then, America hailed WASHINGTON, as her conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor through the tempeÅ¿ts of war. Like the choÅ¿en leader of the IÅ¿raelites, repoÅ¿ing in his God, he obeyed the voice. To him it was ever Å¿acred. But what were his feelings at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! The Å¿ea of troubles through which he muÅ¿t paÅ¿s, lay before him.â€”On one Å¿ide, he Å¿aw vaÅ¿t Å¿uperiority in numbers, wealth unbounded, luÅ¿t of domination inÅ¿atiable, armies inured to war and to conqueÅ¿t, fleets which waved their triumphant banners over the ocean, and which vexed with their prows, the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tant Å¿eas; on the other, he Å¿aw a people thinly Å¿cattered over an extenÅ¿ive continent, without arms, without funds, without a regular government to concenter their force, without fleets, with no other allies, than their own courage, their virtuous oaths, their love of liberty, and their confidence in the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of their cauÅ¿e.â€”But, ardent in the defence of the rights of his country, animated with the true Å¿pirit of exalted patriotiÅ¿m, he emplored the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of Heaven, and haÅ¿tened to the poÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿igned him. Never was there one more perilous. Never was there one, which Å¿o called for all thoÅ¿e great qualities of the Å¿oul, which command the admiration of the world. Never was there a truÅ¿t repoÅ¿ed, on which depended iÅ¿Å¿ues Å¿o momentous. On the wiÅ¿dom, the integrity, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the fortitude of one man, hung the deÅ¿tiny of this wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern world. True glory is always modeÅ¿t and Å¿imple. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the noble principle of obedience to the will of his country, could have induced him, to accept Å¿uch a truÅ¿t, or to appear as the chief vindicator of American liberty. His mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity

was no leÅ¿s evinced by not declining the immenÅ¿e weight of the office to which he had been called, than his diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereÅ¿tedneÅ¿s was, by a refuÅ¿al to accept any pecuniary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ation during the war.</p>
            <p>No Å¿ooner had he arrived at the American army, than he diffuÅ¿ed order through every department. The Å¿ame greatneÅ¿s of Å¿oul, which attended him throughout the war, manifeÅ¿ted it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf in the wiÅ¿dom of his firÅ¿t arrangements, and the meaÅ¿ures which he took to expel the enemy from BoÅ¿ton. SucceÅ¿s crowned his efforts. But trials, which might have Å¿haken the Å¿oul of a JoÅ¿hua, a Maccabeus, or an Epaminond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, now await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.â€”An hoÅ¿tile army, the moÅ¿t formidable in numbers, in diÅ¿cipline, in all the apparatus of war, commanded by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, brave, Å¿killful and enterpriÅ¿ing, had landed on our Å¿hores. It was now, that the horrors of war were to rage in all their fury, and the plains of America, to be drenched with human blood. Ah! Soon did thoÅ¿e horrors commence. Misfortune, for a long time, hovered round the banners of America. In vain did patriotiÅ¿m animate troops half diÅ¿ciplined, half armed, and inferior in number. From Long-IÅ¿land, from New-York and through the JerÅ¿ies, diÅ¿comfiture attended the American arms. Yet, amid theÅ¿e defeats, a courage was diÅ¿played, which was worthy of the firÅ¿t efforts of men Å¿truggling in the cauÅ¿e of humanity. Full many a hoary Father wept the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fate of his gallant Å¿on. Full many a widowed matron was left the Å¿ad monument of woe. Fathers, Mothers, Wives, ye too, tender babes, whoÅ¿e tongues had juÅ¿t learned to liÅ¿p a Father's name, your virtuous tears flowed not in vain. They plead with Angel eloquence in their country's cauÅ¿e. Heaven itÅ¿elf Å¿aw and pitied the Å¿ufferings, and the impending dangers of America.â€”Driven from Long-IÅ¿land beyond the Delaware, his army reduced to a few brave and faithful com-patriots, deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence and diÅ¿may marked every countenance, except that of WASHINGTON. Superior to events, which Å¿eemed more than Å¿ufficient to Å¿hake the Å¿touteÅ¿t hearts, they Å¿erved only to arouÅ¿e, and to call forth the Å¿trength of WASHINGTON's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. It was in this criÅ¿is of weakneÅ¿s, of deÅ¿pondency and diÅ¿may, when the rigour of winter Å¿eemed to oppoÅ¿e inÅ¿urmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table obÅ¿tacles, when the Å¿pirit of Delaware's angry flood, Å¿hrieked loud, and threatened deÅ¿truction, that WASHINGTON, attended by a few faithful heroes, formed the bold reÅ¿olution to defy every difficulty, to croÅ¿s the enraged flood, to attack the victorious foe, and to Å¿natch from him, an Immortal Victory,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037876_0011_100F5F71658AE6A0"/>
in the midÅ¿t of his triumphs. The deÅ¿ign was formed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with a celerity, a judgment and a fortitude, which was crowned with complete Å¿ucceÅ¿s.â€”This was the firÅ¿t moment that preÅ¿ented the poÅ¿Å¿ibility of victory. It was Å¿eized. The bold and gallant achievement aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed the enemy, revived the American Å¿pirit, and opened the door to Å¿till greater enterpriÅ¿e.

               </gap>ry. WASHINGTON, returned to Trenton, where he had juÅ¿t acquired Å¿o much glory. The active enemy, breathing revenge for their late misfortune, haÅ¿ten alÅ¿o to the Å¿ame place, and arrive on the Å¿ame evening, with a force greatly Å¿uperior. The Å¿etting Å¿un beheld Trenton containing the two hoÅ¿tile armies, Å¿eparated only by a Å¿mall Å¿tream. What a criÅ¿is! The returning light of the next morn, threatened a period to the hopes of America. DeÅ¿truction or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity Å¿eemed inevitable. Scarce could the brave Å¿ons of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica refrain from cenÅ¿uring the raÅ¿hneÅ¿s of their commander. They caÅ¿t their eyes upon each other, upon their arms, and upon their country. "The Å¿coffs of the conquerors; their haughty looks, when diÅ¿armed, they Å¿hould be led through the hoÅ¿tile lines," the loathÅ¿ome jail, or the murderous priÅ¿on-Å¿hip, all aroÅ¿e before their eyes. One conÅ¿olation remained. They could die in defence of their country.â€”But the Genius of WASHINGTON, ever invigorated by difficulties, here diÅ¿play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its native force. A Å¿ituation Å¿o perilous, was to him only the means of acquiring new glory. A retreat would have been ignominious, a battle, fatal. See the event. At the return of day, a moment which his enemy had Å¿o anxiouÅ¿ly anticipatedâ€”WASHINGTON, was a conqueror, on the plains of Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. He who appeared deÅ¿tined to certain captivity, was thundering upon his enemy in a diÅ¿tant quarter, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new laurels. I do not Å¿ay, that this exploit was worthy of the Å¿agacity of an Hannibal, or the wiÅ¿dom of a Scipio. It was worthy of WASHINGTON; it will be it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf an example to Å¿ucceeding ages, and will forever retain the full verdure of glory. A kind Providence forwarded in an aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing manner, an enterprize the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed for that quickneÅ¿s of penetration, which enables great minds to convert circumÅ¿tances, apparently the moÅ¿t in-auÅ¿picious, into Å¿uch as are moÅ¿t favorable. This brilliant victory evinced the deep reÅ¿ources of WASHINGTO'NS mind, and excited the univerÅ¿al admiration and applauÅ¿e of a people who loved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him; whilÅ¿t his enemy Å¿aw, and had the generoÅ¿ity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the pre-eminence of talents, Å¿o dangerous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037876_0012_100F5F7550B91CD8"/>
but Å¿o invaluable to his country. Can we look back with cold indifference upon events Å¿o recent, at which the American heart once rebounded with joy, felt the full debt of gratitude to Heaven, and fervently expreÅ¿Å¿ed that gratitude in praiÅ¿e and thankÅ¿giving?â€”Can we forget the man, whom Heaven Å¿elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the inÅ¿trument of its loving kindneÅ¿s towards us? No! Sooner Å¿hall gratitude ceaÅ¿e to be a virtue; Å¿ooner Å¿hall the love and admiration of heroic deeds, of all thoÅ¿e exalted talents which give dignity to man, be obliterated from the human breaÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Thus did a campaign, which in its beginning, threatened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional Å¿ubjugation, in it's end, preÅ¿ent a proÅ¿pect the moÅ¿t animating and conÅ¿olatory to the friends of liberty. The cauÅ¿e of America had now attracted the attention of the world. Her armies had evinced a Å¿pirit worthy of Å¿uch a cauÅ¿e; her enemies had been compelled to retrace their path of victory; whilÅ¿t WASHINGTON, tranquil in danger, Å¿ure in council, Å¿uperior in his views and reÅ¿ources, had acquired the unbounded love, veneration and confidence of his fellow Å¿oldiers, had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reÅ¿pect of his enemies, and proved that he was worthy of the high truÅ¿t committed to him. It was this love, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, this confidence, daily increaÅ¿ing, as his talents and his virtues, were more and more developed which formed the treaÅ¿ury of America. Yes, ye brave and virtuous defenders of your country, ye companions of the illuÅ¿trious WASHINGTON, I call you to witneÅ¿s, that amid all your Å¿ufferings, this devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your chief was your bond of union, your Å¿upport, and your reward, whether ye lay contented on the frozen earth, or marked your way by the blood-Å¿tained ground on which ye trod, or caught in haÅ¿te a Å¿canty morÅ¿el, Å¿till, amidÅ¿t all your privations, your attachment to your commander, founded on the juÅ¿t admiration of his heroic virtues, Å¿upported you in every trial, conÅ¿oled you under every difficulty, and animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with a patriotic enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿m in the day of battle. This command of the affections of brave and virtuous men, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the heart of every Å¿oldier, thisun bounded vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for their chief, whilÅ¿t it forms the greateÅ¿t glory of a general, converts each Å¿oldier into a hero. He Å¿eizes, as an example for himÅ¿elf, the great model which his general exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. His temperance, his Å¿elf command in the heat of battle, his patience in Å¿ufferings, his prudence, his magnanimity, his ardent patriotiÅ¿m, infuÅ¿e themÅ¿elves into every breaÅ¿t, give an elevation to the mind, a dignity, a confidence, a Å¿pirit, which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037876_0013_100F5F76D54BB0D0"/>
converts man into a new being, communicates to every power a new energy, and creates a force wonderful and irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible. Such was the agency of WASHINGTON's Genius. It poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a creative power, which aÅ¿Å¿imilated every thing to itÅ¿elf; or, which called forth in others, talents they felt not before. His very preÅ¿ence inÅ¿pired fortitude. No one approached him, but felt the Å¿pirit of heroiÅ¿m transfuÅ¿ed into his boÅ¿om. I think I Å¿ee at this moment, the brave Å¿oldier, as he paÅ¿Å¿es, hail him as his Father, Friend and Champion; I think I Å¿ee him, riÅ¿e to redeem his country, exult in his martial exerciÅ¿e, and with a holy fervency calling down bleÅ¿Å¿ings on his commander's honored head, pant again to fight for freedom, or for freedom die.</p>
            <p>But if WASHINGTON had hitherto diÅ¿covered talents won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully great in Å¿eizing with promtitude, the firÅ¿t avenues to Å¿ucceÅ¿s, or of profiting from the Å¿malleÅ¿t inadvertence of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, deÅ¿ervedly high in military eÅ¿timation; the time had now arrived, when the caution of a Fabius, or rather, a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿o peculiar to himÅ¿elf, was to be diÅ¿played. His inferiority in numbers, and in all the equipments of war, compelled him to take a poÅ¿ition on the Å¿trong grounds of MorriÅ¿town. It is doubtful whether he manifeÅ¿ted greater talents as a commander, in this Å¿ituation, or in thoÅ¿e Å¿cenes of brilliant action which we have juÅ¿t mentioned. No one knew better the value of that golden curb, which diÅ¿cretion hangs on bravery. A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral engagement, which the enemy Å¿o ardently Å¿olicited, would, in all probability, have extinguiÅ¿hed for ever the bright flame of liberty. To the invading army, procraÅ¿tination was defeat. In vain did the impetuoÅ¿ity of the American councils urge him to battle. Nothing could move the Å¿oul of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, but the Å¿pirit of wiÅ¿dom, which ever calm and Å¿erene, had determined him now to be content with checking the movements of the enemy, and to maintain a war of caution. It was this caution, Å¿o full of prudence and military Å¿kill, which, continually baffling the deÅ¿igns of the enemy, compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to embark, and to attempt to gain Philadelphia by Å¿ea. The attempt forced WASHINGTON from his Å¿trong poÅ¿ts. The battle of Brandy-wine enÅ¿ued. The value of our troops was unÅ¿haken, but the event was not fortunate for the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can arms. There are caÅ¿ualties, which human prudence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always controul, but upon which, the iÅ¿Å¿ues of battles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten depend. One of theÅ¿e occurred. A falÅ¿e intelligence prevented the execution of a deÅ¿ign, the moÅ¿t bold in its
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037876_0014_100F5F79364F2AF0"/>
nature; but Å¿o admirably planned, that had an attempt been made to carry it into effect, victory, and not defeat, would have been the reÅ¿ult. Nor were the actions of German-town, and of Monmouth leÅ¿s Å¿ignalized for the Å¿kill of the general, and the valor of his troops, than for thoÅ¿e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward events which defeated their hopes. WASHINGTON had not always the glory of Å¿ucceÅ¿s; but he had the glory of appearing to deÅ¿erve it. The wiÅ¿dom of his meaÅ¿ures was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubted; Å¿ucceÅ¿s, O God! Depends upon thy Providence.</p>
            <p>But, Fellow-Citizens, we Å¿hould not do juÅ¿tice to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, or the virtues of WASHINGTON, were we to confine our view to thoÅ¿e Å¿cenes only in which he himÅ¿elf was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal actor. During the progreÅ¿s of a war, which raged from the frozen walls of Quebec to the burning Å¿ands of Savannah, the penetrating eye of WASHINGTON Å¿aw every movement; his comprehenÅ¿ive mind took in the vaÅ¿t whole; his councils were received as the monitions of an oracle; whilÅ¿t, from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Å¿prung up heroes in every quarter. The enemy had Å¿oon, every where, if not a WASHINGTON to contend with, at leaÅ¿t one who gloried in following the exalted model. His knowlege of human nature gave him the command of talents where-ever they appeared; whilÅ¿t his magnanimity rendered him always the firÅ¿t to announce the merit of others, and to participate in their triumphs. WhoÅ¿e boÅ¿om glows with the virtuous pride of being a citizen of America, and remembers not the gallantry of Greene, at Red-Bank; or the noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Smith at Mud-IÅ¿land? Who bears not in vivid memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the victors of Saratoga, or him who reÅ¿cued South-Carolina from the fangs of the lion? Who calls not to mind, the brave, the virtuous, but unfortunate Fayette?â€”Thou too, lamented Mercer, Å¿halt live immortal in the memory of America. Thy wounds, received in the bloody conteÅ¿t, which preceded the revolutionary war, had already evinced thy courage and thy patriotiÅ¿m. Ah! Weltering in thy blood, abandoned in the midÅ¿t of the inhoÅ¿pitable wilderneÅ¿s, the deadly Å¿erpent thy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food; what but a kind Providence could have preÅ¿erved thee from Å¿uch perils! It did preÅ¿erve thee, long to live the delight of Å¿ociety, and to become the firm vindicator of liberty. Yes, the hand of God, preÅ¿erved thee, again to unite thy arms with WASHINGTON, and to pour forth thy gallant, but gentle Å¿oul, on the plains of Princeton, covered with glory.</p>
            <p>Would time permit, I could here, with that joy, which the love of noble deeds inÅ¿pires, trace a long line of heroes, whoÅ¿e
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037876_0015_100F5F7AC004B708"/>
names will be for ever dear to America, and whoÅ¿e energies WASHINGTON Å¿aw, combined, and thus produced a force conÅ¿tant in it's action, and irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible in it's effects. Recall the image of this illuÅ¿trious man; behold him, when not brav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dangers of the field, Å¿eated in council, deep deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on engraven on his countenance; Å¿ee him giving life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diÅ¿tant armies, and inceÅ¿Å¿antly directing every thing to the political Å¿alvation of his country. He Å¿eems another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes, Å¿itting on the Å¿hore, and moving at pleaÅ¿ure a vaÅ¿t Å¿hip, on an ocean toÅ¿Å¿ed with tempeÅ¿t, whilÅ¿t he himÅ¿elf is immoveable.</p>
            <p>A juÅ¿t eulogium of WASHINGTON requires a detail of the actions of his life. The wonderful properties the inimitable beauties of thoÅ¿e rays which enlighten and animate all nature to be Å¿een in their full luÅ¿tre, muÅ¿t be viewed Å¿eparately. This detail, this Å¿eparated view of the luminous actions of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON muÅ¿t be left to the judicious and impartial hiÅ¿torian. The time with which you have already favored me, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hes me to haÅ¿ten to that Å¿cene of glory, which Å¿till awaited our beloved fellow-citizen, and which by cloÅ¿ing the bloody drama, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, we truÅ¿t in God, for ever, pure republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿m in this weÅ¿tern world. That laÅ¿t Å¿cene was reÅ¿erved for Virginia. Her favorite Å¿on was deÅ¿tined, in her boÅ¿om, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reward of all his toils; and to finiÅ¿h in her Å¿ight, his career of military glory. I will not open wounds which are but juÅ¿t healed, I will not awake the feelings of the friend, the orphan or the parent; nor will I call to mind the accumulated diÅ¿treÅ¿s which mourned throughout this land. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to Å¿ay, that a Å¿uperior and a gallant foe, the conqueror of India, Å¿pread terror and deÅ¿olation on every Å¿ide. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON Å¿aw the deciÅ¿ive moment; he Å¿aw, that Providence had, at length, preÅ¿ented the opportunity of cloÅ¿ing the Å¿ufferings of his country. With a deciÅ¿ion; a profoundneÅ¿s of judgment, which aÅ¿toniÅ¿hes, he projected and formed with his brave and generous allies, a plan apparently the moÅ¿t difficult in its exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and which, to common apprehenÅ¿ion, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated only the feebleneÅ¿s of vanity and folly. A powerful enemy in New-York, was to be kept in a Å¿tate of alarm, for his Å¿afety; allied troops were to be aÅ¿Å¿embled at the Å¿ame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only from a diÅ¿tant quarter on the continent, but from IÅ¿lands Å¿till more remote; a fleet, which gallantly aided in the great deÅ¿ign, was to Å¿econd every movement, and to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume it's place at the appointed time; his own troops, by rapid

marches, were to enÅ¿ure their arrival at the period affixed; the militia of Virginia, proviÅ¿ions of all kinds, were to be collected. How many powers were here to be combined! What difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their arrangement! What prudence in adjuÅ¿ting means Å¿o diÅ¿cordant! What Å¿ecrecy in the execution!â€”The mind of WASHINGTON was Å¿uperior to every difficulty. The hoÅ¿tile army beheld themÅ¿elves Å¿urrounded by a force, which enÅ¿ured their captivity, before they Å¿uÅ¿pected the deÅ¿ign. Nothing more clearly evinces the Å¿trength of mind, which this extraordinary man poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed than the Å¿ure calculation which he had made of the reÅ¿ult of all his meaÅ¿ures, and alÅ¿o, of the conÅ¿equences which would attend the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of this bold, but well concerted enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Weak minds, ever vacillating, find their emblem in the AÅ¿pin's leaf. They have no center of repoÅ¿e. That of WASHINGTON was Å¿elf-poiÅ¿ed; it felt its own weight, and reÅ¿ted upon its own determinations. The Admiral of the allied forces heÅ¿itated, whether he Å¿hould keep the Å¿tation aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned to him. America Å¿hould often review the letter, which WASHINGTON wrote to him from this city. Hear it fellow citizens. "I am unable to deÅ¿cribe the painful anxiety under which I have laboured, Å¿ince the reception of your letter. It obliges me <hi>warmly</hi> to urge a perÅ¿everance in the plan agreed upon. The attempt upon York, under the protection of your Å¿hipping, is as certain of Å¿ucceÅ¿s, as a Å¿uperior force, and a Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of meaÅ¿ures can render any military operation. The capture of the BritiÅ¿h army is a matter Å¿o important in itÅ¿elf, and <hi>in it's conÅ¿equences,</hi> that it muÅ¿t greatly tend to put an end to the war." After pointing out the certain and fatal event, which would follow the removal of the allied fleet, he adds: "I earneÅ¿tly beg your Excellency to conÅ¿ider, that if by moving your fleet from the Å¿ituation agreed upon, we loÅ¿e the preÅ¿ent opportunity, we Å¿hall never hereafter have it in our power to Å¿trike Å¿o deciÅ¿ive a blow, and the period of an honorable peace will be farther diÅ¿tant than ever." He then aÅ¿Å¿ures the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that he had nothing to fear from the fleet of the enemy, however Å¿uperior, Å¿tationed as he was; and then concludes: "I am to preÅ¿s your Excellency to perÅ¿evere in the Å¿cheme Å¿o happily concerted between us."â€”This letter was the anchor of victory. WASHINGTON, with his brave allies, advanced to York. They came, they Å¿aw, they conquered.</p>
            <p>Then did America exclaim, "If God be for us, who can be againÅ¿t us." Yes, Great God, then was thy providential kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s manifeÅ¿ted; then was it felt and adored by all; but by none
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037876_0017_100F28AB707964B0"/>
with more ardor, or more humility, than by him, who had been Å¿elected as the chief inÅ¿trument in thy hands, for the eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hment of liberty in this new world. "Let Å¿aid he, Divine Service be performed to morrow, in the different Brigades and DiviÅ¿ions. The Commander in Chief recommends, that all the troops, which are not upon duty, do aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t at it with a Å¿erious deportment, and <hi>that Å¿enÅ¿ibility of heart, which the recollection of the Å¿urpriÅ¿ing and particular interpoÅ¿ition of providence in our favor claims."</hi> His thanks are then tendered to the whole army, in the warmeÅ¿t language; and let it be remembered, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of Virginia, with their Governor and General, the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the patriotic NelÅ¿on, received, in a particular manner, his Å¿incere acknowledgments of their brave and zealous co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Joy, like the rapid lightning, ran from one extremity of the continent to the other. Every houÅ¿e of public worÅ¿hip reÅ¿ound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grateful praiÅ¿es and thankÅ¿givings to the God of battles. Every heart called for bleÅ¿Å¿ings on the head of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. Every American now began to hail the glorious conÅ¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all his hopes. The vindicators of liberty now Å¿aw, that the Å¿torm which had Å¿o long deÅ¿olated their country, and deluged it with blood, was rapidly Å¿ubÅ¿iding; the horizon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to gleam around, and promiÅ¿ed the Å¿peedy effulgence of the brighteÅ¿t day, which ever illuminated this earth.</p>
            <p>That day Å¿oon arrived. It was the day which witneÅ¿Å¿ed the acknowledgment of the Freedom, the Sovereignty, and the Independence, of the different Å¿tates of America.</p>
            <p>Is the orb of WASHINGTON's glory now full? No! It is increaÅ¿ing in Å¿plendor. How many victors have found a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicon, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of the people in the air!â€”The integrity of WASHINGTON was a rock, in the midÅ¿t of the ocean, which could not be moved.â€”His patriotiÅ¿m was as firm as the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent he had Å¿aved. He was now to give another example to Å¿ucceeding ages, another proof of the reality, and the greatneÅ¿s of his virtues. By his prudence, he firÅ¿t drew off Å¿ilently the wrath of military tumult; it was an angry cloud, which might have been terrific to this country, had not WASHINGTON, like the immortal Franklin, known how to avert it's fury. No Å¿ooner had the veterans of America, unrecompenÅ¿ed as they were for all their labours and their Å¿ufferings, reÅ¿umed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of citizens, than their beloved commander repaired to

CongreÅ¿sâ€”Behold him, Fellow-Citizens, in this exalted act of patriotic duty. See him with a modeÅ¿ty and a dignity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Å¿o peculiar to himÅ¿elf, riÅ¿ing in the auguÅ¿t council of America, delivering an addreÅ¿s replete with the nobleÅ¿t Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and unrobing himÅ¿elf, of all his military authority. "Happy, Å¿aid he, in the confirmation of our Independence and Sovereignty, and pleaÅ¿ed with the opportunity afforded the United States, of becoming a reÅ¿pectable nation, I reÅ¿ign with Å¿atisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in my abilities to accompliÅ¿h Å¿o arduous a taÅ¿k; which however was Å¿uperÅ¿eded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cauÅ¿e, the Å¿upport of the Supreme power in the union, and the patrionage of Heaven."</p>
            <p>"The Å¿ucceÅ¿sful termination of the war, has verified the moÅ¿t Å¿anguine expectations; and my gratitude for the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition of Providence, and the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I have received from my countrymen, increaÅ¿es with every review of the momentous conteÅ¿t." He concludes with Å¿aying, "I conÅ¿ider it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿penÅ¿ible duty to cloÅ¿e this laÅ¿t act of my official life, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the intereÅ¿ts of our dear country to the protection of Almighty God, and thoÅ¿e who have the Å¿uperintendence of them, to his Holy keeping. Having now finiÅ¿hed the work aÅ¿Å¿igned, I retire from the great theatre of action, and bidding an affectionate farewell, to this auguÅ¿t body, under whoÅ¿e or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I have Å¿o long acted, I here offer my commiÅ¿Å¿ion, and take my leave of all the employments of public life."</p>
            <p>The thouÅ¿and emotions, which crowded upon the minds of all preÅ¿ent, rendered the Å¿cene awfully impreÅ¿Å¿ive. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer of the PreÅ¿ident was delivered with a Å¿enÅ¿ibility, which almoÅ¿t Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed utterance. It was a juÅ¿t tribute to the many virtues, military and civil of the illuÅ¿trious WASHINGTON, and deÅ¿erves to be engraved upon his tomb.</p>
            <p>The acclamations of a grateful country, the applauÅ¿e and the admiration of the world, attended him to the peaceful walks of private life. Tyranny only trembled at the leÅ¿Å¿on he had taught; a leÅ¿Å¿on, Å¿aid the PreÅ¿ident of CongreÅ¿s, equally uÅ¿eful to thoÅ¿e who inflict, and to thoÅ¿e who feel oppreÅ¿Å¿ion. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, the eloquent leÅ¿Å¿on, which he taught, cauÅ¿ed thoÅ¿e Å¿cales, with which the falÅ¿e luÅ¿tre of power had obÅ¿cured the viÅ¿ion of men, to drop from their eyes. The American revolution, like another Ananias, Å¿eems to have been Å¿ent by Heaven, to open the eyes of the univerÅ¿e.</p>

Hitherto, Fellow-Citizens, you have admired the departed, but immortal WASHINGTON, as a commander. Follow his Å¿teps Å¿till further, and you will equally admire him as the Å¿tates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the Å¿age.</p>
            <p>II. When the intereÅ¿ts of America indicated a cloÅ¿er union of thoÅ¿e Å¿overeignties, which the revolution had eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, Virginia, ever watchful over the general proÅ¿perity, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her principles, again Å¿tood foremoÅ¿t. This is the fourth time, that Å¿he firÅ¿t Å¿uggeÅ¿ted to her equals, the adoption of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures, which were eÅ¿Å¿ential to the liberties, the proÅ¿perity, and the aggrandizement of all. Great God! We thank thee, that reaÅ¿on, and not arms, is the force which hath hitherto directed the political movements of a virtuous and enlightened people. The general council which was propoÅ¿ed, met. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON was again called into the Å¿ervice of his country, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouÅ¿ly elected PreÅ¿ident of an aÅ¿Å¿embly of men, illuÅ¿trious for their talents and their patriotiÅ¿m. From this aÅ¿Å¿embly, eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the preÅ¿ent conÅ¿titution of the Federal Government. He who never Å¿olicited and office, was Å¿olicited by all America, to accept the important office of PreÅ¿ident of the United States. With what diffidence he received this teÅ¿timony of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the love and the veneration of a free and independent people, is in the memory of every one; nor is the exultation, which Å¿pread, like the break of morning light, leÅ¿s Å¿trongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected. To Å¿ee WASHINGTON again at the head of the American people, no longer clad in armour, but Å¿eated in the curule chair, giving energy to the laws of the Union, and Å¿tability to the liberty he had vindicated, watching over the intereÅ¿ts of all, harmonizing diÅ¿cordant Å¿tates, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing order and method in every department, and thus making a fair but grand experiment of the Å¿ubÅ¿erviency of the newly created go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the general happineÅ¿s, was a Å¿pectacle the moÅ¿t dignified, as well as the moÅ¿t grateful to every heart. With what aÅ¿Å¿iduity he devoted himÅ¿elf to the duties of his office; with what conÅ¿ummate prudence and judgment, he directed the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate powers entruÅ¿ted to him, to their proper ends, let the voice of his country declare. Let the policy purÅ¿ued, whilÅ¿t Europe, maddening with contention, was convulÅ¿ed to her centre; and whilÅ¿t conflicting nations were laboring to plunge this country into the whirlpool of war, teÅ¿tify the wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the magninimity and the patriotiÅ¿m of its conductor.â€”Peace with all nations, cloÅ¿e connections with none, union among ourÅ¿elves, meaÅ¿ures favorable to commercial intercourÅ¿e,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037876_0020_100F5F8769DF8738"/>
both internal and external, a militia properly organized, not extenÅ¿ive military eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hments, inÅ¿titutions to develope and to extend the powers of the intellect, and to diffuÅ¿e knowledge; TheÅ¿e were the objects which engaged his attention, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the baÅ¿is of his policy. During his adminiÅ¿tration, it is true, that parties, the concomitants of all free governments, aroÅ¿e. WASHINGTON too had his party; it was that of the public good. He was the chief magiÅ¿trate of a whole nation, and not of a part of that nation. Onward he bent his Å¿teady courÅ¿e, inflexible in the purÅ¿uit of what he deemed juÅ¿t and proper, conÅ¿cious of his own integrity, relying upon the favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and affording an example of that rare aÅ¿Å¿emblage, or rather conÅ¿tellation of virtues, which will and muÅ¿t be the admiration of ages.</p>
            <p>Was then WASHINGTON exempt from error? This I do not Å¿ay. He was a man; and conÅ¿equently had the infirmities of man. But this I do believe, and think the whole tenor of his life juÅ¿tifies the belief; that, if he did err, his errors were never intentional. Human wiÅ¿dom, and human virtue claim no higher prerogative. To Heaven only infalibility belongs. But tho' WASHINGTON may have erred, he had the merit of extracting glory even from his errors. How worthy of a great Å¿oul are the following Å¿entiments, which he delivers in his laÅ¿t AddreÅ¿s? <q>Tho', Å¿ays he, in reviewing the incidents of my adminiÅ¿tration, I am unconÅ¿cious of intentional error: I am nevertheleÅ¿s too Å¿enÅ¿ible of my defects, not to think it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I Å¿ervently beÅ¿eech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I Å¿hall alÅ¿o carry with me the hope, that my country will never ceaÅ¿e to view them with indulgence; and that forty-five years of my life having been dedicated to its Å¿ervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conÅ¿igned to oblivion, as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf muÅ¿t Å¿oon be to the manÅ¿ions of reÅ¿t.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Twice called to the preÅ¿idential office, his Fellow-Citizens waited only for the return of that day, on which they Å¿hould exerciÅ¿e the Å¿overeign right of election, again to clothe him with the Å¿ame honors. But, more anxious to enjoy the rights of a private citizen than the honors of office, wearied too with the long and laborious Å¿ervice, which had conÅ¿tantly occupied his mind, and deÅ¿irous to Å¿pend the evening of his day in domeÅ¿tic tranquility, he announced his intention of retiring. He did not however forget, that he Å¿till owed to his country an important
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037876_0021_100F5F89BA91ED50"/>
duty. This was diÅ¿charged by an addreÅ¿s worthy of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. It contains the outlines of the policy he purÅ¿ued, when in office, and which I have attempted Å¿lightly to Å¿ketch. It contains alÅ¿o, admonitions the moÅ¿t wiÅ¿e, founded on long experience and deep reflection; admonitions, which ought to be indelibly imprinted upon the mind of every American. It is the advice of the father of American liberty, no leÅ¿s illuÅ¿trious, as a Å¿tateÅ¿man and a Å¿age, than as a commander in war. America, hear this Å¿entence. "Of all the diÅ¿poÅ¿itions and habits, which tend to political proÅ¿perity, religion and morality are indiÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible Å¿upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiÅ¿m, who Å¿hould labor to Å¿ubvert thoÅ¿e great pillars of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineÅ¿s, thoÅ¿e firmeÅ¿t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician ought to reÅ¿pect and cheriÅ¿h them. A volume could not trace their connection with private and public felicity." The mind of WASHINGTON Å¿aw, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniÅ¿m without morality was a chimera; and that morality without religion was as evaneÅ¿cent as the baÅ¿eleÅ¿s fabric of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion; he Å¿aw, that the morality, the virtue which republics require, muÅ¿t have its utmoÅ¿t link faÅ¿tened to the footÅ¿tool of the throne of God.â€”May the hearts of all be open to this great truth! When WASHINGTON becomes a preacher, who will not liÅ¿ten. O! Ye who love your country, and labour for the preÅ¿ervation of her liberties; ye too, who Å¿urrendering your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to your paÅ¿Å¿ions, have Å¿acrificed your judgments to your zeal, come to this pure fountain of reaÅ¿on; it will quench your animoÅ¿ities; look into it as it flows, it will be a mirror to Å¿hew you the path to public good; it will reflect the bright image of that eternal juÅ¿tice, which ought to rule the univerÅ¿e. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, it is by the obÅ¿ervance of principles contained in this laÅ¿t addreÅ¿s, that the happineÅ¿s of the people, in theÅ¿e Å¿tates, under the auÅ¿pices of liberty, will be complete; and <hi>that</hi> free ConÅ¿titution, the work of their own hands, will be Å¿o Å¿acredly maintained and preÅ¿erved, I uÅ¿e the words of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applauÅ¿e, the affection and the adoption of every nation which is yet a Å¿tranger to it.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON retired; but he carried along with him, the Å¿entiments which a dutiful citizen ever owes to his country. Impending dangers, during, this retirement, alarmed America. WASHINGTON was again ready to protect her with his Å¿hield, and old as he was, to lead her armies to the field of battle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:037876_0022_10117008D418E9A8"/>
III. But, that we may do juÅ¿tice to WASHINGTON, as a Å¿age, and the truly good man, we muÅ¿t view him alÅ¿o in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life. When man is placed upon an elevated theatre, the eyes of the world, the glory of Å¿ucceÅ¿s, give to his Å¿oul a force, and a grandeur, which is often foreign to it. Pride borrows the Å¿entiments of virtue; we do not Å¿ee the perÅ¿on, but the perÅ¿onage. How many have acted as heroes at the head of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or appeared more than men, when conÅ¿cious that they attracted univerÅ¿al attention; and yet in the Å¿hade of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their common intercourÅ¿e with Å¿ociety, have Å¿hewn that they were leÅ¿s than men, devoid of all that real moral worth, which conÅ¿titutes human excellency. To WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the Å¿hade of retirement was as luminous as that of the moÅ¿t public theatre. It was here, that his Å¿oul, unbent, diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played all thoÅ¿e virtues, which are the ornament and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of Å¿ociety. Humane, charitable, wiÅ¿e and juÅ¿t, in every Å¿ituation, he was always conÅ¿iÅ¿tent, always equal to himÅ¿elf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways evincing, that rectitude of conduct was his Å¿overeign good. The poor found in him a guardian, genius a patron, the honeÅ¿t and the meritorious a friend; the diÅ¿Å¿olute the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the profane, always an enemy. Sincerely religious, his attendance upon the Å¿ervice of his God, was the dictate of real piety. Immutably true, he could reÅ¿pect only truth in others. It was to him, the firÅ¿t duty of man. Such his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿ty, that whilÅ¿t he was the admiration of all, he alone, like MoÅ¿es, deÅ¿cended from the mount, Å¿eemed ignorant of the light which Å¿hone around him. Such his prudence, that not a word, not an action eÅ¿caped him, which would not admit of a rational juÅ¿tification. This Å¿ingular character of reaÅ¿on accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him through life. Yes, Brethren, it was in WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, that thoÅ¿e four cardinal virtues, juÅ¿tice, prudence, temperance and fortitude, formed an union Å¿o rare, and Å¿o com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. To theÅ¿e virtues, was added an underÅ¿tanding, the moÅ¿t clear and extenÅ¿ive. His various official communications, his addreÅ¿Å¿es to his countrymen, his anÅ¿wers to the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble congratulations which he received, all of which are Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to form volumes; what ever came from his pen, whilÅ¿t it was always diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by a Å¿tyle the moÅ¿t perÅ¿picuous, the moÅ¿t Å¿trong and manly, evinced at the Å¿ame time, a vaÅ¿t mind, a Å¿uperior intellect, which could graÅ¿p every thing, and which laboured inceÅ¿Å¿antly to promote public and private felicity.</p>
            <p>Such was, in part, the illuÅ¿trious citizen, who filled Å¿o wide and Å¿o honorable a Å¿pace in the eye of America, and of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037876_0023_101170075047CD08"/>
world; and whoÅ¿e loÅ¿s a nation this day deplores. I know, that my attempts to do juÅ¿tice to his character, have fallen infinitely Å¿hort, of what your affection demanded.â€”But, I am little converÅ¿ant in the language of panegyrick. "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded honours Å¿hall gather round the monument of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, and thicken over him. It is a Å¿olid fabric, and will Å¿upport the laurels that adorn it."</p>
            <p>But Ah! Great and good as he was, the Å¿cene of mortal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿tence is cloÅ¿ed for ever. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, your belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed WASHINGTON, has finiÅ¿hed his courÅ¿e. He is gone to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before that God, in whom he truÅ¿ted, and his works have followed him. Happy moment, for thee, illuÅ¿trious Å¿hade! But afflictive to a nation, which mourns thy loÅ¿s, and which can find it's conÅ¿olation only in the rememberance of thy virtues, in an humble reÅ¿ignation to the decrees of an all-wiÅ¿e Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in it's gratitude for benefits received through thy inÅ¿trumentality. Long Å¿hall thy name be dear to thy country. Long Å¿hall the aged father, calling to his Å¿on, point to thy tomb, and bid him remember WASHINGTON; bid him recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thy virtues, and Å¿eize the patriotic flame, which once glowed within thy boÅ¿om. The tender mother too, hanging over her beloved Å¿on, Å¿hall drop the anxious tear, and hall the name of WASHINGTON; Å¿hall exclaim, O! Like him, be thou, brave, prudent, temperate and juÅ¿t. O! Be thou, like him, thy country's Å¿hield in war, it's ornament in peace. And thou, America! Incumbent as thou now art over the tomb of thy beloved citizen, mayeÅ¿t thou annually retrace his virtues, and conÅ¿ecrate his memory. May his actions be ever the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of thy emulation and thy praiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>Ah! Fellow-citizens, remember that virtue only is eÅ¿timable in the eyes of God; and that without it, republics are victims deÅ¿tined for the altars of ambition. Remember, that without juÅ¿t Å¿entiments of religion, virtue periÅ¿hes; a dreadful proÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of morals inevitably enÅ¿ues, and with that proÅ¿tration, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is gone for everâ€”Would you Å¿hoot an arrow at the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid lightning as it flies athwart the Å¿ky; or, would you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to arreÅ¿t the oceans tide, by a Å¿ingle pebble? As well might you attempt to retain virtue, the baÅ¿is of private and public happineÅ¿s, the rock of all rational government, without religion. Ah! In an age, when religion has become the Å¿port of libertiniÅ¿m, and of philoÅ¿ophiÅ¿ts; in an age, when impiety is too often conÅ¿idered as the firÅ¿t proof of brilliancy of genius; in an age, when thy religion, bleÅ¿Å¿ed JeÅ¿us! Is Å¿coffed and reviled

by thoÅ¿e who are ignorant of it; in an age, when even our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a God, has been derided by wickedneÅ¿s and folly; in Å¿uch an age, religion feels more than a momentary conÅ¿olation in embracing the tomb of WASHINGTON, and in holding him forth as another immortal example, that man in his greateÅ¿t perfection, is ever religious and faithful. O! Ye, who love your country, ye who would preÅ¿erve for yourÅ¿elves and your poÅ¿terity, republicaniÅ¿m pure and uncontaminated, again, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, be it yours to cheriÅ¿h religion, and to bear in mind the example of WASHINGTON. Ye, who yet contemn the degrading idea, that death is an eternal Å¿leep; ye, who do not reÅ¿t upon the miÅ¿erable and the dreadful hope of that deÅ¿truction, that extinction of being, at the thought of which virtue trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the Å¿oul Å¿hrinks back with horror; ye, who can look beyond the grave, and there behold regions enlightened by the eternal meridian of God's unclouded Å¿mile;â€”Regions in which piety and innocence live immortal; O! Make that God your friend. Then, like your beloved Fellow-Citizen, will you be Å¿trong in virtue, and incapable of diÅ¿may; then will you, in that awful moment, which muÅ¿t Å¿oon tear us from all the Å¿oul holds dear in this world, be enabled, like him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, "I have fought a good fight, I have finiÅ¿hed my courÅ¿e, I have kept the faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, which the Lord, the righteous judge Å¿hall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them that love his appearing."</p>
