            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IS there a ſpectacle under Heaven, ſo intereſting to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, as that of a free and numerous people putting on the enſigns of mourning, and with one accord, pouring forth their ſorrows for the loſs, they have ſuſtained in the death of a beloved and honored Fellow-Citizen? Such, is the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, which America this day preſents. Glorious ſpectacle! Glorious to humanity, which has diſplayed virtues capable of exciting ſuch univerſal, ſuch heart-felt veneration and love. Glorious to you, citizens of America, who thus honour your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by evincing the high value you entertain for exalted merit.—Great God! On this day, whoſe riſing ſun, we, of late, hailed with joyful acclamations, as uſhering in the morn, which gave birth to the illuſtrious WASHINGTON, but which now, ſad emblem of all things human, is ſet apart to bewail his loſs, and to retrace the energies of his departed ſoul;—on this day of woe, permit me to expreſs the conſolation, which ſuch a triumph of virtue excites within my heart. I behold a young, but enlightened people teſtifying, with one voice, their ſincere devotion to virtue; I ſee the flame of an ardent love for what is truly great and good, burſting forth from every boſom; I ſee a people, but juſt beginning to move in their political orbit, giving the ſureſt teſtimony, that the love of virtue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the breaſt of every citizen, and that they poſſeſs a force, which will retain them throughout their long career, in the path of ſocial felicity, and ſocial greatneſs. I ſee, from this principle, this ſincere love of virtue, the future glories of my country already to commence. It will be, if preſerved in all its ſtrength, the ſhield of liberty, the protecting Angel of the republics of this weſtern world; it will render them for ever illuſtrious for patriotiſm, for heroic deeds, for arts and for ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. It is thus that they will defy the decrepitude of old age; it is thus, that they will be perpetually renovated in youth; and under the guidance of thy Providence, O God! It is thus, they will ſhew to the aſtoniſhed world, that the love of virtue has ſnatched from death, amid his dread conqueſts, one victory more. May this love be ever cheriſhed with a holy zeal! May it ever be the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of Americans, to pay to it the homage, which is due. May this day ever ſerve to recall the bright example of a WASHINGTON; and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037876_0004_100F5F60EDA326B8"/>
to renew, in the hearts of ſucceeding generations, that love for virtue which animates the preſent.</p>
            <p>Ah! My friends and fellow-citizens, I am ſenſible of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of addreſſing you, upon this mournful occaſion, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner correſpondent to your feelings. But the love of my country, veneration for thoſe rare qualities which dignify and ennoble man, and which diffuſe ſuch bleſſings throughout ſociety; and above all, the invitations of religion, give to me a momentary confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Thoſe virtues which once animated the heroes of America in the day of battle, now animate the miniſter of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of truth and of juſtice.—It is true, that genius and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence have already exerted their powers in calling to memory the ſplendid talents, the meritorious actions of the deceaſed; and that they have depicted them with a glow of colouring, which I dare not attempt; but, the ſubject can never become trite, it can never be exhauſted. Let us then endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace ſome of thoſe qualities, which diſtinguiſhed our deceaſed fellow-citizen, as the hero, the patriot and the ſage; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view ſome of the important ſcenes through which he paſſed; and let us ſearch, for the grief we feel in his loſs, a conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the recital of the wonders of his life. It is a cuſtom wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all free ſtates, and which the moſt celebrated in antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty religiouſly obſerved, to be mindful of their anceſtors, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol them with merited panegyricks, and to honor them on ſuch occaſions as the preſent; that by doing juſtice to the actions of the dead, they may excite the virtues of the living.</p>
            <p>If indeed, the illuſtrious WASHINGTON, whom all Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca deplores, and whom the whole civilized world will honor with their eulogies, had obtained only that celebrity, which extraordinary talents in war, in arts and ſciences, or in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics confer; if he had not been diſtinguiſhed for his firm adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the truths of religion; if he had not ſerved his God with a zeal worthy of his ſuperior underſtanding, however full of glory he might have been in the eyes of man, religion could not have added her voice to the general plaudit. But religion joins in the univerſal woe; ſhe weeps over the tomb of WASHINGTON, great in arms, great in peace, great in piety; and amidſt her ſorrows, feels a gleam of conſolation in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his eulogium.</p>
            <p>I. With the life of WASHINGTON is connected a new aera in the hiſtory of man. He ſeems to have been called forth by Heaven, as the inſtrument of eſtabliſhing principles, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in ſocial happineſs, and which muſt and will pervade the civilized world.</p>

When young he was trained to hardihood and to arms; he was educated in the ſchool of war, and thus prepared for that mighty conflict, which ſhook the pillars of a diſtant throne. The government which nurſed the youthful warrior, nurſed a Sampſon, who was one day to break its fetters, and burſt it's cords aſunder. Virginia ſaw in her youthful ſon traits of that character, which was to become the admiration of the world; the morning of his life gave the well founded hope, that the meridian of his day would ſhine with augmented luſtre, and that his ſetting ſun would leave a long tract of glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.—Great talents ſoon manifeſt themſelves by the force with which they take their direction. David, when a youth, ſought out the lion and the bear as ſubjects for his valour, and voluntarily joined himſelf to the armies of Iſrael to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the arts of war. WASHINGTON ſought out the warrior of the wilderneſs, and at an early age, provoked his courage and his ſtratagems.<note n="*" place="bottom">GENERAL WASHINGTON was born on the 22d of February 1732, N. S. When a youth, he was entered a midſhipman, on board a Britiſh veſſel of war; but relinquiſhed his nautical views, in conſequence of the entreaties of his friends. Before he attained his twentieth year, he was appointed Adjutant of one of the three diſtricts, into which Virginia was then divided, with the rank of Major. In his 21ſt year, he was ſent by Governor Dinwiddie, with plenary powers to examine into the encroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reported to have been made by the French and Indians, on the Frontiers of Virginia; to treat with the latter, and to warm the former againſt future aggreſſions. His journal and report to the Governor have been publiſhed. The next year, 1754, he was appointed Colonel of a Regiment, raiſed for the defence of the Frontiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſignalized himſelf at Fort-Neceſſity, by a ſally, in which he defeated an army much ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to his own. In 1755, he acted as Aid-de-Camp, to General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, and attended him in that capacity in the battle, in which he fell. Not an officer, whoſe duty obliged him to be mounted that day, except Colonel WASHINGTON, eſcaped death or wounds. The conducting of the retreat devolved upon him; it was effected with a judgment, which acquired him a high reputation, both in Great-Britain, and America. Such was the fatigue he underwent in the day of action, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding night, that he was obliged, the next morning, to be ſupported on his horſe with cuſhions.—The government of Virginia, ſoon after this period, gave him the command of all the troops raiſed, and to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

undaunted amid ſuperior foes; ſaw him, ſnatch from an entire deſtruction the ſhattered remnant of a brave, but ill-conducted army.</p>
            <p>The fatal battle in which Braddock fell, was only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to thoſe torrents of blood, which flowed from the conteſt of two vaſt, but rival powers. WASHINGTON, now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of all the forces raiſed in Virginia, continued the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of military glory, which he had ſo happily commenced, until his conſtitution, naturally ſtrong and robuſt, became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated, by inceſſant fatigue, and the unuſual hardſhip to which he was expoſed. He was thus compelled to retire from the ſervice of his country, attended with the ſincere regret of all his companions in arms. But this retirement was only a preparation for the auguſt theatre, upon which he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to appear. It would be delightful, could we attend him in this retirement; could we here trace out the ſteps which his philoſophic mind purſued in the acquiſition of uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Hitherto Turenne, Malborough and Eugene, had been his preceptors. I know with what ardency in the early ſtage of his life, he followed them thro' every campaign, retraced their battles, and thus ſerved under thoſe illuſtrious men. WASHINGTON has often been ſuppoſed to have made, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus, a Fabius or an Emilius his prototype. I believe, that he was himſelf deſtined to be a high example to mankind, and that the native ſtrength of his own mind ſoated above imitation; but ſtill it is probable, that his knowledge in tactics was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfected during this period of retirement, by cultivating an acquaintance with the moſt diſtinguiſhed commanders of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern times. Nor can it be doubted, that politics, the true principles of all lawful governments, and eſpecially the rights and intereſts of America, often occupied his active and penetrating mind. No one had a firmer hold of the chain of cauſes and effects. No one ſaw with more clearneſs, the aſtoniſhing progreſs of America, in population and in wealth; or better knew how to eſtimate the operating cauſes. Perhaps his eagle eye ſaw, that this vaſt continent could not long revolve round a ſmall ſpot in the ocean. But, whatever may have been the pre-ſentiment of his mind, it is certain, that in this retirement, he cultivated all thoſe ſocial virtues, which attach man to man, and faithfully diſcharged thoſe duties which a good citizen owes to his country; nor is it leſs certain, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, without interruption, the active friend of religion, and at no time forgetful of his God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037876_0007_100F5F687826D120"/>
During this retirement, a blind policy was preparing the way for an event the moſt important in the annals of the world. It is wonderful to conſider, how often the agency of cauſes, which men put in motion, produce reſults the moſt oppoſite to their intentions, and which baffle all calculation. Ambition forms her plans of ſubjugation, and anticipates her triumphs; but, they are controuled by an all wiſe and over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; inſtead of oppreſſion and miſery, there often ſpring forth liberty, ſocial order and ſocial happineſs.</p>
            <p>That war, in which WASHINGTON had taken his firſt leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the military art was concluded, in the year '61. The proſperity of the American colonies had continued to flow with a quick current amid all the devaſtations of war. The progreſs of population, of commerce, of improvement in the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all arts, agriculture, had received an impulſe, which could not be reſtrained. An enthuſiaſtic affection for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-country had taken deep root. The ſons of America had fought and conquered with the armies of Britain. Their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and their intereſts had been interwoven with new ſtrength during the hour of danger and the triumphs of victory. But the tide of affection did not long continue at the height to which at had riſen. An attempt in '64, to tax America, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unconſtitutional and incompatible with political liberty, arouſed the vigilance of the colonies.</p>
            <p>At this criſis, obſerve, fellow-citizens, Virginia firſt ſaw the lurking poiſon, and firſt dared to propoſe the firſt American Congreſs that ever met. At her requeſt it met at New-York in '65. By the wiſdom and the firmneſs of that Congreſs, the particular meaſure, which had excited ſuch irritation in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, was abandoned. But the abandonment was attended with a declaration, that the right of Britain to bind America by laws and ſtatutes, was unlimited, or extended to all caſes whatever. An aſſumption of power, ſo big with diſgrace and ruin, was viewed by America with horror and indignation. In vain did reaſon and eloquence, on both ſides of the Atlantic, demonſtrate and deplore the calamities, which would enſue from an attempt to enforce this aſſumed right. It was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—The patriotiſm of Boſton foiled the attempt, and whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inſidious bait in the briny deep. Infatuated councils ſaw not, that an obſtinate perſeverance in this mad ſyſtem of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ambition, would give to the world an example the moſt inſtructive; an example which would rouſe nations from their lethargy, ſhew to them their own ſtrength, teach them thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037876_0008_100F5F6BF3238998"/>
primeval rights which men hold only from nature's charter, and awake the ſpirit to vindicate them.—Then was the voice of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heard. Then was heard the thunder of that eloquence, which ſhook this continent. His great ſoul, burning with the concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered rays of wiſdom and of patriotiſm, firſt proclaimed the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated treaſon againſt the majeſty of the people. Immortal Locke! Thine was the glory to arm the orator with the ſacred panoply of truth. Nor to him alone were thy energies confined. Thy hallowed page dear to liberty, to virtue, and to religion, ſhed intellectual light over this weſtern world, and taught a leſſon congenial to the firſt ſentiments of man. The American mind too, nurſed in the boſom of independence, ſpurned any other controul than that which was founded on legitimate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. At this eventful criſis, Virginia again ſtood fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the cauſe of liberty. Like another Athens watching over the ſafety of all Greece, and inſpiring courage by her councils, Virginia firſt propoſed a Congreſs of the different ſtates—</p>
            <p>It met. A dreadful appeal to Heaven drew near. A day of mourning and interceſſion was appointed, and obſerved with an awful ſolemnity. "God! Give the people one heart and one mind, firmly to oppoſe every invaſion of American rights," was the prayer then enjoined and addreſſed to the throne of grace. In vain were the reaſonings and the entreaties of that auguſt Aſſembly of ſtateſmen, patriots and heroes who were now conſulting for the general intereſts of America, and who ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed themſelves for their moderation, their firmneſs and their wiſdom. Whoſe breaſt is ſo callous as not to be touched with the noble ſentiments, the profound reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the manly energetic ſtyle, the ſacred ardor in the cauſe of liberty which have immortalized their records. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to all generations, and will remain for ever, monuments of human genius and human virtue. Virginia ſaw that the moment had arrived, when the rights of freemen, Heaven's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred gift, were to be yielded or defended with a courage wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſuch a prize. "To die ſhe ſaid, is common to all, but to die bravely is peculiar to few. Let us not then regard our lives as what properly belongs to us, but by expoſing them for the public cauſe, let us acquire a renown which ſhall be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and truly our own. Let us again prove, that an handful of freemen contending for their rights, is more powerful than a hoſt, numerous as the ſands of the ſea, laboring with infamy to infringe them."—A third time ſhe roſe in all the ſtrength of liberty, and firſt propoſed the declaration of Independence.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037876_0009_100F5F6D77C3DD18"/>
Nay, ſhe alone, with a patriotic courage, which aſtoniſhes even at this day, took the bold reſolution to ſever herſelf from Britain, and to meet every danger in defence of her rights. The great council of America, ſoon ſaw the neceſſity of a ſimilar deciſion.—America, be thou Independent; take thy place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations of the earth, was the high decree. Nor let it be forgot, that the voice of WASHINGTON, ſanctioned the decree.—To arms, to arms, re-echoed throughout the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. At this awful moment, when the ſword was to reek with kindred blood, what were the agonizing pangs which wrung every heart!—Ah! Ye whom the hand of Providence hath ſtill preſerved to this day, ye can tell; ye can recall the memory of times, which tried men's ſouls. But the ſpirit of America, like the daring eagle, mounted as the ſtorm advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, pierced the thick clouds with inbred lightning fraught, and from aloft, beheld the promiſed land of liberty and peace. It was then, America hailed WASHINGTON, as her conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor through the tempeſts of war. Like the choſen leader of the Iſraelites, repoſing in his God, he obeyed the voice. To him it was ever ſacred. But what were his feelings at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! The ſea of troubles through which he muſt paſs, lay before him.—On one ſide, he ſaw vaſt ſuperiority in numbers, wealth unbounded, luſt of domination inſatiable, armies inured to war and to conqueſt, fleets which waved their triumphant banners over the ocean, and which vexed with their prows, the moſt diſtant ſeas; on the other, he ſaw a people thinly ſcattered over an extenſive continent, without arms, without funds, without a regular government to concenter their force, without fleets, with no other allies, than their own courage, their virtuous oaths, their love of liberty, and their confidence in the righteouſneſs of their cauſe.—But, ardent in the defence of the rights of his country, animated with the true ſpirit of exalted patriotiſm, he emplored the aſſiſtance of Heaven, and haſtened to the poſt aſſigned him. Never was there one more perilous. Never was there one, which ſo called for all thoſe great qualities of the ſoul, which command the admiration of the world. Never was there a truſt repoſed, on which depended iſſues ſo momentous. On the wiſdom, the integrity, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the fortitude of one man, hung the deſtiny of this wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern world. True glory is always modeſt and ſimple. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the noble principle of obedience to the will of his country, could have induced him, to accept ſuch a truſt, or to appear as the chief vindicator of American liberty. His mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037876_0010_100F5F6F01137788"/>
was no leſs evinced by not declining the immenſe weight of the office to which he had been called, than his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs was, by a refuſal to accept any pecuniary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation during the war.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had he arrived at the American army, than he diffuſed order through every department. The ſame greatneſs of ſoul, which attended him throughout the war, manifeſted it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the wiſdom of his firſt arrangements, and the meaſures which he took to expel the enemy from Boſton. Succeſs crowned his efforts. But trials, which might have ſhaken the ſoul of a Joſhua, a Maccabeus, or an Epaminond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, now await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.—An hoſtile army, the moſt formidable in numbers, in diſcipline, in all the apparatus of war, commanded by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, brave, ſkillful and enterpriſing, had landed on our ſhores. It was now, that the horrors of war were to rage in all their fury, and the plains of America, to be drenched with human blood. Ah! Soon did thoſe horrors commence. Misfortune, for a long time, hovered round the banners of America. In vain did patriotiſm animate troops half diſciplined, half armed, and inferior in number. From Long-Iſland, from New-York and through the Jerſies, diſcomfiture attended the American arms. Yet, amid theſe defeats, a courage was diſplayed, which was worthy of the firſt efforts of men ſtruggling in the cauſe of humanity. Full many a hoary Father wept the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fate of his gallant ſon. Full many a widowed matron was left the ſad monument of woe. Fathers, Mothers, Wives, ye too, tender babes, whoſe tongues had juſt learned to liſp a Father's name, your virtuous tears flowed not in vain. They plead with Angel eloquence in their country's cauſe. Heaven itſelf ſaw and pitied the ſufferings, and the impending dangers of America.—Driven from Long-Iſland beyond the Delaware, his army reduced to a few brave and faithful com-patriots, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence and diſmay marked every countenance, except that of WASHINGTON. Superior to events, which ſeemed more than ſufficient to ſhake the ſtouteſt hearts, they ſerved only to arouſe, and to call forth the ſtrength of WASHINGTON's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. It was in this criſis of weakneſs, of deſpondency and diſmay, when the rigour of winter ſeemed to oppoſe inſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table obſtacles, when the ſpirit of Delaware's angry flood, ſhrieked loud, and threatened deſtruction, that WASHINGTON, attended by a few faithful heroes, formed the bold reſolution to defy every difficulty, to croſs the enraged flood, to attack the victorious foe, and to ſnatch from him, an Immortal Victory,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037876_0011_100F5F71658AE6A0"/>
in the midſt of his triumphs. The deſign was formed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with a celerity, a judgment and a fortitude, which was crowned with complete ſucceſs.—This was the firſt moment that preſented the poſſibility of victory. It was ſeized. The bold and gallant achievement aſtoniſhed the enemy, revived the American ſpirit, and opened the door to ſtill greater enterpriſe. Reinforcements ſucceeded this firſt vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ry. WASHINGTON, returned to Trenton, where he had juſt acquired ſo much glory. The active enemy, breathing revenge for their late misfortune, haſten alſo to the ſame place, and arrive on the ſame evening, with a force greatly ſuperior. The ſetting ſun beheld Trenton containing the two hoſtile armies, ſeparated only by a ſmall ſtream. What a criſis! The returning light of the next morn, threatened a period to the hopes of America. Deſtruction or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity ſeemed inevitable. Scarce could the brave ſons of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica refrain from cenſuring the raſhneſs of their commander. They caſt their eyes upon each other, upon their arms, and upon their country. "The ſcoffs of the conquerors; their haughty looks, when diſarmed, they ſhould be led through the hoſtile lines," the loathſome jail, or the murderous priſon-ſhip, all aroſe before their eyes. One conſolation remained. They could die in defence of their country.—But the Genius of WASHINGTON, ever invigorated by difficulties, here diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its native force. A ſituation ſo perilous, was to him only the means of acquiring new glory. A retreat would have been ignominious, a battle, fatal. See the event. At the return of day, a moment which his enemy had ſo anxiouſly anticipated—WASHINGTON, was a conqueror, on the plains of Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. He who appeared deſtined to certain captivity, was thundering upon his enemy in a diſtant quarter, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new laurels. I do not ſay, that this exploit was worthy of the ſagacity of an Hannibal, or the wiſdom of a Scipio. It was worthy of WASHINGTON; it will be it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an example to ſucceeding ages, and will forever retain the full verdure of glory. A kind Providence forwarded in an aſtoniſhing manner, an enterprize the moſt diſtinguiſhed for that quickneſs of penetration, which enables great minds to convert circumſtances, apparently the moſt in-auſpicious, into ſuch as are moſt favorable. This brilliant victory evinced the deep reſources of WASHINGTO'NS mind, and excited the univerſal admiration and applauſe of a people who loved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him; whilſt his enemy ſaw, and had the generoſity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the pre-eminence of talents, ſo dangerous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037876_0012_100F5F7550B91CD8"/>
but ſo invaluable to his country. Can we look back with cold indifference upon events ſo recent, at which the American heart once rebounded with joy, felt the full debt of gratitude to Heaven, and fervently expreſſed that gratitude in praiſe and thankſgiving?—Can we forget the man, whom Heaven ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the inſtrument of its loving kindneſs towards us? No! Sooner ſhall gratitude ceaſe to be a virtue; ſooner ſhall the love and admiration of heroic deeds, of all thoſe exalted talents which give dignity to man, be obliterated from the human breaſt.</p>
            <p>Thus did a campaign, which in its beginning, threatened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional ſubjugation, in it's end, preſent a proſpect the moſt animating and conſolatory to the friends of liberty. The cauſe of America had now attracted the attention of the world. Her armies had evinced a ſpirit worthy of ſuch a cauſe; her enemies had been compelled to retrace their path of victory; whilſt WASHINGTON, tranquil in danger, ſure in council, ſuperior in his views and reſources, had acquired the unbounded love, veneration and confidence of his fellow ſoldiers, had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſpect of his enemies, and proved that he was worthy of the high truſt committed to him. It was this love, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, this confidence, daily increaſing, as his talents and his virtues, were more and more developed which formed the treaſury of America. Yes, ye brave and virtuous defenders of your country, ye companions of the illuſtrious WASHINGTON, I call you to witneſs, that amid all your ſufferings, this devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your chief was your bond of union, your ſupport, and your reward, whether ye lay contented on the frozen earth, or marked your way by the blood-ſtained ground on which ye trod, or caught in haſte a ſcanty morſel, ſtill, amidſt all your privations, your attachment to your commander, founded on the juſt admiration of his heroic virtues, ſupported you in every trial, conſoled you under every difficulty, and animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with a patriotic enthuſiaſm in the day of battle. This command of the affections of brave and virtuous men, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire poſſeſſion of the heart of every ſoldier, thisun bounded vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for their chief, whilſt it forms the greateſt glory of a general, converts each ſoldier into a hero. He ſeizes, as an example for himſelf, the great model which his general exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. His temperance, his ſelf command in the heat of battle, his patience in ſufferings, his prudence, his magnanimity, his ardent patriotiſm, infuſe themſelves into every breaſt, give an elevation to the mind, a dignity, a confidence, a ſpirit, which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037876_0013_100F5F76D54BB0D0"/>
converts man into a new being, communicates to every power a new energy, and creates a force wonderful and irreſiſtible. Such was the agency of WASHINGTON's Genius. It poſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a creative power, which aſſimilated every thing to itſelf; or, which called forth in others, talents they felt not before. His very preſence inſpired fortitude. No one approached him, but felt the ſpirit of heroiſm transfuſed into his boſom. I think I ſee at this moment, the brave ſoldier, as he paſſes, hail him as his Father, Friend and Champion; I think I ſee him, riſe to redeem his country, exult in his martial exerciſe, and with a holy fervency calling down bleſſings on his commander's honored head, pant again to fight for freedom, or for freedom die.</p>
            <p>But if WASHINGTON had hitherto diſcovered talents won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully great in ſeizing with promtitude, the firſt avenues to ſucceſs, or of profiting from the ſmalleſt inadvertence of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, deſervedly high in military eſtimation; the time had now arrived, when the caution of a Fabius, or rather, a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo peculiar to himſelf, was to be diſplayed. His inferiority in numbers, and in all the equipments of war, compelled him to take a poſition on the ſtrong grounds of Morriſtown. It is doubtful whether he manifeſted greater talents as a commander, in this ſituation, or in thoſe ſcenes of brilliant action which we have juſt mentioned. No one knew better the value of that golden curb, which diſcretion hangs on bravery. A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral engagement, which the enemy ſo ardently ſolicited, would, in all probability, have extinguiſhed for ever the bright flame of liberty. To the invading army, procraſtination was defeat. In vain did the impetuoſity of the American councils urge him to battle. Nothing could move the ſoul of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, but the ſpirit of wiſdom, which ever calm and ſerene, had determined him now to be content with checking the movements of the enemy, and to maintain a war of caution. It was this caution, ſo full of prudence and military ſkill, which, continually baffling the deſigns of the enemy, compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to embark, and to attempt to gain Philadelphia by ſea. The attempt forced WASHINGTON from his ſtrong poſts. The battle of Brandy-wine enſued. The value of our troops was unſhaken, but the event was not fortunate for the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can arms. There are caſualties, which human prudence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always controul, but upon which, the iſſues of battles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten depend. One of theſe occurred. A falſe intelligence prevented the execution of a deſign, the moſt bold in its
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037876_0014_100F5F79364F2AF0"/>
nature; but ſo admirably planned, that had an attempt been made to carry it into effect, victory, and not defeat, would have been the reſult. Nor were the actions of German-town, and of Monmouth leſs ſignalized for the ſkill of the general, and the valor of his troops, than for thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward events which defeated their hopes. WASHINGTON had not always the glory of ſucceſs; but he had the glory of appearing to deſerve it. The wiſdom of his meaſures was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubted; ſucceſs, O God! Depends upon thy Providence.</p>
            <p>But, Fellow-Citizens, we ſhould not do juſtice to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, or the virtues of WASHINGTON, were we to confine our view to thoſe ſcenes only in which he himſelf was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal actor. During the progreſs of a war, which raged from the frozen walls of Quebec to the burning ſands of Savannah, the penetrating eye of WASHINGTON ſaw every movement; his comprehenſive mind took in the vaſt whole; his councils were received as the monitions of an oracle; whilſt, from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſprung up heroes in every quarter. The enemy had ſoon, every where, if not a WASHINGTON to contend with, at leaſt one who gloried in following the exalted model. His knowlege of human nature gave him the command of talents where-ever they appeared; whilſt his magnanimity rendered him always the firſt to announce the merit of others, and to participate in their triumphs. Whoſe boſom glows with the virtuous pride of being a citizen of America, and remembers not the gallantry of Greene, at Red-Bank; or the noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Smith at Mud-Iſland? Who bears not in vivid memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the victors of Saratoga, or him who reſcued South-Carolina from the fangs of the lion? Who calls not to mind, the brave, the virtuous, but unfortunate Fayette?—Thou too, lamented Mercer, ſhalt live immortal in the memory of America. Thy wounds, received in the bloody conteſt, which preceded the revolutionary war, had already evinced thy courage and thy patriotiſm. Ah! Weltering in thy blood, abandoned in the midſt of the inhoſpitable wilderneſs, the deadly ſerpent thy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food; what but a kind Providence could have preſerved thee from ſuch perils! It did preſerve thee, long to live the delight of ſociety, and to become the firm vindicator of liberty. Yes, the hand of God, preſerved thee, again to unite thy arms with WASHINGTON, and to pour forth thy gallant, but gentle ſoul, on the plains of Princeton, covered with glory.</p>
            <p>Would time permit, I could here, with that joy, which the love of noble deeds inſpires, trace a long line of heroes, whoſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037876_0015_100F5F7AC004B708"/>
names will be for ever dear to America, and whoſe energies WASHINGTON ſaw, combined, and thus produced a force conſtant in it's action, and irreſiſtible in it's effects. Recall the image of this illuſtrious man; behold him, when not brav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dangers of the field, ſeated in council, deep deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on engraven on his countenance; ſee him giving life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſtant armies, and inceſſantly directing every thing to the political ſalvation of his country. He ſeems another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes, ſitting on the ſhore, and moving at pleaſure a vaſt ſhip, on an ocean toſſed with tempeſt, whilſt he himſelf is immoveable.</p>
            <p>A juſt eulogium of WASHINGTON requires a detail of the actions of his life. The wonderful properties the inimitable beauties of thoſe rays which enlighten and animate all nature to be ſeen in their full luſtre, muſt be viewed ſeparately. This detail, this ſeparated view of the luminous actions of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON muſt be left to the judicious and impartial hiſtorian. The time with which you have already favored me, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me to haſten to that ſcene of glory, which ſtill awaited our beloved fellow-citizen, and which by cloſing the bloody drama, eſtabliſhed, we truſt in God, for ever, pure republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm in this weſtern world. That laſt ſcene was reſerved for Virginia. Her favorite ſon was deſtined, in her boſom, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reward of all his toils; and to finiſh in her ſight, his career of military glory. I will not open wounds which are but juſt healed, I will not awake the feelings of the friend, the orphan or the parent; nor will I call to mind the accumulated diſtreſs which mourned throughout this land. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay, that a ſuperior and a gallant foe, the conqueror of India, ſpread terror and deſolation on every ſide. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON ſaw the deciſive moment; he ſaw, that Providence had, at length, preſented the opportunity of cloſing the ſufferings of his country. With a deciſion; a profoundneſs of judgment, which aſtoniſhes, he projected and formed with his brave and generous allies, a plan apparently the moſt difficult in its exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and which, to common apprehenſion, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated only the feebleneſs of vanity and folly. A powerful enemy in New-York, was to be kept in a ſtate of alarm, for his ſafety; allied troops were to be aſſembled at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only from a diſtant quarter on the continent, but from Iſlands ſtill more remote; a fleet, which gallantly aided in the great deſign, was to ſecond every movement, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it's place at the appointed time; his own troops, by rapid
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037876_0016_100F5F7DDAA29698"/>
marches, were to enſure their arrival at the period affixed; the militia of Virginia, proviſions of all kinds, were to be collected. How many powers were here to be combined! What difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their arrangement! What prudence in adjuſting means ſo diſcordant! What ſecrecy in the execution!—The mind of WASHINGTON was ſuperior to every difficulty. The hoſtile army beheld themſelves ſurrounded by a force, which enſured their captivity, before they ſuſpected the deſign. Nothing more clearly evinces the ſtrength of mind, which this extraordinary man poſſeſſed than the ſure calculation which he had made of the reſult of all his meaſures, and alſo, of the conſequences which would attend the ſucceſs of this bold, but well concerted enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Weak minds, ever vacillating, find their emblem in the Aſpin's leaf. They have no center of repoſe. That of WASHINGTON was ſelf-poiſed; it felt its own weight, and reſted upon its own determinations. The Admiral of the allied forces heſitated, whether he ſhould keep the ſtation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him. America ſhould often review the letter, which WASHINGTON wrote to him from this city. Hear it fellow citizens. "I am unable to deſcribe the painful anxiety under which I have laboured, ſince the reception of your letter. It obliges me <hi>warmly</hi> to urge a perſeverance in the plan agreed upon. The attempt upon York, under the protection of your ſhipping, is as certain of ſucceſs, as a ſuperior force, and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of meaſures can render any military operation. The capture of the Britiſh army is a matter ſo important in itſelf, and <hi>in it's conſequences,</hi> that it muſt greatly tend to put an end to the war." After pointing out the certain and fatal event, which would follow the removal of the allied fleet, he adds: "I earneſtly beg your Excellency to conſider, that if by moving your fleet from the ſituation agreed upon, we loſe the preſent opportunity, we ſhall never hereafter have it in our power to ſtrike ſo deciſive a blow, and the period of an honorable peace will be farther diſtant than ever." He then aſſures the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that he had nothing to fear from the fleet of the enemy, however ſuperior, ſtationed as he was; and then concludes: "I am to preſs your Excellency to perſevere in the ſcheme ſo happily concerted between us."—This letter was the anchor of victory. WASHINGTON, with his brave allies, advanced to York. They came, they ſaw, they conquered.</p>
            <p>Then did America exclaim, "If God be for us, who can be againſt us." Yes, Great God, then was thy providential kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs manifeſted; then was it felt and adored by all; but by none
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037876_0017_100F28AB707964B0"/>
with more ardor, or more humility, than by him, who had been ſelected as the chief inſtrument in thy hands, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of liberty in this new world. "Let ſaid he, Divine Service be performed to morrow, in the different Brigades and Diviſions. The Commander in Chief recommends, that all the troops, which are not upon duty, do aſſiſt at it with a ſerious deportment, and <hi>that ſenſibility of heart, which the recollection of the ſurpriſing and particular interpoſition of providence in our favor claims."</hi> His thanks are then tendered to the whole army, in the warmeſt language; and let it be remembered, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of Virginia, with their Governor and General, the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the patriotic Nelſon, received, in a particular manner, his ſincere acknowledgments of their brave and zealous co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Joy, like the rapid lightning, ran from one extremity of the continent to the other. Every houſe of public worſhip reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grateful praiſes and thankſgivings to the God of battles. Every heart called for bleſſings on the head of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. Every American now began to hail the glorious conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all his hopes. The vindicators of liberty now ſaw, that the ſtorm which had ſo long deſolated their country, and deluged it with blood, was rapidly ſubſiding; the horizon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to gleam around, and promiſed the ſpeedy effulgence of the brighteſt day, which ever illuminated this earth.</p>
            <p>That day ſoon arrived. It was the day which witneſſed the acknowledgment of the Freedom, the Sovereignty, and the Independence, of the different ſtates of America.</p>
            <p>Is the orb of WASHINGTON's glory now full? No! It is increaſing in ſplendor. How many victors have found a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicon, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of the people in the air!—The integrity of WASHINGTON was a rock, in the midſt of the ocean, which could not be moved.—His patriotiſm was as firm as the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent he had ſaved. He was now to give another example to ſucceeding ages, another proof of the reality, and the greatneſs of his virtues. By his prudence, he firſt drew off ſilently the wrath of military tumult; it was an angry cloud, which might have been terrific to this country, had not WASHINGTON, like the immortal Franklin, known how to avert it's fury. No ſooner had the veterans of America, unrecompenſed as they were for all their labours and their ſufferings, reſumed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of citizens, than their beloved commander repaired to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037876_0018_100F5F839B3FBD10"/>
Congreſs—Behold him, Fellow-Citizens, in this exalted act of patriotic duty. See him with a modeſty and a dignity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo peculiar to himſelf, riſing in the auguſt council of America, delivering an addreſs replete with the nobleſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and unrobing himſelf, of all his military authority. "Happy, ſaid he, in the confirmation of our Independence and Sovereignty, and pleaſed with the opportunity afforded the United States, of becoming a reſpectable nation, I reſign with ſatisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in my abilities to accompliſh ſo arduous a taſk; which however was ſuperſeded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cauſe, the ſupport of the Supreme power in the union, and the patrionage of Heaven."</p>
            <p>"The ſucceſsful termination of the war, has verified the moſt ſanguine expectations; and my gratitude for the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Providence, and the aſſiſtance I have received from my countrymen, increaſes with every review of the momentous conteſt." He concludes with ſaying, "I conſider it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible duty to cloſe this laſt act of my official life, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the intereſts of our dear country to the protection of Almighty God, and thoſe who have the ſuperintendence of them, to his Holy keeping. Having now finiſhed the work aſſigned, I retire from the great theatre of action, and bidding an affectionate farewell, to this auguſt body, under whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I have ſo long acted, I here offer my commiſſion, and take my leave of all the employments of public life."</p>
            <p>The thouſand emotions, which crowded upon the minds of all preſent, rendered the ſcene awfully impreſſive. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Preſident was delivered with a ſenſibility, which almoſt ſuppreſſed utterance. It was a juſt tribute to the many virtues, military and civil of the illuſtrious WASHINGTON, and deſerves to be engraved upon his tomb.</p>
            <p>The acclamations of a grateful country, the applauſe and the admiration of the world, attended him to the peaceful walks of private life. Tyranny only trembled at the leſſon he had taught; a leſſon, ſaid the Preſident of Congreſs, equally uſeful to thoſe who inflict, and to thoſe who feel oppreſſion. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, the eloquent leſſon, which he taught, cauſed thoſe ſcales, with which the falſe luſtre of power had obſcured the viſion of men, to drop from their eyes. The American revolution, like another Ananias, ſeems to have been ſent by Heaven, to open the eyes of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:037876_0019_100F5F85E5556368"/>
Hitherto, Fellow-Citizens, you have admired the departed, but immortal WASHINGTON, as a commander. Follow his ſteps ſtill further, and you will equally admire him as the ſtates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the ſage.</p>
            <p>II. When the intereſts of America indicated a cloſer union of thoſe ſovereignties, which the revolution had eſtabliſhed, Virginia, ever watchful over the general proſperity, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her principles, again ſtood foremoſt. This is the fourth time, that ſhe firſt ſuggeſted to her equals, the adoption of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which were eſſential to the liberties, the proſperity, and the aggrandizement of all. Great God! We thank thee, that reaſon, and not arms, is the force which hath hitherto directed the political movements of a virtuous and enlightened people. The general council which was propoſed, met. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON was again called into the ſervice of his country, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly elected Preſident of an aſſembly of men, illuſtrious for their talents and their patriotiſm. From this aſſembly, eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the preſent conſtitution of the Federal Government. He who never ſolicited and office, was ſolicited by all America, to accept the important office of Preſident of the United States. With what diffidence he received this teſtimony of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the love and the veneration of a free and independent people, is in the memory of every one; nor is the exultation, which ſpread, like the break of morning light, leſs ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected. To ſee WASHINGTON again at the head of the American people, no longer clad in armour, but ſeated in the curule chair, giving energy to the laws of the Union, and ſtability to the liberty he had vindicated, watching over the intereſts of all, harmonizing diſcordant ſtates, eſtabliſhing order and method in every department, and thus making a fair but grand experiment of the ſubſerviency of the newly created go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the general happineſs, was a ſpectacle the moſt dignified, as well as the moſt grateful to every heart. With what aſſiduity he devoted himſelf to the duties of his office; with what conſummate prudence and judgment, he directed the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate powers entruſted to him, to their proper ends, let the voice of his country declare. Let the policy purſued, whilſt Europe, maddening with contention, was convulſed to her centre; and whilſt conflicting nations were laboring to plunge this country into the whirlpool of war, teſtify the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the magninimity and the patriotiſm of its conductor.—Peace with all nations, cloſe connections with none, union among ourſelves, meaſures favorable to commercial intercourſe,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037876_0020_100F5F8769DF8738"/>
both internal and external, a militia properly organized, not extenſive military eſtabliſhments, inſtitutions to develope and to extend the powers of the intellect, and to diffuſe knowledge; Theſe were the objects which engaged his attention, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the baſis of his policy. During his adminiſtration, it is true, that parties, the concomitants of all free governments, aroſe. WASHINGTON too had his party; it was that of the public good. He was the chief magiſtrate of a whole nation, and not of a part of that nation. Onward he bent his ſteady courſe, inflexible in the purſuit of what he deemed juſt and proper, conſcious of his own integrity, relying upon the favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and affording an example of that rare aſſemblage, or rather conſtellation of virtues, which will and muſt be the admiration of ages.</p>
            <p>Was then WASHINGTON exempt from error? This I do not ſay. He was a man; and conſequently had the infirmities of man. But this I do believe, and think the whole tenor of his life juſtifies the belief; that, if he did err, his errors were never intentional. Human wiſdom, and human virtue claim no higher prerogative. To Heaven only infalibility belongs. But tho' WASHINGTON may have erred, he had the merit of extracting glory even from his errors. How worthy of a great ſoul are the following ſentiments, which he delivers in his laſt Addreſs? <q>Tho', ſays he, in reviewing the incidents of my adminiſtration, I am unconſcious of intentional error: I am nevertheleſs too ſenſible of my defects, not to think it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I ſervently beſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope, that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and that forty-five years of my life having been dedicated to its ſervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt ſoon be to the manſions of reſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Twice called to the preſidential office, his Fellow-Citizens waited only for the return of that day, on which they ſhould exerciſe the ſovereign right of election, again to clothe him with the ſame honors. But, more anxious to enjoy the rights of a private citizen than the honors of office, wearied too with the long and laborious ſervice, which had conſtantly occupied his mind, and deſirous to ſpend the evening of his day in domeſtic tranquility, he announced his intention of retiring. He did not however forget, that he ſtill owed to his country an important
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037876_0021_100F5F89BA91ED50"/>
duty. This was diſcharged by an addreſs worthy of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. It contains the outlines of the policy he purſued, when in office, and which I have attempted ſlightly to ſketch. It contains alſo, admonitions the moſt wiſe, founded on long experience and deep reflection; admonitions, which ought to be indelibly imprinted upon the mind of every American. It is the advice of the father of American liberty, no leſs illuſtrious, as a ſtateſman and a ſage, than as a commander in war. America, hear this ſentence. "Of all the diſpoſitions and habits, which tend to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, who ſhould labor to ſubvert thoſe great pillars of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs, thoſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician ought to reſpect and cheriſh them. A volume could not trace their connection with private and public felicity." The mind of WASHINGTON ſaw, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm without morality was a chimera; and that morality without religion was as evaneſcent as the baſeleſs fabric of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; he ſaw, that the morality, the virtue which republics require, muſt have its utmoſt link faſtened to the footſtool of the throne of God.—May the hearts of all be open to this great truth! When WASHINGTON becomes a preacher, who will not liſten. O! Ye who love your country, and labour for the preſervation of her liberties; ye too, who ſurrendering your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to your paſſions, have ſacrificed your judgments to your zeal, come to this pure fountain of reaſon; it will quench your animoſities; look into it as it flows, it will be a mirror to ſhew you the path to public good; it will reflect the bright image of that eternal juſtice, which ought to rule the univerſe. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, it is by the obſervance of principles contained in this laſt addreſs, that the happineſs of the people, in theſe ſtates, under the auſpices of liberty, will be complete; and <hi>that</hi> free Conſtitution, the work of their own hands, will be ſo ſacredly maintained and preſerved, I uſe the words of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applauſe, the affection and the adoption of every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON retired; but he carried along with him, the ſentiments which a dutiful citizen ever owes to his country. Impending dangers, during, this retirement, alarmed America. WASHINGTON was again ready to protect her with his ſhield, and old as he was, to lead her armies to the field of battle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:037876_0022_10117008D418E9A8"/>
III. But, that we may do juſtice to WASHINGTON, as a ſage, and the truly good man, we muſt view him alſo in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life. When man is placed upon an elevated theatre, the eyes of the world, the glory of ſucceſs, give to his ſoul a force, and a grandeur, which is often foreign to it. Pride borrows the ſentiments of virtue; we do not ſee the perſon, but the perſonage. How many have acted as heroes at the head of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or appeared more than men, when conſcious that they attracted univerſal attention; and yet in the ſhade of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their common intercourſe with ſociety, have ſhewn that they were leſs than men, devoid of all that real moral worth, which conſtitutes human excellency. To WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the ſhade of retirement was as luminous as that of the moſt public theatre. It was here, that his ſoul, unbent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played all thoſe virtues, which are the ornament and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of ſociety. Humane, charitable, wiſe and juſt, in every ſituation, he was always conſiſtent, always equal to himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways evincing, that rectitude of conduct was his ſovereign good. The poor found in him a guardian, genius a patron, the honeſt and the meritorious a friend; the diſſolute the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the profane, always an enemy. Sincerely religious, his attendance upon the ſervice of his God, was the dictate of real piety. Immutably true, he could reſpect only truth in others. It was to him, the firſt duty of man. Such his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, that whilſt he was the admiration of all, he alone, like Moſes, deſcended from the mount, ſeemed ignorant of the light which ſhone around him. Such his prudence, that not a word, not an action eſcaped him, which would not admit of a rational juſtification. This ſingular character of reaſon accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him through life. Yes, Brethren, it was in WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, that thoſe four cardinal virtues, juſtice, prudence, temperance and fortitude, formed an union ſo rare, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. To theſe virtues, was added an underſtanding, the moſt clear and extenſive. His various official communications, his addreſſes to his countrymen, his anſwers to the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble congratulations which he received, all of which are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to form volumes; what ever came from his pen, whilſt it was always diſtinguiſhed by a ſtyle the moſt perſpicuous, the moſt ſtrong and manly, evinced at the ſame time, a vaſt mind, a ſuperior intellect, which could graſp every thing, and which laboured inceſſantly to promote public and private felicity.</p>
            <p>Such was, in part, the illuſtrious citizen, who filled ſo wide and ſo honorable a ſpace in the eye of America, and of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037876_0023_101170075047CD08"/>
world; and whoſe loſs a nation this day deplores. I know, that my attempts to do juſtice to his character, have fallen infinitely ſhort, of what your affection demanded.—But, I am little converſant in the language of panegyrick. "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded honours ſhall gather round the monument of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, and thicken over him. It is a ſolid fabric, and will ſupport the laurels that adorn it."</p>
            <p>But Ah! Great and good as he was, the ſcene of mortal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence is cloſed for ever. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, your belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed WASHINGTON, has finiſhed his courſe. He is gone to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before that God, in whom he truſted, and his works have followed him. Happy moment, for thee, illuſtrious ſhade! But afflictive to a nation, which mourns thy loſs, and which can find it's conſolation only in the rememberance of thy virtues, in an humble reſignation to the decrees of an all-wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in it's gratitude for benefits received through thy inſtrumentality. Long ſhall thy name be dear to thy country. Long ſhall the aged father, calling to his ſon, point to thy tomb, and bid him remember WASHINGTON; bid him recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thy virtues, and ſeize the patriotic flame, which once glowed within thy boſom. The tender mother too, hanging over her beloved ſon, ſhall drop the anxious tear, and hall the name of WASHINGTON; ſhall exclaim, O! Like him, be thou, brave, prudent, temperate and juſt. O! Be thou, like him, thy country's ſhield in war, it's ornament in peace. And thou, America! Incumbent as thou now art over the tomb of thy beloved citizen, mayeſt thou annually retrace his virtues, and conſecrate his memory. May his actions be ever the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of thy emulation and thy praiſe.</p>
            <p>Ah! Fellow-citizens, remember that virtue only is eſtimable in the eyes of God; and that without it, republics are victims deſtined for the altars of ambition. Remember, that without juſt ſentiments of religion, virtue periſhes; a dreadful proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of morals inevitably enſues, and with that proſtration, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is gone for ever—Would you ſhoot an arrow at the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid lightning as it flies athwart the ſky; or, would you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to arreſt the oceans tide, by a ſingle pebble? As well might you attempt to retain virtue, the baſis of private and public happineſs, the rock of all rational government, without religion. Ah! In an age, when religion has become the ſport of libertiniſm, and of philoſophiſts; in an age, when impiety is too often conſidered as the firſt proof of brilliancy of genius; in an age, when thy religion, bleſſed Jeſus! Is ſcoffed and reviled
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037876_0024_1011700BDA7B9250"/>
by thoſe who are ignorant of it; in an age, when even our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a God, has been derided by wickedneſs and folly; in ſuch an age, religion feels more than a momentary conſolation in embracing the tomb of WASHINGTON, and in holding him forth as another immortal example, that man in his greateſt perfection, is ever religious and faithful. O! Ye, who love your country, ye who would preſerve for yourſelves and your poſterity, republicaniſm pure and uncontaminated, again, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, be it yours to cheriſh religion, and to bear in mind the example of WASHINGTON. Ye, who yet contemn the degrading idea, that death is an eternal ſleep; ye, who do not reſt upon the miſerable and the dreadful hope of that deſtruction, that extinction of being, at the thought of which virtue trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the ſoul ſhrinks back with horror; ye, who can look beyond the grave, and there behold regions enlightened by the eternal meridian of God's unclouded ſmile;—Regions in which piety and innocence live immortal; O! Make that God your friend. Then, like your beloved Fellow-Citizen, will you be ſtrong in virtue, and incapable of diſmay; then will you, in that awful moment, which muſt ſoon tear us from all the ſoul holds dear in this world, be enabled, like him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, "I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous judge ſhall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them that love his appearing."</p>
