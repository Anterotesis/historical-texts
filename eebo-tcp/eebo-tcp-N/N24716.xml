            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>YOUR laſt, containing an account of your perfect recovery, met a cordial recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Upon this happy occaſion, deareſt Maria, accept the ſincere congratulations of my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate heart.—I am tempted almoſt to envy you the dear object of your ſublime rapture:—the rapture of a young mother in gazing on the offspring of her early love. From your own pleaſing emotions you may now partly conceive

the comparative agony of mine, on the prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture loſs of my only darling child! That heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly babe, whoſe infant ſmiles even now live in my memory; whoſe little heart ſeemed already to beat and glow with ſentiments of virtue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; whoſe liſping accents ſoothed the cenſure of its father's tongue, and gave a comfort to mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal woe, was, in a very flaſh of thought, ſnatched from my doating eyes; his lips for ever ſealed; his ſoul tranſported to the ſhades of innocence and bliſs; leaving me a ſolitary monument of his worth, by the bitter conſciouſneſs of his loſs! Oh! how ſeverely trying was this tremendous conflict of tender, weeping nature, with stern philoſophic reaſon and calm religion! Oh Maria, prepare your heart for trials even as dreadful as mine! Life itſelf, all its enjoyments, hang on the flying winds; and the gentleſt gale may, by Almighty diſpenſation, become the dreadful meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of deſtruction! Even that ſmiling infant, now opening to your ſanguine expectation, muſt one day yield the precious life it breathes; and we ourſelves experience an ageleſs interval of love and friendſhip!—Forgive theſe calamitous anticipations: May heaven continue ſupremely good and bountiful; for ever withholding from your experience the miſeries of which your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſiſter complains.</p>

WE have but juſt recovered from the labour and fatigue of removing to our newly-purchaſed country-ſeat. The deſcription of it given by Mr. Franks, did not in reality exceed the rural beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and magnificence of the ſcene to which we have retired for the approaching ſeaſon. The dwelling-houſe is advantageouſly ſituated on a delightful green hill, which, beſides looking over an extenſive and beautiful country, adds a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar grandeur and variety to the approximate ſcenery. The rooms and balcony in the front are entirely ſhaded by a row of willows, whoſe drooping bows, moved by the gentle breeze, ſeem to wave in zephyrous muſic to the victim of ſolitude and grief. In ſuch a ſecluſion, bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſociety of ſome feeling friend, or the livelier converſation of you, Maria, what a period of divine luxury would be the enſuing ſummer! But alas! this rural elegance, this mild "fancy of nature's hand-maid," only imparts bitterness to the reflection of my being deprived of such a companion to participate in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceleſs grandeur.</p>
               <p>THE ſurrounding country is conſiderably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by induſtrious indigence. Within a few acres of us there is a manſion, in appearance the perfect twin of ours, the property of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032746_0014_0FF4F88A82FE6350"/>
of eminence in Philadelphia, named Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, whoſe family has retired thither from the noiſe and tumult of the city, to ſpend the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſummer. It conſiſts only of Mrs. Alfred, a polite old lady, an amiable daughter (Miſs Fanny,) and a ſon, whom I have not yet ſeen: From the mother and daughter I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received ſeveral flattering marks of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, and have occaſion to wiſh for a ſpeedy intimacy. Miſs Alfred, now about her twenty ſecond year, has a romantic attachment, and principally delights to ramble, juſt as the ſun dives into the weſt, among the ſilent rocks, liſtening to the mingled noiſe of wooing birds, and the echoes which aſcend from the adjacent vales. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it is an intellectual repaſt exceeding deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription; and at her particular requeſt, I am ſoon to be a partner in one of her evening ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>ON the other ſide of us ſtands an ancient and mouldering edifice, in which, I underſtand, three maiden ſiſters reſide during the ſultrineſs of the year. I received a notice from them this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their intention to ſpend the afternoon with us: In my next, therefore, you ſhall have a particular account of theſe antiquated virgins.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:032746_0015_0FF4F8937376AAD8"/>
FROM this you will perceive that all my expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſociety, while abſent from the city, are on the Alfred family; and although this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at preſent proves unwelcome, I anticipate a variety of pleaſures from the frequent viſits of the intelligent Miſs Alfred.</p>

               <p>I CONFESS, dear Maria, the truth of many of the remarks communicated in your laſt; though ſome of them, permit me to ſay, ſavoured too ſtrongly of the turgid ſtiffneſs of conſcientious ſanctity. No one, however, more truly chorded with my ſentiments and feelings than that "the endearing careſſes of a fond huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032746_0016_0FF4F89505782968"/>
ought to fill up every wiſh and deſire of an affectionate wife, even immured in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, far from the fantaſtic pleaſures of a tinſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world." Than this, what more delightful fruition could a virtuous woman deſire? But, oh, my ſiſter, have you already forgotten the sad neceſſity of my union with Mr. Franks?—You, to whom fortune has invariably proved so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, ſhould, if not forgive the aberrances of the more unfortunate, at leaſt lament the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious origin of them. There is a ſupernatural ſatiety exiſting in the female ſoul;—the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ineffable love, without which the moſt ardent feelings of the heart, the moſt reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent faculties of the mind, are left unexerciſed and torpid. You, my lovely Maria, feel your boſom hourly ſwelling with the celeſtial glow of a pure and ceaſeleſs paſſion; how then can you competently judge of the ſecret emotions of a ſiſter, chained by tyrant cuſtom to a man who never avowed more than a motive of expediency for his addreſſes, who has ever neglected the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of a huſband, and for whom, even now I declare, I never felt more than eſteem? The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſhes of that deluded father whoſe power coerced me to the deed, ſleep over the endleſs torments which his raſhneſs has produced!—And muſt I, in meek ſubmiſſion to a hardened,

ſenſeleſs world, oppoſe the inſtinctive impulſe of my ſoul? Muſt I, to gratify the caprice of a world whoſe cenſure or applauſe is alike deſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, dam up the current of my thoughts, or cut ſhort the thread of mental reflection? Can I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain or limit the involuntary aſpirations of my heart? In ſhort, is it poſſible for me to affect a placidity of mind, when the humbleſt inſect I behold vaunts of its ſuperior bleſſedneſs? For heaven's ſake then, Maria, ſuppreſs your cruel reprehenſions.</p>
               <p>I SHOULD not have replied ſo paſſionately to this part of your letter, had I not fancied there was too much gaul and acrimony in the ink with which you penned it. A heavy frown ſeemed to hang on every line, and each ambiguous word to my ears and eyes conveyed horror and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>THE expected viſit from my ancient neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours was ſuddenly and ſtrangely interpoſed. About noon a heavy cloud emerging from the weſt, occaſioned a ſmart ſhower of rain, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with moſt tremendous peals of thunder. The valley beneath us ſeemed to retain the hoarſe exploſion; and every clap from heaven was anſwered by the ſharp echo of the trembling
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032746_0018_0FF4F89A57CF5640"/>
earth, making the convulſed air the theatre of an horrific conflict! At about three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon it entirely ſubſided; and the bright ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, breaking through the ſcattered clouds, diſplayed to the admiring world the arched ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of the rain-bow in all its reſplendent glory.—I expected this circumſtance, ſo ſalubrious in its influence on the air, would have created a new inducement for my expected viſitants to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their engagement; but at near four, I was <hi>officially</hi> informed, "that the Miſs Haywords, apprehenſive that the air was dangerouſly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with ſulphurous and other offenſive matter, begged to defer their viſit until a more favorable evening. I readily accepted the apology; not, however, without ſmiling at the abſurd caution which had produced it.</p>
               <p>I MUST briefly bid farewell, as I overhear the obliging Miſs Alfred in the parlour below. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven take you in its care!</p>

               <p>DO not, I beſeech you, wilfully miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive me:—what I expreſſed in my laſt were the matured effuſions of my oppreſſed boſom, and they have loſt no ſtrength by the ſubſequent retroſpection. But oh, how unintentionally kind is my fair Miſs Alfred, in intermitting the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my grief, by the exhilirating emotions of friendſhip. She increaſes hourly in my eſteem, and has already flattered me with a great portion of her confidence. On concluding my laſt epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I met her in the lower parlour, impatient, as ſhe ſaid, to take a round of diſcovery through the adjacent wilderneſs in my company. I ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on my ſhawl and chearfully complied with her requiſition. We walked for two hours, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging in a variety of flippant pleaſures; while our aſtoniſhment and admiration paced with each other, on diſcovering ſo many objects of beauty and grandeur, cloiſtered from the world's eye by almoſt impenetrable ſhrubbery and immenſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032746_0020_0FF4F8A1675B2260"/>
hoſts of oak and hickory. We traverſed through thorns, briars, brambles, &amp;c. aſcended ſteep and craggy rocks, forded pellucid ſtreams and chryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal rivulets, with a labour that loſt its fatigue in the thoughts and enjoyment of each other's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. At times we varied our amuſement by a frolickſome race down ſome verdant hill, and then, at the foot, where a cooling ſtream gurgled to our panting breaſts, we refreſhed ourſelves by catching the fragrant zephyrs that iſſued from the adjacent plains.</p>
               <p>As we returned, now ſaid my mirthful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, I will lead you to the Cavern of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with which, taking my hand, ſhe conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me through a ſhady valley, which appeared to be formed by the familiar junction of two large rocks, both fancifully carpetted with a green sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. Having paſſed this, we entered an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſpacious hall, paved by a ſtone which had acquired a moderate ſmoothneſs from the flow of a ſtream, which had lately been impeded.—"That, ſaid Miſs Alfred, pointing to an opening in the oppoſite rock, is the entrance to my ſolemn retreat, where, unheard but by the callous ſtone, which returns a ſympathiſing echo, I ſoothe the rigorous edge of reflection."—I expreſſed an apprehenſion of danger from ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032746_0021_0FF4F8A2F52CDAA0"/>
into a manſion formed ſo delicately by the adventitious cluſter of innumerable rocks. She inſtantly led me to this gloomy avenue, in the middle of which, we were nominally benighted; but my fair guide, groping, at length brought me to her favorite ſpot, where I beheld a natural ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha excavated from the rocks, beautifully lined with a green turf. It is of a ſemi-circular form, and at each ſide of the ſopha, a purling ſtream which runs from the precipice and buries itſelf in an unſeen baſon below, creates a prattling muſic congenial to the ſolemn aſpect of the ſcene, and to a mind tempered for melancholic medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—"Here, exclaimed my companion, with a vehemence before unobſerved, here, deareſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it is that I review the ſhort ſeaſon of life I have yet paſſed, and enumerate the comparative million of my diſaſters! Here I eaſe my ſwelling heart, by mingling with theſe ſtreams, the bitter tears of my affliction.—Oh, ſhe continued, when men, and even my fellow fair have denied a tear of commiſeration, this breathleſs, dumb rock has ſhed ſhowers of pity."—I ſtood awhile almoſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified; and beholding the fair Miſs Alfred's eyes deluged in tears of anguiſh, and the ſympathetic currents from the rock, which at this time ſeemed to flow more rapidly, I involuntarily joined in the diſtreſsful concert. Recovering from this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032746_0022_0FF4F8A4890B2F80"/>
ſympathy, I entreated my companion to make me acquainted with the diſaſtrous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances revived in her memory by the ſilent language of the ſurrounding ſcene. She replied, "Dear madam, excuſe me from complying with your requeſt at this time. Come, let us leave the ſpot, and at ſome hour when I can more controul the influence of feeling, you ſhall know the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this inordinate ſorrow."—I did all in my power to allay the ſenſible anguiſh of her heart; and after recovering from our fatigue, by a few moments repoſe on the ſopha, and more minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inspecting the rude magnificence of the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we retired in the ſame manner as we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. On again coming, I may ſay to the face of the earth, we diſcovered the ſun had laid deep in the Weſt, and left only a ſilver tint on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite foreſts. Urged by the advance of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we tripped over a direct path to our manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at which we arrived, juſt as the gloomineſs of night mantled the earth in ſable ſhade. After our joint ſolicitations, Miſs Alfred conſented to remain with us till the next morning. Her ſtrength and ſpirits being apparently exhauſted; I endeavored to revive the latter by ſkipping over ſome gay airs on my piano, which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled with many polite encomiums. Finding that ſhe underſtood the inſtrument, we prevailed

with her to give us a tune. Oh Maria, what celeſtial melody floated through the expanſive hall!—The docile key, as they kiſſed her nimble fingers, acknowledged the ſuperior influence of their new miſtreſs, and ſeemed to emulate each other in the placid harmony of their notes.</p>
               <p>THE affectionate ſociety of this charming girl, is a treaſure unexpected in this rude and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated wilderneſs.

Mr. Franks, with a politeneſs not peculiar to him, offered to conduct her home.

"Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble," exclaimed I, traverſing the hall, "that one ſo young and fair, ſo mildly innocent and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould already wear in her heart, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding cauſe of this pathetic conduct!—But ah, why do I wonder this, when youth, beauty, and innocence are the choiceſt victims of artifice and guilt!—Oh, what a benevolent curioſity have I to know the hiſtory of her tears! To ſoothe their torture by adminiſtering ſympathy!"—Thus I employed upwards of an hour, when Mr. Franks returning, aſſured me that the fair Miſs Alfred became much indiſpoſed in the courſe of their walk; and that on leaving her, ſhe had repaired to her bed. Think, my ſiſter, how this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſtartled me, conſcious as I felt, that the ſad circumſtance muſt be attributed to ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of yeſterday. I was inſtantly hurrying to pay her a viſit; but, on Mr. Franks repeating her having gone to reſt, and the confuſion of the family, I deferred this act of friendſhip till the afternoon.</p>

As ſoon as we had dined, my girl Hannah, (Mr. Franks declining to accompany me) and I, croſſed the fields and woodland which divide our plantation from the Alfred's, and ſoon arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the front of their manſion houſe. The ſurly houſe dog, hoarſely announced the arrival of ſtrangers, which brought to the door, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mother of my friend, who received me with a cordial welcome.—I impatiently inquired after the health of her daughter. "Oh, ſweet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," ſaid ſhe with a cheerful ſmile, "our alarm is all over. A trifling bleeding and ſome repoſe has conſiderably abated her fever, and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I am certain, will complete the cure." I was rejoiced at this anſwer; and following Mrs. Alfred through a ſpacious hall, I was conducted to a back parlour, which, like our own, is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhaded by a row of large trees.—Here, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the courteous and buſy politeneſs of the old lady had ſeated me, I waited but a few minutes, when overhearing a footſtep, I aroſe, and advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the door, met my ſweet friend, whoſe eyes ſhone even in the midſt of ſickly meekneſs!—Oh, ſiſter, what a divine picture was here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played of oppreſſed innocence ſtruggling with contumely!—The blooming roſe had ſunk in the general whiteneſs of her face, leaving only a glimmering tint on her lips; and her eyes, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032746_0026_0FF4F8B5ABB04BB0"/>
all their ſprightlineſs, ſeemed to exult in the ſurrounding langour of her countenance!—Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her by the hand, I ſaid, Dear Miſs Alfred I hope you are perfectly recovered from your alarm?—"Law, dear Madam," replied ſhe, "the care and ſolicitude of my tender parent, has made my indiſpoſition appear too ſerious. The long, though extremely agreeable ramble of yeſterday, added to the ſubſequent agitation of my mind, had occaſioned a debility, which, ſucceeded by a fever, gave very unfavorable ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. However I am at preſent entirely reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and your company was only wanting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore my ſpirits"—After receiving every mark of politeneſs from this ſmall family, and viewing the variety of objects of taſte and grandeur to which Miſs Fanny conducted me, I took my leave, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that my engaging friend was not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely reſtored, as ſhe wiſhed to convince me.</p>
               <p>IN returning home, partly to gratify Hannah, we took a circuitous walk through the foreſt, which extends for many acres back of the two farms; and in the boſom of which, a variety of unimproved beauties, ſtriking the eye in their rough ſtate, occaſion a ſucceſſion of pleaſing emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Reſting on the ſummit of a lofty rock, which overlooks a vaſt proſpect, our ears were

ſuddenly enchanted by the ſoft muſic of ſome artful piper, who was concealed in the cluſtering ſhrubbery beneath. It began in a mild harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſtrain, and gradually ſwelling, the valley beneath us rung with the ſublime melody. I gazed on every ſide to diſcover this Apollo of the woods; while the amazed girl at my ſide cried out, "Oh what a ſweet bird! Would that we had it in our new cage!"—We were obliged to depart without a diſcovery; while the ſhrill pipe, as if conſcious of our admiration, loudly warbled to our footſteps, till its dying ſweetneſs was loſt in the intervening ſpace.—Who knows, my ſiſter, but that this ſecluded muſician, remote from the ſcenes of anguiſh and diſappointed love, here and thus ſeeks to drown the recollection of woe, in the united muſic of his pipe and the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſive echo of the vale!—While he played, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was huſhed to liſten to his lamentatation; and even the ſtubborn oak moved not a leaf to interrupt the ſacred ſadneſs of the ſong.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU will no doubt be aſtoniſhed at the acknowledgement, that your laſt, containing a panegyric on the fair, met a cordial acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in my heart. Conſidering my paſt apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and, I might almoſt add, diſguſt for the ſex, is it not miraculous, that at the mere glance of a female, my callouſed nature has been melted into unbounded adoration?—Yes, Bill, I have but juſt diſcovered that the finer faculties of my ſoul have heretofore been obſcured by ſcholaſtic precepts and falſe reaſoning; and that, inſtead of oppoſing the mild influence and dominion of beauty and innocence, nature deſigned the heart <hi>to love,</hi> and formed it for intellectual fruition: In fine, that "nature is the god of love."</p>
               <p>THUS you perceive, in fidelity to our juvenile engagement, (made in our chamber, when, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, we ſhould have been hammering at the problems of Euclid,) I have made an immediate diſcloſure of the firſt operations of Cupid on my heart:—perhaps it is premature; but when I compare my ſenſations and deſires with thoſe of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032746_0029_0FF4F8BFB48D23E8"/>
which I have read in the examples of renowned lovers, I am ſtruck with the apparent parallel, and already foreſee a thouſand obſtacles to the conſummation of my hopes; a thouſand difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſurmount, and as many dangers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. Nay, I ſometimes fancy myſelf the Don Quixotte of my miſtreſs; and in my imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary perils, fall an heroic victim to the queen of pleaſures!</p>
               <p>MY father's farm is poſſeſſed of all that ruralic beauty of which are led to conceive by peruſing the hiſtory of the loves of enamoured ſwains and ſhepherdeſſes. Nature has adorned it with a variety of exquiſite groves, grottos, &amp;c. whoſe unſeen retirement ſeems peculiarly deſtined for a reciprocal interchange of hearts. From thoſe I have ſelected one, ſuited moſt to my temper of mind and conception of wild elegance, to which I have been accuſtomed to withdraw in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each day, and with my haut-boy play to the gradual fall of the ſun. It was in the laſt exerciſe of this diurnal amuſement that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the appearance of a female, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on an eminence exactly oppoſite, whoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and heavenly countenance broke through the interwoven leaves and mollified my unwary heart. She appeared engaged in a careleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032746_0030_0FF4F8C36B9731E8"/>
of the ſurrounding proſpect. I ſeized my neglected inſtrument; and by playing a ſoft and melancholy air, had the ſupreme gratification of obſerving her both pleaſed and ſurpriſed with the music. Gods! Methinks, at that moment I could have rendered the powers of Orpheus, had I poſſeſſed them, the ſervants of a chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous purpoſe!—Her eyes wandered to diſcover the concealed muſician; but the thick cluſter of the trees, added to the falſe echo of the diſtant rocks, deluded her eagereſt ſcrutiny; till at length, finding it impracticable, ſhe moved—and by my ſoul, I had not the ſenſe or the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to follow her; but, changing the tune, kept muſic to the majeſty of her ſteps, till the view of her beauty was buried in the diſtant foreſt. Yet even now her graces live in the memory of my eyes; and I mentally gaze on her bewitching charms! But, alas! this is all—all I dare expect! Who ſhe is, from whence, or to where, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found myſtery, which keeps my imagination on the rack! She cannot be of this part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or ſurely my cars would have heard the <hi>"rumour of her beauty,"</hi> before my eyes were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to witneſs it's power, and my heart to avow its dominion. Neither have I ventured to make enquiry at home; although I highly ſuſpect my ſiſter could give me conſiderable ſatisfaction.

You know the character which my principles concerning the influence of women on our ſex has obtained: it has prevailed in our family; and a diſcloſure of this kind to them, would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce vexation and ridicule.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR CHARLES,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I SHOULD have been extremely ſuſpicious of the validity of your laſt had it not
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032746_0032_0FF4F8CBCFE7A3D8"/>
been accompanied with ſo many ſerious affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and as the caſe you deſcribe yourſelf to be in, is as ſerious as it is unprecedented, permit me, by what you courteouſly term <hi>philoſophic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> either to eradicate a hopeleſs paſſion, or give to it the impulſe of virtue and ſubſtantial affection.</p>
               <p>FROM the extraordinary deſcription you have drawn of this unknown female, I was at firſt prompted to conclude, that, inſtead of loving an <hi>handſome woman,</hi> you are no more than paying a dutiful adoration to ſome <hi>celeſtial being;</hi> who, in the peculiar humour of the ſex, had made a trip to this ſublunary world to ambuſh your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and, having accompliſhed your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, has returned to her elyſium, leaving you the victim of a paſſion hopeleſs as the grave. Should your inquiries after the <hi>goddeſs</hi> terminate in diſappointment or chagrene, this idea, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous as it is, will be partly confirmed: and then, my amorous lad, let your affections mount the pinions of the lark, and aſcend, like fragrant incenſe, to ſalute the "olfactory nerves" of your deified miſtreſs!</p>
               <p>BUT, to reverſe my conjecture, ſhould your inquiſitive labour fortunately iſſue in an auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

diſcovery, and her fair heart be open to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite impreſſions, let me adviſe you, to exerciſe with ſkill and judgment, thoſe fine qualities of merit with which your mind and perſon are ſo happily adorned. To beſiege a heart already exempt from impreſſions, with a hope of ſucceſs, you ought previouſly to engage its partiality by a thouſand trifling offices of politeneſs and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and thus effectually ſurround it by a preſentiment in your favour, againſt which it will be a pain to act, when you more unequivocally attack the fortreſs.—It is, however, uſeleſs to dictate rules of ſubordination to lovers; as the paſſion which they experience ſpurns at the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of art, and acts ſolely from its own ſimple and preſent emotions. In other words, it is a paſſion imcompatible with the caution of artifice; and, as you ſay, being the modeſt child of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, its demeanour abounds in all the ſimplicity of its birth.</p>
               <p>BUT, my friend, are you indeed ſo ſuddenly and ſingularly overcome by this ſublime paſſion? Have you already an univerſality of feeling which drives from your thoughts, all but the object of your adoration? Is the preſent interval of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs a ſeaſon of exile and deſpair? And does hope, the child of love, even now cheriſh your
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032746_0034_0FF4F8D000C0EEA0"/>
palpitating heart?—If theſe be your feelings, the paſſion is not a counterfeit; your diſeaſe is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the ſource of it is alſo the only remedy.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032746_0035_0FF4F8D6C0B941C8"/>
innocence; at which, I am ſure her tender boſom will ſigh in uniſon with my own.—Alas! how many of our ſex live a life of joy, and die a death of forgetfulneſs; while others, fair and virtuous in the eye of heaven, incur the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated cruelty of the world; and are finally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed by the weapons of malice! While ſome, practiſing on the other ſex the devices by which they deſtroy us, enjoy the taſteleſs pleaſures of vanity and pride, others are the devoted offerings to artifice and ſin! Innocence is no ſhelter from the intrigues of vice; and virtue proves a bait for the efforts of deceit!—Oh, my Maria, how thrice-bleſſed are you, early withdrawn from the theatre of folly and diſſimulation, into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial embraces of an affectionate huſband! Even I may exclaim myſelf happy;—happy, as yet ſafe from the machinations of art!—Happy, in being at the ſame time robbed of the enjoyment of love, and ſhielded from the ruins of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!</p>
               <p>YOU will remember the tears ſhed by the ſweet Miſs Alfred in her profound ſecluſion; nay, you will not have forgot your own ſympathetic emotions excited by my letter on that diſtreſsful occaſion.—Alas, how little did I ſuſpect that her ſerene and heavenly ſmiles concealed a tender
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032746_0036_0FF4F8D84EA5E0C0"/>
heart, furrowed with unheard of diſaſters! How little did I imagine, that the ſprightly friend in whoſe ſociety all my diſtreſſes were buried, could not for a moment bury her own! Yes, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, young, fair, and captivating as is Miſs Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, the world,—that world whom you would have me reverence,—the unjuſt, the ſelfiſh, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el world, even in her infancy, daſhed her hopes of human felicity!—Oh, that I could equal, in the ſtyle of narration, the exquiſite anguiſh of my friend's life, as it ſtreamed from her melting tongue; that my ſiſter might weep over the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in all the luxury of wounded ſenſibility!</p>
               <p>I HAVE already mentioned the endearing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Miſs Alfred's mother: Her father, whoſe buſineſs requires his conſtant attention in the city, is not leſs affectionate. His greateſt comfort is in accumulating happineſs for his two precious children; and principally his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe early calamity has given her a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intereſt in the whole family. From her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, theſe fond parents anticipated the moſt unbounded joy for their decline of life, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and promoting the felicity of their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, in the abominable practice of the world, but with this fond hope impreſſed, they had, before ſhe attained her ninth year, nominally
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032746_0037_0FF4F8D9DBA11EC0"/>
united her to a neighbour's ſon, then about twelve years of age. Full of the bright view of their diſtant bliſs, to ariſe from this parental pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, ſhe was ſent to a celebrated ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to receive every poſſible accompliſhment and ornament of education. Here, my Fanny confeſſes, ſhe enjoyed the undefinable happineſs of youthful innocence unfettered by rigid moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity or ſuperſtitious prejudice. "Here", as ſhe exclaimed in her narration, "here were all my tranquil days enjoyed; the remainder are filled with ſighs, and tears, and agony!"—</p>
               <p>HAVING received an education highly adapted to her ſtation, ſhe left this abode of peace and virtue; and returned to the affectionate care of her fond parents. There ſhe was early intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the ſociety of both the ſexes; and from the natural ſweetneſs of her diſpoſition, and acquired elegance of mind, early engaged the admiration and eſteem of the one, while the ſame qualities excited the envy and malice of her own. Forgetful of the rigid cuſtoms of the world,—of the preordination of her parents; and impelled by her own innate ſentiments of virtue and propriety, her ſusceptible heart was gradually devoted to the love of a youth, who, though inferior in fortune, poſſeſſed the ſuperior
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032746_0038_0FF4F8DB67EC1F90"/>
endowments of an amiable mind, and a heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious to every impulſe but that of truth and honor. This circumſtance gave an aſperity to the conduct of her father; who, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fatal error of mankind, endeavoured to give a different direction to the affections of his child. "Nay," ſhe exclaimed, "my deareſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgetful of his nature, was on this occaſion even cruel!"—In the firſt vehemence of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal concern, he ſucceeded in ſeparating this lovely pair, by prevailing with the father of Mr. Wellsford, (the youth before mentioned) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him as ſupercargo to the Eaſt-Indies; where he has been almoſt five years, without communicating the leaſt intelligence to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or to the more unhappy Fanny. "Oh," ſhe ſighed, "I am ſure he is no more! His ſpirit was too noble to bend long to the baſeneſs and perfidy of mankind! It has fled to its nativity; from whence it ſhall hover round my mind, till both are re-united in perfect bliſs!"</p>
               <p>SEVERELY as my Fanny muſt have experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this odious tyranny, its effects were not ſo baneful or laſting, as thoſe of the diſaſter which ſucceeded. Already had her inſidious female enemies forged a thouſand calumnies; and the foul breath of ſlander had been as buſy in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032746_0039_0FF4F8E3E747CD28"/>
the defamation. Her former aſſociates ſuddenly withdrew themſelves from her intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and the number of her male admirers as ſuddenly increaſed, drawn by the rumour of her wantonneſs. Thus fouly traduced and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while her unſuſpecting heart was devoted to love and conſtancy; her deareſt and only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter arbitrarily exiled; and with feelings ever alive to acute impreſſions, a violent malady, of both mind and body, ſucceeded; and but for the timely revival of her father's affection, and the tender ſolicitude of her mother, would have aſſuredly proved fatal: but by their joint efforts the trembling thread of life was ſtrengthened, and her paſſion, diſdaining the conſtructions of a treacherous world, retired to this ſeat of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, dedicating tears of pity to the frailty of mankind, and invoking on her baniſhed Henry the collected bleſſings of an approving God!—Her father has perceived, by the ſad experience of his child, the repugnance to true happineſs of coercion or reſtraint in the concerns of the heart; and endeavours, by a courſe of fondneſs and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to eraſe from the annals of her mind the painful recollection of her ſufferings.</p>
               <p>THUS, deareſt Maria, did Miſs Alfred, in the plenitude of her confidence, unfold to my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive

               <p>ON concluding my laſt to you, which was written early on the morning ſubſequent to my entanglement, I had recourſe to my gun, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an hour of exerciſe to baniſh the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly penſiveneſs which inſidiouſly gained on my mind. I traverſed the extenſive woodlands without having occaſion once to diſcharge my gun; and was returning home, when the ſudden report of a muſquet from a thicket at my ſide, ſo ſtartled me, that my finger, then on the tryger, by the quick emotion of my fright, inſtantly let ſly the whole contents of the piece into the boſom of the ambuſh from which the former had iſſued. Theſe ſucceſſive frights kept me ſilently amazed for ſome time; till, thinking of the probable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of my random ſhot, I entered into the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and my aſtoniſhment was increaſed by there beholding a gentleman inſenſibly extended on the ground, with a muſquet careleſsly fallen at his ſide. Certain that this was the effect of the laſt accident, I raiſed him from his laying poſture, and was relieved by obſerving that the ſhot had but ſlightly grazed his left ſhoulder and cheek; and that his ſenſes were partly reſtored. After a
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032746_0042_0FF4F8E8973BDC58"/>
ſhort ſilence, he looked me in the face and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired if I was hurt, to which having replied in the negative, I alſo accounted for the accident by which he had been reduced to his preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—He begged that I would not apologize: He had been out the whole morning, he ſaid, without meeting any game, till paſſing through this cluſter of ſhrubbery, a ſquirrel ſtarting, he careleſsly let fly at him, not thinking of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He then directed me to his dwelling, a few acres from my father's, and preſſed me to pay him a viſit that afternoon. Promiſing to oblige him, I returned home and found the family at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt; for which, alas, thought had robbed me of an appetite!</p>
               <p>THE remainder of the morning I employed in a moral contemplation of the ſapient Seneca; and, after a tolerable dinner, departed to fulfil my early engagement—But oh, my friend, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did my forebodings predict the event!—I was inſenſible to every external object around me, till entering a ſhady covert in the wood, how I came there I know not, my amazed eyes beheld the fair object of my meditation repoſing on a green turf, beautifully ſhaded by ſeveral young walnut trees, and partly ſurrounded by a circle of ſweet briers! I ſtood for a moment abſolutely petrified,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032746_0043_0FF4F8F10C48CA68"/>
undetermined whether to enjoy a ſtolen glance or retreat from the holy ſecluſion. Love and hope impelled me to the firſt; and on advancing I perceived an open book juſt ſlipping from her tender hold, which having ſecured, think, my friend, in all the imagery of your glowing fancy, of the tranſported attitude in which I gazed on this ſleeping goddeſs, as unconſcious then of my paſſion as I am of the preſent emotions of her ſoul!—Now with my eyes eagerly revitted to the mild beauties of her face; nay, even glancing on the white innocence of her heaving boſom, and then, raiſed in ſilent extacy to heaven!—I almoſt forget myſelf in this mute rhapſody, and but for the fear of offending, would ſurely have continued in this exerciſe till ſhe awoke; but prudence and reſpect drove me from her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and with a heart highly elated, I arrived at the dwelling of my new acquaintance, who received me into a ſpacious parlour with all the cordiality of politeneſs; aſſuring me that he was recovered from the fright as well as the injury of the morning. He is a gentleman conſiderably advanced in years, and in the curſory converſation of an hour diſplayed a great intelligence in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical facts, and a knowledge of reigning politics, which he made the theme of our diſcourſe. I had juſt given a new turn to the ſubject—My
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032746_0044_0FF4F8F299AC6EF8"/>
mind, teeming with the thought of the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>wood nymph;</hi> had juſt began to enquire of my companion, the ſociety of the country; whether there were accompliſhed females; and even, if he knew a lady anſwering the deſcription of the fair ſlumberer? "She is," ſaid I, "dreſſed in all the majeſtic gracefulneſs of exterior beauty; and from the mild language of her eyes"—at which, turning my attention to a door which opened, the model of my deſcription appeared, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced the voice of praiſe!—But oh, my friend, how ſhall I proceed?—How dare I think of the trembling horror of that moment, when my ſoul was convulſed by a vaſt aſſociation of paſſions?—Her perſon had more dignity than ever, her eyes ſparkled with pleaſure, and, with feelings I cannot deſcribe, I aroſe, and making a bow, was thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtruck on being introduced to the wife of my new acquaintance! How I appeared I know not, but till the period of departing I was ſenſible of nothing but the miſery of my condition. This interview, however, diſcloſed to my knowledge the fair object of my anxiety.—She is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my ſiſter, and I may expect either a cure to my paſſion, or a juſtification in her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſociety.</p>

THUS, my friend, has every faculty of my mind been ſtaggered by this unpropitious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the diſtreſſing effects of which are conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all my actions—Alas, how ſhall I act?—Dare I perſiſt in loving and adoring the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated partner of my friendly neighbour; or muſt I—(but it is vain to inquire) I cannot,—never can ceaſe from admiration. No, my friend, though the bleak cenſure of the united world, and the ſtern precepts of religion are oppoſed to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, reaſon and nature will advocate a paſſion pure and undeſigning as is that which I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               <opener>
                  <dateline>BALTIMORE.</dateline>
                  <salute>DEAR CHARLES,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ALREADY, as I at firſt predicted, your life commences with eccentric incidents; and I ſeriouſly apprehend, that, like your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the loving fraternity, you are alſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to experience the irrevocable alternations of bliſs and miſery.</p>
               <p>THE fortuitous diſcovery you have recently made is ſo important, that a ſtranger would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your love as well as your hope would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at the knowledge you have obtained of the impoſſibility of ſucceſs: Yet at the ſame time, your paſſion, in ſurviving this tremendous ſhock, evinces its nature to be genuine and ſincere; and conſequently, in my humble opinion, can be denominated no other than virtuous. Love can never be vicious. Taking the term in its literal definition, it is an emotion of the ſoul which ever is the ſpring and motive of action to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the beloved object. Being in its nature a ſentiment of good-will, and a ſecondary principle of ſelf-love, its generous ſtreams retain their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032746_0047_0FF4F8FE273746B0"/>
ſanctity; and therefore, even in its moſt unbounded inundations (if the expreſſion may be uſed) guilt is not juſtly attached: though faſhionable and general inſtitutions dogmatically limit its operation; fix the boundary of its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſay, "Thus far, and no farther ſhalt thou go."</p>
               <p>SURELY your own feelings will corroborate the opinion, that it is a paſſion too omniſcient, too arbitrary, to ſubmit to the controul of human laws, which often are the offspring of avarice and pride:—That, notwithſtanding the cuſtoms of the world, a beautiful and amiable <hi>wife</hi> will as effectually entrap the affections of an unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boſom, as the ſame attractions would in the perſon of an unplighted <hi>maid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the preceding, my friend, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how exactly parallel with your preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, my ſpeculations on this ſubject have always been. Moreover, I affirm, that, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from human nature, it is as impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a refined and ſuſceptible heart from admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an amiable and beautiful woman, either mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or ſingle, as it would be to annihilate any natural appetite of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:032746_0048_0FF4F8FFB3BA4388"/>
HAVING ſo explicitly avowed this ſentiment, which, by many, will be deemed that of a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, I cannot refrain ſuggeſting the neceſſity and expediency of reining your paſſion with the utmoſt circumſpection; as we are in our actions more ſubordinate to the laws of the world, than to the deciſions of our own individual minds. Hence, at the ſame time to conform to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the world, and yet to indulge in repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant propenſities, ſhould be the inceſſant ſtudy of a man, hurried, as you are, into the perils of an illegal amour. The conſciouſneſs you expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the purity of your paſſion, would, no doubt, unbiaſſed by fear, induce you to diſcloſe it to the object;—but, Charles, this will not do; we are not living in a ſtate of nature; and I will add, that even ſhould your wiſhes meet a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity of affection, that ſacred boon muſt be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit, and all its conſequent raptures devoted to lence and retirement.</p>
               <p>—YOUR predicament is indeed extremely ſingular and momentous!—'Tis impoſſible, you ſay, to extirpate your affection: I believe it, from my ſoul. Love, having once engrafted itſelf, can only be exterminated by the total extinction of its ſource; that is, the heart.—Yet alas! Look at the big horror which ſwells the eye of antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation!
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032746_0049_0FF4F90145386530"/>
What ſophiſtry can aſſuage the painful certainty of her being the <hi>monopolized property</hi> of another? What vain conception can delude you to expect, that your ſuperior qualities can alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her heart from its lawful maſter? What deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration can impell you to encounter the "wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wrath" of her enraged huſband?—Can your love conquer theſe ſuggeſtions, and retain its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence? If ſo, pray make your talents ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the wiſhes of your heart; in which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous adventure, that you may arrive at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of perfect felicity, is the prayer of</p>

               <p>HOW cheerfully would I ever fly to the dear converſe of my friend! To you whoſe bounteous ſympathy has already nearly ſoothed the rancour of my ſoul!—For theſe two days paſt the weather has been ſo ſultry as to deter me from walking; beſides which, my conſtant attendance has been required at home, on account of a ſhort viſit from my tender father. I intended how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to have been with you the greater part of to-day, but an accident has unfortunately depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me of that pleaſure.</p>
               <p>THE morning being extremely inviting, Charles prevailed on me to take a ſhort ride up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. On our return, the creature which I rode, being a young ſkittiſh horſe, ſuddenly took fright and ſtarted, leaving my brother at a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. Without attempting to curb his ſpirit I held to the ſaddle, till overtaking ſome foot paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers who officiouſly obſtructed his courſe, I was ſuddenly thrown from my ſeat by the quick halt. Overpowered by the fall, I had juſt faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as my brother rode up, by whoſe aſſiſtance I
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032746_0052_0FF4F90B98D9E870"/>
soon recovered, and exchanging horſes, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home in a ſlow pace. I have ſince had ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a fever, and at preſent feel ſo diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as to be unable to accept your polite invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Believe me, my deareſt friend, it is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thus to be deprived of your ſweet ſociety.</p>
               <p>My brother ſaw the ſervant deliver your billet and was mightily in the fidgets to ſee its contents. I was on the point of giving it to him, when I came to the concluſion, where you mentioned him ſo reſpectfully, which, though indeed my brother poſſeſſes many amiable qualities and a good mind, coming from you, whom he highly eſteems, would be too flattering to his <hi>ſexual</hi> vanity. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this remark: It proceeds from my knowledge of the sex:—alas, from my own fatal experience! that the ſlighteſt courteſy from us, is by them, imputed to their merit, and the impreſſion it has made on our minds.</p>

               <p>MY laſt was ſhaded with the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs of deſpair: Let the preſent annul the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of the former, as time has rendered my proſpects more auſpicious. Oh my friend, "tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles light as air," are mighty comforts to the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs boſom of deſpairing love! From an abyſs of deſperation I have been elevated to the pinnacle of hope by mere phantoms, and even retain the wiſdom to behold and acknowledge their nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet, as it is a characteriſtic of the paſſion to live on idea, I willingly ſecond the efforts of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>I YESTERDAY prevailed with my ſiſter to take a ride, for the mere purpoſe of deriving ſome particulars of the condition of my Charlotte, for ſuch permit me to call her. Her hiſtory I aſſure you has blown the buds of hope.—Like many of the unfortunate of her ſex, in infancy ſhe was compelled by a fordid parent to accept her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent huſband, for whom I underſtand, ſhe even now feels no more than a languid eſteem. Oh
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032746_0054_0FF4F9120B7A00E8"/>
my friend, love is ever the attractive of love, as apathy is of diſguſt!—Will not the pure effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my ardent ſoul draw from her oppreſſed boſom, at leaſt a correſpondent wiſh. Her heart is unengaged, and may I not hope to impreſs it with pity?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"And pity ſoon is melted into love."</l>
               </q>
               <p>MY ſiſter ſpoke of her in the moſt exalted terms; eſtimating her friendſhip as the greateſt bleſſing of her life. My ears caught the delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous founds, and my vain heart exulted in the idea that ſuch an one, ſo ſupremely excellent, was well worthy the ambition of my love. Returning home, my ſiſter's horſe being frighted, put an end to this ſeaſon of enthuſiaſtic rapture.</p>
               <p>ON the ſame morning, a note was delivered by a ſervant, directed to my ſiſter. I inſtinctive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived it to be from the fair hand of this enchantreſs; and intreated my ſiſter to diſcloſe the contents. At firſt, ſhe half conſented, but on peruſing it, ſhe refuſed, by ſaying it contained ſomething concerning me, which it was not pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to expoſe. Heavens, think of my emotions at this!—I was ready almoſt to ſeize the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girl, and tear the ſacred treaſure from her pocket!—I begged, perſuaded, and kneeled; but
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032746_0055_0FF4F91809166A80"/>
all was ineffectual, and I was left to conjecture what were the ideas of my firſt aukward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—I prevailed however with Fanny, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe my reſpects in her anſwer.</p>
               <p>AT the approach of duſk, I repaired to the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, idly hoping there to meet this ſylvan god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs; but ah, thought I, after rambling till dark, ſhe now avoids my haunts, and leaves me to my own miſery.—I returned home, and was half murdered on being told, that ſhe had paid a ſhort viſit to my ſiſter in my abſence, and had been obliged to walk home unattended but by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant!—By heavens, I was on the very eve of fury; and dreading the ſuſpicion of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me, I retired to my chamber, where in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretful anguiſh, I ſpent the remainder of the night.</p>
               <p>THUS ſhall I continue to communicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of my paſſion, till they wear out your friendſhip. Have I not an equal claim on your confidence?—Or as yet, is your heart impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the attacks of this tormenting urchin?</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU know it is impoſſible for me to conceal a ſingle thought from your generoſity. It is your kindneſs which unlooſes the bandages of my boſom, and your pity which allays the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar of my grief! In you I have always found a friend to flatter my virtues, and a ſiſter happy in correcting my vices; the laſt, I truſt, have been the unavoidable effects of my firſt and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſfortune.—Yet why need I endeavour to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate my own anguiſh, by diffuſing its influence, and embittering, by a poignant ſympathy, the pure and tranquil joys of which my amiable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria partakes, and to which her ſplendid goodneſs entitles her! Oh, my ſiſter, but for the certainty that your affection delights in the work of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, my woe-worn heart ſhould be the limits of its own diſtreſs: Yea, burſt with plenitude of grief, ere by diſcloſing it, impart one unwelcome ſigh or move a repugnant throb in the tranquil boſom of my ſiſter! Melancholy's diſeaſe and "ſadneſs dire" ſhould devour my frame; till gliding into

an immenſe eternity, my ſad memory, and my woes ſhall ſleep together in a breathleſs grave!</p>
               <p>OH, Maria, how keen, how exquiſitely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing are my preſent ſenſations! My huſband—(alas, the revered name allied to him is profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!) has juſt left me in a paroxiſm of frenzy! As I write I tremble at the recollection of his words! My heart heaves the oppreſſive ſigh, and all my faculties are ſtupified by the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of terror; yet believe me, it is a mild for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of grief, an intermiſſion of woe, thus in friendſhip to avow my ſecret reflections.</p>
               <p>A FEW days paſt, having no reaſon to expect the ſociety of Miſs Alfred, I left the houſe early in the afternoon, to loiter away the tedious time; and, if poſſible, forget the wretchedneſs of my ſituation, by devoting my mind to a pious admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the beauties and bleſſings of nature.—The air was attuned to penſiveneſs; the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs canopy of heaven's etherial blue was varied only by a few ſcattered fleecy-clouds; the ſun ſhone in its mildeſt ſplendour, from whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the branches of innumerable trees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed a meandering foot-path; the concert of birds, fearleſsly friſking on the ground, complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſcene of magnificence and peace through
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032746_0058_0FF4F91FF1C9B658"/>
which I wandered. At length, after a tedious circuit, I arrived at the grotto, to which, with a book, I have uſually repaired in the moments of mental affliction. Here, reclining on the ſoft boſom of the earth, I retraced the pathetic epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Eloiſa, till I became entranced in a gentle ſlumber. Oh, Maria, in this ſhort interval of life, (for ſuch it may be called, as in it I forgot my relation to the world) a benignant ray of bliſs flaſhed through my perturbed boſom; and even when returned to this "vale of tears," the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of fancied joy diſſuſed a momentary happineſs.—The volume, which for once had been my opiate, had diſappeared, by what ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural means I was unable to diſcover. Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this circumſtance, I precipitately left the place and hurried home; where, entering ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, I found Mr. Franks in converſation with a young gentleman, a ſtranger, till he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to me as Mr. Alfred, brother to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable friend. On his introduction he exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a peculiar degree of youthful modeſty and embaraſſment; which was, no doubt, heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the abrupt manner of my entrance, and the conſequent incoherence of my manners. It was not long, however, before he aroſe to depart; when, deſiring to be remembered to his ſiſter, we both accompanied him through the hall to the

door, at which, as he croſſed the platform, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked to Mr. Franks, with no other deſign than to pleaſe him by an innocent compliment on his young acquaintance, that nature appeared partial to this happy family, in laviſhing on its children, the accompliſhments of mind and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Oh, luckleſs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>! It ſprung invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary from my heart: It was but an harmleſs ſpark of that general affection which had been conceived for the whole family, by a knowledge of the merits of Miſs Alfred!—But the cruelty of my huſband replied with this uncouth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:—" Curſe on the vanity of your heart! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that child bluſhes at your preſence, you would ſacrifice him to coquetry!" At which he left the houſe, and was abſent till late in the evening.</p>
               <p>ALAS, Maria, is it not always thus where affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not controul, that caprice, petulance, and pride aſſume command?—To you, from whoſe pen I need not dread the ſeverity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt cenſure, I will candidly declare, (and tell me, wherein is the guilt?) that young Alfred in his perſon is not leſs graceful than his charming ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to which is added an accompliſhment as amiable as it is extraordinary in his ſex; that is, a bluſhing modeſty and politeneſs, the general

inmates of true merit. His eyes are of the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hue, conſtantly ſparkling with feeling; and his countenance, tout enſemble, is the picture of ſentiment.—Pardon me, ſiſter, if in thus breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſe on the brother of my ſecond beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, I overleap in expreſſion the reſtraints of cuſtom and the world. Your own liberal mind will provide a ſufficient apology;—nay, does not virtue itſelf ſanctify the deed? Is merit eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;—and ſhall it not be extolled? Is beauty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable;—and ſhall it not be praiſed? Is virtue amiable;—ſhall it not be eſteemed? Or does a ſtate of matrimony interdict the utterance of praiſe?

               </q>
               <p>I HAVE ſomewhere before obſerved, that firſt impreſſions invariably ſtamp the future character of a man; particularly in the eſtimation of the ladies. A diſguſt produced by improper conduct at a firſt interview, is immutable; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the offender is ever after avoided: On the other hand, a certain lucky deportment, which ſome men inherit from nature, is ſure to win the partiality of the fair;—a partiality which, by ſubſequent addreſs, is eaſily converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into love. In ſhort, I believe, the fly urchin always approaches the female heart in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of eſteem; and only after obtaining admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, unmaſks himſelf.</p>
               <p>So far from diſcountenancing your paſſion, it is my ſincere wiſh that, by a perſeverance in the purſuit, you will evince to the object the ſincerity of your motives. Nay, my friend, it would be meritorious, to ſoothe the aching boſom of this beautiful wife, whom you mention as having been
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032746_0063_0FF4F9343A47B168"/>
forced into the "rude embrace" of her preſon huſband; and, by a conduct marked with care and affection, rob the ſelfiſh wretch of that which he never poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>To conceive of crime, we muſt previouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an idea of guilt concealed in the heart. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives being the only true criterion by which to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the relative quality of action, it is not juſt to cull precipitant opinions from ſuperficial out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of conduct; but muſt probe and anatomize the heart and its propelling principles. Hence, if you have candidly avowed the reality of your feelings on this occaſion, your paſſion, being the ſpontaneous effect of a conviction of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merit in the object, is virtuous and laudable. It is true, the world, the terrible world, will frown on your advances:—Your beloved too, will ſtart with affrighted virtue at the dangerous propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—but it is for your love, your art, your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, your addreſs, to harmonize to her principles a conduct, viewed by mankind as the loweſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of female debaſement:—it is for your fortitude to endure the cenſure of an undivided world.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR MARIA,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHAT an intolerable afternoon has my laſt been; waſted in the company of three ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and antiquated women, as well as exiled from the enlivening ſociety of Miſs Alfred!—Even this misfortune, however, has not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: No; it has at leaſt taught me, that our internal faculties, diſunited from external relations, and joined to a malignity of ſpirit, can render us individually more miſerable, than the influence of foreign objects on a mind duly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with patience and virtue. While I liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the decayed victims of envy carping at ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032746_0065_0FF4F9375B7EA2A0"/>
virtue and innocence, I was feelingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to deteſt and avoid beings, who, by a peſtilential banefulneſs, alike deſtroy their own and their neighbour's peace of mind! Of ſuch a character are the ancient Miſs Haywords, whom, in a former letter, I mentioned as comprizing a family in this neighbourhood. Their long-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged viſit at length has been performed; not, however, without ſeveral circumſtances which gave new occaſion for aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>YESTERDAY morning, after an abſence of ſome hours, which is his cuſtom, Mr. Franks return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, informed me in a very courteous manner, that I might expect an early viſit that afternoon from the maiden ladies, our neighbours; add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a tone and emphaſis which betrayed a particular ſolicitude to pleaſe, that every readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be made to receive ſuch reſpectable and valuable viſitors with marked politeneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. After perſonally arranging a variety of articles, and appointing the ſervants to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective duties; nay, even entering the kitchen to enjoin on the girls a grave and decorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, he again haſtily left the houſe without dining! This extraordinary conduct in a man who, believe me, never evinced a deſire to pleaſe a ſoul but himſelf, gave me an uncommon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032746_0066_0FF4F938E786B6A0"/>
and for a conſiderable time afterwards I was totally incapable of directing my mind to any rational object; until reverting to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of my worthy Fanny Alfred, I ſcribbled an incoherent note, requeſting her company in the afternoon: But alas, misfortune deprived me of her ſoothing ſociety! An alarming accident had that morning produced an indiſpoſition, by which my lovely girl was confined to her room! Thus was I doomed to a torture, the approach of which I awaited with a trembling agitation not inferior to that of a criminal at the awful moments preceding the hour of execution.</p>
               <p>AT about three o'clock, an ancient and ſuperb' carriage drove up to the gate; where, Mr. Franks firſt nimbly alighting, with induſtrious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs aſſiſted three old ladies (more the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Macbeth's witches) to deſcend. A deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of their perſons, each of which differed in ſome particular from the other, would require the pencil of Hogarth. Suffice it, they were an humourous triumvirate of living oddities, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frightful either by the ravages of time, or by the more deforming influence of their acrid tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The youngeſt, about fifty, Miſs Harriot, was fantaſtically dreſſed in a crimſon ſattin, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as herſelf, with a large blue ſloath on her
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032746_0067_0FF4F942B5B7A5E0"/>
head. Miſs Charlotte, ſomewhat more advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in years, with a head bounteouſly "ſprinkled with the froſt of time," was not leſs ridiculous in her apparel; adding to a blue ſilk chemiſe, the appendant foppery of brocade ruffles, crape, and a firmament of ſpangles. Miſs Maria, not quite ſeventy, in her appearance, approached moſt to the reſemblance of human nature; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at certain moments, the violent diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her face, occaſioned by the twitch of ſome acute pain, rendered her a being as truly hideous as were her ſiſters ludicrous!</p>
               <p>THIS groupe I uſhered into the hall; where, after a number of laughable perplexities, ariſing from their aukward decrepitude, they ſucceeded in ſeating themſelves. "Mercy," cried Miſs Harriot, how intolerably warm this place is!"—"Heaven!" added Miſs Charlotte, "warm, ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! I am ſure it is very pleaſant,"—" Pleaſant!; exclaimed Marian, "I fear I ſhall imbibe my death of cold; the current of air that paſſes this avenue is ſo highly ſaturate I with moiſture and cold." While thus, in ſucceſſional exclamations, they diſcovered their conſtitutional climes of temperature, their active gallant was buſy in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding refreſhments, and I ſilently gazing at the ridiculouſneſs of their grimace and diſcourſe. A
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032746_0068_0FF4F94448294B60"/>
deſultory converſation enſued; from which I learnt, that theſe ladies, from certain incidents in early life, had imbibed a miſanthrophic prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the venom of which they infuſed to all their actions and words. They murder the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of character with delightful enthuſiaſm; and exult while wallowing in the guiltleſs blood of injured reputation. Yes, Maria, they are the worſt of aſſaſſins; for they murder indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately the hopes of the children of virtue, and ſtrangle the juſt ſame of ſucceſsful innocence!</p>
               <p>AMONG the number of victims to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, I was ſentenced to hear included my dear and innocent friend, Miſs Alfred. Miſs Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, the apparent favorite of Mr. Franks, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a rapid harangue with a vile and calumniat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſinuation againſt the character of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Fanny. Without any knowledge of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or connexions, ſhe maliciouſly attributed her preſent retirement to ſome diſgraceful amour in the city; to which her envious ſiſters, and, ſhame on him, even Franks, tacitly acceded!—Oh, Maria, at that moment, how did my blood boil with indignation and rage! My already ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered reaſon had almoſt forſook me; and I was on the point of replying to their calumnies in a voice of reproach and contempt, when a gentler
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032746_0069_0FF4F945D51CE458"/>
ſpirit took poſſeſſion of my ſoul, and ſuppreſſed its ardor by a general ſarcaſm at their ſuſpicions, and a continued harſhneſs of expreſſion for the remainder of the viſit; to which they ſeemed as indifferent, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are their minds callous to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of benevolence. At an early hour, however, the fear of "imbibing cold" hurried theſe wretches from my houſe, eſcorted by their former chevalier. I inſtantly flew acroſs the woodland to enquire of the health of my angelic friend, and had the unutterable happineſs of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her chearful and compoſed. On my return home, which was not before duſk, my huſband was ſtill abſent, and did not appear until very late in the evening.</p>
               <p>IT is then in the baneful ſociety of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous waſps, that Franks employs his many hours of abſence; while I, in ſolitary rambles through theſe deſart woods, counting the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of my life, have intercourſe only with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and deſpair!—</p>

OH, my ſiſter, what ſterner curſe is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by deſtiny to complete my wretchedneſs? My huſband,—he who ought to be the firſt to comfort the riſing torment of my heart—files from my preſence with contempt and deriſion! Nay, the more to aggravate my feelings, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves to others with affected courteſy! Oh, that I were caſed againſt ſenſibility, that thereby I might endure without a ſigh theſe meditated marks of indifference, or retaliate with more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable neglect!</p>
               <p>THIS ignoble treatment, Maria, you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, is the effect of no impropriety on my part. From the Amen of our nuptial ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, his demeanour has partook more of lordly and affected ſuperiority, (viewing me as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry menial in his houſhold) than of the tender care and ſolicitude of an indulgent huſband. Oh, how it wrings my ſoul with agony and remorſe, to think of the bliſsful tranſports of a loving pair!</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Oh happy ſtate! where ſouls each other draw,</l>

               </q>
               <p>I OFTEN endeavour to abate the vehemence of this comparative miſery by recurring to the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032746_0071_0FF4F953D5B97278"/>
amuſement of books: But ah, too often this looked-for conſolation proves as ſharp an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by unfolding to my admiration bright ſcenes of bliſs, which, contraſted, reflects a ſable ſhade on my own! Late on the ſame evening, during the abſence of Franks, I opened a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated author on the pleaſures of Solitude, not doubting but that there I ſhould meet with a temporary alleviation of mind;—but alas, a few pages delineated the following picture of aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed felicity:—" Does the tear of ſorrow ſteal down the cheek of one? The other with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wipes it tenderly away. The deepeſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the one are felt with equal poignancy by the other: but what ſorrow can reſiſt the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which flows from an intercourſe of hearts ſo tenderly, ſo intimately, ſo cloſely united! Time flies before them on its ſwifteſt pinions. The car is never tired of the gratification of liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to each other's converſation. The only misfortune of which they have any fear, is the greateſt they can poſlibly experience, the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, of abſence, ſeparation and death."—Alas, where is that tender hand to wipe away the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tears I hourly ſhed? Where that benevolent heart to ſhare in my perpetual ſorrow? Where ſhall I look for a community of ſouls, which, by equally diſtributing the portion of pain, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes

               <p>SINCE the date of your laſt, which, permit me to obſerve, was ſuperabundant in flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, I have enjoyed an unremitted ſucceſſion of happineſs, proceeding from the gradual advances
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032746_0073_0FF4F956F1FFE958"/>
and brightening proſpect of my love.—At leaſt, I may ſay, this new-born paſſion of my mind, which a few days ago crucified my ſenſibility, is no longer painful; but controuls my heart with an hopeful and benign authority. Yet even in this actual enjoyment, I am not forgetful of the poet's intimation;
<q>
                     <l>From hope's keen hand the cup of joy may ſlip,</l>
                     <l>And fall, untaſted, tho' it reach the lip.</l>
                  </q>
and am, therefore, reſolved never to ſuffer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proſperity to dazzle a juſt apprehenſion of future adverſity.</p>
               <p>SINCE my laſt, I have at three different times, beheld and converſed with the dear empreſs of my ſoul. Oh, my friend, I have found that not only her perſon, but her intellects are the niceſt products of natural beauty and art!—To an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly complacency of temper, derived from the favouring hand of creation, ſhe adds a brilliancy of fancy, and a grandeur of conception, ſuperior to the generality of her ſex, and which ſuffuſes the mildneſs of her countenance, with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and intelligence of an angel. In fine, my worthy friend, ſhe is what you would call amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032746_0074_0FF4F960E895A9E8"/>
what you, were you preſent, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from loving and adoring—Yet, alas, this fair and accompliſhed wife, is unhappy!—An early forced marriage, (a palliating term for proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution) has robbed her boſom of its native tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility; and like an heroic captive, ſhe deplores in ſmiles and graces, the curſed chains that fetter her peace and beauty. Each recollective moment crowds her holy boſom with a hoſt of ſighs; and the trembling tears that gliſten in her eye, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically reveal the ſecret ſorrows of their ſource!—Such is the ſituation of her, whoſe anguiſh I would alleviate by my ſympathetic love. Even arrayed in the majeſty of her tears I will addreſs her in the eloquence of my paſſion; by ardent entreaty, ſeduce her memory from retroſpective glances, to the full expectation of bliſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled rapture!</p>
               <p>Two evenings ago, as I fondly meditated on this endearing theme, ſitting in the alcove behind our houſe, my ſilent reverie was interrupted by the appearance of my Charlotte, (for Charlotte I muſt call her, though I ſhould be unwilling to be thought a Werter) croſſing the oppoſite field, in all the majeſty of graceful beauty. An univerſal perturbation prevailed my mind. My eyes were rivetted on her until ſhe approached; when, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032746_0075_0FF4F9628522D1C0"/>
confidence, I cordially ſaluted her, and offered my hand with a familiarity, for which I conceived my youth an apology.—Thus, my friend, I had the tranſport of conducting her through a long hall to the apartment of my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who pleaſantly remarked on the cordiality of our appearance. Here I enjoyed a moſt bleſſed and unreſtrained intercourſe with the arbitreſs of my hopes. With an enthuſiaſm, which I feared often betrayed its deſign and tendency, I ſpoke of the ſublime rapture of lovers; and by indirect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, ſtrove to impreſs her tender mind with a favourable conception of my eſteem. I pauſed and reflected;—nay, I began already to regret the impatience of my love. Methought, the dear idol of my heart, was affected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſerious and reſerved. My ſiſter too, who had often admired the uncommon fervency of my ſtyle, appeared amazed and concerned! Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe apprehenſions I remained tormented until the moment of her departure, when ſhe chearfully accepted my company. Again my reſiſtleſs paſſion broke the bounds of prudence, and thundered in all the fire of zeal; to which, ſhe liſtened with an eagerneſs, that ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a growing approbation of the warm wiſhes laboring at my heart; but when I diſcloſed the circumſtance of the grotto, the manner of ſtealing
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:032746_0076_0FF4F9641258EE10"/>
her volume, and my ſilent extacy in admiring her ſleeping beauty, her eyes ſparkled with emotion, and a crimſon diffidence ſuffuſed her face, with undiſtinguiſhable bluſhes. She continued remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably penſive the remainder of the walk.—On arriving home her huſband was abſent—ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to walk in:—but alas, I could not! De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the courteſy, therefore, with a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I bid her farewell, with a gentle preſſure of her hand. ſhe continued at the door, methought looking after me, till I entered the wood that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the two farms. In this ſilent obſcurity I remained, reflecting on the paſt adventure, till the approach of duſk, and arrived home after dark.</p>
               <p>SINCE then I have viſited her in company with my ſiſter, and on the ſame day, fortunately met her in the bottom of the wood. In both theſe interviews I found her chearful and converſable; but always left her ſerious and reſerved. She would ſometimes look at me, as though affected by my condition, with an eye of tenderneſs: at other times inverting her countenance, ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſpleaſed.—But I will not credit the evidence of my ſenſes, while they intercept the hopes of my ſoul.</p>

The noble nobly pity and relieve.</p>
               <p>I HAVE recently met with a character, whoſe hidden hiſtory engages all my intereſt and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Going to the coffee-houſe a few days paſt, I was introduced by the proprietor to a young man, who, he ſaid, wiſhed for employment in a counting-houſe. His appearance immediately prepoſſeſſed my favour, and offering my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he entered my ſervice with a polite and amiable modeſty. He has ſince convinced me by his attention and talents, that he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy this generoſity.—Yet my friend, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted ſorrow hangs heavily on his brow—op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive ſighs and alternate tears, ſwell his labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boſom or gliſten in his eyes. Perceiving theſe emotions, I ventured to make inquiry of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and offer the aid of my friendſhip to allay its pungency. "Ah, my worthy benefactor," he replied, "what would not generoſity like yours do in common. It ſoothes but cannot cure the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of my ſoul. I once was happy, but the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did world deſtroyed my peace, and my futurity is filled only with woe and deſperation." With this his grief became more vehement, and my anxiety increaſed; but his agony reſiſted the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of friendſhip; and, as if ſelfiſh of tears, he refuſed to excite mine by his narrative. Worldly

                  </gap> made him poor; beſide which, love's poiſon rankles at his heart.—He ſpeaks of Philadelphia with emotions of anguiſh. "There I was born," he ſaid, "and there enjoyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled bliſs. Baniſhed from thence I loſt all peace."—He arrived here in great neceſſity from Bermuda, where he had been carried and robbed of his little all, by the infamous violaters of our commerce and independence. His countenance is extremely intereſting, and has once been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; his manners are courteous and polite; his converſation intelligent, and his minuteſt actions are evidences of a ſuperior education.—He calls himſelf Tallman, and has been bred to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile profeſſion; but this is all of his life and family that he will diſcloſe, ſaying, "'Tis better to live unpitied, than to die lamented,"</p>
               <p>THERE is one circumſtance remarkable in the caſe of this youth. His application to buſineſs ſeems to intermit his grief. As, when he reflects on his misfortunes, his faculties are all abſorbed in agony, ſo when he turns his mind to other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, his miſfortunes are forgotten. This fact has led me to create a variety of objects for his attention, in hopes of weening him from grief. Should I proſper in the endeavour, believe me, I would not barter feelings with a monarch.</p>

THUS it is, my worthy friend, that captious fortune, plays with the brave and noble! Thus the impreſſive boſom of youthful innocence is early ſtrewed with the thorns of adverſity!—While you are engaged in the fond rapture of love's purſuit, and quaffing the nectar of the gods, I will enjoy the firſt of human bleſſings, that of "removing a brother's woe." While you are endeavoring to conquer an amiable woman, I will ſtrive to reſtore to ſociety, a worthy and uſeful citizen.</p>

               <p>OH my ſiſter, had I that ſternneſs of reaſon with which you are ſo happily endowed, I could either avoid thoſe diſtreſſes, or meet them with fortitude. But ah, I am weak of mind, and even criminally ſuſceptible!—Sentiment will finally deſtroy me! The oppreſſion of affliction ſinks me into ſtupid wretchedneſs, and as I write, even to you, thou gentle angel of conſolation, my heart bleeds with reiterated woes.—The engaging Charles Alfred, who firſt appeared to me under the auſpices of friendſhip, being the affectionate brother of her, whom next to you I eſteem, has addreſſed me in the plain language of affection.

Alas, he ſaid every thing but that he loved, and that his eyes and conduct unequivocally declared. I have liſtened to his eloquence at two particular periods, at which his behaviour obtained all my pity; but in a third, Maria, his ſad ſeriouſneſs alarmed my duty. He met me in the boſom of an immenſe wood, where often I rambled in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſolitude. There he unchecked the ſtream of eloquence and love, which he ſaid, had long been the ſource of rapture and of anguiſh!—His words affected my ſoul; and methought, while he argued againſt the ſelfiſh barriers of the world oppoſed to mutual love, their former ſacredneſs tumbled into inſignificance. But I reſtrained the impulſe of ardent ſentiment, and being about to return home, inſiſted on his not accompanying me; to which he complied, but with obvious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, which increaſed the keenneſs of my feelings; and alſo ſlipped into my hands, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing poetic effuſion:</p>

               <p>THE unexpected arrival of ſeveral of our veſſels from India, obliges the partnerſhip to call you from your happy retirement. We, however, anticipate your ready and cheerful compliance; more eſpecially when you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the preſent urgency of buſineſs will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you no longer than a week or ten days; by which ſhort interval from pleaſure your return to the delights of the country will be rendered more agreeable.</p>
               <p>INFORM my Fanny that by theſe veſſels I have obtained intelligence of her young favorite, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wellsford. After arriving at Canton, and diſcharging his duty to his owners, he accepted a lucrative appointment in the principal manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of that place. Here he ſerved with repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and fortune, until June in laſt year; when, converting his money into valuable merchandize, he chartered an American ſhip, and ſailed for Bourdeaux in France; after which my infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant heard nothing further. It is probable, he

               <p>YOUR laſt was indeed a welcome cordial to my agitated boſom. Its tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents ſuſpended the rigor of reflection; and for a time my mind was tranquillized in the oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enjoyment of your love and ſympathy. But ah, theſe kind intervals of joy ſeem reſerved only to embitter ſome ſucceeding diſaſter! Theſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient flaſhes of delight are the unerring preludes to the thunder of diſtreſs!—I had juſt diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the truſty Hannah with my important note to young Alfred, who I beheld croſſing the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite held, when a ſervant delivered your epiſtle. Already had a momentary regret for this ſtep ſeized my mind; but your timely approbation diſſipated its influence, and confirmed me in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the meaſure as indiſpenſibly neceſſary, as well to avert my own miſery as the deſtruction of the principles of this amiable youth. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of my addreſs to the undeſigning lad. Alas, thought I, as I wrote it, I have already wounded his tranquillity! How ungenerous then, will it be,—how cruel, to add to his preſent unhappineſs, the poignancy of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or the ſeverity of anger! My words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were of the gentleſt kind, ſelected by ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and reſpect. He anſwered it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; and oh, my ſiſter, his expreſſions, more unequivocal than ever, convinced me he had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated through the incautious veil of my words. At one moment, my wicked heart was mortified at the ſeeming indifference he expreſſed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my requeſt; at the next, my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was aſtoniſhed by the cogency of his reaſon; and finally, I was overwhelmed by a ſilent ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, from the circumſtance of his perſiſting in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing the influence of a feeling, which, although
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032746_0094_0FF4F9A71ECC2F90"/>
abſtractedly harmleſs, in our ſituation, would prove imminently dangerous.</p>
               <p>OH, Maria, teach me the ſtubborn principles of matrimonial duty: Learn me the art, for it is not nature, of looking on merit and demerit, on virtue and vice, with indiſcriminate eyes, and an unmoved heart; for, to be happy, I muſt be inſenſible to either.</p>
               <p>HE has detained my billet as an hoſtage for another interview. Alas, dare I tempt the edge of that reſiſtleſs vortex whoſe gulph is horror and remorſe? Yet why do I aſk? 'Tis vain in my heart to attempt to allay its anguiſh by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſociety of him whoſe preſence is rapture, and whoſe abſence already ſaddens my joy!—I overhear ſomebody entering below! It is my Fanny no doubt. Farewell, for the preſent.</p>
               <p>—OH hide me, hide me, from the cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world! Hide me, if poſſible, from myſelf! Maria, even deny me your pity; nor ſuffer thy hallowed tears to flow in ſympathy for a wretch whoſe misfortunes are the effects of her crimes!—Crimes! did I ſay?—Oh heavens! Gracious God, wherein am I guilty? Is the purity of my
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032746_0095_0FF4F9A8AEFC5DB8"/>
ſoul contaminated by the exerciſe of principles which thou haſt planted in my nature? Can na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's milk-white innocence become demoniac, by indulging her greateſt, firſt prerogative? Is virtue a certain divine attribute of the mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed at creation, or is it but a viſionary creature of the world's invention? I feel it to be a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple immutable and eternal. The proud efforts of men to modify or counterfeit its characters, are the ſchemes of impiety, or the machinations of fiends.</p>
               <p>ADIEU, until I compoſe my mind.</p>
               <p>THE foregoing reflections have tended gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to ſubſide my deſpair, and my reaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a tempeſtuous tumult, is calm enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the circumſtance which took place on firſt leaving my pen. Alas, inſtead of meeting my endeared Fanny, I ruſhed into the parlour, and there was aſtoniſhed with the perſon of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! He was ſtanding in the middle of the room, his hat in his hand, and dreſſed in a riding-ſuit. My emotion was obvious:—He bluſhed; and after an expreſſive bow, begged me to forgive the freedom he aſſumed:—"If, madam," ſaid
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032746_0096_0FF4F9AA3A0681E8"/>
he, "I encroach on the decorum of the world by this unlooked-for viſit, impute it not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; but to the innocence of my years and the fervency of my eſteem." Oh, Maria, I looked forgiveneſs! For the impatient youth, darting his love-fraught eyes upon my countenance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my being able to reply, ſo dumb was my confuſion, added:—"Alas, madam, I am ſoon to be torn from your dear ſociety, by the urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of my father's affairs in the city! Oh, at a juncture, which, of all my life, I ſhould prefer to devote to retirement and friendſhip, I am dragged to the labor of a counting-houſe and the more loathſome noiſe of the city! But eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed madam, no motives could induce me to depart without performing my obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this diſtreſsful paper, and with it thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly implore from your lips a pardon for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent temerity." Oh, ſiſter, can you poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the agitated tumult of my mind, on hearing this tender addreſs, proceeding from one I ſo highly eſteemed, and kneeling at my feet, with tears gliſtening through the fire of his eyes, and perſuaſive eloquence glowing on his lips! I continued inſenſibly ſilent, until the load at my heart burſting from my eyes, afforded an alleviation by a torrent of tears; after which I ſucceeded in making a fau'tering and, I fear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032746_0097_0FF4F9ABCFA606F8"/>
reply.—Oh, Maria, yet do I fear, that in the frenzy of my ſoftened ſoul, my unguided tongue betrayed thoſe unholy feelings at my heart, to conceal which I had inwardly ſworn! He left me, ſiſter, with joy dancing in his face: His eyes, brim-full of ſentiment, fixed upon me; one hand on his breaſt, the other raiſed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, as he retired ſaying: "Adieu, dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt madam: Your heavenly tears interpret my happineſs:—I will be obedient:—Farewell!"—Oh, my angel of peace, to your friendſhip I fly for pity and forgiveneſs! Can I deſerve pity, and not hope forgiveneſs? Is my ſoul vitally tainted by a vicious attachment; or are my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent feelings only the temporary effects of an impreſſive ſenſibility? Oh write to me of the attributes of virtue! Illuſtrate to my immature judgment that metaphyſical nicety by which love is diſcriminated from friendſhip!</p>

               <p>YOUR abſence from the country has diſpenſed a gloomineſs over all our features. Even my amiable friend, Mrs. Franks, languiſhes for the period of your return. Indeed, Charles, you are highly eſteemed by this worthy lady; and I am ſure your generoſity will induce you to purſue every polite means of meriting her friendſhip. She is of all the ſex the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, feeling, and affectionate. If ſhe has any foible it conſiſts in an exuberant ſuſceptibility, which might be rendered a dangerous part of her nature, by a villainous influence from the other ſex. Sometimes, when ſhe burſts forth in the fervor of ſentiment, I fear ſhe leaps the bounds of delicacy and religion. But ſhe has never acquired the faſhionable art of diſguiſe; and although the tyranny of cuſtom has been exerciſed to trammel the body, her mind retains its natural liberty, and ſoars undaunted to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of love and friendſhip. I aſſure you, ſhe appears peculiarly anxious for your return, and ſays, with a ſmile, that from the manner of your

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR laſt, ſo fraught with genuine diſtreſs, arrived at a moment when my whole ſoul was agitated by a pathetic fact, which has recently occurred in this city.—Alas, my dear girl, it is not you alone whom calamity viſits:—the ſons and daughters of affliction are as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032746_0100_0FF4F9C6B24C53D8"/>
as the votaries of humanity:—Sympathy need never be idle; and the tear of pity may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly trickle from the eye of tenderneſs, while bigotry, avarice, and vanity violate the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive boſom of innocence and love.</p>
               <p>SINCE our eſtabliſhment in this city, among the acquaintances we have formed, a family of the name of Williams, conſiſting of a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble father and mother, and three dutiful ſons, has not been the leaſt flattering and agreeable. My earlieſt obſervation in it, was the ſincere paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which the eldeſt ſon conſtantly avowed for a neighboring female, whoſe parents, though not in the habit of intimacy with his, were ever cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and polite to his addreſſes. A mutual and and unvaried affection had ſubſiſted between them from their infancy, and, "growing with their growth," the time had now arrived in which they anticipated the unbounded fruition of their juvenile hopes. Their parents, having hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tacitly acquieſced in their union, beheld with unutterable pleaſure the ceaſeleſs conſtancy of their children, which could be productive of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the moſt unmingled happineſs to all. The day of feſtive gladneſs was appointed, and Mr. Williams, in order to equalize his ſon's eſtate with the expected affluence of his daughter-in-law,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032746_0101_0FF4F9C843AA9558"/>
purchaſed an elegant houſe, and furniſhed it with every article of grandeur and convenience; beſides a handſome donation in caſh, which he reſerved for the day of celebration. The bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and expectant hour opened to the warm feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the young lovers a thouſand ſcenes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted joy—a thouſand ſources of ineffable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Louiſa already looked upon Henry as the plighted huſband of her ſoul, and poured into his boſom her unreſtrained confidence; while he, with feelings equally elated, made her the ſupreme miſtreſs of his thoughts!—Thus did the rapturous ſcene glow in their vivid imaginations, and tantalize expectation, when the ſordid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Louiſa, taking her to their cloſet, thus addreſſed her:—"Dear Louiſa, your happineſs and future comfort being the only hope and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our lives, we have with pleaſure beheld, and cheriſhed with parental indulgence, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous paſſion you have long felt for Henry Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams. In three days more our period of duty and authority will expire; and before this we earneſtly wiſh by one dictate of prudence, well to conclude the work ever nigheſt our hearts."—The aſtoniſhed Louiſa, unable to diſcern the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this ambiguous exordium, remained penſively ſilent; and her father continued;—"You know the diſparity of young Williams'
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032746_0102_0FF4F9D1ADCF1CA0"/>
fortune, and the thoughtleſſneſs of men of his profeſſion and years—Let us then beſeech you, as you regard your future welfare and our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn requeſt, the laſt perhaps, we ſhall ever end join, previous to your marriage, to call for an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney and confirm on your children, the fortune left you by your uncle: what we are able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow will equal, if not exceed the fortune of your huſband."—Louiſa was all comprehenſion, and looking with an eye of affection firſt at her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mother, and then her father, ſhe exclaimed, "Is it poſſible, father, that he, to whoſe honour and fidelity I am to commit my perſon and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious happineſs, is deemed unworthy to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a trifling ſum of paltry gold!"—and turning, with a ſigh acceded to the propoſition of her parents, as the only means of reconciling them to participate in their approaching bliſs. An attorney was obtained, and her fortune of five thouſand pounds ſecured to the offspring of her legal marriage, and forever wreſted from the touch of her huſband. Their exulting parents beheld the nigh approach of their children's happineſs, with accumulated tranſport! The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured Henry forſook the world; and devoted his time to the retired ſociety of his amiable Louiſa:—Louiſa diſcloſed the ungenerous deed ſhe had been obliged to perform.—Its ſuſpicious
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032746_0103_0FF4F9D34019AA50"/>
aſpect, and concealed proceſs, enraged the pride of his ſoul!—He flew to his father, related the inſiduous act, and with aggravated frenzy curſed the foul and penurious machination!—His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, naturally of a high and independent ſpirit, heard his ſon with mortified ambition, and in flames of vindictive manlineſs haſtened to the preſence of the parents of Louiſa—They receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with cordiality; but their demeanour was ſoon changed into coldneſs and reproach, by his unbridled vehemence; and after a clamorous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation, in which the agonized Louiſa mingled her tears, he left them with a ſolemn denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the match, and an imprecation on their iniquitous penury. All intercourſe between the parties was interdicted; the houſe, furniture, &amp;c. purchaſed by Mr. Williams, re-ſold, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſolemnization annihilated.</p>
               <p>—Here, Caroline, pauſe, and enquire of your ſoul, if this horrid tale could thus conclude? Say, my ſiſter, is it poſſible to your conception, that the divine and unadulterated fervor of this young pair, could, by this interpoſition of avarice, be reſolved into apathy and indifference?—Could that celeſtial paſſion, whoſe weakeſt votary has ſurvived the ſhocks of fate, become extinct by a
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032746_0104_0FF4F9D4CF2DAE60"/>
mere artifice of parental covetousneſs?—No, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, it is inconſiſtent with nature and nature's God.</p>
               <p>LOUISA'S anguiſh at this diſaſtrous event is not to be deſcribed!—After uttering her grief in the agony of tears and lamentation, ſhe droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a ſettled melancholy. Immured in her chamber, and refuſing the comfort of the world, her lonely reflections aggravated the deletery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of her miſfortune: She gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; and in a few months, her relentleſs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents beheld the awful advances of their child's diſſolution; which ſhe viewed with a placid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of ſoul. "Death, like a friend" indeed, ſeemed to ſuccour her affliction: and by a gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and mild operation, terminated the bitter pangs of her heart. Yet even at the ſolemn pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of her decline, her mind dwelt on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and love of Henry with delightful exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and in departing from her ſorrowing friends, forever cloſed her quivering lips in pronouncing his beloved name! Her fate reached the ears of the frantic Henry, who, until this time, had been kept ignorant even of her indiſpoſition! He flew to the houſe,—but at firſt was denied this laſt ſad pleaſure of beholding his lifeleſs Louiſa!—He was, however, admitted for a few minutes,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032746_0105_0FF4F9D662192810"/>
on cruel conditions. Leaning on the arm of his younger brother as he croſſed the aiſle which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the ſolemn apartment, his weakened ſenſes ſtarted at the melancholy idea, and for a time an univerſal agony rendered him unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his real ſituation.—He entered the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened room, and approaching the coffin, beheld his lately blooming love beautiful even in the frozen arms of death!—"Oh!" he exclaimed; but his ſurcharged heart guſhing from his eyes, obſtructed the farther utterance of his grief. He gazed on the cold eloquence of her face; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his hand her palſied cheek; and with a kiſs whoſe ardor ſeemed to breathe his ſoul to the object, was dragged from the tragic ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle!</p>
               <p>HE attended the funeral rites; and ſince has been continually abſorbed in ſilent ſorrow! His ſoul, at times, ſeems abſtracted from his body, and in relapſing from his reveries, he often fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently exclaims, "I have ſeen my Louiſa! She is with her kindred ſpirits in bliſs; and I ſhall ſoon be happy!"—While he thus paces in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the ſame grave which encloſes his hopes of life and felicity, his loving parents, oppreſſed with age and affliction, are hourly progreſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their end. Sorrow has raiſed her banner
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:032746_0106_0FF4F9DF941ADDA8"/>
in the family; while the parents of Louiſa, in performing the pageantry of mourning, forget the cauſe and object of their grief.</p>
               <p>FROM this intereſting narrative, my love, you will perceive, that, although others of your ſex endure not the ſame diſtreſſes to which you are deſtined, they are not wholly exempt from the aſperities of fate. Alas, be not covetous of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: but learn from this reflection, that all are either the Victims of Sentiment or the dupes of paſſion, how deſirable it is to acquire a mind pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in ſuffering, and a ſoul indignant of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Author thinks it here proper to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the outlines of the hiſtory contained in Letter XXV. were ſketched from an incident in real life, which occurred, not in New-York, as is mentioned, but in Philadelphia.</note>

               <p>FROM the date of this you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve I have ſuddenly removed from the mild ſcenes of love and innocence to the buſy metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of the American world.—Yes, friend, at a moment when the criſis of my love was tottering on the balance of thought; while I was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the heavy cenſure of my Charlotte, a diſpatch from my father demanded my immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate preſence in this city!—My relunctant ſoul fluttered between duty and love; until at length, the former prevailing, I hurried to the city, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a pathetic farewell; abandoning the joys of love and retirement, for the purſuits and labor of a counting-houſe! But even in the midſt of this perplexity, my aſtounded hopes were revived by the flattering emotions of her I love, on the viſit I made to bid her adieu!</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Yet ſtill I love; with rapture I admire;</l>

KNOW firſt, my friend, that the rapturous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview of the grove, which I mentioned in my laſt, and in which I partly gave vent to the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of my ſoul, had nigh been the finalle of our intercourſe! The watchful prudence of my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friend, though apparently pleaſed with the language of my paſſion while I expreſſed it, on returning home became highly incenſed, and the day following honored me with a ſhort epiſtle, written with the eaſe and elegance of Rowe, in which the idea of my love was reprobated as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with her duty and my own honor; adding a ſolemn injunction in perpetual ſilence on my lips.—Think, my friend, with what a trembling anxiety I received the important let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!—My eager eyes flew quickly over her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der admonition: while my heart leaped with alternate hopes and fears!—The female ſervant who delivered the note, returning without an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of any kind, I was left to indulge in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of her, who even in aſſumed harſhneſs, proved her heart ſoft and compaſſionate! Yes, Bill, it was plain, that while her pen obeyed the impulſe of neceſſity, in cenſuring my love, the wound intended for me was felt more ſeverely by herſelf! She relied tenderly on my friendſhip; and hoped, (oh, think of my tranſport at theſe
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032746_0109_0FF4F9E66BA683C8"/>
words!) that her denial of love would not alſo exclude the calmer pleaſures of eſteem.</p>
               <p>I AFTERWARDS returned a ſtudied anſwer to her communication; in which I endeavoured, by a complication of feelings, at leaſt to convince her of the purity of my attachment, and the fidelity of my heart, if not to produce in her mind a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent congenial with my own. In this event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poſture ſtood affairs, when the requiſition of my father's partnerſhip arrived, whereby I was conſtrained to part without knowing the iſſue of our altercation!</p>
               <p>Mr Charlotte was the laſt ſweet object of my eyes on leaving the country.—The beauty of her face ſhone through the brilliancy of the tears in which it was dreſſed, ſupported by the arm of a ſopha, as I withdrew from her preſence! Tears,—alas, not of ſorrow for my departure; but, more probably, the bitter alleviation of a ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling virtue in her breaſt!—A letter from my ſiſter has conſiderably tranquillized the uproar of my feelings; inaſmuch as it kindly intimates, that my abſence has produced a general regret. This information ſpurs my anxiety to return;
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:032746_0110_0FF4F9ED5880B868"/>
which I expect in the courſe of a few days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til when farewell,</p>

               <p>—YOUR paſſion, it is evident, has paſſed the rubicon! The die is caſt! Charlotte's wounded heart throbs only as your influence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects; and by a judicious artfulneſs, you may ſoon aſcend to voluptuous bliſs, and be the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Nabob of her charms!</p>
               <p>I AM aware, this ſalutation will almoſt diſguſt the tenacious chaſtity of your love; becauſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032746_0111_0FF4F9EEE656C608"/>
enamoured as you are with your miſtreſs, your innocent, boyiſh heart conceives of no rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but that which flows from virtuous love!—Yet, believe me, what I have heretofore obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in extenuation of the principles of your amour, is emphatically applicable to the full conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The ſame pure and guiltleſs ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which at firſt glow in the breaſts of a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pair, are ſtrengthened and diffuſed by this confirming teſtimonial of mutual confidence:—Nay, the trembling flame, which before was lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expire at the firſt blaſt of coolneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, by this undying touch of extacy, is converted into an everlaſting blaze in each, which reciprocally warms, vivifies, and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens both. The joy of ſouls thus reciprocally exchanged is ſublimely ineffable.</p>
               <p>BUT in thus reaſoning in your behalf, I wiſh not to implicate a defence of thoſe females, who, not from a deſire to evince the ſincere ardency of their love, but from wild infatuation, proſtitute their virtue and charms, by falling into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful embraces of a treacherous ſeducer. A young female, who, in all her affections, ſhould ever have a fixed eye on matrimony, in ſo yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the perſuaſions of a villainous lover, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a weakneſs of virtue equal to her ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032746_0112_0FF4F9F0733E6C68"/>
of mind; whereas, a forced wife, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as is your heroine, and feeling for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that celeſtial glow which ſhe never felt for her huſband, affords a doubtleſs proof of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of her attachment, by a ſurrender of her perſon; and in that act ſhe is leſs guilty than thoſe who before dragged her to the bed of one, the embraces of whom, though ſanctioned by human laws, were a violation of natural virtue and of juſtice.</p>
               <p>THE intereſting melancholy of my young ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance reſiſts all the conſolatory efforts of friendſhip.—I prevailed on him laſt evening to accompany me to the theatre, at the performance of Shakeſpear's Hamlet. For a time, the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of the houſe, the "ornaments of the box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es," and the ſpirit of the ocheſtra, ſo far engaged his admiration, as to ſhoot tranſient ſparkles of joy in his face, the firſt I have ever obſerved:—But the progreſs of the tragedy reſtored his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al look of melancholy. At times, he would eye the charming Mrs. Marſhall, in Ophelia, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of amazement, and inquire, "Who is ſhe? What's her name?" Being anſwered, he exclaimed with a ſigh, "Heavens, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> frantic am I!"</p>

                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:032746_0113_0FF4F9F3209BBB88"/>
NEXT I obſerved his emotions increaſing, by the character of the hero; whoſe peculiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſentiment was admirably expreſſed in the appearance and action of my theatrical friend, young Moreton. When he pronounced the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquy in Act III. Scene Firſt, Tallman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo violently indiſpoſed as to be obliged to be conducted home; where he has been ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his bed by a violent fever, with intervals of delirium! To-day, however, I am happy to find his illneſs has conſiderably abated. He is inceſſantly begging me to pardon, what he calls, his unthankful inconvenience, ſaying, "It will not be long thus! By your leave, my friend, as ſoon as my health may permit, I will repair to Philadelphia, where I have friends; and oh, where even friendleſs, I may die with joy!" Do, Charles, for virtue's ſake, make ſome inquiries of your friends in the city, concerning the family and connexions of one Henry Tallman, a youth about twenty years of age, or upwards. He is a victim of that tyrant who at preſent controuls your varying hopes!</p>

               <p>THINK not, eſteemed Harriot, that the friendly hint ſuggeſted in our laſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has depreciated your amiable qualities in my eſtimation. My recent abſence from your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſociety, is indeed, the conſequence of your benevolent inſinuations; yet by no means produced by a diſguſt for the motive, but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reverence of the generous principles of your heart, the innocence of your mind, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſanctity of your diſcloſure.</p>
               <p>YES, my worthy friend, the faithleſs partner of my bed, is, if not criminally attached to, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably concentred in the affections of, young Alfred!—She forgets or neglects the avocations of domeſtic life, and even avoids him to whom ſhe is ſolemnly allianced by both religion and law!—Oh could I deſcribe the mixed and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized reflections of my mind on this curſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery!—But it is impoſſible for human lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage competently to expreſs the complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed feelings of a huſband, who, after a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting ſeries of indifference to his wife—af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter looking on her, and treating her, only as a neceſſary utenſil—beholds the ſame ſentiments
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032746_0115_0FF4F9FD7959DE98"/>
and the ſame practices retorted on himſelf!—It is not the vivid fire of jealouſy that awakens my torpid ſoul:—no, jealouſy is the ſiſter of genuine love; and we can only be ſelfiſhly watchful, or jealouſly careful of that which is to us intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dear and eſtimable.—But alas, have I ever felt, (oh infamy!) have I ever avowed, a fond or tender ſentiment for my treacherous wife? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this pungent conſciouſneſs, after leaving your inſtructive company, and met her with a ſoul enraged with latent vindictiveneſs!—She appeared remarkably depreſſed in ſpirits, and ſeemingly replied to my fearful interrogatories with a conſcious timidity; which I was about aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing to a predictive omen of my deſcovery, when the appearance of Miſs Alfred and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent diſcourſe between the two, diſcloſed the momentous cauſe of her ſadneſs!—Her <hi>petit maitre,</hi> Harriot, is on a viſit to the city!—and ſhe (impreſſive creature!) pines in ſilence at his diſtreſſing abſence!</p>
               <p>FROM the obſervation of this circumſtance, I am induced to believe, that my unthinking and gay wife indulges a reprehenſible partiality for the accompliſhments of young Alfred; but philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy explodes the poſſibility of its ever ſwelling into a criminal intercourſe—Oh, were I to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

the occurrence of this dreaded event, the tormenting foreſight would convulſe my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to death!—But my pitying friend, as you from motives of generoſity, firſt ſuggeſted to my fears the danger of my honour, ſo alſo do you from motives of mercy, aſſiſt me to repel the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of jealouſy, that accurſed fiend to matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Rather blind my perception to confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidence, and ſo keep me in tranquil inſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than by ſharpening the acuteneſs of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, open on my ſoul the reſiſtleſs ſluices of unutterable anguiſh!—Do this, my Harriot, and you will evince yourſelf the friend of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,</p>

               <p>RETURNING to this theatre of bliſs, my heart prancing more nimbly than the horſe, I met with an incident which not only detained me ſeveral hours from the object of my love, but alſo excited much ſympathetic ſorrow!</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:032746_0119_0FF4FA0C15234910"/>
I LEFT the city about three o'clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and having ſlowly rode a few miles, halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a ſmall hut, ſituated at the foot of a hill, covered with lofty oaks, to repay an obligation formerly conferred on me by the ruſtic inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. Abruptly entering the humble roof, I was ſtartled at the appearance of diſtreſs evident in the melancholy countenances of the mother and her three ſobbing children! She ſitting on a ruſh chair, preſſing a ſcreaming infant to her breaſt, mingling with its milk the tears of her affliction; while the two eider children, leaning on each ſide, catched the bitter ſighs of their mother with tender hearts which ſeemed to float in the water of their eyes!—I impatiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the father of the family, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their diſtreſsful condition; to which the diſtracted wife replied by exclaiming, "Oh, heaven only knows where or how Philip is!"—This heightened the firſt impreſſions of wonder. The wretched woman being unable, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of her tears, to afford the neceſſary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I had recourſe to the eldeſt daughter, though a child, who was equally affected with the family diſtreſs, yet leſs violent than her fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic mother.—"Oh, ſir," ſaid ſhe, wiping with a homeſpun apron the big tears which "rolled her blooming cheeks adown," "my dear, poor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032746_0120_0FF4FA0DA89BA140"/>
is loſt in town! Yeſterday, our rent being due, his landlord told him to quit the houſe or pay the money before to-night. He therefore, gathered all his fruit, and ſo on, and went to market, expecting to return at night with enough to ſatisfy our cruel landlord; but oh, he has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come; and to-night mamma, I, ſiſter, and dear little Philip muſt all lay in the wood!"—This ſorrowful tale unravelled the myſtery of the affecting ſcene before me. I comforted the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with ſmall preſents; and delivering to their mother the amount of the rent due, left them in a ſtate more tranquil than that in which I had found them.</p>
               <p>ON returning to the door, my horſe, whom I had left hitched to a ſence, becoming impatient of my ſtay, had ſlipped his bridle and abſcond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaving me to follow on foot. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was extremely unwelcome, it being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance home, and the ſun, throwing his farewell glances on the tops of the foreſts, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the approach of darkneſs. As I advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the familiar ſcenes of my recent pleaſures, my heart bounded with rapture and delight!

My unexpected appearance, and the manner, aſtoniſhed the old lady; which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by equal amazement on my part, when I was informed that my truant horſe had not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived before me.—But, my friend, think of the tranſports of my wearied heart, on being deſired to ſtep acroſs to our neighbour, and conduct home my ſiſter, who was on a friendly viſit there! My fond impatience was worldleſs! I ſlew into the preſence of my all; ſaluted her with ardor; and received the utterance of her affection from the gladdened langour of her eyes Oh, my friend, ſhe appeared more beautiful and enchanting than ever!

paſſion of young Alfred?—Oh that my heart were ſteeled to theſe tormenting inquiries!—But they ruſh like torrents in excruciating conviction on my ſoul!—<hi>They</hi> ſoon muſt waſte their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or <hi>it</hi> very ſoon fall a victim to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted pungency!—</p>
               <p>—RETIRED from worldly objects, I have endeavoured to allay my ſoul-rending ſuſpicions; nay, my ſenſible convictions of the baſeneſs of my wife, by ſtudying the philoſophy of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, and its innate propenſities to good and evil. Alas, theſe philoſophic contemplations too generally terminate in a bitter conſciouſneſs of ſelf-blame!—</p>

               <p>REASON, nature, religion, and philoſophy, though each oppoſed to lawleſs love, are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to reproach the remiſs conduct of my nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial life, and point to it as the creative cauſe of my preſent dilemma, and ever-laſting ignominy!—Burthened with theſe contemning ſenſations I dare not, cannot aſſume the tone of uprightneſs,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032746_0125_0FF4FA20465D97C8"/>
to vindicate the honour of my bed—Hah! what do I ſay!—Alas, let me not die with falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture!—Hymeneal chaſtity is yet, I know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contaminated:—ſensual debaſement is not yet perpetrated:—but that their mental faculties have long engaged in illicit affection;—that their ſouls even now revel in the voluptuouſneſs of laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentiment, is undemonſtrably evident in the amorous language of their love-fraught eyes!</p>
               <p>I FIND myſelf in a condition ſo mentally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that I muſt beg you will break down the obſtacles of cuſtom, and favour me with a few lines of conſolation. Though I loſe the melody of thy tongue in the manner of communication, yet will thy words retain their original balſam!—Yes, what one ungenerous, thoughtleſs woman has deſtroyed, thy virtues and ſuperior accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments ſhall doubly repleniſh.</p>

                  <salute>ESTEEMED SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>TO refined minds the pleaſures of ſympathy afford an exhauſtleſs fruition; but to thoſe whoſe repelling boſoms are alike callous to the impreſſions of benevolence, and deaf to the feeble voice of diſtreſſed virtue, the inlets of this ſublime intellectual enjoyment are effectually choaked by unnatural principles of ſenſuality. The former are made happy, in a manner, by the calamities of their fellow-creatures; becauſe, their diſtreſſes produce an opportunity for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of every god-like prerogative. The latter, radically dead to ſenſibility, can partake neither of their proſperity nor of their adverſity; but contract within the narrow and wretched li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ſelf, every human power of intellectual enjoyment. So forcibly have theſe ideas been confirmed on my mind, by obſervation and the increaſe of experience, I am often prompted to believe, that on this univerſality of feeling, which as it increaſes its objects, aſſimulates to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign ſpirit of philanthrophy, hang all the ſocial comforts of life; and that without a fellow-feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032746_0127_0FF4FA292431A3E8"/>
for another's woe, we would be compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively inſenſible to the rigour of our own.—It is but a melancholy pleaſure, however, to know and commiſerate another's ſufferings, without poſſeſſing the power to remove or alleviate the occaſion. Our really <hi>feeling,</hi> does not actually <hi>lighten</hi> his grievances; but the idea of ſocial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, or a partnerſhip in miſery, renders its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance more tolerable, than when we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unfortunate, unfriended, and abandoned.</p>
               <p>To your mind, my worthy friend, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed with the agony of injured honour, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with a portion of ſelf-condemnation, this ſpecies of alleviation will afford but little comfort; unleſs indeed you can balance againſt the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one woman's affections, the acquiſition of the eſteem and friendſhip of another.—But this circumſtance, even were it poſſible, would not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate the reſtoration of your wonted tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. Could you, by a wonderful ſtretch of philoſophy, once conceive that a kind of repriſal on your wife's unfaithfulneſs, would equalize the irritation of both; could you even be perſuaded to retaliate on her perfidy by equal perfidy, I doubt not, but that intervals of uneaſineſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe would occur, to falſify your experiment. Nothing then, but the rivival of her love and duty
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032746_0128_0FF4FA2AB3672630"/>
as a wife, or the extinction of that title and its endearing relationſhips, can make you even tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil. While ſhe retains the ſacred appellation of wife; while as ſuch, ſhe claims your attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as huſband, it is irrevocable that every aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from propriety in her conduct, will convulſe and torment your ſoul; but could that affinity be totally extinguiſhed, and her claims on your affection withdrawn, her future demeanour, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever culpable, would, of courſe, ceaſe to agitate your feelings. But why need I thus preſume to argue to a man endowed with all the energies of reaſon, and a permanent ſtandard of reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!—Innate conſciouſneſs, joined to a manly and upright vindictiveneſs, will guide you to the beſt eligible means of remedy, in the purſuit of which you are ever accompanied with my moſt ſanguine wiſhes.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT conclude this attempt to be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without adding a ſuggeſtion which I truſt, will intermit the violence of your grief;—it is, my friend, that notwithſtanding the almoſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable indecency of Mrs. Franks towards this young coxcomb, there is but little proof apparent to convict her of actual criminality.—Forgive me, Sir, for this boldneſs!—I declare it has coſt me numberleſs bluſhes;—but my ſincere intereſt for

                  <salute>DEAREST CAROLINE,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN the name of heaven whither will this frenzy of paſſion impel you? Alas, has it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready whirled you to the borders of fathomleſs deſtruction; on which even now your frantic mind is undecided between a ſentiment of duty and the wild impulſe of a guilty paſſion? Oh, Caroline, my heart bleeds afreſh at every renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtance of your weakneſs; for I will not call it vice. At the arrival of every mail, a ſudden horror ſeizes my mind, apprehenſive of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſome grievous intelligence! As I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed your laſt, my fears ſwelled in proportion
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:032746_0130_0FF4FA35535059E8"/>
to the increaſing intereſt of its contents; and at the concluſion, every mental faculty was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately convulſed! The whole, for a while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured my affection; and I felt for you only thoſe emotions of pity which our ſex generally experience on beholding the gloomy records of female degradation!</p>
               <p>BELIEVE me, Caroline, my affection is not merely the warmth and partiality of a ſiſter.—No; the ſolicitude of a fond mother, the abate leſs ardour of a friend, added to our natural al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, render my attachment ſuperlatively genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. Every peril of your life creates in me the apprehenſions, the prayers, and the hopes of a parent whoſe chiefeſt felicity conſiſts in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and happineſs of her child. Every error of thought, the ſlighteſt deviation from real vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is with tears recorded in my memory. Nay, ſiſter, the fibres of your ſoul are ſo entwined with thoſe of mine, that the ſmalleſt touch on the firſt reverberates with redoubled aſperity on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Your preſent conſciouſneſs of diſtreſs is a negative pain, to that actual torment which I experience in the apprehenſion of your danger! Your judgment is inveigled by the ſlaſhing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistications of his logic; your partial eyes, faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinated by ſuperficial endowments, neglect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate

               <p>BEFORE prediction touched the threſhold of events, I ſecretly regretted your conſtitutional propenſity to unhappineſs! In infancy, the loſs of a toy, or the want of a favorite ribbon, would ſwell your heart with unutterable anguiſh, and produce a ſeaſon of pining diſtreſs! As you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in life and encountered the ſterner diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of human nature, this want of fortitude followed your footſteps, and beſet every trifling accident with unreal terrors.—How often, and alas, how ineffectually, have I drawn your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and opening ambition to the beauties of the Poem <note n="*" place="bottom">Hayley's Triumphs of Temper.</note> which inculcates a certain happy ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of temper?

               <p>THE receipt of your laſt, as is uſual, was ſucceeded by a variety of entertaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. My admiration was geometrically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between the inſtance given of your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence to the diſtreſſed peaſants, and the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous growth of your paſſion for her <hi>whoſe eyes make ſlave the mind!</hi> Love, I imagine, has a tendency to render the heart univerſally charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; becauſe, by it the whole ſyſtem is ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ameliorated, as to be eaſily ſuſceptible of the finer impreſſions of pity. A perſon under the influence of this paſſion, melts into compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the firſt ray of another's diſtreſs; while thoſe who are repulſive to its gentle operations' are alſo callous to the effects of ſympathy. So likewiſe, it may be obſerved of thoſe who natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are poſſeſſed of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>I AM not a little anxious to receive the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that pathetic tale which your feelings ſo

happily indited. Give me in your next the facts which have ſince tranſpired. I have no doubt that the honeſt family will fully repay, in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude the munificence of their youthful bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.—What a glorious ſubject would it be for an humane painter, to diſplay the modeſt figure of Youth, in the humble cottage of perſecuted Indigence, diſpenſing gratuitous bleſſings ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anguiſh of a bereaved wife, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the noiſy ſorrows of unfriended little ones! By heavens, Charles, were I the ſlave of Hymen, and my own wife your ciceſbo, this proof of the nobility of thy mind ſhould extenuate the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and continue thee in my friendſhip!</p>
               <p>MY young acquaintance, the unknown Tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, left me laſt week to proceed for Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia; where, as he exclaimed, his only hopes of happineſs were concentred. His health, ſpirits, and appearance were ſurpriſingly improved.—On my leaving him at the ſtage-office, he gave me a look of inexpreſſible feeling, and graſping eagerly my hand, ſqueezed it with both of his, ſaying—"Oh, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               <p>—PLAGUE on your flattery, Bill! The lucid praiſe you have ſo ſhowered on the vain Alfred, has indeed made him a huge hill of vanity? I will, however, endeavour, by always emulating your commendation, to derive benefit
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032746_0136_0FF4FA4799462760"/>
from the very ſource which inundates others with ridicule and contempt.</p>
               <p>BUT, my friend, I have a ſtronger, dearer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive added to your encomium, to urge me to the practice of benevolence:—My Charlotte, the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed depoſit of every virtue, rewarded my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſicence with a torrent of bleſſings—with a full hour of endearing careſſes! I was with her ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the balcony which fronts her manſion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating on ſentiments of love and friendſhip, when we perceived coming from my father's plantation, an homely countryman, whom afterwards I found to be the father of the diſtreſſed family to whoſe relief my timely aſſiſtance had been afforded. As he advanced with his hat in his hand, his eyes ſparkling with an honeſt joy, and his tongue loaded with the whole weight of his gratitude, he could but ſcarcely articulate, "Heaven bleſs you for preſerving my dear wife and children!" After confuſing me with the laviſh expreſſion of his gratitude, he proceeded, at the requeſt of my ſympathetic Charlotte, to relate the occaſion of his unhappy abſence; which he did in nearly the following terms:</p>
               <p>"SWEET madam, (even his vulgar eyes, ſaw ſomething <hi>ſweet</hi> in the perſon of my fair compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032746_0137_0FF4FA492521DC00"/>
"and you, good ſir, when I arrived in the city and had diſpoſed of my little all, returning to take poſſeſſion of my horſe and cart, I could find neither it nor the man with whom I had left it. Zoons! ſays I, this will never do! So at length I traced the fellow—"Where's my cart?" ſays I;—" Your cart!" ſays he, "at the d—l; get your horſe, and look for it."—Oh ho, is that the tune! So making no more ado about it, I yokes the ſcoundrel by the gills, and toated him into a ſhop where they told me juſtice might be bought; but the magiſtrate being out, my buſineſs could not be done. There I waited till near night, hearing the thief curſe me like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, before the appearance of the judge, who, it ſeemed, had a better job in hand; and, giving the villain into the care of one of his journeymen, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to appear the next morning. Ah, ſir, you may gueſs how I ſpent the night, in grieving for the certain diſtreſs of my poor family!—Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning I attended at the office, when after anſwering ſome queſtions and ſwearing an oath, was told nothing could be done for me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Mayor's court! Oh, zookers, how my heart was then gauled! I ſhould ſurely have done ſomething wicked, had not neighbour Jones met me, and told where I could find my property. It was in a dirty alley I found my poor half-ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032746_0138_0FF4FA5259E62C38"/>
creature, hitched to a ſtump. She, poor ſoul, was as rejoiced as myſelf; and home we trudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaving the juſtice and his man to handle the rogue who had tried to defraud me.—After croſſing the ferry I found your horſe, which I inſtantly knew, grazing on the ſide of the road. Hitching him to my cart, I have brought him home, and left him in your ſtable."</p>
               <p>HERE he pauſed, as if to recover breath, of which his fervent narrative had nearly deprived him.—" Ah, dear ſir," continued he, "think of my aſtoniſhment on coming to my dear home, to find neither wife nor children to welcome me! I was half diſtracted! Gueſſing the occaſion, I ſlew to my landlord, and was there told, that my innocent family were in cuſtody on the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of their having diſhoneſtly got the very money which your charity beſtowed, and with which they had offered to pay the rent! Croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers! but for his wealth, I would have hided the ſcoundrel! When I mentioned your name and goodneſs, he reſtored us to our homely hut; where, if it will be any joy to you, heaven ſhall hear the prayers of a whole family for your proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity!"—Concluding thus, the aged clown, with a coarſe bow, left us to reſume the pure plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of love. Oh, with what unbounded confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

               <p>MY diſtracted mind has but juſt ſurvived a tremendous agitation!—A thouſand conflicting thoughts, a thouſand fears and hopes have ſuddenly been excited, by an adventitious circumſtance of this morning, o'er which I have
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032746_0140_0FF4FA557955F2B0"/>
ever ſince ſilently pondered in ſad and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wonder.</p>
               <p>AN inſtinctive ſadneſs gradually ſtole on my mind. The acuteneſs of reflection often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced tears on my cheek, without the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of their origin. In vain I uſed every effort to remove its influence:—Read, ſung, danced, and played, but each contrivance was alike ineffectual, and my diſtended heart invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily heaved ſighs of predictive diſtreſs. At length, finding every other means unavailing, I reſolved to ſhorten its duration, by withholding my weak reſtraint; that is, by giving it a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and unreſiſted controul, let its violence be its own deſtruction. For this purpoſe, I repaired to my ſympathizing grotto. Here indeed, allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed to be produced, by the increaſe of lamentation.—Here, as I had before often done, I emptied my ſurcharged heart of its latent ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, by complaining to the rocks, and fancying' that in their ſonorous reſponſes, I heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of another's anguiſh.—Indeed, my friend, there is a ſpecific in the ſociety of theſe aged rocks, which ſeldom fails of relieving the poignancy of my retroſpective reflection. I left them wonderfully revived. A placid ſerenity, congenial with the ſoftneſs which hung on the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032746_0141_0FF4FA57093B8298"/>
ſurrounding ſcenes of nature, accompanied me home.—But here;—alas, how can I proceed in this ſhort tale of wonder!—here was reſerved for me, the ambiguous occaſion of my preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. I had juſt ſeated myſelf in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and was beginning to peruſe the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leaves of ſcientific poetry by Thompſon, when the encloſed letter was delivered to me, by a ſtrange and very polite ſervant. His introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was formal and ſolemn, and his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,(which was, to deliver a confidential letter) were both calculated to ſwell the firſt emotions of amazement!—They did—I received the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger and his letter with trembling ſurpriſe, which was increaſed to horrid wonder, on read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the encloſed addreſs to me, without a genuine ſignature! Its ſerious, polite, and ſtudied diſguiſe, ſeem to conceal ſome circumſtance of importance to my welfare; in conjecturing which, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wrecked my underſtanding. To you, my worthy friend, in whoſe boſom, my deareſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets have already found a grand lodge, I fly for counſel and advice.—Oh, for heaven's ſake, tell me candidly, if you do not think this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is real; and that my Henry, my exiled Henry returned, is at the bottom of it?—This dear, this delightful thought, this enlivening hope, inhabits my heart, and rings with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032746_0142_0FF4FA5FDC5D4E88"/>
through my ſtrained fancy. Its impreſſion on my mind, has prevented me from diſcloſing the affair to any of my family; preferring the firmneſs and candour of your friendſhip, to the intereſted love of any earthly relation. Return the letter ſpeedily, together with your advice. Tell me if it is ſafe or prudent to accept the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation;—and tell me alſo, if you will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me thither.</p>

               <p>NOTHING but a permanent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of your generous diſpoſition, could give boldneſs to a ſtranger to addreſs you in this free and doubtful manner.—But relying on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign gentleneſs of temper, and the honourable motives by which I am impelled, thus to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the mounds of reſpect and decorum, I firmly truſt, the ſubſequent intereſt you will perceive in the following diſcloſure, will amply apologize for my preſent impropriety.</p>
               <p>THERE is certainly a deep-planted ſentiment in your heart, which for many year paſt, has paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on your conduct the conſpicuous lineaments of ſorrow and diſtreſs.

               <p>I AM well aware of the apprehenſions, which will be excited in your delicate boſom, by this ſtrange and ſuſpicious demand: I even feel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, that circumſtances render it indiſpenſible, to purchaſe future permanent bliſs, by a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary convulſion of mind; but the intereſt I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to have in your conduct, and the conviction I bear of being inſtrumental to your happineſs, impels me to hope that the aſſignation, though ſo apparently perilious, will be effected.</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH I labour under an acute melancholy, I haſten to communicate my firſt ideas on the ſubject of your letter of this morning, in doing which I am not more guided
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:032746_0146_0FF4FA6C4AB3A790"/>
by a ſpirit of adventure and curioſity, attached to our ſex, than by a pure and diſintereſted regard for your happineſs.</p>
               <p>BELIEVE me then, my friend, I think there is obſervable in the hurried diction, and apparently reſtrained affection of the epiſtle, a ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be of ſervice to you. The features of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty are perceptible through every aſſumed garb; and as villainy is infallibly detected by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of its own countenance, ſo it may alſo be ſaid, the ſimple phyſiognomy of honeſty invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recommends itſelf to confidence. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cannot counterfeit even the language or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior of the latter:—in its moſt artful attempts, it always retains its native brogue of criminality.—This being the caſe, and we are to judge of the integrity of the deſign, by the complexion of the letter, and other collateral circumſtances, I am convinced, if you will re-peruſe it with attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you will join with me in believing, that an acquieſcence in the required interview, will by no means endanger your ſafety; but probably accelerate the progreſs of that happineſs, which is reſerved for you in the ſkies.</p>
               <p>As to the fond hope of your exiled Henry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baſis of it, I muſt beſeech you, not to rely
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032746_0147_0FF4FA6DD9B5F860"/>
on the idea as probable. No, Fanny, though poſſibly it may relate to the amiable Wellsford, be aſſured, that the language of his love, on ſuch an occaſion, would not for a moment be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, for the perpetration of a ſcheme of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous chivalry. No, child, his long conſtrained paſſion, when it ſhall meet thy endearing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, will burſt in ſublime ardour at thy feet. It could not tranquilly await the iſſue of a plot, ſo uncertain as that ſuggeſted in your letter.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH I have thus unequivocally adviſed you to comply with the aſſignation of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known correſpondent, I cannot omit ſuggeſting the prudence of your communicating the affair to the confidence of your brother, requeſting him to attend near the ſpot, to interpoſe in caſe our credulity ſhould entangle us in difficulty.—This you may decide on, as expediency may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; in the mean time, be aſſured, I will punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually attend at the hour appointed, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you on this ſingular expedition.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE firſt moments of retirement after arriving in this city, I thus thankfully dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to your diſintereſted ſympathy. Alas, ſir, my feelings reſemble thoſe of a wretch, who, when on the edge of immediate ruin, has been reſcued, and then devoted to a more ſlow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting deſtruction! Oh, when will misfortune have exhauſted her miſeries on my devoted head! In every viciſſitude of life, every change of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, her vengeance purſues me, inflicting on my guiltleſs ſoul, the condenſed anguiſh of her power! A ſucceſſive climax of woes has marked my infant career in life; while benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence like yours has been interpoſed merely to variegate its appearance, or to ſharpen the pangs that were to ſucceed! While I was enjoying the ſweet repaſt of charity at your hands, deſtiny was recruiting her waſted ſtrength and forging new and peculiar calamities!</p>
               <p>My mind being wholly engaged in the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of love and conſtancy, it was not until
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:032746_0149_0FF4FA742D97A568"/>
the familiar ſcenes of nativity and infancy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that I reverted to the connexions of my blood. Alas, five years abſence and fifty of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, had partly eraſed from my memory the fond idea of father, mother, and my other kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred! Heavens! thoſe reverend titles exiſt no more, but in the faint annals of my recollection! The dreadful fever of 1793, ſwept into eternity a father, mother, ſiſter, and two brothers!—Oh, my worthy friend, can your humanity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the effects of this horrid intelligence; which was the firſt ſalute I received in this city? It for a while prevented me from an enquiry which ſeemed paramount even to this melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumſtance. I had left in this city, arrayed in tears of ſorrow at my departure, the celeſtial object who had received and anſwered with equal ardor, the firſt affections of my heart; and from the hopes of whoſe conſtancy, even in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my woe, I derived a cheering emotion of joy. Fear and hope ruſhed into my trembling boſom; and under the influence of both, I have ſo far explored the region of bliſs, as to diſcover the place of her reſidence, and the more welcome circumſtance of her heart being undedicated to any other.</p>
               <p>THE affairs of my father at his death were extremely flouriſhing; whereby I become heir
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:032746_0150_0FF4FA7A826BF6F0"/>
to a large eſtate; the only branch of my family, ſpared either to encounter new diſtreſſes, or to enjoy my portion of temporal felicity. Oh, my friend, if it be the latter, ſhall one tranſport riſe in my boſom, in which you will not partake?

Oh, Bill participate in my joys!—I am conſtantly revelling in the preſence of her I adore!—Her feelings, her love, is as ſanguine as my own!—Her expreſſions, glowing in living flames upon her dear lips, in ſublimity and elegance exceed all my feeble attempts at rhapſody! In fact, our interviews are a commerce of ſouls, in the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent indulgence of which every faculty of mind and body is rendered the medium of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular bliſs! She, loving, tender and amorous, receives my ardent careſſes with a total proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reluctance; while I, inflated with divine intellectual fruition, reſpond to her bewitching endearments in the "ſilent elocution of the eye." Sometimes our panting boſoms, loaded with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious joy, loſe their preſent conſciouſneſs, and, preſſed in each other's warm embrace, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly melt into <hi>a ſea of pleaſures!</hi>—Oh, this

is indeed the joyous ſuſpenſion of life, the bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trance of the ſenſes, wherein is that extreme of pleaſure deſcribed by ancient and modern po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets!

               <p>AFTER leaving your ſoothing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety laſt evening, taking a circuitous path in my way homeward, I was profoundly ſtartled on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, in the field adjoining the property of Alfred, two men and two women engaged in a reciprocal exchange of courteſy and affection. In my courſe coming nearer to the ſcene, I was effectually ſhuddered by diſtinguiſhing in this happy club, my truant wife, her petit maitre, the <hi>prudiſh</hi> Miſs Fanny, with her gallant alſo! This ſingular groupe, had it conſiſted of indifferent characters, would have drawn my admiration; but think of my thrilling horror on making the diſcovery! The impulſe of the inſtant would
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032746_0154_0FF4FA88FB311380"/>
have driven me furious into their preſence; but my heart, bearing freſh in remembrance the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent counſels of your wiſdom, retired from the guilty ſpectacle, with a fervent apoſtrophe to the juſt, and I truſt, vindictive heaven.</p>
               <p>THE ſubſequent reflections preyed on my tranquillity as I meditated at home.—Oh, how "ſtale, flat, and unprofitable" appeared to me the pleaſures, vanities, and hopes of this world! Methought, exiſtence was an immenſe load, and, if it had been poſſible, I would have evaded its oppreſſion!</p>
               <p>—OH, my generous, tender friend, I have certain ireful thoughts brooding in my diſtracted ſoul!—Thoughts, which I tremble to reveal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to your ſacred confidence!—Thoughts, which, as I pore over them, become odious to myſelf! Have you, joined to an experience in life, a practical firmneſs to counſel with deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Does your mind, though of the texture of a woman, poſſeſs inherent principles of valor? Can you, Harriot, unſex yourſelf, and be the friendly accomplice of my voluntary deſtruction?—Start not at this!—Life has proved only a ſucceſſional train of torments—my ſoul looks for repoſe to death and eternity.—Thoſe gifts which
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:032746_0155_0FF4FA8A8DD4D520"/>
heaven as bleſſings, have been intercepted by demons, and, ere they reached me, converted into curſes! I will, therefore, thwart the efforts of hell, by plunging blindly into immortality; confiding my ſoul into the care of that power who created it.</p>
               <p>I KNOW this awful determination will affright you:—Yes, it will doubtleſs pierce the ſoul of a woman who feels univerſally in the cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.—You will urge me to cling to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient horrors of this world, in preference to the doubt and peril of an adventurous paſſage to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Speak not of reſignation. Heaven did not create the ſoul, endow it with a conſciouſneſs of its future dignity, and expand it with noble ſentiments of deity, for the purpoſe of drudging under an immenſe load of miſeries in this idle world. Why is it inveſted with the <hi>power,</hi> if not to exerciſe the <hi>right</hi> of annihilating this fleſhy cumbrance, and re-aſcending to omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency? Is it not nobler to end life by one act of the will, than, by awaiting the ſlow and excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating courſe of miſery, fall a groaning ſacrifice to puſillanimity?</p>
               <p>IF no damning crime has marked the progreſs of my life, what motive is there <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="158" facs="unknown:032746_0156_0FF4FA8C1B78FD50"/>
from heaven?

               <p>I folded down a leaf in the rich vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Zimmermann on Solitude, in order to read and anſwer your letter of this morning. My mind was ſuffuſed with a rapturous admiration of the ſolemn pleaſures of retirement, the living ideas of which I had juſt caught from the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic ſtyle of the author.—I opened the letter, while mentally calculating on the comparative happineſs of a hermit and a courtier or ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:—the courſe of my contemplations was not
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032746_0159_0FF4FA985B9E4830"/>
interrupted until the horrid word "deſtruction" seizing my eye, created a ſhivering winter in my veins!—Alas, how has unguided madneſs tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melled the vigour of your intellects!—What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy influence has thus ſtripped thee of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of reaſon?—Surely the acuteneſs of your judgment, cannot be loſt in the apparent propriety of your reaſoning, in palliation of the horrors of ſelf-murder? Surely that mind which lately was all energy, that heart which is all piety, cannot ſo ſuddenly be the dupe of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the perpetrator of guilt?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Is reſignation's duty hard?—</l>
                  <l>"Examine, you ſhall find,</l>
                  <l>"That duty gives up little more</l>
                  <l>"Than anguiſh of the mind."</l>
               </q>
               <p>MY feelings are ſo violently agitated by this unhappy circumſtance, that I am incapable almoſt of collecting reaſon ſufficient, to outweigh the ſophiſtication of your eſſay to vindicate the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious aſſumption of Heaven's prerogative. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe life is conſidered as a loan, thoſe deluded mortals who have ruſhed unprepared into the preſence of their Maker, conceive it to be ſolely at their diſpoſal, and that whether they improve or abuſe it, no authority dare call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032746_0160_0FF4FA99EC50C5B8"/>
Life is not only a loan;—it is a ſacred depoſit from the hands of creation, and if we thoughtleſsly miſapply or pervert it, the united voice of reaſon, nature, and religion is loud in cenſure;—how much more worthy, then, of cenſure and puniſhment is that infatuated wretch, who, wildly warring on religion, nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not only abuſes the bleſſings of exiſtence, but with a bloody hand conſigns it to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?—How foul in nature's eye is the wretch who attacks the life of another? And is not his own life a more holy, ſacred truſt? He who moulded our bodies; who infuſed the animation of ſouls; who appointed our abode in this earth for wiſe and good purpoſes; and who, at his pleaſure can convert afflictions into mercies;—he only is the juſt arbiter of the period at which his ſervants ſhall be re-united to Divinity.—Alas, it is only when mankind loſe their belief in the ſupremacy of this power, that they perform an act, which at once violates the principles of obedience, and alienates the guilty from the care and protection of the Deity!</p>
               <p>IT may be true, my friend, that in this world your only portion has been pain and miſery.—But is this a motive to ſuicide?—The act ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that you either remedy the actual torments
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032746_0161_0FF4FA9DA30ABFB8"/>
under which you labour, or that by extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, you deſtroy its ſenſibility both for the preſent and the future. You muſt undoubtedly expect either to ſucceed to an exiſtence of more perfect bliſs, or to a ſtate in which, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the principles of animation, your mind will be unſuſceptive of either the emotions of pleaſure, or the throbs of pain.—Surely, my friend, you cannot acknowledge the attributes of God, particularly his juſtice, if after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſo horrid a deed, your ſoul conceives the hopes of his favour!—Alas, Franks, our religion tells us, that the gates of heaven are doubly barr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the entrance of him, whoſe hands are ſtained with his own blood!—Let religion then unnerve your dreadful purpoſe!</p>
               <p>THE other plea is, the general attendant of thoſe who are hardy enough to execute this dire deſign.—Finding that religion affords no extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for their guilt, and impatient of miſery, they die, not with the luminous anticipation of a bleſſed hereafter, but with the dreary expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſtate of apathy; preferring nonentity to an exiſtence of trials and diſtreſs.—This idea, I truſt, has no influence on the belief of my philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic friend:—No; have I not heard him with a tranſport of joy, deſcribe thoſe ſcenes of pure
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032746_0162_0FF4FAA40AAF2F08"/>
and unmingled fruition, to which the virtuous and good ſhall be elevated hereafter!—Alas, are thoſe bliſsful proſpects, the foreſight of which ſurpaſſes every other earthly comfort, ſo lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably clouded by the impious belief, that death is but "an eternal ſleep?"—Oh, my friend, come to my preſence!—It is impoſſible for me to write calmly or rationally, while my mind is ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally affrighted:—I ſtart, and fancy the "bloody buſineſs" is performing!—Then ſcream, and in my ſolitary ſympathy ſeem to mingle blood with blood, and die the death of Franks.—</p>

               <p>I WAS never more confident of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſting matter to you than on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion; becauſe, knowing that general
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:032746_0163_0FF4FAA59B471010"/>
vein of philanthrophy which diſtils through your ſoul, no circumſtance which is pleaſing to huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, can be unintereſting to you.</p>
               <p>NEARLY five years ago, my ſiſter conceived an ardent and generous paſſion, for a young inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of Philadelphia, who, though not born to ſplendour and affluence, had conſiderable expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the growing circumſtances of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who at that time was but a commiſſioned merchant. Abſtracted from theſe ſelfiſh views, in his mind and perſon he poſſeſſed all thoſe amiable and endearing qualities, which ought ever to be the objects of female adoration. By a frequent intercourſe, the parties became inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attached. It ſoon came to the ears of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who having already almoſt ſtipulated a match, (though at that time my ſiſter was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly young) with an immenſe fortune, immediately adopted ſevere meaſures to deſtroy their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in which he ſucceeded ſo far, as to prevail on the father of the youth, to diſpatch him as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percargo to the Indies.—Alas, I well remember the affecting ſcene of their farewell!—It occurred in the time of our vacation holidays, by which, being on a viſit at home, I was made a witneſs to the cruel effects of parental authority, in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the impulſe of nature, innocence, and
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032746_0164_0FF4FAA72837B720"/>
love.—My ſiſter, in tears of ſpeechleſs agony, hung around the dear neck of her departing friend; while he with a calmneſs of ſorrow, which diſdained the aid of tears, preſſed her to his ſwelling boſom, and uttered a thouſand bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on her head!—Thus were they for ſeveral moments locked in each others arms, ſigh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſigh, when the wind being favorable, he was hurried to the veſſel which was to convey him from the ſcene of his infantile joys. My ſiſter was conducted to her room, where for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months ſhe continued in a ſtate of mind and body, extremely doubtful as to the iſſue.</p>
               <p>MY own experience of the ſublime paſſion, enables me now to judge of the diſtreſsful feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this pair, at the eventful juncture of their ſeparation;—of the unavailing tears and ſighs, which muſt have filled up the bitter period of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence!—Until a few days paſt, my ſiſter, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his fortune, devoted her tears and prayers in ſilence for his ſafety. A few days indeed have unwound to her enraptured mind, the constancy and fidelity of her exiled Henry!—Read, my friend, and let not your wonder ſubſide until you have acknowledged, that the fate of lovers is the peculiar care of ruling Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:032746_0165_0FF4FAABF95DD250"/>
ON Wedneſday laſt, my ſiſter received from the hand of an unknown ſervant, an anonymous letter; which, it ſeems, after expreſſing the moſt ſanguine eſteem for her character, and proteſting honorable intentions, ſolicited her to favor the writer with an interview the next day; appointing the hour and place. In her earlieſt emotions, ſhe communicated the incident to my female friend; who, judging with more experience of life, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to accede to the propoſal; ſhe to be her ſecond, and I, left any danger ſhould reſult, was to be placed in a private ſituation adjacent to the important ſpot.—Affairs being thus ordered by the inquiſitive and timorous women, I repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the place, and fixing myſelf within the cloiſter of ſome young trees, commanded a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral view of the theatre in which this ſingular interview was to be performed.—I impatiently waited for the appearance of the parties:—nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was punctual to the aſſignation.—At length, however, I perceived at a diſtance croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the field in a direction for the propoſed ſcene, a ſtrange young gentleman; who, as he advanced, exhibited ſtrong marks of concern, by frequent ſhows of ejaculation, ſudden halts, and a certain timidity or backwardneſs of conduct which generally accompanies doubtful adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of every kind.—Suddenly I obſerved the
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032746_0166_0FF4FAB1B5A96958"/>
embarraſſment of his manners increaſe; which, on turning my eyes, I diſcovered to be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the appearance of my ſiſter, who ſlowly advanced, gently leaning on her companion, both with emotions not leſs obvious than thoſe of the gentleman, who now ſtood fixed in a thoughtful poſture, his eyes caſt on the ground, and both hands cloſely preſſed to his boſom!—Believe me, friend, this was an intereſting criſis to my agitated feelings. My outſtretched expectation, joined to a portion of anxiety for the ſafety of my trembling ſiſter, nearly ſuſpended the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my reaſon;—when my aſtoniſhment was completed by perceiving her, with eyes fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the object, forſake the ſupport of her friend and fly into the opened arms of the ſilent ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger!—This circumſtance, I conceived, warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in iſſuing from my concealment; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the ſpot, found Fanny in a ſwoon, ſtill in the arms of the gentleman; whom I inſtantly recognized as the exiled arbiter of her heart;—the worthy WELLSFORD!</p>
               <p>THE overpowered girl ſoon reviving by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of her friend, a ſcene of love enſued, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyond my humble powers of deſcription. The rapture of the delighted lovers was mutual and unbounded; during which my Charlotte ſeemed

tranced in the enjoyment of the felicity which fluſhed on her mind from the welcome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her friend's happineſs; which I, ſerious as was the nature of the occaſion, converted into an opportunity for the vindication of my love, by extolling as worthy the patronage of the moſt chaſte and modeſt, a paſſion, which, by its divine influence on the actions, ſurrenders the parties to the indiſcriminate enjoyment of each, without fear or repugnance.</p>
               <p>IT was not until after conſiderable joint ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that the overjoyed Wellsford was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to encounter, what he called, "the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my Fanny's parents:" But being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the inclination of my father to indulge his daughter in any virtuous attachment which would conduce to her tranquillity, (early deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his cruel effort to correct nature) he ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her hand with delighted enthuſiaſm; and, proceeding onward, indulged in the warm tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of reciprocal love: While my Charlotte and her ſwain, with a fervor not leſs ſincere, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, converſing on the miracles of Cupid, who could preſerve unfaded, in two youthful boſoms torn aſunder by tyranny and prejudice, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable blaze of his torch!</p>

HAVING thus far partly forgot the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my nature, (that is, love) you muſt excuſe me if, in order to fill up the remainder of the ſheet, I add a few ſentences on the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous aſpect of my amour.

               <p>AS you expected, the contents of your laſt produced in my mind, a ſeries of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and moral reflections, reſulting in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere admiration of that wonderful paſſion which can, by a peculiar magic, entwine two hearts at the diſtance of innumerable miles!—It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by no means uncommon in the hiſtory of love, that notwithſtanding the efforts of pride, prejudice, or ſuperſtition, to ſuppreſs its earlieſt dawning, the cauſe of nature and innocence will
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032746_0170_0FF4FABF0CB82638"/>
be finally matured by the hand of deſtiny.—The votaries of love, that unconquerable paſſion, are daily ſeen to ſurvive the wrecks of malice and perſecution; and although for a period their fate is apparently loſt in the myſterious evolutions of fortune, a watchful and approving power is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately certain of collecting their ſcattered hopes into a point of enjoyment.</p>
               <p>IT is the trial of love, under which my worthy friend Tallman is now labouring.—Since he has left me, I have received a letter, dated Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, in which he communicates a melancholy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the loſs of his parents and family, by the dreadful contagion which ſpread death and terror in that city, during the year 1793.—This afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incident, I obſerve, appears conſiderably alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, by the glimmerings of hope with which he has met, in the purſuit of his love.—Should he finally be proſpered in his paſſion, which is interwoven with his exiſtence, he will aſſuredly be the happieſt and beſt of men!—</p>
               <p>YOU ſpeak in your laſt of certain perils, which appear in the way of your love, with a timidity which ſeems to indicate a deſire to relinquiſh your purſuit! Ah, Charles, is this your proof of gallantry? Are you not aware, that in every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

enterprize, the value of the acquiſition is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably enhanced, by the magnitude of the difficulties ſurmounted? It is but an inglorious conqueſt which is obtained without the effuſion of blood. The hero, who in victory retires from the field of battle, cloathed in ſcars and bloody gaſhes, is doubly applauded to him, who returns unhonoured with one reeking evidence of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:—much more ignoble is he, who from the mere foreſight of danger, from <hi>the ſmell of powder</hi> I may ſay, baſely ſhrinks from the encounter, avoiding a battle the iſſue of which, depends ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his own individual proweſs?—Of such a deſcription I ſhall conceive my friend Charles Alfred, if the prowling aſpect of a jealous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is ſuffered to retard his purpoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the affections of his alienated wife.</p>

               <p>I HAVE but this moment diſcovered a circumſtance which has confirmed me in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of communicating to you an apology for, the guilty, altho' prudent diſſimulation which I practiſed on your goodneſs—Oh ſir, the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Tallman, the creature, of your charity, whoſe concealed ſorrow excited in your breaſt ſuch ſublime ſympathy, is now the joyous and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent Wellſford;—the accepted, favored lover of the adorable ſiſter of your friend Charles Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred! This intelligence, my worthy friend, I am ſure will delight your generoſity; to which I am indebted to afford a circumſtantial account of this happy viciſſitude in my life, are which I hope will effectually atone for the ſtratagem by which I kept ſecret my origin, myſelf, and my hopes, until ſuch times as I could declare all with unbluſhing pleaſure.</p>

THE brother of my amiable Fanny, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquainted you with the origin of my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and of the cruel embarraſſment in which it was early involved.—Alas, I had but one hope, beſide the aſſurance of conſtancy, to ſupport me in the dreadful moments of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; and that was a fond expectation, that by a perſeverance in induſtry and honour, I ſhould ſhortly be enabled to return in circumſtances, which if not acceptable to her parents, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title me to the clandeſtine attainment of the dear girl's hand!—This hope, from the moment of my departure for three ſucceſſive years, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be rapidly realizing. In India my talents for buſineſs were ſo liberally rewarded, that in the courſe of this period, I had amaſſed a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which compared with the eſtates of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, would be immenſe.—Inflated by this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with the ambition of returning to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and love, in honourable affluence, I inveſted the amount in the moſt valuable Indian articles, and, there being no immediate conveyance to America, failed with it for Bourdeaux in France.—Alas, it never reached its deſtination!—The world had already proved truſtleſs to me; but now I almoſt dared to accuſe heaven of leaguing with treachery againſt me!—In the midſt of our voyage, which until then had proved remarkably
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032746_0174_0FF4FACC9D84ABD0"/>
auſpicious, a ſudden hurricane conſigned my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go and my hopes to a bottomleſs ocean; and the whole crew, after a perilous day ſpent on the ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered remnants of the ſhip, were fortunately reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from deſtruction by the humanity of a French ſhip of war, by which we were carried into Toulon.—Here, by the aſſiſtance of ſeveral benevolent Americans, I was lucratively employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a few months; when meeting with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity of returning to America, and abandoning the idea of fortune, who had thus jilted me, I embarked in an American veſſel for Philadelphia; my all conſiſting of a ſmall wardrobe, and about two hundred dollars in caſh, excluſive of my paſſage.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH theſe circumſtances by no means juſtified perſonal felicitation, believe me, my friend, I experienced a delightful exultation in the foreſight of parental joy at my return, and the welcoming ſmiles of my ſtill adored Fanny. Alas, theſe hopes were indeed ſleeting meteors to perplex my imagination!—In the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when my fancy was glowing with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of friendly delight and gratitude; liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in anticipation, to the melody of my char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's joy,—a new calamity blighted the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and intercepted the bland approach of
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032746_0175_0FF4FACE2B2549C0"/>
bliſs!—The veſſel was boarded by an Engliſh privateer, the paſſengers plundered of their all, the cargo carried into Bermuda, and condemned without reſerve. Here again, I narrowly eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a more execrable misfortune:—for thoſe who were unfriended or unprotected, were forcibly carried to unite in a war as repugnant to national morality, as oppreſſive to humanity.</p>
               <p>AFTER much application, I ſucceeded in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a paſſage for Baltimore, in compenſation for which I was to preſerve the accounts of the veſſel, and occaſionally aſſiſt in the labors of the crew. Alas, dear ſir, the recollection of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs at the moment of your benevolence, renews all the ſenſations of an immenſe gratitude!—I was landed, unknown and unfriended, in a large mercantile town; where the general purſuit of wealth is often known to eat up the natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of philanthrophic charity. I had now no deſire to proceed to Philadelphia; confident that the wretchedneſs of my condition would be diſtreſſing to the pity of my friends, and a ſubject of exultation for thoſe who had formerly either envied or hated me.—Alas, what was I to do? What ſhould I have done, but ſome act of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, had not your generous charity reſcued me from infamy, want, and ruin? Even to that
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:032746_0176_0FF4FACFB9038138"/>
charity my pride proved an ingrate, by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting a name! But I truſt, my friend, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the benefit which has reſulted from the artifice, you will forgive the wretch who exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALFRED, who reſides in the city during the influx of buſineſs, has been informed of my return, acquieſces in my addreſſes to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and has politely undertaken to arrange the affairs of my father. Theſe circumſtances have fluſhed me with the hope of ſoon becoming the happy huſband of my Fanny.—Oh, my friend, I have loſt a parent, and will not you be preſent at the extatic moment, to deliver up your ſon, (for am I not the child of your bounty) to this heavenly female? Abandon buſineſs, relinquiſh amuſements, to partake of the unbounded rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man, who views and thanks you, next to heaven, as the cauſe of his felicity!</p>
               <p>SINCE my reſidence here, I have obſerved a remarkable attachment in your young friend Charles for an amiable married lady, of the name of Franks, who is alſo a particular aſſociate of my Fanny. She is indeed an accompliſhed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;

                  <salute>DEAR MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AT the requeſt of your unhappy ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with whom I have recently enjoyed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence, I undertake to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the diſtreſsful cauſe of her late ſilence, and the event by which ſhe is diſabled from correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with you at preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:032746_0178_0FF4FAD995CA5E80"/>
ALAS, madam, how inſcrutable are the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Providence! How prompt is human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to repine at the wiſe diſpenſations of heaven; not becauſe they are really unjuſt or baneful, but becauſe their infinite wiſdom does not grovel to our frail judgment! Every example of woe; every bloody offering made to vice or the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is a loud leſſon of morality to the ſurviving children of miſfortune.—Oh, madam, I am unwilling to commence a tale, the horror of which would impreſs terror on the hearts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſenſibility; but in your affectionate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, whoſe ſympathy ſhares with its ſiſter's ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, will aſſuredly produce a deſperation of grief!</p>
               <p>—A CIRCUMSTANCE of importance in my life having lately occurred, from which flowed to my friend the moſt conſummate joy, your amiable ſiſter, in order to augment, if poſſible, my ſum of happineſs, kindly joined in the feſtivity of the occaſion. With a friendſhip whoſe ardour was as unceaſing as pure, ſhe ſeemed to labor to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate new topics of joy; devoting her time and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, her talents and induſtry, to the accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a period, in which ſhe particularly, and my loving relations generally, anticipated the moſt tranſcendant delight. Alas! but two days ago, after ſpending the greater part with us in
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:032746_0179_0FF4FAFD909139E8"/>
pleaſant amuſement, though her mirth was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bounded by a certain melancholic ſedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe returned home, accompanied by my brother Charles; who, after a ſhort interval, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared with paleneſs and horror in his face! For a while his concern choaked his utterance; But ſtruggling, he weakly exclaimed, "FRANKS IS DEAD!" and fainting, fell breathleſs on the floor!—Oh, madam, pardon me, if I have too abruptly developed to your fears the fatal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my letter!</p>
               <p>OUR firſt care was to revive my affected bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; after which, accompanied by a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and ſervant, I haſtened to the houſe of my eſteemed friend, to inquire into the truth of Charles' frightful intelligence. A death-like ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſurrounded the manſion!—We entered with abruptneſs; and meeting no perſon in the hall, proceeded to the well-known chamber where often my Caroline and I had indulged in ſerene and friendly pleaſures!—Oh, madam, here we diſcovered the ſhocking object of woe, which had ſo agitated the feelings of my brother!—The mangled figure of Franks lay weltering in his own gore! At each ſide had fallen the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtruments of his infuriate madneſs!—The ghaſtly ſpectacle deprived me of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:032746_0180_0FF4FADB245A2318"/>
and leaning on my companion, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to every circumſtance, until waking from my horrid ſtupefaction, I found myſelf in a room, where lay my diſtreſſed and invaluable friend, your dear ſiſter! Oh, madam, this ſecond ſhock nearly made frantic my ſoul!—The ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of my late happy hours, the ſolacer of my ſorrows was in the agonies of convulſion! Her tender arms bound by the fierce graſp of two male ſervants; while the heavenly voice whoſe ſound was ever muſic and delight, now wildly pierced the air with ſhrieks of hedious horror!—I would have gladly ruſhed into her frantic arms, and, at the peril of my life, encountered the terrific madneſs of my friend! But they tore me from her preſence, leaving her to the cruelty of unfeeling monſters!</p>
               <p>EARLY next day, I haſtened to the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcene—Oh, joyous reception!—My Caroline was calm and reaſonable in her diſtreſs.—Her brilliant eyes were either dimmed, or their fire extinguiſhed, by a night employed in tears and diſtracted miſery. The lilly had uſurped the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of the roſe, ſpreading over her heavenly face a deathly and affecting paleneſs!—She ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hand; and, bathing it in tears, begged me to write to you of the circumſtances of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032746_0181_0FF4FADCB372B720"/>
—I replied, I would, if ſhe thought it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſo grievouſly to afflict a tender ſiſter.—Alas, this remark wrapt her in profound meditation;—the big tears of anguiſh rolled down her cheek in the midſt of her reverie:—"For heaven's ſake," cried I, "my Caroline, why will you be ſo wretched?"—She ſcreamed, "Oh, my ſiſter, my ſiſter!" and again her dear frame was convulſed by the dominion of a horrible madneſs!—Thus has ſhe been ever ſince; her reaſon dawning forth at intervals, as the ſun after a dreadful ſtorm!—In her rational moments ſhe talks fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of you; then, ſtarting, cries for her mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered huſband; and relapſes into a paroxiſm by ſcreaming for my brother, who is ſtill confined by the firſt impreſſion of this tranſaction.</p>
               <p>ALAS, madam, my all of diſtreſs heretofore is inſignificant compared with that produced by this diſaſtrous event. Heaven only knows by what infernal motive the unfortunate man was tempted to the commiſſion of ſo impious an act; throwing himſelf guilty and unprepared into the face of heaven, and ſtaining the earth with ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious blood. Always have I remarked him to be a man of ſelfiſh principles; fond of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and adverſe to the joys of ſocial life. He had for a long time maintained a ſtrange inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:032746_0182_0FF4FADE451A55E0"/>
with an unworthy family in this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who, it is preſumed, were privy to the perpetration of this act. Alas, much I fear, that ſome unhappy influence from them has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him, without regard to religion or morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to turn a murderous hand upon himſelf. He left behind him no appeal to the world; no written explanation of the occaſion of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The evening after his cataſtrophe, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants buried his mangled corpſe in the foreſt back of the farm.</p>
               <p>AS to your dear ſiſter, much I apprehend, madam, that her tender nature, unable to bear this tremendous ſhock, will ſoon fall a victim to the ravages of madneſs. Already her exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrength renders her the ſad reſemblance of death; beſides which, ſhe perſiſts in refuſing all offers of nouriſhment.—We have ſent to town for Dr. R—, that patron of humanity, whoſe preſence imparts health to the patient, and comfort to the diſtreſſed.—Be aſſured, no act of ſervice ſhall be omitted by your</p>

               <p>MY appearance in this city, will no doubt, aſtoniſh you. It is produced by your laſt letter; not, however, as you will at firſt expect, to participate in your deſerved felicity, but, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear, to rankle it by a new ſpecies of diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>THE encloſed is for Charles Alfred, to whom I muſt requeſt you immediately to deliver it. He is a man, ſir, guilty of a ſyſtem of the moſt atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duplicity, exerciſed under the ſacred diſguiſe of friendſhip;—a man who has rendered the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of confidence, the baſe means of tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the character of my family. To reſent ſuch villainy is the purpoſe of my preſent viſit.—I ſhall forbear to relate the particular infamy of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; truſting that your ſenſe of honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, diſregarding the connexion you expect in
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:032746_0184_0FF4FAE8B75FFAC8"/>

               <p>GUILT like yours cannot long lurk in ſucceſsful concealment.

               <p>I HAVE, ſir, inadvertently detected the villainy of your motives, for the pretended modeſty of your withholding the name of the unhappy woman
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032746_0185_0FF4F9C39214CCA8"/>
whoſe virtue and fidelity you have violated.

But this idea, could not weaken or repel your diabolical deſign: By a perfidious encroachment on my underſtanding, you artfully angled, until you drew me into an approbation of the infernal deed.</p>

               <p>THE convulſion which the mind of young Alfred had recently endured from the ſhocking cataſtrophe of Franks, had juſt began to abate, when the trembling Wellsford delivered him this letter. The well-known hand of his friend caught his delighted eyes; and he opened it with elated feelings; but ah, how were they changed to horror and diſmay, when he read the cruel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives of his furious friend?—When he reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the myſterious circumſtance of his beloved Charlotte being the ſiſter of his deareſt friend? It flaſhed on his ſoul with intolerable poignancy; and, but for the ſupport of conſcientious integrity, he would inſtantly have fallen an innocent victim to ſenſibility. Deſtroying the letter, he devoted ſeveral hours in ſolitude to his chamber; and, previous to the fatal hour of his deſtiny, made a brief viſit to his oppreſſed Charlotte; whom he found immured in penſive madneſs. While ſhe was rational, he bade her adieu, urging her to drive from her imagination the figure of her dead huſband, who, in his life-time had acted unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name, and in his death unworthy the character of a man. The affecting diſcourſe, proceeding from one, who, next to herſelf, ſhe conceived as the cauſe of her huſband's ignoble end, naturally produced the agony of reflection, which reſulted in a paroxiſm of madneſs! He
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:032746_0187_0FF4FAF5A849E378"/>
left her with a heart riving with pity and torn by remorſe; and repairing to the ſcene nominated in the challenge of his friend, ſpent his time in fervent and loud expiation to heaven for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious guilt. "If, oh heaven," he exclaimed with tears, "I have erred, impute it not to the vileneſs of my heart; but to the weakneſs of my head;—to the ſeeds thou haſt planted in my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!" when, like a tyger, Courtney ruſhed upon him. "Wretch, infernal wretch," he cried, "defend yourſelf!" and drawing from his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket a loaded piſtol, repeated the exclamation. Charles, diſſolving from his devotion, begged his friend to be clam till he offered an explanation; but Courtney, ſwelling with paſſion, inſiſted, as he had cowardly come unarmed, on his making a choice of piſtols. "Alas, my friend," he ſaid, "I have no wrath for you, and therefore will not raiſe my hand againſt your life:—your ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance only is to be appeaſed—here, pour it in my boſom." Courtney, unmoved by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his friend, perſiſted in the choice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taking the inſtrument, Charles cried to him, "fire," and diſcharging it in the air, received that of Courtney full in his breaſt, and fell!</p>
               <p>COURTNEY haſtening from the hand of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, flew into the preſence of his ſiſter, and,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032746_0188_0FF4FAF73644E220"/>
while the fury of madneſs was tearing her ſoul; called down accumulated vengeance on her head. He diſappeared from the world; and Charlotte, acquainted of the cauſe of his fury, with a ſingle groan, followed her Charles into the regions of eternity!</p>
