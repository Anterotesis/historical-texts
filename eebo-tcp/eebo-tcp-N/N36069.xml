            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. The temporal executive council ſhall notify the preſent decree, within the day, to Louis Capet, and ſhall take the neceſſary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of police and ſafety to ſecure its execution within twenty-four hours, reckoning from the notification, and ſhall render an account of the whole to the national convention immediately after its execution.</p>

               <p>The executive council was convoked and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at a very early hour this morning, in order to conſult on the execution of a decree relative to Louis Capet.</p>

The train moved on with a ſlow pace from the Temple to the <hi>Boulevards,</hi> which was planned with cannon, and beſet with national guards, drums beating, trumpets ſounding, and colours flying. The <hi>Guillotine</hi> was erected in the middle of the ſquare, directly facing the gate of the garden of <hi>Thuileries,</hi> between the pedeſtal on which the grand-father of Louis was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the 10th of Auguſt, and the avenues which lead to the groves, called the <hi>Elyſion Fields.</hi> The trotting and neighing of horſes, the firrill found of the trumpets, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual beating of drums pierced the cars of every beholder and heightened the terrors of the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene.</p>
               <p>The ſcaffold was high and conſpicuous, the houſes ſurrounding the place of execution were full of women, who looked through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. The very ſlates which covered the roofs of the houſes were raiſed for the curious and intereſted to look through.</p>
               <p>The king alighted from the carriage at twenty minutes paſt ten, and aſcended the ſteps of the ſcaffold with heroic aſſurance, and every feature of his majeſtic countenance be ſpoke the calm ſerenity of conſcious innocence, and the heroic fortitude of a chriſtan.

               <p>Having then taken leave of his confeſſor who ſhed a thouſand tears, he beckoned with his hand to he heard; the noiſe of the warlike inſtruments ceaſed for a moment; but ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thouſand voices vociferated, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable ferocity, "<hi>No ſpeeches!

I forgive my enemies! I die innocent."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was then ſeized by the executioner dreſſed in black, and they immediately tied a plank of about eighteen inches broad, and an inch thick, to his body as he ſtood upright, ſuſtening it about his arms, belly and legs; this plank was about four feet long, and came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt up to his chin. The executioner directly laid him upon his belly on the bench and lifted up the upper part of the board which was to receive his neck, adjuſted to his head properly, then ſhut the board and pulled the ſtring, which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047100_0011_10224E61C199BAA0"/>
is faſtened to the peg at the top of the machine, which lifted up a latch, and down came the axe; [See the annexed plate.] the head was cut off in a moment, are fell into a baſket which was ready to receive it; the executioner took it up by the hair, to ſhew the populace, and then put it into another baſket along with the body.—The final part of his execution was exactly twenty-two minutes paſt ten.</p>
               <p>After his head was cut off, the <hi>Sans Cullottes</hi> and <hi>Jacobins</hi> waved their hats in the air; exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>vive la nation vive la republique!</hi> The muſic ſtruck up <hi>caira,</hi> and the body was immediately removed in a black coffin.—The proceſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Temple in full gallop, and the ſworn deputies went to make their report.</p>
               <p>Louis made a will, in which he aſked pardon of God, for having ſanctioned the decree upon the civil conſtitution of the clergy, although this ſanction was extorted by violence; and was contrary to his ſolemn proteſt.</p>
               <p>In this teſtament, Louis acknowledges his having freely accepted all the other parts of the conſtitution; and having neglected nothing to remove from his dominions the ſcourge of war, and prevent the invaſion of the Pruſſians.</p>
               <p>In a previous decree made by the national convention, the place for putting their inhuman
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047100_0012_10224DBF91BFEA30"/>
ſentence into executition was to have been the Carouſel, fronting the palace of the Thuille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This was changed by the miniſters, to whom all the arrangements were conſided, to the place de la Revolution, heretofore the place Louis XV.</p>
               <p>This city yeſterday reſembled an immenſe camp; the ſections and federates were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the different diſtricts;—they had their watch word; they wheeled round where one corps met the other. They carried with them upwards of 150 pieces of heavy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilery, and it made a moſt impoſing ſpectacle. They were conſtantly in motion, and could not ſtand ſtill five minutes.</p>
               <p>During the exhibition of this horrid ſcene, all Paris was in conſternation.</p>
               <p>The commiſſaries of the Temple found in the king's deſk ſome gold coin, to the amount of about 3000 livres. It was done up in rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and on then was written, "to M. Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherbes. This grateful bequeſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaſed monarch was not complied with—the money was depoſited in the ſecretary's office.</p>
               <p>Louis ſaw his laſt moment approaching with coolneſs and tranquility. It is long ſince he reſolved to ſacrifice life if we may judge from the two following anecdotes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:047100_0013_10224E6415E8F688"/>
Two years ago, M. de Laincourt repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Louis, that the modifications and the <hi>veto</hi> which he oppoſed to certain decrees, might be dangerous—"What can they do? replied Louis, "They will put you to death—well, I ſhall obtain an immortal for a mortal crown."</p>
               <p>The other anecdote is more recent, and proves like the former, that Louis never fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death,—On the day that Deſeze made his defence in the convention, Malaſherbes, in a converſation which he had with Louis in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening wiſhed to prepare him for the event by hinting that his defence might not be attended with the deſired effect, and that the iſſue was uncertain." "I underſtand, you" replied Louis, "but my reſolution is already taken. I ſee without fear my laſt hour approaching; and I ſhall lay my head on the block without unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. You will perhaps be ſurpriſed when I tell you that my wife and my ſiſter think exactly as I do."</p>
               <p>The laſt requeſts of the unfortunate Louis breathe his ſoul of magnanimity, and a mind enlightened with the fineſt ideas of human vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. He appears not to be that man which his enemies reported.—His heart was found, his head was clear, and he would have reigned with glory, had he but poſſeſſed thoſe faults
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:047100_0014_10224E07CF68C360"/>
which his aſſaſſins laid to his charge.—His mind poſſeſſed the ſuggeſtion of wiſdom; and even in his laſt moments, when the ſpirit of life was winging for another world, his lips gave utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to them, and he ſpoke with firmneſs and reſignation.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the life of Louis XVI. after a period of four years detention; during which he experienced from his ſubjects every ſpecies of Ignominy and cruelty which a people could inflict on the moſt ſanguinary tyrant.—Louis the XVI. who was proclaimed at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of his reign, <hi>the friend of the people;</hi> and by the conſtituent aſſembly, <hi>the reſtorer of their liberties;</hi>—LOUIS, who but a few years ſince was the moſt powerful monarch in Europe, has at laſt periſhed on the ſcaffold. Neither his own natural goodneſs of heart—his deſire to procure the happineſs of his ſubjects—nor that ancient love which the French entertained for their monarch, has not been ſufficient to ſave him from this <hi>cruel ſacrcifie.</hi>

               <p>"Marie Antoinette, widow of Louis Capet, has, ſince her abode in France, been the ſcourge and blood ſucker of the French: that

even before the happy revolution which gave the French people their ſovereignty, ſhe had political correſpondence with a man called the king of Bohemia and Hungary: that this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence was contrary to the intereſts of France; and not content with acting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with the brother of Louis Capet, and the infamous and execrable Colonne, at that time miniſter of the Finances; of having ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the finances of France (the fruit of the ſweat of the people) in a dreadful manner, to ſatisfy inordinate pleaſures, and to pay the agents of her criminal intrigues, it is notorious that ſhe has at different times tranſmitted milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the emperor, which ſerved him, and ſtill ſupports him to ſuſtain a war againſt the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; and that it is by ſuch exceſſive plunder, that ſhe has at length exhauſted the national treaſury.</p>
               <p>"That ſince the revolution, the widow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet has not for a moment withheld criminal intelligence and correſpondence with foreign powers, and in the interior of the republic, by agents devoted to her, whom ſhe ſubſidized and cauſed to be paid out of the treaſury of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devant civil liſt; that at various epochs ſhe has employed every manoeuvre that ſhe thought conſiſtent with her perfidious views to bring about a counter-revolution: firſt, having under
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047100_0019_10224E6CC0A6F248"/>
pretext of a neceſſary union between the ci-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant gardes du-corps, and the officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the regiment of Flanders, contrived a repaſt between theſe two corps on the firſt of October, 1789, which degenerated into an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute orgy as the deſired, and during the courſe of which the agents of the widow Capet perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeconded her counter-revolutionary projects; brought the greater part of the gueſts, in the moment of inebriety, to ſing ſongs expreſſive of their moſt entire devotion to the throne, and the moſt marked averſion of the people; of having excited them inſenſibly to wear the white cockade, and to tread the national cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade under foot; and of having authoriſed, by her preſence, all the counter-revolutionary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, particularly in encouraging the women who accompanied her, to diſtribute theſe white cockades among the gueſts; and having on the 4th of the ſame month, teſtified the moſt immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate joy at what paſſed during theſe orgies.</p>
               <p>'Secondly, Having in concert with Louis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet directed to be diſtributed very plentifully throughout the kingdom publications of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-revolutionary nature, ſome of which were pretended to have been publiſhed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators on the other ſide of the Rhine (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſuppoſe, in Coblentz) ſuch as—'Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the emigrants—Reply of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants—The emigratst othe people—The ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

follies are the beſt—The order of march—The return of the emigrants, and other ſuch writings:—of having carried her perfidy and diſſimulation to ſuch a height, as to have cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated writings in which ſhe herſelf is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in very unfavorable colors, in order to cloak the impoſture; thereby to make it to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to foreign powers that ſhe was extremely ill treated by Frenchmen, to inſtigate them to go to war with France.</p>
               <p>"That in order to carry on her counter-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary deſigns with more efficacy, ſhe, by means of agents, cauſed in Paris, towards the begining of October, 1789, a famine, which occaſioned a new inſurrection; in conſequence of which, an innumerable crowd of citizens of both ſexes ſet out for Verſailles on the 5th of ſaid month; that this fact is proved beyond all contradiction, as the next day there was a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every thing, even after the time that the widow Capet arrived with her family in Paris.</p>
               <p>"That being ſcarcely arrived in Paris, the widow Capet fertile in intrigues of every kind formed committees, conſiſting of all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-revolutioniſts and intriguers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent and legiſlative aſſemblies, which held their meeting in the dead of the night; that plots were there formed how to deſtroy the rights of man, and the decrees already paſſed, which were to form the baſis of the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047100_0021_10224E7116DBB710"/>
that it was at theſe committees, or meetings, that the neceſſary meaſures were deliberated to obtain a reviſion of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees which were favorably to the people; that the ſlight of Louis Capet, his widow, and his whole family, was impeded, as they travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under fictitious names, in the month of June 1791; that the widow Capet confeſſes in her interrogatory, that it was ſhe who opened and locked the door of the apartment thro' which the fugitives paſſed; that independent of the confeſſion of the widow Capet in this reſpect, it is confirmed, by the teſtimony of Louis Charles Capet, and by his ſiſter, that De la Fayette favored all the deſigns of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Capet, in the ſame manner as Bailly did white he was mayor of Paris, and that both were preſent when the fugitives eſcaped and favoured their ſlight as much in their power. That the widow Capet, after her return from Varennes, re-commenced her coteries at which ſhe herſelf preſided and that aided by her favourite La Fayette, the gates of the Thuilleries were kept locked, which deprived the citizens of the power of paſſing backwards and forwards in the courts of the Thuilleries; that thoſe only who had cards were permitted to paſs. That this order was given out by La Fayette as a meaſure of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:047100_0022_10224E7453676840"/>
puniſhment to the fugitives, though it ferved only as a trick to prevent the citizens from knowing what paſſed at theſe midnight or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and from diſcovering the plots againſt liberty carried on in this infamous abode.</p>
               <p>"That it was at theſe meetings, that the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible maſſacre which took place on the 17th of July, 1791, was planned, when ſo many zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous patriots were killed in the Champ de Mars; that the maſſacre which had previouſly taken place at Nancy, as well as thoſe which have ſince happened indifferent parts of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, were ordered and determined on in theſe ſecret councils; that theſe inſurrections, in which the blood of ſuch an immerſe number of patriots has been ſpilt, were plotted in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the more expeditiouſly and ſecurely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a reviſion of the decrees paſſed and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the rights of man, which were ſo obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to the ambition and counter-revolutionary views, of Louis Capet and Marie Antoinette, that the conſtitution of 1791, being once accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the widow Capet took every means in her power to deſtroy its energy by means of her manoeuvres; that ſhe employed agents in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the republic to effect this object of annihilating liberty, and to make the French once more to fall beneath the tyrannic yoke under which they had languiſhed for ſo many years; that for this purpoſe, the widow Capet

               <p>"That it is the widow Capet who cauſed perverſe miniſters to be nominated, and placed her creatures in the armies and public offices, men who were known by the whole nation to be conſpirators againſt liberty; that it was by her manoeuvres and thoſe of her agents, as able as they were perfidious, that ſhe got a new guard formed for Louis Capet, compoſed of ancient officers who had quitted their corps, and had refuſed to take the conſtitutional oath; that ſhe gave appointments to refractory prieſts and ſtrangers: and in ſhort, to all thoſe who were diſliked by the nation, and who were worthy of ſerving in the army of Coblentz, whither many of them fled after being caſhiered.</p>

"That it was the widow Capet, who in conjunction with a ſcandalous faction, at that time domineered over the legiſlative aſſembly, and for ſome time over the convention; who declared war againſt the king of Hungary and Bohemia, her own brother; that it was thro' her manoeuvres and intrigues, at all times pernicious to France, that the French were obliged to make their firſt retreat from Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>"That it is the widow Capet who forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to foreign courts the plan of the campaign, and the attacks which were agreed upon in the council: ſo that by means of this double treaſon, the enemies of France were always informed before hand of the movements of the armies of the republic; from whence it follows—that the widow Capet is the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs or all thoſe reverſes of fortune, which the armies of the republic have experinced at different times.</p>
               <p>"That the widow Capet combined and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her perfidious agents the horrible conſpiracy which broke out on the day of the 10th of Auguſt; which failed only through the courageous and the incredible efforts of the patriots: that to this end, ſhe ſeduced into her dwelling of the Thuilleries, and even into the ſubterraneous paſſages under it, Swiſs ſoldiers,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:047100_0025_10224E7A62F01398"/>
who at the expiration of a decree then paſſed, were no longer to belong to the body guard of Louis Capet; that ſhe kept them in a ſtate of drunkenneſs, from the 9th to the 10th in the morning, the day appointed for the execution of this horrible conſpiracy; that for the ſame purpoſe, ſhe had re-united on the 9th, a body of thoſe beings known by the name of the Knights of the Dagger, who had figured away with the ſame infamous deſigns, and in the ſame place, on the 21ſt of February, 1791, and again on the 21ſt of June, 1792.</p>
               <p>"That the widow Capet, fearing no doubt that this conſpiracy might not have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed effect, went on the evening of the 9th of Auguſt, at half after nine, into the room where the Swiſs, and others in her intereſt, were buſy making carriages; that in order to excite them the more, ſhe took up the cartouches and bit them.</p>
               <p>"That the next day, the 10th of Auguſt, ſhe preſſed and ſolicited Louis Capet to go to the Thuilleries at five in the morning, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the real Swiſs guards and thoſe who had aſſumed their uniform; and at his return ſhe preſented him with a piſtol, ſaying—"This is the moment to ſhew yourſelf," and on his refuſing ſhe called him a coward.</p>

denies having given any orders to fire on the people, her conduct on the 9th—her deeds in the room of the Swiſs guards—the councils ſhe held all the night long—the article of the piſtol, and her words to Louis Capet; their ſudden retreat from the Thuilleries, and the firing on the people at that very moment he and ſhe entered the room of the legiſlative aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly;—in one word, all theſe circumſtances united, leave no doubt but that in her councils during the night, it was reſolved that the people muſt be fired at, and that Louis Capet and Marie Antoinette, the female director of that conſpiracy, ſhould themſelves give the orders to fire.</p>
               <p>"That to the perfidious, intrigues, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvres of the widow Capet, in confederacy with that infamous faction of which we have juſt ſpoken, and with all the enemies of the republic, France is indebted for the internal war which has diſtreſſed her ſo long; but the end of which is fortunately not much more diſtant than that of its authors.</p>
               <p>"That at all times, the widow Capet by the influence ſhe had acquired over Louis Capet, inſinuated into him that perfidious and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art of diſſimulation, to promiſe by public acts the very contrary he intended to perform; and that they both in their midnight councils

plotted the ruin of that liberty, ſo dear to Frenchmen, [and which, they will take care to perſerve] and to recover the plenitude of the royal prerogatives.</p>
               <p>That finally, the widow Capet, in every reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect immoral, and a new Aggrippina, is ſo diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſo familiar with all crimes, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting her quality of mother, and the limits preſcribed by the law of nature, has not heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to proſtitute herſelf with Louis Charles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet her ſon, &amp;c. according to the confeſſion of the latter, ſhe has committed indecencies with him, the very idea and name of which, ſtrike the ſoul with horror."</p>

               <p>Laurent Lecointre, deputy to the national convention, depoſed againſt the accuſed, for having formerly been the wife of the <hi>ci-devant</hi> king of France; and for being the perſon who, at the time of her removal to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had charged him with a memorial to the convention, in order to gain over 12 or 14 perſons, whom ſhe mentions, to what ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her ſervice.

the accuſed, refuſed to fire upon the people. At length, the Pariſians having ſhaken off the yoke of tyranny, this revolutionary movement roam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the energy of their brethern at Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles. They formed the very hardy and courageous project of freeing themſelves from the oppreſſion of the deſpot, or of his agents. On the 28th of July, the citizens of Verſailles formed a with to organize themſelves into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional guards, like their brethren at Paris. They nevertheleſs propoſed to conſult the king; the negociator was the <hi>ci-devant</hi> prince de Poix. Endeavours were made to prolong the matter; but the organization having been made, the ſtaff was appointed; D'Eſtaing was named commandant general, and Gouvernet ſecond in command.</p>
               <p>Some others here entered into the detail of the acts which proceded and followed the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the 20th of September, ſent for ſome officers of the national guard, and made them a preſent of two colours; a third remained, which they were told was deſtined for a batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of pretended guards paid for the avowed purpoſe, as it was declared, of relieving the inhabitants of Verſailles, who were thus cajo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the ſame time that it was affected to pity, them, they in reality were abhorted.</p>

guard gave a repaſt to its brave brethren, the ſoldiers of the regiment of Flanders. The public journals gave an account at the time, that at the repaſt of the citizens, nothing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed contrary to the principles of liberty; but that the feaſt given October the 1ſt, by the gardes de corps, had no other aim than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the national guard againſt the cidevant ſoldiers of Flanders, and the chaſſeurs des trois Eveches.</p>
               <p>"The witneſs obſerved, that the accuſed appeared at this latter part with her huſband; that they were loudly applauded there; that the air, <hi>O Richard!

               <p>Upon the requeſt of the public accuſer, the tribunal ordered, that a mandamus ſhould be iſſued to bring forth Perceval d'Eſtaing.</p>

               <p>The deponent here detailed what happened at Verſailles on the 5th and 6th of October, d'Eſtaing being informed of the movements which were making in Paris, went to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipality of Verſailles in order to obtain permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to carry away the ci-devant king, who was then hunting, and who was entirely ignorant of what was paſſing; with a promiſe to bring him back when tranquillity ſhould be reſtored.
