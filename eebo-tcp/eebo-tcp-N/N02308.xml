            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE are the Words (you are ſenſible) of bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Doctor of the Gentiles, &amp; as one calls him, the great Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Clergy. They breathe the true Spirit of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and are very agreeable, I hope, to the Diſpoſitions &amp; Reſolutions of our dear <hi>Brother,</hi> who is this day to be ſolemnly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. As they are very fit to be his Ordination-Vow; ſo I'm perſwaded, they
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002744_0003_0FE61FD40101C060"/>
enter into his Soul, and tell us the ſecret Language of his Heart: and truly glad ſhou'd I have been, if (purſuant to the Cuſtom, which hath ſo long obtain'd among us) he cou'd have been prevail'd on to take up the Book at this time, &amp; preach to us his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Thoughts &amp; Purpoſes. Or otherwiſe, if he might juſtly be excus'd upon the Plea's uſually advanc'd in this caſe, againſt the common Cuſtom,— Why cou'd not ſome venerable Father or elder Brother in this Neighbourhood, have taken the desk? Which, as it muſt needs have been acceptable to the Audience, ſo I'm ſure exceedingly more pleaſing to <hi>me,</hi> who am the unfitteſt among the Multitude of my Brethren, to ſpeak on ſo great an Occaſion, and to ſuch an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But ſince this part of the Day's work has been devolv'd upon me, I wou'd ask your ready &amp; grave Attention, while I endeavour, with all plainneſs of Speech and in the moſt familiar &amp; uſeful manner I can, to repreſent &amp; urge ſome of the Things which concern both Miniſters &amp; People. Men &amp; Brethren, I pretend not to any new Doctrine, neither ſtand here to inform or dictate: but bear with me, while I ſtir up your Minds by way of Remembrance. For ſo it becomes us to exhort &amp; admoniſh one another, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on theſe Solemnities; and not be negligent to put each other always in mind of theſe Things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' we know them, and are eſtabliſh'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Truth.</p>
            <p>The words I've read to you, contain a rich Fund of uſeful &amp; ſeaſonable Meditations. But ſhou'd I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a juſt Diſcourſe on the ſeveral parts of the Text, I muſt needs tranſgreſs the uſual Limits, and take up abundantly too much of the Time, which on ſuch a day particularly is very precious. If therefore
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002744_0004_0FE61FDB7158EF40"/>
I wave the formality of dividing my Text, as well as paſs over the Connection of the words, and but hint at ſome of the Reflections they afford, (that I may not be over tedious &amp; burdenſome) you'l eaſily forgive me this wrong.</p>
            <p>The Argument I have chiefly in view, and which ſeems a genuine &amp; obvious Inference from the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red paſſage before us, is this,—</p>
            <q>That <hi>Miniſters are to be held a kind of</hi> FATHERS, <hi>in the Church of GOD.</hi> They ſtand as in the Relation of <hi>Parents</hi> to the Eccleſiaſtical Families of God's People, and ſhou'd ſtudy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Fatherly Spirit in the whole of their ſacred Miniſtry.</q>
            <p>The Apoſtle hints the Relation, &amp; breathes the Spirit, in the words of our Text: and his conſtant Practice was full of bright &amp; inſtructive Comments upon it.</p>
            <p>The Parental Relation is the <hi>ſecond</hi> in human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; next to the Conjugal. 'Tis a ſuperiour Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and carries Authority with it: a near Relation, and beſpeaks the tendereſt Love, the greateſt Care, and Complacence. It carries a peculiar Affection &amp; Endearment, to ſweeten &amp; regulate the Authority and Power of it. And this may be the Reaſon why it is made a <hi>Pattern,</hi> &amp; every other Relation, in which there's Superiority, is in Scripture ſet forth under the Parental Character. Hence the Supreme Lord of all is ſtiled the <hi>Everlaſting Father</hi>; and when he would ſet out his own boundleſs Love &amp; Pity to his People, He compares it to the Bowels of a <hi>Mother,</hi> and the Compaſſion of a <hi>Father,</hi> as the moſt lively and <hi>ſenſible</hi> Repreſentations. — Hence alſo <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> are called Fathers. In ſeveral Nations, the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002744_0005_0FE6203CB7CCF150"/>
Princes &amp; Governours have affected this Title, as the moſt ſplendid Badge of Honour. Among the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, their Princes aſſum'd the appellative Name, <hi>Abimelech,</hi> i. e. My Father the King. The Roman Senators of old tho't it their brighteſt Character to be <hi>Patriae Patres,</hi> Fathers of their Country; and the Oratour conſtantly ſalutes them with the Stile of <hi>Patres conſcripti. — Job,</hi> that godly Arabian Prince, glories in it, that he was a <hi>Father</hi> to his People. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> cry'd after <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Chariot, <hi>Abreck,</hi> i. e. (as many carry it) <hi>Tender Father</hi>! And in the Prophet, it is promiſed the Church, that Kings ſhould be <hi>Nurſing Fathers,</hi> and Queens <hi>Nurſing Mothers</hi> to her.—But then this is the ſtyle of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as well as Magiſtrates. There are Fathers in the Church, as well as the State. And indeed this Title of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was in old time a very common Name for the Miniſters of Religion. Hence <hi>Eliſha</hi> cry'd after the aſcending Prophet, <hi>My Father, my Father!</hi> — And He had this Reſpect repaid him by the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who wept over the dying Prophet, ſaying, <hi>O my Father, my Father!</hi> — And ſome good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters judge, that <hi>Solomon</hi> perſonates the <hi>Preacher,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>Hear, ye Children, the Inſtruction of a</hi> Father, <hi>and attend to know Underſtanding.</hi> A manner of Addreſs much like that ſo often us'd by the Apoſtle <hi>John, — My little Children,</hi> theſe things write I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that you ſin not: <hi>Little Children,</hi> let no man deceive you. He uſed this Compellation, as being a Father to them by <hi>Office,</hi> as well as in Years. And to add no more, <hi>Micah</hi> invited the wandring young <hi>Levite</hi> to his Houſe, in thoſe Terms, — <hi>Dwell with me, and be unto me a Father, and a Prieſt.</hi> And in the ſame Language was he afterwards invited away by
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002744_0006_0FE61FDB78AAE988"/>
the Children of <hi>Dan,—Go with us, and be to us a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to my Deſign, which mainly is to take a View of the Goſpel Miniſter under this notion of a Spiritual <hi>Father</hi>: A Character, which though it be very naturally applicable to him, and is a Scripture-Title, and muſt needs be equally pleaſant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to meditate upon, yet perhaps but ſeldom has been allow'd its due Conſideration. 'Tis not an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Title; but is full of Duty, full of Dignity, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charm. This external Character, when found in conjunction with thoſe intrinſick Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Accompliſhments, &amp; Virtues, which correſpond to it, gives us the moſt Divine Idea of the Goſpel-Miniſter, &amp; makes him appear in his trueſt Glory.</p>
            <p>This Character, apply'd to Miniſters, may import the following things more eſpecially</p>
            <p n="1">1. It carries in it an Idea of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> and ſpeaks the Eminence of their <hi>Station</hi> in the Houſe of GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It hints to us the noble <hi>End</hi> of their Inſtitution; with the <hi>Importance</hi> and <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> of ſuch an Order of Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It points out the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of their Office.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It ſuggeſts to us what their <hi>Qualifications</hi> and Accompliſhments ſhould be.</p>
            <p n="5">5 It tells us what <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Deportments</hi> do become them.</p>
            <p>Finally, It teaches us the <hi>Duty</hi> and Reſpect, which <hi>People</hi> owe to their Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Nothing ſhort of theſe Things can be intended in this Character of <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Fathers</hi>; and all of them I think, are fairly included. They are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002744_0007_0FE61FDC85D35D10"/>
Heads of Diſcourſe: but I ſhall endeavour to ſum up what is to be ſaid upon them, in as few words as is conſiſtent with my double Deſign, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parents as well Natural, as Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Then, <hi>Miniſters may be call'd Parents or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in regard of their</hi> Station <hi>and</hi> Authority <hi>in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Paſtor ſtands as 'twere in the Father's place; a Poſt of Dignity and Power.</p>
            <p>Every Father ordinarily has a Family and Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of his own: and all that belong to it are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to Him, in their Domeſtic Capacity. He is the Head of the Houſe, by the Law of Nature and Reaſon of Things. As the Head is the higheſt and moſt conſpicuous Part of the Body; is placed at the Top, has a governing Power ever all the reſt of the Members, &amp; is the Glory of the Man: So the Parents are the principal and moſt eminent Members of the Family; but in ſpecial, the Father. The Husband is the Head of the Wife: and beſure then the Father is Head over the Children.</p>
            <p>Man is by the Capacity and Propenſity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a ſociable Creature: well ſtyl'd by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, <hi>A political Animal.</hi> We are form'd for mutual Fellowſhip and Commerce; without which many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable purpoſes of Life can't be ſerv'd. 'Tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the political Well-being of Mankind, that they combine together in diſtinct Societies: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually neceſſary it is, that in every Society there be Government and Order. Now a Family is the firſt Society in Nature; a kind of little Kingdom, where the Diſtinctions of Superior and Inferior, Governor and Governed take place, by an inevitable Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002744_0008_0FE61FDC8CD7CBC8"/>
and the force of natural Light. Had Mankind continu'd in their original State of Innocence and Happineſs, it is highly probable there would have been a Diſtinction of Orders and Degrees among them. Doubtleſs at leaſt there had been diſtinct Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: and Nature has in theſe founded an immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Difference of Order, a Superiority &amp; Inferiority between the Parents and the Children. Leviliſm here beſure is contrary to the unalterable Reaſon of Things, and bids Defiance to the God of Nature. The Superiority and Power of Parents in their own Houſes, is eſtabliſh'd upon the juſteſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Claims: and the careful preſervation of it makes much for the Harmony, Beauty and Strength of theſe little Bodies politick.</p>
            <p>Now, when Miniſters are call'd Parents or Fathers, it may intimate that their Station and Figure in the Church, carries a Shadow of this Paternal Eminence. JESUS CHRIST is Supreme Head of the Church: but He has deputed Miniſters to preſide over parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Flocks or Families of his People, as his Subſtitutes and Agents. We read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27, 28. Ye are the Body of Chriſt, and Members in particular: And GOD hath ſet ſome in the Church, <hi>Teachers, — Helps, Governments.</hi> So <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. He gave— ſome <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> — for the work of the Miniſtry, till we all come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — The Church is compared to a <hi>Houſehold,</hi> (which is an orderly Society, implying a Variety of Members, in a State of Inequality and Subordination) and Miniſters are placed therein as Fathers, to guide the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The many other exalted Titles and Names of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given them in the Scriptures, make this appear with a glaring Evidence. Thus they are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002744_0009_0FE61FE2A01A4AD0"/>
called <hi>Angels</hi>; partly no doubt with an eye to the diſtinguiſhing Elevation and Authority of thoſe Heavenly Powers, as well as to their eminent Purity and Zeal. So, the <hi>Lights</hi> of the World; in alluſion to the glorious Luminaries over our Heads; the Sun which was made to rule by Day, and the Moon and Stars, which were made to rule by Night. They are called <hi>Stars</hi>; becauſe they move in a Superiour Orb, as well as to "ſignify their diffuſive Light and beneficial Influences" — They are called <hi>Overſeers</hi> of the Church, and are ſaid to be <hi>over them</hi> in the Lord; to have the <hi>Rule over them.</hi> — Not for that they have <hi>Dominion</hi> over their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but are helpers of their Joy: Neither as being <hi>Lords,</hi> to tyranniſe over GODs Heritage; but as <hi>Parents,</hi> whoſe Yoke is naturally of all others the moſt eaſy, and their Burden light. Yet neither do We pretend to ſtretch the power of Miniſters to the height of Parental Authority, or make it altogether of the ſame kind; but only aſcribe to them ſome faint Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and lower Degrees. We mean not to aſſume to our ſelves a Civil or Temporal Superiority and Dominion: but only aſſert our Station <hi>in the Church,</hi> and Right of Precedence and Rule in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, according to the Word of GOD, that unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Directory. We would make <hi>This</hi> our grand Rule, in the exerciſe of our Paſtoral Authority. And (I will add) ſo far as we appprehend that celebrated Summary of Church-Diſcipline, commonly call'd the <hi>Platform,</hi> is grounded on the Scriptures, we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur with it, and deſire to guide our ſelves by it in our Paſtoral Care.

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002744_0010_0FE61FE2A71DC370"/>
claim a kind of Parental Power in the Church. — Yet we confeſs, our Authority is not Legiſlative, but Executive; not of a carnal, but ſpiritual Nature: not coercive, but ſuaſory and rational; not ſolitary, but ſocial, to be exerciſed (ordinarily at leaſt) in the preſence and with the Conſent of the Church.</p>
            <p>Neither do we pretend to exerciſe Paſtoral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any other than the <hi>particular Churches,</hi> which we are called to the overſight of; even as the Heads of Families extend not their parental Power beyond the Limits of their particular Charges. — Nor do we ſubmit to any <hi>Foreign Juriſdiction,</hi> in Affairs Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical. We are for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Paſtors, &amp; Communion of Churches in all the Offices of Brotherly Love &amp; Neighborly Care and Aſſiſtance, <q>for their mutual Good and Edification, according to Capacity &amp; Opportunity.</q> Our venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Synods</hi> have very much inculcated the careful preſerving of Church-Communion. Nevertheleſs They hold that <q>Every Church or particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of viſible Saints, in Goſpel-Order, hath full Power Eccleſiaſtical within it ſelf, and is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. From whence they think it follows, that Conſociation of Churches is not to <hi>hinder</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this Power, but by Counſel from the Word of GOD to direct and ſtrengthen the ſame upon all juſt Occaſions.</q> Thus the Synod in 62. — So the Platform obſerves, <q>Churches [which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Paſtors] are diſtinct, and therefore may not be confounded one with another: and <hi>Equal,</hi> and therefore have not Dominion one over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</q> — Indeed they look upon particular Churches to be as diſtinct, equal and independent, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002744_0011_0FE61FE463B07980"/>
particular Families: and think <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> agree in this, that as theſe in their Domeſtick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, ſo thoſe in their Eccleſiaſtical Character, have no Preheminence or Authority one over another. The Title of <hi>Father in God,</hi> they look upon as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and undiſtinguiſh'd Character of every Biſhop and Paſtor; and the Divine Commiſſion they act upon, as forever one and the ſame: which neceſſarily ſets them all on a Level, ſuperſedes all pretences of an unequal Authority, and forbids any <hi>Strife among them which of them ſhould be Chief.</hi> — Now, let the Senſe of the Dignity and Authority of our Office, only ſerve to inſpire us with a juſt Solicitude, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Reverence due to our high Calling, by a ſutable Conduct in it, and not expoſe it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Profane, by doing things unworthy of it. And let the only Contention among <hi>us</hi> of this Order be, <hi>who</hi> ſhall make the fulleſt proof of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and in the moſt real &amp; noble Effects of Love, approve himſelf a Spiritual Father to his People. We ſhould be more Studious to deſerve than to aſſert the Honour due to our Sacred Calling; and ſhould take Pleaſure (with the Apoſtle) even in Reproches and Neceſſities for Chriſt's ſake. — I am become a Fool in glorying: Ye have compelled me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' I ſhould boaſt ſomewhat more of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (which the Lord hath given us for Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not for Deſtruction) I ſhould not at all be aſham'd.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>When Miniſters are called Parents, it points us to the excellent</hi> End <hi>of their Inſtitution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the</hi> Importance <hi>and</hi> Uſefulneſs <hi>of this Order of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002744_0012_0FE61FE46C3CD828"/>This Character leads us to the noble Deſign of their being ſet in the Church, which is, that they may ſeek the Good of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> all their Days, and be ſingular Bleſſings to their Generation. For ſuch is the wiſe Parent in his Family, and to the World. Vaſt are the Benefits, unknown the happy Fruits of Parental Care and Love, under a due Regulation, and accompany'd with the Divine Benediction. A Parent has peculiar Opportunities to ſerve his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by training up his Children in Wiſdom and Virtue. Parents (as ſuch) generally move in a Sphere very narrow; but yet of peculiar Importance to the Publick: and they often become diffuſive Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, by the good Education of their Children, and diſcreet Government of their private Charges. And both the Nature of their Relation, and the Intention of the GOD of Nature, render it neceſſary, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſtudy in this way to do ſignal Service to the World.</p>
            <p>Hence this Title of Parents, given to Miniſters, carries us back to the Original Deſign of their Office, <hi>viz.</hi> the Good of Mankind, and more eſpecially of the People under their Charge. The Miniſtry ſurely was never inſtituted, merely that ſome Men might have the advantage to get a Living by it, or obtain a little Diſtinction and Power above others: But the primary Intention of it was, to be a Miniſtry under Chriſt, to the good of Souls; that ſuch as are of this Order, might approve themſelves <hi>Fathers</hi> to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in all Offices of Love to their Souls; and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Peace, Order, Virtue and Religion among them, become great Benefactors to the Publick. — This Style of Parents tells us what ſhould be our main Inducement, in taking up this holy Calling;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002744_0013_0FE61FE6F6E26658"/>
and what the governing Aim of our Miniſtry ought to be, in all the Acts and Exerciſes of it, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to Doctrine, Worſhip, or Diſcipline. It tells us what Bleſſings Miniſters ſhould Study to be, and what Bleſſings all faithful and wiſe Miniſters in fact are, to a People: as Lights, to guide them; as Pillars and Foundations, to ſupport them; as Fountains, to refreſh them; as Shields, to defend them. Thoſe two Characters were very agreeably united in the Lamentation of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> over the Prophet on his Death bed, <hi>O my Father, my Father, the Chariots of Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof.</hi>!— As to particular Families, much of their Beauty &amp; Safety is bound up in the wiſe &amp; good Fathers at the Head of them. Even ſo learned and faithful Miniſters are very much the Strength and Glory of a People. Hence the Apoſtle obſerves, that the Office of a Biſhop is a <hi>good Work,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>This Title of Parents, give to Miniſters, very much points out the</hi> Nature <hi>and</hi> Buſineſs <hi>of their Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not an airy Title of Honour, this of Parents; but is big with ſolid Duty, and implies abundant Buſineſs, Care, and Labour. You that are Parents, and have Families, are doubtleſs ſo ſenſible of the daily Returns of Duty, Toil, &amp; Fatigue, in the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Station, that you need not any Amplifications on this head, to illuſtrate the matter to you.</p>
            <p>Agreeably the work of the Miniſtry is a great Work, and in ſome Places almoſt an immenſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Whatever many may think of it, 'tis no Idle or Eaſy Profeſſion; but full of Services, laborious, painful, &amp; continually revolving. To which add the Conſideration of their own Infirmities, natural as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002744_0014_0FE61FE7048E8100"/>
well as moral, being Men of like Paſſions with others; together with the perverſe Humours of many proud and obſtinate Sinners they have to deal with; &amp; the various Temptations that attend this Employment, from Satan, the Fleſh, and World—. Theſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conſpire (agreeably to this Character of Parents given Miniſters) to proclaim the Difficulty of their Calling. And this Character may ſerve to inform us very much in the Nature &amp; Buſineſs of their Office. Here let me ſay diſtinctly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the Buſineſs of Miniſters to endeavour the <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> of Sinners.</p>
            <p>They may be called Fathers, as they are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to propagate the Divine Nature, &amp; promote the New Birth of Souls. 'Tis on this Account that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſtiles himſelf a <hi>Father</hi> to the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp; calls them his beloved <hi>Sons</hi>; for (ſays he) <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 14, 15.</note>. So he ſays to <hi>Philemon,</hi> I beſeech thee for my <hi>SON Oneſimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds.</hi> — Hence the Goſpel-Adminiſtration is call'd <hi>the Regeneration</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.23.</note>. We are all by Nature Children of Wrath, Children of the Devil, a Seed of evil Doers. But GOD in the Riches of his Grace, ſeeking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a godly Seed, ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that he ſhould taſte Death for every Man, and thereby recover us unto Life, Liberty &amp; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect thro Sufferings. And now it pleaſeth GOD by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching to ſave them that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002744_0015_0FE61FEDC4E65948"/>
believe. We preach Chriſt crucify'd; and are not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt; for it is the Power of GOD unto Salvation. 'Tis the grand means of begetting Souls to a ſpiritual Life. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. Of his own Will <hi>begat</hi> He us, with the <hi>Word</hi> of Truth. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the <hi>word of God.</hi> There is a kind of propagatory Virtue in the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is apply'd by the Spirit of GOD for the production of a ſpiritual offspring. The Word doth not produce the new Creature merely by its own natural Efficacy; but by the concurring Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Grace on the Heart. 'Tis therefore called the Miniſtry of the Spirit: &amp; we are ſaid to be born of the Spirit; yet alſo to be born again by the Word, and Miniſters are ſaid to beget us through the Goſpel. — Hence then (in a remote and low and improper ſenſe) the Character of Parents may be apply'd to Miniſters, as they are Inſtruments in the Converſion of Sinners: and the Converts of Sion may in a ſubordinate ſenſe be call'd their Sons &amp; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>"Aaron</hi>'s Sons (as one obſerves) are call'd the Generations of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as <hi>Aaron</hi> (Numb. 3.1.) tho none of his natural Sons are there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned — <hi>Aaron</hi>'s they were by natural Generation; <hi>Moſes</hi>'s perhaps by a ſpiritual Regeneration and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction"</p>
            <p>The Work of Miniſters is to turn Sinners to GOD thro' the Goſpel; and thereby to raiſe up a ſpiritual Seed to Chriſt, their Elder Brother. — Not indeed that they can do this by any Principle or Power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor may they attempt it in their own ſolitary ſtrength, but muſt have their abſolute Dependence on Chriſt, who ſaid even to his Apoſtles (thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002744_0016_0FE61FEDCBE1E690"/>
Fathers of the Church) <hi>Without Me,</hi> Ye can do nothing. — In this matter of the New-Birth, verily a <hi>Paul</hi> is nothing; an <hi>Apollo</hi> is nothing; but all our Sufficiency is of GOD. 'Tis His ſole Prerogative to give the Increaſe. — Thus even as to natural Birth, this is not in the power of Mortals: but its GOD that frameth our Bodies in ſecret, and formeth the Spirit of Man within him. Hear what good <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his diſcontented Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Jacob's</hi> anger was kindled againſt <hi>Rachel,</hi> and he ſaid, <q>Am I in <hi>God's ſtead,</hi> who hath with-held from thee the fruit of the Womb!</q> — So afterwards when his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> met him and his Flocks, and ſaid, Who are thoſe with thee? He anſwered, <q>The Children which <hi>GOD</hi> hath graciouſly given thy Servant.</q> Parents are only the Inſtruments (in ſome ſenſe) of their Children's being: their Formation is of GOD the prime Efficient. — So as to the Renovation of Souls, this likewiſe is from GOD. The Saints are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus. Miniſters are at beſt but mere Inſtruments in the hand of GOD. Yet <hi>being ſuch,</hi> they may be called Parents, in regard of Thoſe who thro' their Miniſtry are begotten and born to GOD. And to be Parents in this ſenſe, is what they ſhould continually aſpire after. 'Tis one eminent part of their ſacred Employment to labour the Converſion of Sinners, that they may become the Children of GOD by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus! and ſo the Family of Chriſt be inlarged, by their being added to the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their buſineſs is to <hi>provide for, nouriſh</hi> and <hi>feed</hi> the Children of GOD</p>
            <p>'Tis one of the duties of Parents toward their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to make all needful proviſion for their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002744_0017_0FE61FF3D91D0FD8"/>
Livelihood. Thus, while in their helpleſs Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Parents muſt carefully nurſe &amp; cheriſh their tender bodies, and endeavour to ſupply all their wants. And during their whole minority, they ſhould take care that they be well provided for, ſuitably to their age, quality, &amp; the like; ſhould ſee 'em train'd up in ſome good and profitable Buſineſs, by which they may afterwards be able (if need be) to provide for themſelves; and ſhould ſtudy to lay up Something to leave as an agreeable Portion to them Hence the Apoſtle tells us in our Text, "The Parents ought to lay up for the Children This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is one of the fundamental dictates of Nature, as well as Religion. So that (as he obſerves elſewhere) If any Man provide not for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the Faith and is worſe than an Infidel: — yea is loſt to all natural Affection, &amp; become more vile than the very Brutes that have no underſtanding; who from an Inſtinct of Nature are very provident Caterers for their Young. Thus the <hi>Hen</hi> lovingly gathereth her Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens under her Wings, and with greateſt Care and Induſtry feeds and cheriſhes her tender Brood, till able to provide for themſelves. (Even the Sea-Monſters draw out the breaſt, and give ſuck to their Whelps.) Only the <hi>Oſtrich</hi> of the Wilderneſs is cruel, who leaveth her eggs in the duſt, forgetting that the foot may cruſh them, and is hardned againſt her young ones as tho' they were not hers. Unto which cruel Bird may <hi>he</hi> be liken'd, who provides not for his own. Surely ſuch an one is more brutiſh than any Man, and has forfeited the name of Father. 'Tis one eſſential Property of a Parent to provide as well as he can for the comfortable Subſiſtence of his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002744_0018_0FE61FF44F213EC8"/>
Children. In this reſpect <hi>Job</hi> calls himſelf a Father to the Poor, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> was made a Father to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his People. And this is alluded to, where the GOD of Iſrael ſaith, <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up children,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now in this reſpect Miniſters are to act the part of Fathers toward their People, by providing &amp; diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſpiritual Food to them, for the ſtrengthning and improving the Divine Life in their Souls. Their Duty is ſuggeſted in that precious Promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. I will give you Paſtors according to mine heart, which ſhall <hi>feed you</hi> with Knowledge and Underſtanding. It was propheſied of Chriſt, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.4. He ſhall ſtand and feed in the ſtrength of the Lord. — Even ſo Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are charged to do: See <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>They muſt be nurſing Fathers to the new-born Babes (Young and feeble Chriſtians) and feed them with the ſincere Milk of the Word (with eaſy plain Truths, firſt Principles of the Oracles of GOD) that they may grow thereby: for ſuch have need of Milk, and not of ſtrong Meat. In which we have the Apoſtle for an Example, who ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. <q>And I Brethren, could not ſpeak unto you, as unto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto Babes in Chriſt. I have <hi>fed</hi> you with <hi>Milk,</hi> and not with Meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</q> But then there are Chriſtians ſtronger in the Faith, and more improv'd in Knowlege &amp; Grace, who ſhould have a different Portion dealt out to them; as the ſame Apoſtle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <q>Strong <hi>Meat</hi> belongeth to them that are of full age, even thoſe who by reaſon of uſe have their Senſes exerciſed to diſcern both Good and Evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002744_0019_0FE61FF557748C10"/>Miniſters are Stewards of the Myſteries of GOD, and ſhould feed the Houſehold with Food convenient; rightly dividing the <hi>Word,</hi> and giving to every one his proper portion, whether of Inſtruction, Reproof, Advice, or Comfort. And they ſhould endeavour that all who (in a Judgment of rational Charity) have a right to the Children's bread, may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>: and by the diſpenſation of theſe Ordinances, as well as of the Word, they are to feed the Flock of GOD, &amp; confirm the Souls of the Diſciples.</p>
            <p>They ſhould continually be either diſtributing the Bread of Life to Souls, or preparing the ſacred Food. They muſt by daily Study and Prayer be <hi>laying up</hi> in Head and Heart a Treaſure of Knowledge, that they may be able with the good Houſeholder to bring forth things both new and old. They muſt look well to their <hi>Preparations</hi> for the Pulpit; that they don't ſtarve the Souls of their People, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful meat, and unprofitable Traſh; but nouriſh them up with ſubſtantial and agreeable Food (with ſound Doctrine, with wholeſome words) even as a Father cheriſheth his Children — Moreover, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents know how to give good Gifts to their Children, and uſually leave to them ſome ſpecial Tokens of their Love, for a Memorial of 'em, when they are gone: ſo ſhould Miniſters be ready to impart ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Gifts unto their People (to the end that they may be eſtabliſhed) by Spreading Books of Piety among them, as they are able, and therein make proviſion for coming Generations, as well as for the preſent. Agreeably thus ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Pet. 1.15. <hi>I will endeavour that you may be able after my Deceaſe, to have theſe things always in remembrance.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002744_0020_0FE61FF55E64B360"/>
Nature, as well as Religion, teaches us to conſult the Benefit of Poſterity, and lay up in Store for theſe that ſhall come after us. <hi>A good Man</hi> (its ſaid) <hi>leaves an Inheritance to his Children.</hi> The beſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail is <hi>Religion,</hi> which relates to the Soul, the better Part. The Soul is the Man: and Proviſion for that is the moſt excellent Proviſion, moſt worthy the Care of natural Parents, and in a peculiar manner of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Fathers, whoſe ſpecial Employment is to promote the Welfair of Souls.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis their buſineſs to <hi>inſtruct, inſpect,</hi> &amp; <hi>govern</hi> the Family committed to their Charge.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Duty of Parents to <hi>inſtruct</hi> their Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, both in the Things which concern the Life that now is, and in thoſe which relate to the Life that is to come. They muſt ſee that their Children be taught ſome uſeful Art, Trade, or Employment, and impart to 'em as much as is proper of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this World. But above all, it's of indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable obligation on Parents to teach their Children the Fear of the Lord, &amp; inſtruct them in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Chriſt, whom to know is Life eternal. They muſt walk in their Houſes <hi>according to Knowlege</hi>; being themſelves well acquainted with theit Bibles, and ready to communicate their Knowlege to their Children, that every one of them may (with <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>) from a Child know the Scriptures, which are able to make them wiſe unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. They ſhould in a ſolemn manner daily read the ſacred Writings to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as valuing the Word of GOD more than their neceſſary Food. They ſhould alſo frequently Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſe their Children (inſtilling into them the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion) ſo long as they are ſuch as have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002744_0021_0FE61FFF040966C8"/>
need of Milk. They ſhould alſo by Familiar Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from time to time (as they are able) open to them the Scriptures, while they walk by the way, or ſit in the Houſe, when they lie down, and when they riſe up, giving them Line upon Line, here a little &amp; there a little. — And as they come to riper Age, muſt proportion and adapt their Inſtructions to their growing capacity.</p>
            <p>Even ſo <hi>Miniſters</hi> are ſet in the Church to be <hi>Teachers.</hi> And they muſt teach their larger Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in all the forementioned ways; giving attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (with <hi>Timothy</hi> to Reading, to Exhortation, and Doctrine. The Prieſts Lips ſhould preſerve Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and diſpenſe it. But this having been glanc'd at under a former Head, I ſhall only obſerve here, that on this account Miniſters may be called Fathers, and their People their Children.

likewiſe Family-Government &amp; Diſcipline muſt be duly maintained. It was utterly a Fault in <hi>Eli,</hi> that when his Sons made themſelves vile, he reſtrained them not. And alike negligent was <hi>David,</hi> of his Son <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah,</hi> concerning whom we read, His Father had not diſpleaſed him at any time, in ſaying, Why haſt thou done ſo? — No wonder then that he exalted himſelf in the manner he did, to ſuperſede &amp; dethrone his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father. Moſt of the Confuſions &amp; Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in Families are owing to the Parents faulty Negligence, &amp; Imprudence, &amp; Unfaithfulneſs. No Society can well ſubſiſt without Government &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and as the beſt way to maintain Authority in Families, is to advance &amp; keep up Religion in it: ſo Parents ſhould apply their Authority to promote Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in their Houſes by all poſſible methods of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Light of Nature teaches us, that every Man ſhould bear Rule in his own Houſe: and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion teaches us, that <hi>there is no power but of God.</hi> They therefore who are Heads of Families, ſhould employ their Authority <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> and be a Terror not to good works, but to evil. They ſhou'd countenance Virtue, and diſcourage Vice, as much as poſſible, in their Families; reſolving every one with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord. They ſhould (with <hi>Abraham</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Houſehold to keep the way of the Lord: and when Correction may be needful, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely apply this wholſome Remedy, and not <hi>ſpare the Rod</hi> Behold, this is to bring up their Children in the Nurture &amp; Admonition of the Lord. 'Tis but agreeable to the Conduct of God towards his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14.

with the rod of Men, and with the ſtripes of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men.</p>
            <p>And even ſo Miniſters, who are ſaid to be Rulers over the Houſehold, ſhould ſtudy to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Fathers to their People, by a due exerciſe of their Paſtoral Authority, in all proper acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; Diſcipline, agreeable to their Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>Thus they muſt <hi>invite</hi> &amp; <hi>admit</hi> into the viſible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Chriſt, by Baptiſm, and unto the Table of the Lord, ſuch as are meet &amp; proper Subjects of theſe holy Ordinances, and only ſuch; careful to keep out of his Houſe ill Servants, left the Children ſhou'd learn their ways, and get a ſnare to their Souls.</p>
            <p>They muſt <hi>watch</hi> over them that are committed to their Charge; take heed unto themſelves, and to all the Flock; watching for their Souls, as thoſe that muſt give an Account.</p>
            <p>They muſt exerciſe their power and ſhew all good fidelity in <hi>reproving</hi> Sin; rebuking (where there is occaſion for it) with <hi>all Authority,</hi> as a Father doth his Children, when he ſees them do amiſs.</p>
            <p>They are alſo to <hi>warn</hi> and admoniſh. I Cor. 4.14. <hi>As my beloved ſons, I warn you.</hi> Private Chriſtians may, yea, ſhou'd (and I wiſh they did more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) reprove &amp; warn one another: But then They do it merely in a war of Charity &amp; Brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Whereas Miniſters act herein as publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and their Reproofs &amp; Admonitions carry ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Paternal Authority with them.

in remembrance, <hi>charging them before the Lord.</hi> Indeed when they command or charge, it muſt be only in the Name &amp; Cauſe of CHRIST, our common Head and Maſter. They are to be obey'd only (as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are requir'd to obey their Parents) <hi>in the Lord</hi>: and therefore they muſt keep cloſe to the Word, as their Directory, &amp; take all their Charges &amp; Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of that, &amp; give them forth as the Commands of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, They are to <hi>excommunicate</hi> impenitent ſcandalous Offenders. Them that ſo ſin, they are to <hi>rebuke before all,</hi> that others alſo may fear; &amp; after the firſt &amp; ſecond Admonition, <hi>reject.</hi> The Apoſtle directs the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>put away from among themſelves</hi> a wicked Perſon that had defiled their Communion. They were to do it by their <hi>Elders</hi>; unto whom it belongs by Office to exerciſe that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with the Concurrence of the Brethren. By their hand the Keys are to be turn'd, both in opening and ſhutting the Doors of GOD's Houſe.</p>
            <p>Again, They are to <hi>reſtore</hi> him that is lapſed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Repentance; take off the Sentence &amp; Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was inflicted of many, &amp; forgive and comfort him, as tender Parents welcome home a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Prodigal.</p>
            <p>In a word, They are both to exhort and convince <hi>Gainſayers,</hi> and ſtop the Mouths of unruly and vain Talkers &amp; Deceivers, who reſiſt the Truth, &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Souls. Some they muſt rebuke ſharply, that they may be ſound in the Faith, or at leaſt may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further: while on others they muſt have Compaſſion, in Meekneſs inſtructing them. They muſt endeavour by ſound doctrine to recover ſuch as are fallen into Error, to eſtabliſh the wavering, to

ſupport the feebleminded, &amp; build them up on their moſt holy Faith. — But I conclude this head with that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. <hi>You know how we exhoried and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his Children.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. Miniſters are to <hi>bleſs</hi> their People, and to <hi>pray with and for them</hi>: and in this perform the part of Parents toward them.</p>
            <p>Parents, and in ſpecial the Fathers, are to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their houſes in Divine Worſhip, &amp; be their mouth to GOD in Family-Prayer, as well as his Mouth to them in Family-Inſtruction. Theſe are Duties taught us by the Light of natural Reaſon, &amp; enforced by the Laws of reveal'd Religion. And in the order of Nature it belongs to the Parents to lead in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exerciſes. They whoſe province it is to guide the Houſe, &amp; preſide in the ſecular Affairs of it, ſhou'd alſo go before the Family in the things of GOD. Every Maſter is as well a Prieſt to his houſe, as a little King &amp; Prophet. The Father in old time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inſtitution of diſtinct Orders among Men, ſuſtain'd this threefold character, &amp; offer'd Sacrifices, as well as bare Rule, &amp; taught within his own walls. And in Acts of natural Religion (ſuch as Prayer) he ſo far ſtill remains a Prieſt unto GOD, that he muſt lead his family in the ſpiritual Sacrifices of Prayer &amp; Praiſe; which ſhould, as the continual burnt offering, be preſented daily morning &amp; evening. We find the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherever he pitch'd his Tent, building an <hi>Altar</hi> (a Family-Altar) &amp; ſerving at it, in his own perſon. We read alſo of <hi>Job</hi>'s ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Children, by burnt-offerings according to the number of them all. Thus (its ſaid) did <hi>Job</hi> continually. — It is ſpoken of <hi>David,</hi> as what was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002744_0026_0FE6204B63CA3370"/>
his Cuſtom, after the Tranſlation of the Ark, that he returned to <hi>bleſs his Houſehold.</hi> — And it is required of Maſters, as they would give to their Servants that which is juſt &amp; equal, that (knowing they themſelves alſo have a Maſter in heaven) they <hi>continue in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, praying TOGETHER</hi>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, Churches being a kind of larger Houſeholds, in which Miniſters are ſpiritual Fathers, they are to bleſs theſe their Eccleſiaſtical Families in the Name of the Lord; to pray for them in their Cloſets, and to pray with them in private on ſpecial occaſions as they are called (ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14.) but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the publick Congregation. Of old the Lord ſeparated the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to ſtand before him &amp; to <hi>bleſs in his Name.</hi> And this makes a part of the Office of Goſpel-Miniſters alſo. Tho' we don't (that I at preſent remember) expreſsly read any where of the Apoſtles or firſt Miniſters of the Goſpel lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the prayers of any publick Aſſembly: yet doubtleſs it was their Practice, &amp; ſeems to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in ſeveral places. — The Apoſtles do inſert <hi>Benedictions,</hi> in their Letters to the Churches: and undoubtedly wherever they preach'd a Sermon, they pray'd with the Aſſembly, &amp; pronounced a Bleſſing on the Worthy. Even ſo ſhould every Miniſter. They muſt lead in the Devotions of GOD's Houſe; ſolemnly bleſs their People upon all proper Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether in publick or private, as well as make mention of them always in all their ſecret Prayers. They are oblig'd by their Office to give themſelves to <hi>Prayer,</hi> equally as to the Miniſtry of the Word.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002744_0027_0FE61FFF0B6CA308"/>
And this is but what becomes the Character of <hi>Fathers,</hi> which they ſuſtain. Thus the young <hi>Levite</hi> was a <hi>Father</hi> &amp; a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Miniſters are oblig'd to be</hi> Examples <hi>of Religion before their People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Parents partake of the ſame Nature, which they propagate unto their Children: So Miniſters ſhould ſee to it that they themſelves be real Inſtances of that viral Sanctity, which 'tis the grand buſineſs of their Office to promote &amp; ſpread in the World.</p>
            <p>The Example of Parents carries a peculiar Force and Impreſſion with it; which Reflection ſhould make them ever ſolicitous to be exemplary in all their language &amp; demeanour before their Houſehould. And of the like Influence is the Example of Miniſters. They therefore ſhould ſtudy to teach Religion by their Practice as well as Doctrine; that the former adding Weight &amp; Efficacy to the latter, ſuch as have not been wrought on by their Word, may be won by their good Converſation in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is not only a moral duty of common obligation on Miniſters with other Chriſtian Profeſſors; but ſeems given them in charge even as a part of their ſacred Office, and an inſtituted Medium for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on their Work to better advantage, That they be careful to ſet a good Example; which is the moſt Divine &amp; excellent, the moſt familiar, compendious and engaging method of Inſtruction — Hence if Miniſters ſet a <hi>bad</hi> Example they are <hi>doubly</hi> guilty before GOD.</p>
            <p>Miniſters are (as Parents in the Family) in a ſomewhat <hi>elevated</hi> and <hi>conſpicuous</hi> Station; they are as a City ſet on a Hill, which can't be hid. They
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002744_0028_0FE6204C6D630C90"/>
lie very open to Obſervation, &amp; many Eyes are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. It is of no ſmall Conſequence therefore, that they walk circumſpectly, &amp; be holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Converſation; So, they will ſhine as Lights in the World, &amp; diffuſe benign Beams &amp; Influences; will adorn their Doctrine, &amp; make Religion appear with an attractive beauty &amp; luſtre. Whereas, on the contrary, if they are vicious &amp; diſſolute, their ill Example has a direct Tendency to ſtain the honour of the Goſpel, to give a Reputation to Vice; to harden the Wicked, &amp; wound the Righteous Souls among their People. <q>The wicked Lives of ſuch will read loud Lectures of Atheiſm &amp; Irreligion, &amp; ſpread a deadly Infection, which waſteth at noon-day: while yet in their publick Diſcourſes they may talk like Angels of light.</q> If the Prieſts make themſelves vile, the People will ſoon come to abhor the Offerings of the Lord.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add here; Perſons are ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated the <hi>Children</hi> of others, from their <hi>Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> &amp; <hi>Imitation</hi> of them. For this reaſon in part are Believers called the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe they walk in his ſteps: &amp; he is call'd the <hi>Father</hi> of us all, as being an eminent Example of Faith to all Generations.</p>
            <p>Hence then, Miniſters are oblig'd by this character of Fathers, to ſhew themſelves <hi>Patterns</hi> of good works. It is therefore expreſsly required of them, in the Scriptures, — That they be <hi>blameleſs, and of good behaviour</hi>; Lovers of hoſpitality; Lovers of good men; ſober, juſt, holy, temperate; not given to Wine; not greedy of filthy Lucre; no Brawlers, no Strikers, not ſoon angry, not ſelf-willed, neither carrying it as Lords, but being Enſamples to the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002744_0029_0FE62003A7FB7558"/>
Flock: Enſamples in Word, in Converſation, in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity: fleeing all youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Luſts; from which if a Man purge himſelf, he ſhall be a Veſſel unto honour, ſanctify'd, &amp; meet for the Maſter's uſe, &amp; prepared unto every good work. In particular no ſmall ſtreſs is laid upon Miniſters being Patterns for <hi>Family-Government</hi> &amp; Diſcipline: that they rule well their own Houſes, having their Children in ſubjection with all gravity; for (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>) if a Man know not how to rule his own houſe, how ſhall he take care of the Church of GOD?</p>
            <p>Theſe are Apoſtolick Canons, of a Divine Original, unqueſtionably authentick; and do loudly beſpeak entertainment with all that would approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves genuine Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp; truly Fathers to their People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> For all theſe ends, they muſt <hi>perſonally reſide</hi> among their People, as Parents dwell with their Children &amp; Family. The Apoſtle would have Mothers to love their Children, to be diſcreet, keepers at home, guiding the Houſe. And Fathers are oblig'd to reſide as conſtantly with their Families as poſſible. In alluſion to this the names of Father &amp; Mother are ſometimes made uſe of to ſignify intimate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion &amp; Familiarity; as in <hi>Job</hi> 17.14 &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. — 18. Even ſo Miniſters ſhould live among their People, that they may get acquainted with them, and know the ſtate of their Flocks, in ſome meaſure as Parents know the ſtate of their Families, &amp; have an intimate acquaintance with their Children. In populous places indeed, &amp; large Congregations, it is difficult to attain a perſonal knowlege of every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual. Yet the ends of the Miniſtry require that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002744_0030_0FE62003B087B0D8"/>
a Paſtor be at leaſt acquainted with the general ſtate of his People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he ſhould ſeek after a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acquaintance, as far as he can, by careful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, by paſtoral Viſits, by asking &amp; receiving Viſits from them, &amp;c. that he may know their Soul-wants, &amp; be able to ſuit his ſpiritual Proviſions to their various Appetites &amp; Capacities. Miniſters muſt reſide with their particular Charges; to the end they may watch for Souls; may inſpect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of their People; may ſhine before them by the light of an holy Example, &amp;c. For theſe ends (I ſay) perſonal Reſidence is their duty; &amp; ſeems neceſſary, as they wou'd approve themſelves worthy the Title of Fathers. It looks unnatural, &amp; a foul Incongruity in them, to be long or often needleſsly abſent from their Charges; much more to dwell ſtately at a remote diſtance; or finally leave them but upon the moſt juſtifiable &amp; important Reaſons. The Reprimand may be apply'd in ſuch Caſes, that was given the Prophet, when he was out of his place, <hi>What doeſt thou here,</hi> Elijah?</p>
            <p>But thus much for the third thing, The nature and buſineſs of their Office. I come now to another general head.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>This title of Parents or Fathers, ſuggeſts to us ſome of the</hi> Qualifications, Gifts <hi>and</hi> Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>that are requiſite for the work of the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men have ſometimes this Title apply'd to them, in regard to their Age, their Knowlege, their Wiſdom, Experience, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seniority</hi> gives this Denomination. Hence the Apoſtle begins his Apology (Act. 22.1.) with thoſe diſtinct Compellations, <hi>Men, Brethren, and Fathers.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:002744_0031_0FE6200C98FA60F0"/>
Now, in this application of the word, Some in the Miniſtry are emphatically <hi>Fathers,</hi> &amp; have a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing right to the Name, by reaſon of their ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable Hoary Head. And tho' theſe are not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſons intitled to that Character, &amp; tho' advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Age is not requiſite to the Miniſtry; yet let me take occaſion to ſay here, It ſeems the higheſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that Perſons be able to write <hi>Man,</hi> and be arriv'd to years of Maturity &amp; Solidity, before they aſſume this Office &amp; Character.</p>
            <p>Under the <hi>Levitical</hi> Diſpenſation, only <hi>middle-ag'd</hi> Men of the Tribe of Levi were employ'd in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Tabernacle. The Limits were from 30 years old to 50. — I ſhall offer an Account of this matter, in the words of Mr <hi>Henry,</hi> (in his Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.) <q>Of the other Tribes, thoſe that were number'd to go forth to <hi>War,</hi> were from 20 years old &amp; upward, but of the <hi>Levites</hi> only from 30 to 50: for the Service of GOD requires the beſt of our Strength, &amp; the Prime of our Time, which cannot be better ſpent than to the Honour of Him, who is the Firſt &amp; Beſt. And a Man may make a good Soldier much ſooner than a good Miniſter. They were not to be employ'd till they were 30 years old, becauſe till then they were in danger of retaining ſomething childiſh &amp; youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp; had not Gravity enough to do the Service, and wear the Honour of a <hi>Levite.</hi> At 25 years old they were enter'd as Probationers, <hi>Num.</hi> 8.24. and in <hi>David's</hi> time (when there was more work to be done) at 20. But they muſt be 5 years learning, &amp; waiting, &amp; ſo ſitting themſelves for Service: nay in <hi>David</hi>'s time, they were 10 years <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">

his publick Miniſtry, &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> his, at 30 years old. — It is not in the Letter of it obliging to Goſpel-Miniſtere now, as if they muſt not begin their Work till 30 years old: but it gives us two good-Rules. (1) That Miniſters muſt not be <hi>Novices.</hi> 'Tis a work that requires Ripeneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; great Stayedneſs; &amp; therefore thoſe are very unfit for it, who are yet but Babes in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, &amp; have not put away childiſh things. (2) That they muſt <hi>learn</hi> before they <hi>teach, ſerve</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they <hi>rule,</hi> &amp; muſt firſt be <hi>prov'd</hi>; then let them uſe the Office, being found blameleſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Miniſtry is an Office of Authority: &amp; natural Decency requires, that ſuch as execute it, be Men both in years, &amp; parts. Beſides otherwiſe there will be danger of two things: (1) of their being bloated with <hi>Self-Conceit,</hi> with young <hi>Nadab</hi> &amp; <hi>Abihu,</hi> to their Ruin. Hence the Apoſtle inſerts it in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Biſhop. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Not a Novice</hi>; leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Devil. And then (2) there will be danger of their falling into <hi>Contempt,</hi> as being but of Yeſterday, &amp; knowing nothing.</p>
            <p>The Miniſtry is a hard &amp; critical Work, &amp; of a ſuperiour nature; &amp; ſuch a work had need have a wiſe Head &amp; dextrous Hand to manage it. Verily it requires the beſt Furniture of Science, Prudence, Fortitude, &amp; Reſolution, to ſupply all its occaſions, and wade thro' its Difficulties. They hadn't need be very young, &amp; tender, &amp; unexperienc'd, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch a Work; which will many times exerciſe all the Strength, Skill, &amp; Courage of a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Cephas</hi> and an <hi>Apollos</hi> united.

Study, Prayer, &amp; Obſervation. — Let me pauſe here a little, and having firſt laid my hand on my own breaſt, permit me to ſay, — Many of us have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reflect with Shame upon our Ruſhing into the Pulpit ſo young, ſo undiſciplin'd, &amp; unfurniſh'd: and all of us have too ſad occaſion to lament our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Inexpertneſs, &amp; manifold Deficiencies.</p>
            <p>I go on, —</p>
            <p>Miniſters had need be Men of good natural Powers; and theſe well cultivated by a liberal Education. It is requiſite they be acquainted with the Tongues, Arts &amp; Sciences; &amp; have thoſe meaſures of acquir'd Literature, which may advance them above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Level, &amp; diſtinguiſh them from the Generality of their People, as much as Parents uſually excell their Children in Knowlege. They had need be Men in Underſtanding; and eſpecially ſhould they be mighty in the Scriptures; that they may be apt to teach, &amp; able both to exhort &amp; convince. Elſe they little deſerve the name of Fathers. For ſaith the Apoſtle, Every one that is unskilful in the Word, is a <hi>Babe.</hi> — They ſhould be ready Scribes, well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Kingdom of GOD. They are call'd the Lights of the World. A Star without light, is not a greater ſoleciſm than a Miniſter without ſome good portion of Theological Learning.</p>
            <p>Further, Another very important Requiſite is Wiſdom. — <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Who then is that faithful and wiſe Steward</hi> —! Theſe Eccleſiaſtical Fathers had need be perſons of Wiſdom as well as Fidelity: come to a virile Conſiſtence &amp; Perfection in their Reaſon and Judgment; having a juſt Government of their Thoughts, Appetites, &amp; Paſſions; &amp; well verſt in the Art of Buſineſs; knowing in Things as well
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002744_0034_0FE6200DB09CAFD8"/>
as Words, &amp; having read Men as well as Books; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually skill'd in Manners &amp; Principles; acquainted with the variety of critical &amp; perplext Caſes that occur in the Miniſtry; &amp; underſtanding in the Times: that they may be able to manage their Affairs with Diſcretion; may know how to behave themſelves in the houſe of GOD &amp; among his People; to apply properly to Perſons of all Characters, of all Tempers and Conditions, &amp; to ſpeak a word in Seaſon upon all occaſions. In theſe things wiſdom is profitable to direct.</p>
            <p>Moreover, (it deſerves a ſpecial Remark) the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is a <hi>holy</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Work, &amp; therefore calls for <hi>gracious</hi> Qualifications; requires no little Strength in Grace, &amp; Experience in vital Chriſtianity. [An unexperienc'd Pilot is not a greater Abſurdity than an unexperienc'd Miniſter.] Surely Miniſters ought to be ſuch as deſerve the Name of <hi>Fathers,</hi> (in the Senſe wherein 'tis us'd by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.13.) in diſtinction from <hi>Young Men</hi> &amp; <hi>little Children,</hi> or more imperfect Beginners in Religion. — The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ought to be a Father, in regard of his manly Attainments in Grace; at leaſt of <hi>full age,</hi> &amp; among thoſe who by reaſon of <hi>Uſe</hi> have their Senſes exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcern both Good &amp; Evil: — Not a <hi>Novice,</hi> a Weakling or Babe in Chriſt, of ſhort Standing and little Proficiency in the School of Heaven; much leſs a Child of this World, an unſanctify'd Sinner, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated only in the form of Godlineſs Sure I am, ſuch an one muſt often neceſſarily be very aukward in his managements, &amp; ſcarce know how to deal with Souls in many caſes; muſt needs be frequently put to a Stand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſometimes to the Bluſh, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of his own Ignorance &amp; Inexperience in
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002744_0035_0FE620146A7F4D90"/>
Divine Things. — If the Miniſter be not an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Chriſtian, certainly he muſt make but a <hi>poor Caſuiſt</hi>; an unſafe Guide, very uncapable to lead the Blind; an unſafe Phyſician, uncapable to apply to the Wounded in Spirit, with that skill, &amp; tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; fidelity, which their condition requires. — The Miniſter had need be ſtrong in Faith; rooted in Love; fill'd with ſpiritual Wiſdom; under the governing power of Divine Principles, &amp; improv'd in all the Graces of the active &amp; paſive Life. — <hi>Otherwiſe</hi> he will <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

There will not be that Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, that Humility, that Life &amp; Affection, in his Prayers, his Sermons, &amp; other Performances, which becomes a ſpiritual Father.</p>
            <p>It is a Reflection, pertinent to our purpoſe, which we have from one <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Paſchal.</hi>
               </note> of the greateſt Maſters of Thought in the laſt age, — That the <hi>Heart</hi> has its Arguments &amp; Motives, with which <hi>the Reaſon</hi> is not

acquainted. We feel this (ſays he) in a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It is the Heart, &amp; not the Reaſon, which has properly the Perception of <hi>GOD</hi> —. The Judgment &amp; Underſtanding have their proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: which is by Principles and Demonſtrations. The Heart &amp; Affections have a Method altogether different. A Man wou'd expoſe himſelf very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably, who ſhould go about to engage our <hi>Love,</hi> by laying down, in a Philoſophical Order, the Springs and Cauſes of that Paſſion." (Thus he) And agreeable is that Remark, from another Maſterly Hand <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Bates.</hi>
               </note> "It is not compoſing a Sermon with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Art, &amp; the delivering of it like an Orator, that makes a Miniſter accepted with GOD: and uſually ſuch Sermons are without Profit to the Hearers. The ſound of words only reaches the Ear: 'tis the Mind convinces the Mind, &amp; the Heart perſuades the Heart. He that is burning in his own breaſt, will inflame others: but if there be no Celeſtial Fire in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's breaſt, he ſpeaks of Divine Truths without a deep Concernment; and a Cold Preacher makes a cold Hearer: So the Sermon is loſt in the Air between the lips of the one &amp; the ears of the other. — Indeed (as we have the Remark from a like excellent Hand<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bp. <hi>Hopkins.</hi>
               </note>) "GOD may feed his People, as He did <hi>Elijah,</hi> by a Raven; and make a cold Breath kindle the ſparks of Grace in the Hearts of others. But yet ſuch an one as ſpeaks <hi>from</hi> the Heart, is moſt like to ſpeak <hi>unto</hi> it. And it is commonly obſerv'd, That they are the Labours of ſuch, that GOD moſt uſually owns &amp; crowns with Succeſs."</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that Miniſters had need be truly
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002744_0037_0FE620157A064750"/>
               <hi>Men of God,</hi> endow'd with ſuperior meaſures both of Gifts &amp; Graces, &amp; have that Wiſdom, Weight, and Experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may juſtly intitle them <hi>Spiritual</hi> Fathers.</p>
            <p>I paſs now to another general Head.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>This title of Parents tells us what the</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <hi>and</hi> Deportments <hi>are which do become Miniſters</hi>; that they ſhould expreſs a <hi>Fatherly Spirit</hi> in their Miniſtry, and imitate the Conduct of wiſe, tender, and religious Parents.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Name</hi> inſcrib'd upon them muſt give Law to all their Powers, &amp; direct their Tempers &amp; Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that as they are Parents by Office &amp; Title, they may be ſuch by Analogy &amp; in Fact. Now a wide Proſpect opens before me here; and might I be permitted to expatiate, a great deal cou'd be ſaid to profitable purpoſe. But I ſhall ſtudy to bring my Thoughts into a narrow Compaſs; &amp; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſomewhat prevented my ſelf, by many incidental Hints I've mingled in the foregoing part of this Diſcourſe. Yet I ſhould hardly be juſt to my Text, if I did not allow the head we are now upon, a diſtinct Conſideration. Suffer me then to ſay here.</p>
            <p>(1) Miniſters ſhould <hi>bear</hi> all ſutable <hi>Parental Affections</hi> toward their People.</p>
            <p>They ſhould be Fathers to their People in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Love is the firſt &amp; moſt eſſential paſſion in a Parent. Our Children being ſo many parts of our ſelves (without a figure) we love 'em by a natural and almoſt invincible Inſtinct. And as it ſeems a property of Love to deſcend with the greateſt force; ſo the Love of Parents is perhaps of all others the ſtrongeſt, &amp; uſually flows down in a reſiſtleſs Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002744_0038_0FE6204C74974990"/>
of Benevolence, Zeal &amp; Solicitude. Hence if Miniſters would ſhew themſelves in truth Fathers to their People, their Breaſts muſt be fill'd with Love, and flame with paternal Paſſions.</p>
            <p>They muſt ſee to it that their Love be <hi>real</hi> &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, as that of Parents; not a painted blaze, but a living Reality. For it's poſſible there may be glittering Diſſemblers (like <hi>Judas</hi>) who have not the leaſt ſpark of ſacred fire in their boſoms; but their hearts cold &amp; dead as a Stone, while yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all without may be flame &amp; heat.</p>
            <p>Again, Their Love muſt be <hi>pure,</hi> &amp; without the the mixture of corrupt Aims; a free &amp; generous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, like that in Parents,; &amp; a ſpiritual Affection, kindled by motives of a heavenly extract, &amp; regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine Principles &amp; Deſigns. Not a general Philanthropy only, nor a Party-Friendſhip; not a mercenary &amp; ſenſitive Affection; a mere human Love, terminating in carnal Conſiderations; ſuch as theirs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.17. <hi>They zealously affect you, but not well</hi>; that is, not ſincerely, or upon true &amp; genuine Views. All worldly Conſiderations are heterogenous Springs. Where <hi>Self</hi> only or mainly is concerned &amp; intended, the Love is of a falſe Original. We muſt be animated by the ſame Spirit with the holy Apoſtle, who ſays in our Text, <hi>I ſeek not yours but you: &amp; I will gladly ſpend &amp; be ſpent for your</hi> Souls <note n="†" place="bottom">So it is in the Original.</note> 
               <hi>tho' more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly I love you, the leſs I be loved.</hi> — It muſt be a Love to Souls, a Love to Chriſt in his People, &amp; a Love to them for Chriſt's ſake. This is to love the Brethren with a pure heart.</p>
            <p>Again, Their Love muſt be <hi>impartial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as the love of parents generally is or ſhould be. It muſt extend
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002744_0039_0FE6201585C81A40"/>
to all their People, without exception, &amp; without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons. Indeed it can't be exerciſed toward all exactly in the ſame manner &amp; degree without any diſtinction: this is neither poſſible, nor a duty. Yet it muſt be univerſal in its goodwill at leaſt, &amp; not limited by any ſiniſter Conſiderations. Suppoſe we have receiv'd Affronts &amp; Abuſes; or ſuppoſe perſonal Defects in this &amp; the other; Deformity of Body, or (which is worſe) a Crookedneſs of Temper; or Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Meanneſs of Condition; or a prevailing Unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs under our Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet in none of theſe Caſes is Love to be diſpens'd with. It is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing for Miniſters or Parents to want a hearty Affection to their Children or People, or to any of them. Corrupt Partiality has been the Bane &amp; Ruin of many Families &amp; Churches Unity &amp; Peace.</p>
            <p>Again, Their Love muſt he <hi>fervent,</hi> like that of tender Parents. We are to love our Neighbors as our ſelves; &amp; yet are allow'd to love our Children in an uncommon degree. So Miniſters ſhould love all Men; but the People of their Charge, in a peculiar manner. Not contenting themſelves with ſome little faint ſpark of Affection, they ſhould endeavour to get their Hearts inſpir'd with a burning Zeal, with Parental Ardours.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It ſhould be <hi>conſtant</hi> &amp; perſevering. The Love of Parents is a natural Affection: &amp; what's natural, is fix'd &amp; durable. So Miniſters ſhould have a kind of natural Affection for their People; an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Love, an unperiſhing flame, which many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can't quench.</p>
            <p>In fine, It muſt be a very <hi>active</hi> Principle; reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all the Powers of their Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; producing all agreeable inward Motions, Deſires &amp; Reſentments.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002744_0040_0FE62019D82DB280"/>
What is it that a loving &amp; gracious Parent feels within? O the tender Sympathy &amp; Concern that fills his breaſt! The ardency of Deſire! The vigour of active Pity! The painful Senſations, upon his Childrens Afflictions or Miſcarriages! His Heart akes, his Soul melts &amp; bleeds out in Tears of Grief for them. — But O! the Joy &amp; Raviſhment, upon their Proſperity &amp; good Conduct! <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father: but a fooliſh Son is the Heavineſs of his Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even thus ſhould Miniſters be affected towards their People. They ſhould mourn over carnal Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with parental bowels; anxious for them, as <hi>Kiſh</hi> for his ſon <hi>Saul,</hi> when he left the Care of the Aſſes, &amp; ſorrowed for him, ſaying, What ſhall I do for my Son? — Where any appear obſtinate &amp; dead in Treſpaſſes &amp; Sins; they ſhould be grieved for the hardneſs of their Heart, &amp; mourn for them as <hi>David</hi> for his <hi>Abſolom.</hi> Their Souls ſhould weep in ſecret places for them. — And where any are under Awaknings &amp; preparatory ſpiritual Dolours; theſe ſpiritual Parents ſhould groan earneſtly for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, &amp; as 'twere <hi>travel in birth,</hi> until Chriſt be formed in them. They ſhould be inflamed with an holy impatient Thirſt for the Convirſion of Souls; longing after them all in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt; that of <hi>Zion</hi> it may be ſaid, <hi>This and that Man was born in her,</hi> under their Miniſtry. — And they ſhould rejoyce in the Converſion of Sinners. The News of this ſhould be to them, as Tidings to a Father, of the birth of a Child, filling his Heart with gladneſs. — Moreover, they ſhould maintain a peculiar Eſteem for the pretious Sons of Zion, &amp; Daughters of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, accounting them the Excellent in the Earth,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002744_0041_0FE62019DFDD2678"/>
and calling them their <hi>own Bowels,</hi> as Paul ſpeaks of his Son Oneſimus. They ſhould be full of peculiar Benevolence to ſuch. So the Apoſtle, to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <q>Our Mouth (ſays he) is open onto you; our Heart is enlarged. I ſpeak as to my <hi>Children.</hi> You are in our Heart, to die &amp; live with you.</q> It is one ſtroke in the Character of <hi>Titus</hi>'s Biſhop, That he be <hi>a Lover of good Men.</hi> He ſhould love their Perſons, value their Society, take a pleaſure in their Gifts &amp; Graces, &amp; Proſperity whether in Temporals or Spirituals. He ſhould rejoyce with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, &amp; weep with them that weep; "adopting their Joys &amp; Griefs." <hi>As a Father pitieth his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi>; ſo ſhould the Miniſter put on bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards his People, be grieved for all their Trials, but eſpecially mourn their ſpiritual Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Diſtreſſes, Fears &amp; Temptations; bearing a heavy pa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with them under their various Burdens. He ſhould have a ſharp ſenſe of the Injuries done them; as a Parent reſents the Abuſes his Children receive. — He ſhould be jealous over them with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jealouſy; as as pious Parent for his dear Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: afraid left by any means their Minds ſhould be corrupted. So <hi>Lemuel's</hi> Mother; <q>What my Son! And what the Son of my womb! And what the Son of my Vows.</q> — Yet he ſhould not nouriſh in himſelf a ſpirit of evil ſurmiſing, &amp; an unguarded Credulity, which are oft in the unhappy fountains of miſchievous Prejudices &amp; Alienations: but in every eaſe be diſpos'd to hope the beſt, as Parents of their Children, &amp; turn away his eyes from the dark ſide, as much as is conſiſtent with rational Charity.</p>
            <p>In a word, He should be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſſeſs'd with a Parental Care for his People. Can a Woman forget her ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002744_0042_0FE6201CA62A8DB8"/>
Child! Or can the Tenderneſs &amp; Vigilance of an affectionate Father be equal'd! He has his lov'd Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ever on his Mind, &amp; all his Powers upon the wing, to ſeek their Good. And when natural Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion is ſanctify'd by the grace of GOD, all the Springs of pious Concern are open'd, &amp; he is ſolicitous for their Souls, Day &amp; Night. Even thus ſhould the Spiritual Parent bear his People upon his Heart, and grave them upon the palms of his Hands. Verily a <hi>careleſs Miniſter</hi> is a prodigious Soleciſm. The Apoſtle tells Timothy, A Biſhop muſt be <hi>vigilant, &amp; take care</hi> of the Church of GOD. And he gives that Charge to the Biſhops of Epheſus, <hi>Take heed</hi> unto your ſelves, and to all the <hi>Flock.</hi> — Watch &amp; remember that by the ſpace of three years I ceaſed not to warn every one night &amp; day with Tears. — The Biſhop or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Father muſt watch in all things, as one that really has <hi>the Care of Souls,</hi> at heart. There muſt be a Care to know the State of his Flock; a Care to find out proper Methods for the promoting their ſpiritual Safety &amp; Proſperity; &amp; a Care to make a wiſe &amp; ſucceſsful Application of the Means: An earneſt Care (ſuch as GOD put into the heart of <hi>Titus</hi> for the Church at Corinth) a Care to ſerve Chriſt and ſave Souls; this, this is the true Paſtoral Care: &amp; muſt be found in all that would approve themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſpiritual Fathers to their People.</p>
            <p>Thus we have been looking into the hidden Man of the Heart, &amp; viewing the inward Frames of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which agree to that ſweet &amp; inſtructive Title of <hi>Parents,</hi> which Miniſters are characterized by.</p>
            <p>I go on now to ſay, —</p>
            <p n="2">(2) They muſt ſtudy to illuſtrate the Beauty and Propriety of their Name, by all ſuitable Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002744_0043_0FE6201CADE8CAD8"/>
               <hi>Conduct,</hi> &amp; outward Management, in their Office, and towards the People of their Charge.</p>
            <p>Thus, they muſt aſſert their Character, by a <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> Diſcharge of their Truſt, in all the parts of it. Parental Love is a buiſy reſtleſs Paſſion. What is it that the affectionate Parent will not do for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! O the ardent Zeal that flows in his breaſt! The Vigour of Endeavour! The unweary'd Offices of Benignity! He'l gladly ſit up late, &amp; riſe early, to ſerve them, &amp; think nothing in his power too much to do for 'em. — Now, even thus ſhould Miniſters be active &amp; diligent in their Work, to ſhew before the Churches the proof of their Love, &amp; that their Care for 'em in the ſight of GOD may appear to them. They muſt labour to do their whole work, the duty of the day in its day, according as every day requires. So far as the Miniſterial Truſt is neglected, they put off the Character of Fathers. — True Parental Love will (in proportion to the degree of its ſtrength) put Life &amp; Activity into all their executive Powers, and make them ready to every good work; hating Sloth; impatient of Delays &amp; Hindrances, &amp; careful to redeem the Time. — And indeed their Work is ſuch as calls for all their Vigour, Weight &amp; Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They had need to ſtudy hard, to read much, and think more, &amp; ſtick cloſe to Buſineſs, the proper Buſineſs of their Poſt; attending continually on this very thing; giving themſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to it, as was requir'd of <hi>Timothy.</hi> And ſuffer me to ſay here, For this end, they ſhould endeavour the greateſt <hi>Abstraction from the World,</hi> &amp; ſit as looſe to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns as may be. Indeed the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (we know) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wrought with their <hi>own hands</hi>: but then it was only to ſupply their preſent Wants, in a time of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002744_0044_0FE62022A1C602E8"/>
neceſſity; which perhaps is almoſt the only caſe, wherein 'tis lawful for Miniſters to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in worldly buſineſs; eſpecially to that degree as to take them off much from their divide Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is elegantly &amp; very juſtly compar'd to a <hi>Warfare</hi>: And the Apoſtle remarks to his Son <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>; No Man that warreth, <hi>entangles himſelf with the Affairs of this Life,</hi> that he may pleaſe his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that is, may be at leaſure to attend, &amp; have skill &amp; will to execute his Orders, upon whatſoever Service he pleaſes to call him out. Now, to this end, it much more behoves the Miniſter, to baniſh all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Earthly Cares and Anxieties out of his Mind, as much as poſſible. Hence the Apoſtles renounced the <hi>Deacons</hi> Office (a Miniſtration about Temporals) That they might give themſelves <hi>continually</hi> to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Miniſtry of the Word: as finding by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they muſt neceſſarily in too great &amp; unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a meaſure <hi>leave the Word,</hi> if they continu'd to ſerve Tables. (See, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.) — Few in the World are Men of that Capacity, Application, and Strength of Genius, as to be able to carry on a variety of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings together. The Miniſtry before is ordinarily <hi>enough</hi> for any Man, to take up his whole Time, and exerciſe all his Powers. And then it being a <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Work, that calls for the moſt heavenly &amp; divine Tempers, it ſeems (in its nature) to be not a little inconſiſtent with the tumultuous Cares of a <hi>Secular</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Employment. There is danger of our drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>Demas-like</hi> Spirit, the Spirit of the World; if we needleſsly immerſe our ſelves in the Affairs of this preſent life. Miniſters being Men ſubject to like Paſſions had need as well as others to beware of Covetouſneſs; left the love of money, which is the

root of all Evil, once inſinuating it ſelf into their breaſts, this ſhould gradually extinguiſh every Spark of Love to Souls; &amp; ſo the temporary Suſpenſions of their Miniſtry (in purſuit of the World) unhappily lead to a final Deſertion of it; in Heart, if not in Practice. — But enough upon this particular.</p>
            <p>Further, Miniſters ſhould endeavour to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Fathers, — by the exerciſe of all fatherly and manly <hi>Gifts</hi> &amp; <hi>Powers</hi> in the performing of their Office. They ſhould ſtudy to ſhew themſelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved unto GOD, <hi>Workmen,</hi> that need not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed. — I have ſaid before, <hi>what</hi> their Gifts ſhou'd be: I am now ſaying, they ſhould ſutably <hi>exerciſe</hi> them. <hi>Let no man deſpiſe thee: Neglect not the Gift that is in thee</hi>; was part of the Charge given <hi>Timothy.</hi> Thus, they ſhould ſtudy to exhibit their <hi>Knowlege</hi> (ſacred Knowlege) unto Edification, in all their Miniſterial Performances; ſhewing themſelves Men, &amp; Men of GOD, thôrôly furniſh'd: or at leaſt managing ſo, that their Profiting may appear to all. Again, They ſhould ſtudy to exerciſe &amp; manifeſt <hi>Prudence,</hi> Skill, &amp; ſpiritual Wiſdom: ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not only Men of Zeal, but Men of Thought, directed by rational Views, &amp; govern'd by wiſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; not indeed by the maxims of carnal policy, the wiſdom of this world, but of the wiſdom which is from above. This muſt ſit Chief, &amp; chuſe out their way for them; otherwiſe "Good Paſſions may ſometimes carry them into bad Actions, or the beſt Actions be ſpoil'd by an irregular Management." Indiſcreet luxuriant Fervour generally begins in miſtake, proceeds in confuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ends in miſchief; or at beſt in diſappointment. They had need exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe all their Sagacity, Caution, Penetration, &amp; Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002744_0046_0FE620248E68FED0"/>
to diſtinguiſh aright concerning Perſons, Things, &amp; Times; to methodize their Affairs well; to improve the fitteſt Seaſons; to chuſe out the beſt Means, &amp; apply them with dexterity. — Thus, in their PRAYERS, they ſhould uſe their beſt prudence; that theſe may be adapted to the common Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; carry light, &amp; heat, &amp; order in them; be clothed with humble eaſy language; be accommodated to the occaſion, &amp; the ſtate of things, whether in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private; not in a doctrinal or hiſtorical Strain, but devotional; &amp; the Utterance duely proportion'd and adjuſted to the place, matter of the prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, in their SERMONS, they ſhould ſtudy for ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Subjects; moſt frequently inculcate the firſt and great Truths of the Goſpel; not read Lectures of mere Ethicks, or deal in Politicks, or lay out their Labours on jejune Speculations, in barren Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or Arguments more nice &amp; ſubtle, than wiſe, or profitable, eſpecially to popular Audiences. It's a juſt Remark of a celebrated Writer; "'Tis but a mean Character of a Man, that he ſays a great many fine Things." If a <hi>Son</hi> ſhould ask Food of any of you that is a Father, will you feed him with Wind? If he ask Bread, will you give him a Stone? or if he ask a Fiſh, will you give him a Serpent? — If Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters would not deal as unkindly &amp; unjuſtly with their People, they muſt preach <hi>the Word,</hi> the Truth as it is in Jeſus; &amp; this in a <hi>manner</hi> adapted to the general capacity &amp; reliſh of their Audience, as much as may be. That's the beſt Preaching, which has in it moſt of the genius &amp; ſpirit of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; exhibiting it in its glorious principles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, promiſes, &amp;c. Here's the bread of Life, to nouriſh Souls. <hi>Lord, evermore give us this Bread!</hi>—
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002744_0047_0FE6202496511AB0"/>
But further, Miniſters muſt uſe the greateſt prudence in managing the affairs of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> &amp; Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that all be done <q>with gravity, without affectation; with zeal &amp; courage, without temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; with authority, without uſurpation:</q> with fidelity, without rigour; with renderneſs, without indulgence; with a juſt diſtinction in differing caſes, without a criminal partiality. — Finally, In <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> they ſhould be prudent; to ſet an unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Example, &amp; avoid offence; ſhould ſtudy for an agreable addreſs, uſe all innocent arts to win and engage, to pleaſe &amp; profit together: endeavouring at once to act both the Chriſtian &amp; the Gentleman, which will in many caſes try all their Skill, &amp; put them to no little pains.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not prevent my ſelf from ſaying in the next place, —</p>
            <p>They muſt ſhew themſelves Fathers, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous exerciſe of all thoſe <hi>Graces</hi> &amp; <hi>Virtues,</hi> which may adorn their Character &amp; Relation. Theſe muſt ſhine out, &amp; diſplay themſelves, in their whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry &amp; Converſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus,</hi> They muſt expreſs a Spirit of Seriouſneſs &amp; Solidity. All kind of <hi>Levity</hi> is childiſh; very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly in Parents (who ſhould ſtudy to make their preſence venerable to their Children) but more ſo in Miniſters. The Apoſtle rejects the thought of it with abhorrence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Did I uſe Lightneſs</hi>! They muſt be grave in the Pulpit, &amp; out of it; in their Garb, Mein, &amp; Language; in Doctrine ſhewing uncorruptneſs, Gravity, Sincerity; in Converſation uſing ſound Speech, which can't be condemn'd; not indulging <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

&amp; "in Manners, above the trivial puerile Cuſtoms &amp; looſe Practices of a vain World"; not only keeping at the wideſt diſtance from groſſer Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities &amp; Impurities, but alſo in ſome caſes abridging themſelves even of lawful Freedoms, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry be not blamed, &amp; that they may ſet the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Example of a ſhining Gravity. — I uſe this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, becauſe true Gravity is a very diſtinct thing from cloudy ſullen Reſervedneſs, &amp; moroſe Dejection.</p>
            <p>Again, There muſt be a ſpirit of Meekneſs, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Humility &amp; Self-denial, appearing in their Conduct. 'Tis a Law upon Parents, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke not your Children, leſt they be diſcourages.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Rigours towards Children are generally of pernicious Conſequence; on the one band, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hearts of the meek &amp; tender ſpirited &amp; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them lie down in ſullen deſpair &amp; neglect of duty: on the other hand, inflaming the more rough and paſſionate, &amp; tempting them to run into greater Outrages. Hence then Parents ſhould ſee to it that they temper their Government with the meekneſs of Wiſdom. And indeed it is the general Diſpoſition of Parents to be indulgent, rather than ſevere. Hence it is drawn into compariſon, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>I will ſpare them, as a Father ſpareth his own Son</hi> that ſerveth him. So in thoſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb. 11.12. Have I conceived all this People? Have I begotten them? that Thou ſhouldeſt ſay unto, me, Carry them in thy boſom, <hi>as a nurſing Father bereath the ſucking Child!</hi> We that are Parents know what this means. Now Miniſters ſhould learn of tender Parents, to maintain &amp; expreſs a Spirit of Candour &amp; Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance towards their People. Thus the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. We were gentle among you, <hi>even as a Nurſe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002744_0049_0FE6202C04CDCC20"/>
cheriſheth her Children.</hi> They ſhould endeavour to ſhew all Patience under the Difficulties they meet with, from the Humors of Men, from the Infirmities of the Weak, the troubleſome Follies of the Froward, and the baſe Requitals of the unthankful; puting the beſt Conſtruction's, &amp; making all poſſible Allowances. They muſt be ready to deny themſelves, &amp; comply with mean &amp; hard things ſometimes, like Parents for their Children ſake: as the Hebrew Servant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.5. <hi>I love my Children; I will not go out free.</hi> They muſt labour to exerciſe the true Spirit of <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi> ſtudying to prevent &amp; compoſe all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among their People; as Parents among their Children. They muſt endeavour to be cloathed with Humility; eaſy of acceſs, affable, courteous, willing to condeſcend to men of low degree, &amp; ſtoop to the meaneſt Offices, proper for their Station; as Parents for their Children. They ſhould ſmile on and countenance good Beginnings, &amp; not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, or diſdain to ſpeak to <hi>Babes.</hi> Nor affect to command, where Intreaties will ſuffice. Thus the Apoſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> ſays, Thô I might be much bold in Chriſt, to <hi>enjoyn</hi> thee that which is convenient: yet for Love's ſake I rather <hi>beſeech</hi> thee. And in diſpenſing Rebukes, they ſhould endeavour that their Zeal may be regulated by Prudence, &amp; be ſuch as conſiſts with the Spirit of Meckneſs, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, leſt they alſo be tempted. They ſhould be willing to ſee &amp; own all that's good and commendable in every one; ſometimes diſcreetly mixing deſerved Praiſes, with their Reproofs and Warning [See an Inſtance of this in 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1.4,—11.] I ſhall conclude this Head with a ſhort Extract out of the Character given of a late <hi>eminently good and

            </p>
            <p>Again, They ſhould labour for a fervent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; diſcover all the lively paſſions of tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in Prayer &amp; Preaching, &amp; private dealing with Souls. Parental Love often puts all the Springs &amp; Powers of Nature in motion, and makes us even agonize ſometimes in our Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace for our dear Children: we don't always content our ſelves with a tranſient cold Petition or two; we cannot reſt in one perpetual lifeleſs Round of words; but, Nature helping Grace, our hearts ſometimes grow hot within us, &amp; we pour out many &amp; very importunate Requeſts to GOD. Now in this, Miniſters ſhould ſtrive to imitate natural Parents. Like <hi>Elias</hi> they ſhould Pray earneſtly: Like <hi>Epaphras,</hi> they ſhould always labour fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Prayer,</hi> with a deep Solemnity, Warmth &amp; Vigour of Spirit — So in Preaching, a Zeal for Souls
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002744_0051_0FE6202D1478B130"/>
ſhould carry them out in pathetic Strains, animate their Utterance, &amp; inflame their Language. Both in the Study &amp; Pulpit, they ſhould even ſtrive for ſomething of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s <hi>Heat of Spirit,</hi> when the hand of the Lord was ſtrong upon him. They ſhou'd ſpeak as thoſe that feel in themſelves the heart of a Father, &amp; the bowels of a Mother; which often give moſt affecting Accents to parental Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels &amp; Inſtructions. <q>It is requiſite (as one <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> (my worthy Brother &amp; Claſs mate) in his Sermon at Mr. <hi>Green</hi>'s Ordination. <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</note> gives us the excellent Remark) that their Hearts ſhould be <hi>warm,</hi> &amp; that they ſhould ſpeak as thoſe whoſe Lips are touched with a Coal from the Altar; becauſe in Preaching there is intended a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Souls</hi>
               </q>. Hence the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> He was willing to have <hi>imparted</hi> to them, not the Goſpel of GOD only, but alſo <hi>his own Soul</hi>; — was deſirous to inſpire into them the ſame devout Paſſions that flam'd in his own breaſt; to communicate to them of the heavenly Spirit that reſted on himſelf; that the ſame Mind &amp; Heart might be in them, that was in him. Miniſters ſhould in Preaching as 'twere breathe out their <hi>Souls</hi> to their People in the moſt ſincere &amp; holy Fervours; in order to ſet <hi>their</hi> Hearts on fire, by the grace of GOD, &amp; bring them to be <hi>like-minded</hi>; not only almoſt, but altogether <hi>ſuch as they are,</hi> in regard of the Chriſtian Faith &amp; Life.</p>
            <p>Moreover, They ſhould be of good Courage, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, reſolute &amp; indefatigable in their Work. They muſt be faithful in perſonal Applications to Souls, and in publick Diſpenſations of the Word, deliver the whole Counſel of GOD, and keep back nothing
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002744_0052_0FE62031D10262A8"/>
that is profitable. The Apoſtle obſerves to the Corinthians, — <hi>Great is my boldneſs of Speech to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you—; I ſpeak as to my Children.</hi> Parents don't uſe to mince the matter, &amp; balk duty, for fear of their Children; but deal plainly, &amp; ſpeak home, &amp; do what they apprehend is beſt &amp; moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, however their Children reſent it: Tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to maintain their Government, and reſtrain them from Diſorders, they are ſometimes oblig'd to put on all their Reſolution, &amp; uſe the utmoſt Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

               </gap>m at the Good of Souls, preach the Word, reprove, &amp; exhort with all Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering &amp; Doctrine; warning every Man with all fidelity, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Tho' they dwell with Scorpions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Children &amp; rebellious; yet muſt not be afraid of their Words, nor diſmay'd at their Looks. <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 2.4, 6.) Whatever Oppoſition they meet with in their Work; whatever Difficulties lie in their way, they muſt ſtill go on, with an unchill'd Zeal, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Vigour, &amp; incorruptible Integrity; above the Influence of worldly Fears or Hopes. Frowns or Charms; ſtedfaſt &amp; immoveable, &amp; always aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the work of the Lord. True Zeal is of a ſanguine Complexion, bold in the purſuit of duty, and firm to it's point. It mocks at Fear, &amp; ſmiles in the face of Terror, as well as deſpiſes Flattery, and ſcorns all Diſcouragements. The Apoſtle ſpeaks
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002744_0053_0FE62031D807B008"/>
in the Language of Heroic Zeal, Acts 20.24. <hi>None of theſe things move me,</hi> neither count I my <hi>Life</hi> dear to my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my Courſe with Joy — <q>He cou'd embrace Chains, endure Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; enjoy Miſeries <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <q>Oppoſition did not diſpirit, but ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Reſolution; and his great Heart, inſtead of fainting &amp; ſubſiding, roſe &amp; biggen'd, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any growing Danger which threaten'd him.</q> Being ſtrong in Faith; this carry'd him thro' Seas of Difficulties, &amp; kept him from ſinking: this nouriſh'd in him the Flame of Love to Souls, ſo that the Floods could not quench it.— And now, If Miniſters would approve themſelves ſpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they muſt ſet themſelves to copy after this great Pattern, in all faithful Zeal, unwearied La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, &amp; inflexible Reſolution. To this end, They muſt be concern'd to obtain <hi>like precious Faith,</hi> and live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, upon whom they intirely depend for Aſſiſtance, Acceptance and Succeſs. They muſt lay out Faith &amp; Prayer for themſelves &amp; their People, as godly Parents for Themſelves &amp; Children. The Parents ought to lay up for the Children: and what better than a good <hi>Stock of Prayers,</hi> Prayers of Faith! The Parent's Breaſt ſhould be a living Temple, wherein are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd up to GOD (on the Altar of CHRIST's Merits) ſpiritual Sacrifices for his Children, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of them all The Miniſter ſhould go &amp; <hi>do likewiſe</hi>; being often on his Knees, and carrying his People to GOD in the Arms of an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Faith; caſting them upon Him who careth for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:002744_0054_0FE62051C8F4F800"/>Thus we have ſeen ſomething of the Duty of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters towards their People, reſulting from the Character of <hi>Fathers</hi> apply'd to them. I have been much longer here than I deſign'd. I ſhall haſten now to the laſt general Head of Diſcourſe; after I ſhall have added this one Hint, That theſe ſpiritual Fathers ſhould ſtudy to maintain <hi>Brotherly Love</hi> &amp; Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence among themſelves, by mutually exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Offices of good Neighborhood.</p>
            <p>It remains now to obſerve in the laſt place.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The Apoſtle in our Text compares the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>Children</hi>; which is a very natural Conſideration of them, if Miniſters bear the Character of Parents. And from hence they may learn much of the Duty they owe to their Miniſters.</p>
            <p>But here I ſhall do little more than hint at things: for I perceive the Time runs out faſter than my Subject.</p>
            <p>This tells People that they ſhould <hi>honour</hi> their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fathers. <hi>A Son honoureth his Father.</hi> And agreably it is requir'd, that faithful Elders be <hi>count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of double honour</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) treated with a kind of filial Reſpect, eſpecially by the People of their Charge, who are commanded to obey them in the Lord, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.) in as expreſs words as the <hi>fifth</hi> Commandment. It's an Apoſtolick Canon (at leaſt applicable) in this Caſe — <hi>Rebuke not,</hi> that is (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the notation of the original word) don't ſatyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally laſh <hi>an Elder, but intreat him as a Father.</hi> — However mean their Perſons &amp; outward Condition, yet 'tis a venerable Character &amp; Commiſſion they bear; &amp; this ſurely ſhould ſcreen them from all Inſult, Contempt, — Outrage. It was a mournful Complaint, of old, The Son diſhonoureth the Father, &amp; a Man's

Enemies are the Men of his own Houſe. — But let it not be ſo in the Houſe of GOD. We have had Fathers of our Fleſh, &amp; we gave them Reverence: ſhall we not alſo be in Subjection to thoſe who under GOD are our ſpiritual Fathers! They ſhould be reſpected <hi>as ſuch,</hi> whether they be younger or older. Let no Man deſpiſe their <hi>Youth,</hi> eſpecially if adorn'd with Wiſdom and Gravity: Much leſs throw Contempt on the <hi>Hoary</hi> Head, thô grown weak &amp; infirm. Thou ſhalt honour the face of the old Man, &amp; not deſpiſe thy Father, when he is old. — During the whole Time of their Continuance in the Paſtoral Relation, their People ought to honour them particularly by a juſt Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of their Labours, in a ſutable <hi>Maintenance.</hi> It is requir'd of Children (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4.) that they learn to ſhew Piety at home, &amp; to <hi>requite their Parents</hi>: for this is good &amp; acceptable before GOD; &amp; is due by all the Laws of Gratitude &amp; Equity. Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6.) that <hi>they who are taught in the word ſhould communicate unto Him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> Who planteth a Vineyard (ſaith the inſpired Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7,—11.) &amp; eateth not of the Fruit thereof? And <hi>if we have ſown unto you ſpiritual Things, is it a great matter if we ſhall reap of your carnal things</hi>? Beſure if we reap but ſparingly (as 'twere the young <hi>Levite's</hi> Portion, which he had of <hi>Micah</hi> (<hi>Judg.</hi> 17.10.) who ſeems to have intended to make up in honorary Titles, what he fell ſhort in Wages) it ought not to be grudg'd to us. They that reap bountifully, receive but a juſt Reward. And after all, give me leave to ſay, the beſt Salary is no proportional &amp; adequate Recompence for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit receiv'd by a faithful Miniſtry.

            <p>That People ſhould bear a filial <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and expreſs a ſutable <hi>Affection</hi> to their ſpiritual Fathers. And indeed we value a real Intereſt in your Hearts, above all the external Honours you can do us We are ready to beſpeak you, in the words of the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11, 12, 13.) <q>O ye People, our <hi>Mouth</hi> is open unto you, our <hi>Heart</hi> is enlarged. Ye are not ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in us, but ye are ſtraitned in your own Bowels. Now for a Recompence in the ſame (I ſpeak as to my Children) <hi>Be ye alſo enlarged,</hi>
               </q> and repay us the like Affection, it being but reaſonable for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to recompence their Parents Love, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Returns of Love &amp; Duty. He that is without natural Affection to his Parents, has put off the Man, and is become more vile than the very Brutes that have no Underſtanding. Alas! It is a moſt guilty Thing for Children to indulge Diſaffection &amp; Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt their Parents. So is it in People againſt their ſpiritual Fathers: concerning whom it is requir'd that you <hi>eſteem them very highly in Love</hi> for their Work's ſake, 1 Theſ. 5.12. And indeed as Love to Parents is a firſt Principle deeply rooted in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man; ſo where any are truly begotten to GOD thrô the Goſpel, they will by a kind of natural Inſtinct value &amp; love their ſpiritual Fathers. Their Love to Chriſt, to his Houſe &amp; Sabbath &amp; pretious Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea, &amp; to their own Souls, will powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them. And a principle of Gratitude will have no little Influence upon every conſidering Chriſtian. It is reported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that he was wont
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002744_0057_0FE6203CB017A540"/>
to ſay, He was more beholden to his Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> than to his Father <hi>Philip,</hi> becauſe he had his Being only from the latter; but his Well-being from the former. And truly if Love be a Debt to our natural Parents as under GOD the Authors &amp; Preſervers of our bodily &amp; temporal Life; we can owe no leſs to our ſpiritual Parents, who have begotten us by the Goſpel, to a better being, to a ſpiritual &amp; eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Now, if Chriſtians wou'd ſhew their Love; Then,</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, Let 'em prize the Society of their Miniſters. Love is a Social Paſſion. Be not ſhy of your ſpiritual Fathers. Receive them in the Lord. So will they thank GOD, &amp; take Courage.</p>
            <p>Again, Let People learn to value &amp; ask the Prayers and Bleſſings of their ſpiritual Fathers. So <hi>Eliſha</hi> beg'd <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Bleſſing: &amp; the ſame afterwards did King <hi>Joaſh</hi> of him. Even a profane <hi>Eſau</hi> ſought his Father's Bleſſing with Tears. People ſhould be ready upon all Occaſions to ask the Prayers of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. In particular it is directed, Jam. 5.14. <hi>Is any ſick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him.</hi> Truly Brethren, we look upon it as a Slight &amp; Coldneſſ towards us, if you will not ſend for us in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
            <p>Further, Shew your Love by a due Care not to grieve them by Contentions or other Scandals. Thus ſays the Apoſtle to his Galatians, <hi>My little Children,— let us not be deſirous of vain glory, provoking one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, envying one another.</hi> Let them have this Joy, to behold your ſtedfaſtneſs &amp; Order; to ſee you walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Truth, &amp; dwelling together in Unity.</p>
            <p>Further, Shew your Love in faithfully aſſerting &amp; defending their good Names It is an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; Phil. 2.29. <hi>Hold ſuch in Reputation.</hi> If they
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002744_0058_0FE6203BA0A719B0"/>
be ſlander'd, you muſt vindicate them with a prudent Zeal. If they be evil ſpoken of, you muſt not receive the Accuſation, but <hi>before two or three witneſſes.</hi> So the Rule is expreſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. —If you know them to be overtaken with a Fault, think of the Duty you expect from your Children in ſuch a Caſe: and this will be a ſufficient Directory. Or think of <hi>Shem</hi> &amp; <hi>Japhet</hi>; and take care you don't play an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>Ham</hi>'s part, in expoſing &amp; laughing at involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Stumbles, or accidental Falls. Love will teach you to cover ſuch Things in Silence: and where any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to indulge groſſer Follies, Love will alſo teach you to obſerve it to them, with a reſpectful Sorrow, ſtill intreating them as Fathers. (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1.)</p>
            <p>Moreover, Filial Love will teach you to follow their good Example. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15, 16. In Chriſt Jeſus I have <hi>begotten</hi> you thro' the Goſpel: <hi>Wherefore I beſeech you, be ye Followers of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, True Love will teach People a due Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their ſpiritual Fathers faithful Care &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: and a Contentment with the wholeſome Food with which they entertain them in the Houſe of GOD; altho' perhaps it be not dreſs'd up in all the forms &amp; ſplendors that ſome others are treated with. True Love will teach People to adhere to their Miniſtry, and not deſert it, upon every little Temptation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It will teach them to be conſtant &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate in Prayer for them; generous in Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, love will teach People to mourn their Death, when GOD takes them from their head. Theſe ſpiritual Fathers are mortal as well as other Parents. <hi>Your Fathers,</hi> where are they? and the Prophets do they live for ever? Chriſtians ſhou'd often think of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002744_0059_0FE6203BA7BA1AE0"/>
this, while they are living; get all the Benefit they can by them, while they enjoy their Preſence &amp; Help; &amp; get prepar'd for the parting time: Honour 'em at their Death, by ſuitable Lamentations; &amp; (may I not ſay?) alſo by a decent Burial. Even a mocking <hi>Iſhmael</hi> cou'd join with his Brother <hi>Iſaac</hi> in burying their Father <hi>Abraham.</hi> We read of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, 2 Chro. 24.16. <hi>They buried him in the City of</hi> David, <hi>among the Kings, becauſe he had done Good in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>both towards God, &amp; towards his Houſe</hi> —.In a word, True Love will teach them to pay all becoming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to their Memory. It is expreſly requir'd, Heb. 13.7. <hi>Remember them which have ſpoken unto you the word of God.</hi> "It is ungrateful &amp; unkind (as one<note n="†" place="bottom">The late Rev. Mr. <hi>Stevens,</hi> in his Funeral Sermon for the Rev. Mr. <hi>Brattle</hi>; annex'd to his laſt Sermons.</note> obſerves) <q>to forget <hi>any</hi> Friend or Benefactor: and much more ſo, to forget our <hi>Fathers</hi> in the Church of GOD: —Their Names ought to be remember'd, — often ſpoke of, with Gratitude, Love &amp; Honour, for their Works ſake. The <hi>Children</hi> (at leaſt) of ſuch ſpiritual Fathers ſhou'd <hi>riſe up &amp; call them Bleſſed.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But I draw now to a Cloſe:</p>
            <p>Let us reflect on the whole, — and then taking a View of our own Conduct, let us compare Things: ſee whether we have been acting up to our reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Characters; the People, as Children, &amp; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as Parents. And may we be humble before GOD for all our Failings &amp; Miſcarriages towards each other! And let us all be concern'd to ſtudy the exacteſt Conformity to our ſeveral Characters, in our Deportment towards each other, both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002744_0060_0FE62051D2DE6DD8"/>
&amp; People, as Remembring that we muſt give an Account unto GOD.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid might be apply'd, by way of Caution &amp; Direction to the Candidates for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry — And alſo to the Churches, to regulate them in the great Affair of chuſing a Miniſter. Covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts: And yet I ſhew unto you a <hi>more excellent way.</hi> Tho' one ſpeak with the Tongues of Men &amp; Angels, &amp; have not the Love of GOD in him, &amp; a Love to Souls (the Heart of a true ſpiritual Father) verily he is as a ſounding Braſs, or a tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cymbal.</p>
            <p>But now to conclude in a ſhort Hint to You, Brethren, who are the Occaſion of our Convening here at this Time. I need not apply my ſelf parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to my <hi>Brother,</hi> who is this Day conſecrating himſelf to the Miniſtry. The Things which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be given him in Charge by another &amp; the proper Hand, will be ſufficient. As he will give a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Entertainment to the Honours &amp; Reſpects, which I have been claiming for him in the name of Chriſt and from his holy Oracles; So I hope, a kind Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Words of Counſil &amp; Admonition, that have been delivered. May He ever bear in mind this Character of a <hi>Spiritual Father!</hi> May he ſtudy to be indeed ſuch an one in the Church of GOD! And may he have a numerous ſpiritual Offspring for his Crown and Joy in the day of the Lord!</p>
            <p>And I hope you, <hi>my Friends,</hi> who having built this Houſe to the Name of GOD, have lately been incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into a diſtinct Family (as 'twere) &amp; choſen this Servant of GOD to be a Father unto you, will always remember the Character of <hi>Children,</hi> which the Apoſtle in our Text puts upon you, &amp; ſtudy to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002744_0061_0FE620546DED2420"/>
adorn it by a becoming Reverence &amp; Love to Him. Receive him (as we truſt you do this day) with all Gladneſs. See that he may be with you without Fear: for he worketh the Work of the Lord. Intreat him always as a Father: let no Man deſpiſe his Youth. The Paſtoral Power (accompany'd with a good Degree of Knowlege, Prudence, Seriouſneſs, and Zeal for Souls) gives Age &amp; Seniority, to ſuch as are but young in Years. Submit to him therefore as it is fit in the Lord. Do all you can to encourage his Heart, &amp; ſtrengthen his Hands in his Work. Be at Peace among your ſelves. Strive together with him in Prayers to GOD for him. And let your Profiting by his Miniſtry appear.</p>
            <p>So will you make him a glad Father: and in the the great day he will give up his Account with Joy; will have Confidence before the Son of Man at his Appearing, &amp; ſhall preſent you to GOD, in ſuch Language as that, <hi>Lo! Here am I, and the Children which Thou haſt given me!</hi>
