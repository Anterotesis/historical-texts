            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> In the 20th ver. he declares, that it was his earneſt Expectation and Hope, that Chriſt ſhould be magnified in his Body, whether by Life, or by Death. In this Ver. he gives a Reaſon of his Hope: <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi> i. e. ſays an Expoſitor, "If I live, Chriſt ſhall be the Scope of my Life, and End of my Living; I reſolve to live to his Service: if I die, Death will be a real gain to me." Others read the Words, "Chriſt is to me in Life and Death, Advantage or Gain."</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:009513_0004_0F758B78681B41F8"/>I. It is the Character of every true Chriſtian, and faithful Goſpel Miniſter; that for them to live is Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is their great Priviledge and Happineſs, that for them to die ſhall be gain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is the Character of every true Chriſtian, and faithful Goſpel Miniſter; that for them to live is Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This is the Character of every <hi>true Chriſtian.</hi> All ſuch as are given up to Chriſt in Baptiſm, and profeſs to be his Diſciples; are under ſolemn Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to ſeek the Spirit of Chriſt, that they may live to him; and it is the Character of thoſe who are Chriſtians indeed, that they make the Goſpel of Chriſt, the <hi>Rule,</hi> and the Glory of God in Chriſt, the great <hi>End</hi> of their living. It is their great Concern and Endeavour, to depart from all Iniquity, and to walk worthy of the Lord to all pleaſing, by walking as becometh the Goſpel, even as the Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation teacheth us, <hi>that denying Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. ii.12.</note> They not only call Chriſt, Lord; but do the Things which he ſays. They devote their Time and Talents, yea, their Lives to his Service.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the Character of every <hi>faithful Goſpel Miniſter, that for him to live is Chriſt.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpel:<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. iii.6, 7.</note> and it was his Care to live as became ſuch an one.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate and confirm this Head, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:009513_0005_0F758B7900921E40"/>1. It is the great Concern of ſuch <hi>to obtain the Evidence of their Union with Jeſus Chriſt, and of his dwelling in their Hearts by Faith.</hi> They are ſenſible, that unleſs they are united to him by his Spirit, and a living Faith; they can have no ſpiritual Communion with him in his ſaving Benefits. <hi>He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. vi.17.</note>.</hi> And unleſs they are thus in Chriſt, they can't derive Grace from him to fulfil their Miniſtry; nor in a right Manner depend upon him to fulfil his Word; <hi>I am with you alway.</hi> If deſtitute of that Faith, which works <hi>by Love,</hi> tho' they had the moſt ſhining Gifts, and could ſpeak with the <hi>Tongues of Angels,</hi> yet they are but as ſounding Braſs; an empty Noiſe: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Good others might receive by their Miniſtry, they themſelves muſt be caſt away. Accordingly, they are earneſtly concerned that they may be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I knew a Man in Chriſt:</hi> and that they may be found in him, cloathed with the Righteouſneſs of God, by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This implies <hi>their ſincere Concern and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be acquainted with the Goſpel in ſuch a Meaſure, that they may be qualified to lead Souls to Chriſt, and build them up on their holy Faith.</hi> They are ſenſible, that this is the great Deſign and Uſe of the Goſpel Miniſtry, to lead Men to Chriſt, as the only Saviour of periſhing Sinners. The ſame Apoſtle teacheth, that it is for the <hi>edifying of the Body of Chriſt;</hi> 'till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God.<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. iv.12, 13.</note> — And therefore the faithful Miniſter, determineth not to know any Thing among his People, <hi>ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> Now, under this, is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Knowledge of the Truths, Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel of Chriſt; concerning the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009513_0006_0F758B79C480FC10"/>
of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt; his divine and human Natures united in one Perſon; his Offices, Laws, and ſaving Benefits. Accordingly, the faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, gives himſelf to Reading, Meditation and Prayer, that his Lips may preſerve and communicate this Knowledge to his Hearers; that his Light may ſhine before others, to give them the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. And this leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the great Care and Endeavour of the faithful Miniſter, is to <hi>preach Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>teach the Things which concern his Kingdom and Glory.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Kingdom of God; and taught thoſe Things which concern the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Act. xxvili.31.</note> And in another Place, he tells us, <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv.5.</note> 
               <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.</hi> They dare not impoſe their own Notions, nor teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men; but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keep cloſe to the pure Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, teaching Men to obſerve <hi>all Things whatſoever Chriſt has commanded.</hi> The End and Scope of their Miniſtry, is not to gain the Applauſe of Men, by proſelyting them to any darling Opinions of their own, but to teach them the Knowledge of God and Chriſt, and the Way of Salvation as revealed in the infallible Oracles of the old and new Teſtament; that their Faith may ſtand not in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God. <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> And in this Reſpect, for to live to them is Chriſt. The Lord Jeſus is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's Life, and every faithful Paſtor is ſenſible of this. Agreeably, the Apoſtle ſays to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Epiſt.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009513_0007_0F758B7A50D55768"/>
ii 1. <hi>Thou therefore, my Son, be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And declares concerning himſelf: <hi>The Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> Gal. ii. 20 He acknowledgeth that his Furniture and Ability for his ſacred Work, were from the Lord, and that he liv'd upon Him, who <hi>counted him faithful, putting him into the Miniſtry.</hi> Such realize it, that all their Sufficiency is of God, and is communicated to them through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, the glorious Head of the Church; and accordingly, they run the Race ſet before them, looking unto Jeſus, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of their Faith: who ſaid to this Apoſtle, in a time of Extremity, <hi>My Grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee; for my Strength is made perfect in Weakneſs.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor, xii.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. It implies, that it is their great <hi>Care and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to follow the Example of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>for me to live is Chriſt,</hi> it intends, that he look'd unto Jeſus, as his Pattern and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar, and labour'd that the ſame Mind might be in him, which was in Chriſt Jeſus, 1 Cor. xi. 1. <hi>Be ye Followers of me, even as I am of Chriſt.</hi> The true evangelical Paſtor is concerned, that the like Zeal for the Glory of God, the Purity of his Worſhip, and the Salvation of the Soul's of Men; the like Humility, Patience and Submiſſion to the Will of God; may be in him, which were ſo conſpicuous in the Man Chriſt Jeſus. It is his Care, that he may ſhew forth the Virtues of this lovely Perſon, who was holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from Sinners: He not only preacheth, but lives the Goſpel in ſome good Meaſure; bearing in Mind what our Lord ſaid, when he had waſhed his Diſciples Feet, Joh. xiii. 14, 15. <hi>If I then your Lord and Maſter, have waſhed your
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009513_0008_0F758B7B182A4780"/>
Feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one another's Feet, For I have given you an Example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Scope and End of their Lives and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry are, that God in Chriſt <hi>may be glorified.</hi> They ſeck not their own primarily, or chiefly, but the Things which are Jeſus Chriſts; that God in Chriſt may be glorified: many being brought to truſt in him, to turn to God by him, and live as the obedient Subjects of the Lord. It is not their own Honor or Profit, which they are principally concerned for, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Chriſt; that many may aſcribe Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Bleſſing to Him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb forever. Thus for them to live is Chriſt; when the great End of their Lives is to exalt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and that his Goſpel may run and be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Salvation of many, form'd to ſhew forth his Praiſe. 1 Pet iv. 11. <hi>if any Man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God; if any Man miniſter, let him do it as of the Ability which God giveth: that God in all Things may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be Praiſe and Dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The principal Joy of their Lives is to behold the Kingdom of Chriſt, ſet up with Power, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in their own Souls, and in the Hearts of God's People.</hi> It is the Spirit and Temper of every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter, to rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no Confidence in the Fleſh. They love the Lord Jeſus; and from love to Him, they feed his Sheep, and feed his Lambs. And from this cordial Affection, wiſh Proſperity to the Son of <hi>David.</hi> The Bleſſings of his Kingdom, which are Righteouſneſs and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, are more to them, than the Joy of Harveſt. 1 Theſſ. iii, 8, 9. <hi>For now we live,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009513_0009_0F758B7C17B8A990"/>
if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord: For what Thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the Joy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we Joy for your Sakes before our God.</hi> It was the Comfort of their Lives, to behold the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians ſtedfaſt in the Belief and Practice of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Jeſus; yea, they were their <hi>Crown and Joy <note n="*" place="bottom">1 theſ. ii.20.</note>.</hi>

Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if ye believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him. For this we ſay unto you by the Word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep. For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a Shout with the Voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God: and the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air; and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with theſe Words.</hi>

            <p>ON Thurſday the 25th of this Inſtant died, in the thirty-ſeventh Year of his Age, the Reverend Mr. ALEXANDER CUMMING, one of the Paſtors of the South Church in this Town; to the Grief of all who were acquainted with his juſt Character.</p>
            <p>THE Father of Spirits was pleas'd to form him with ſuperior intellectual Abilities: His Apprehenſion was quick and piercing; his Imagination lively and fruitful; his judgment accurate and ſolid.</p>
            <p>THESE Gifts of Nature were greatly improved by cloſe Thought and diligent Study; and, being ſanctified by divine Grace, were employed to promote the Intereſts of Religion.</p>
            <p>HE early devoted himſelf to the Service of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and in his public Performances you might diſcern the Marks of a ſtrong Mind.—It was eaſy to him to write on Points that to others were intricate and abſtruſe; this might lead him to frequent Diſcourſes on ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: but even in theſe, there were the evident Traces of a ſerious Spirit, deeply impreſſed with the great and important Truths of Religion.</p>
            <p>His practical Diſcourſes were clear, animated and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious; they evidenced that he was himſelf well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Chriſtian Temper, and being delivered with a grave and ſtriking Elocution, they were adapted to reach and better the Hearts of his Hearers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:009513_0024_0F758B87CECF8CB8"/>HIS Converſation was amiable and uſeful, He was ſerious without Affectation, and affable without Levity or Meanneſs. You ſaw at once the polite Gentleman, the fair Reaſoner, the accompliſh'd Divine, and the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>THOUGH he wanted not Senſibility, he had a great command of his Paſſions, not eaſily ruffled in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or betrayed to raſhneſs in his Expreſſions; knowing how to be firm and reſolved, without loſing the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Mind, or the gentleneſs of his Manners.</p>
            <p>HONESTY and uprightneſs were diſtinguiſhing Parts of his Character; He was a Stranger to Diſſimulation him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and abhor'd it in others.</p>
            <p>HIS Religion was pure and ſubſtantial; free from the Follies of Superſtition, or the Reveries of Enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>HIS Conſtitution, naturally tender, was ſeverely tried with frequent Paroxiſms of Pain, which were of a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aſpect; he bore theſe with Chriſtian Patience: When in moderate Health, he was a pleaſant Companion, and went through the Duties of his Station with Diligence and Chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>HIS laſt Illneſs came upon him with ſuch Violence, as exhauſted his Spirits, and rendered him incapable of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to his Friends. He continued however in full Poſſeſſion of himſelf, till juſt before he expired, and ſpake of his Departure with calmneſs and Serenity. He was willing to die, tho' he had almoſt every earthly Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make him deſirous of living—He knew in whom he had believed, and expreſſed his firm Reliance on the Merits of the compaſſionate Redeemer of Men. He met the Approaches of Death, like one who believed and hoped for Immortality.</p>
            <p>HIS Removal is a Loſs to the Public—It peculiarly affects the Church and Congregation to whom he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd: They with Pleaſure beheld him ſerving as a Son with the venerable Dr. SEWALL, who having obtain'd help from GOD ſtill ſurvives, to lead and comfort them under this melancholy Bereavement.</p>
            <p>MR. CUMMING'S Remains were interred Yeſterday, with every Mark of Reſpect.</p>
