            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Funeral Sermon; OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF HIS EXCELLENCY, LIEUTENANT GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM, LXXXII. 6, 7.</bibl>
               <q>I HAVE SAID, YE ARE GODS.—BUT YE SHALL DIE, LIKE MEN; AND FALL, LIKE ONE OF THE PRINCES.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>DEATH makes no diſtinction between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, princes and people. Men of high character and exalted ſtations, in life, are as much expoſed to the infirmities of human nature, and the ſtroke of death, as the common claſs of men. They are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the poſterity of Adam. They are equally under, the ſentence, <hi>"Duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return."</hi> To them it is, equally, appointed, <hi>"Once to die."</hi> In reflecting on the common mortality of man, the wiſe king of Iſrael ſaid, <hi>"There is no man, that hath power over the ſpirit, to retain the ſpirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: And there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, in that war."</hi> For, in this reſpect, <hi>"All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him, that ſacrificeth and to him, that ſacrificeth not; as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; and he, that ſweareth; as he, that feareth an oath."</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036793_0005_100B0F3D122CDCD0"/>
In deſcribing the common fatality of all men, and their equal expoſure to <hi>'The king of terrors,'</hi> a certain elegant poet ſays,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>With equal foot, impartial fate</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Knocks at the palace, as the cottage gate.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame appears to be the ſentiment contained in the words of our text: <hi>"I have ſaid, ye are gods.—But ye ſhall die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes."</hi> Your ſtation is exalted. You are raiſed to high power and authority among your fellow creatures. In point of intereſt, character, and influence, you are raiſed above the common level, and have obtained the title of gods on earth. But theſe high diſtinctions ſhall not exempt you from diſeaſe, pain, and death.</p>
            <p>To the rulers, in the Jewiſh church, were the words of our text, firſt, addreſſed. The government of this church was theocratic. The Moſt High God was their particular king. He formed their mode of government. He made their laws, and ordained all their rules of diſcipline. In the firſt, diſtinct, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their government, he appointed Moſes and Aaron to be the chief rulers over his people, and gave directions, in what manner, their ſucceſſors ſhould be introduced into office, and inveſted with power over the people.</p>
            <p>As the government of the Jews was theocratic, as God was their particular king, ſo all the officers choſen to govern this people, and introduced accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divine appointment, were the legal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Moſt High. They repreſented his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, majeſty, and power, by requiring obedience to his commands, and by puniſhing diſobedience with exemplary puniſhment. Their high power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, their exalted character and reſpectability they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036793_0006_100B0F3F8ECF6D78"/>
received, by ſpecial delegation, from God. They were his judicial and executive officers, to judge in matters of controverſy between man and man, and to inflict the penalties of his kingdom. Referring, if we miſtake not, to the delegated power of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, in God's holy kingdom, Paul commands the followers of Chriſt, in theſe words: <hi>"Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers: For there is no power but of God; the powers, that be, are ordained of God." (Rom.</hi> 13. 1.<hi>)</hi> And becauſe of this delegated power, the rulers in Iſrael were called gods. In the context, it is obſerved, <hi>"God ſtandeth in the congregation of the mighty: He judgeth among the gods."</hi> The judges, in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, you ſee, were ſtiled gods, as being the legal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of Jehovah, acting in his kingdom, veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his authority, and carrying into execution the laws of his houſe. And being God's repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they were under the moſt ſolemn obligation <hi>"To defend the poor and fatherleſs, to do juſtice to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and needy; to deliver the poor and needy, and rid them out of the hand of the wicked."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suſtaining this high character, and being under theſe ſolemn obligations, they were amenable to God for all their conduct, in their judicial and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive departments. On God they were dependent for their being, their high diſtinction among men, and their continuance in office. He put them into office; he had a ſovereign right to continue them in office, and to remove them from office, when and in what manner, he ſaw fit. And, that they might not be elated with pride, he reminds them of their frailty and mortality. <hi>"I have ſaid, ye are gods.—But ye ſhall die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe remarks apply, in a ſpecial manner, to the rulers in God's ancient church. They were his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036793_0007_100B0F411981B190"/>
his peculiar people, and treaſure. For wiſe and holy purpoſes, he ſelected them from among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth, gave them a code of laws, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their rulers, gave them their charge, and inveſted them with all their power.</p>
            <p>As among the Iſraelites, their rulers were ſubject to the misfortunes of life; and to the laſt, the ſolemn ſcene of leaving this ſtage of action; ſo it is equally the caſe among other nations of the world. The greateſt riches, the higheſt office, and reſpectability do not exempt men from the ſhafts of death. As in Iſrael, their rulers were called gods, from their being inveſted with power over the people; ſo this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſome meaſure, may be applied to the kings, princes, and great men of other nations.</p>
            <p>In whatſoever government a man may be a ruler, a chief man, he may, in this reſpect, be called a god; and yet he is ſubject to die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes. Whether a man become a ruler, by the ſpecial appointment and delegation of God, as among the Iſraelites; or by hereditary ſucceſſion, as in a monarchy; or by a combination of certain great men, as in an ariſtocracy; or by the free election of the people, as in a republic; yet his exaltation to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and dignity does not liberate him from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon evils of life, nor from death, <hi>"the laſt debt of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture."</hi> Power and authority are no preſervatives from ſickneſs and mortality. Conſumptions, ſevers, inflammations, and other mortal diſorders will, as ſoon, ſeize the conſtitution of a ruler as a ſubject. The ſceptre of government, the robe of ſtate, and the ſword of power will be no protection, whenever death comes with haſty ſtrides, apprehends the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and is conveying him to the land of ſilence. When the ſummons of death arrives, nothing can
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036793_0008_100B0F4498BEB780"/>
withſtand its execution. Neither the cries nor wiſhes of the people, nor the aid of phyſicians, nor riches, nor power, nor uſefulneſs, will defend, in this awful, trying, moment.</p>
            <p>This affecting truth has, lately, been exemplified, in the death of LIEUTENANT GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON.(A) Although born to give liberty and independence to a nation, to rule and protect a nation, he has died, like a man; and fallen, like one of the princes. In his death, America has loſt her firſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter and her beſt friend. For more than forty years, his life and talents were devoted to the good of his country, both in the cabinet and field. When a young man, he gave ſtriking evidence of his future greatneſs and uſefulneſs. At this period his wiſdom and bravery were eminently diſplayed, in ſaving the remnant of the American and Britiſh army, when General Braddock was defeated by the French and Indians. Endowed with a ſtrong mind, with ſhining talents, with an aſtoniſhing command over his own paſſions, he early diſtinguiſhed himſelf, in the liſt of ſame, and gained the attention and love of America.</p>
            <p>That nature produces but one extraordinary man, in an age, is the common remark of hiſtorians. This age has ſeen George Waſhington appear, on the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of life, and perform wonders, which have aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed the world. Our affection for him, our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his perſon, abilities, and uſefulneſs may, perhaps, be carried too far. But ſhould we ſay, he is the moſt dignified character, that has appeared, in this century, we ſhould ſpeak the general voice of America, (B) and of Europe. In compariſon with him the crowned heads, princes, and generals of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope appear to loſe their luſtre and dignity. Of the laſt king of Pruſſia it has been ſaid, he ſent to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036793_0009_100B0F462BE0D578"/>
Waſhington, in the late war, his own likeneſs, with this note, "FROM THE OLDEST GENERAL IN EUROPE TO THE GREATEST GENERAL, IN THE WORLD."</p>
            <p>The character, whoſe death we are lamenting, was, principally, formed, in the late American revolution. When America was, cruelly, oppreſſed by her mother country, when the Britiſh Parliament aſſumed the right of making laws <hi>to bind us, in all caſes whatever,</hi> and ſent her fleets and armies to enforce thoſe laws, our eyes were turned to this Great Man. With a brave, intrepid heart, and humble reliance, as we conceive, on the God of armies, he ſtepped forth to defend his country, and guide her to victory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.</p>
            <p>As the friction of a diamond will make it ſhine the brighter; ſo difficulties and dangers will rouſe the heroic ſoul, and make it appear, in all its native ſtrength. This was the caſe of Waſhington. Taking the command of a weak, undiſciplined, army, he riſqued his life and reputation, in oppoſing a mighty foe. Through unſeen dangers and difficulties, he led, with a ſkilful, unerring hand, his little band of heroes, and humbled the pride of an imperious, haughty, nation. (C) Calm and unruffled as the ſmooth ocean, he could ſee, without perplexity, (D) one danger riſing after another, and yet not deviate from the grand object in purſuit. Conſcious of his own integrity, and depending on the juſtice of his cauſe, he perſevered with fortitude and conſtancy, till he drove the oppreſſors from this land of liberty, and gave peace to his country. And, then, with the love of his citizens and applauſe of the world, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the private walks of life, and the repoſe of domeſtic happineſs.</p>

"When the debility of our Federal ſyſtem had become manifeſt, and the bonds, which connected the parts of this vaſt Continent, were diſſolving, we ſaw him the Chief of thoſe patriots, who formed for us a Conſtitution, which, by preſerving the Union, will, I truſt, ſubſtantiate and perpetuate thoſe bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings our revolution had promiſed to beſtow. In obedience to the general voice of his country, calling on him to preſide over a great people, we ſaw him, once more, quit the retirement he loved, and in a ſeaſon more ſtormy and tempeſtuous than war itſelf, with calm and wiſe determination, purſue the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the nation, and contribute, more than any other could contribute, to the eſtabliſhment of that ſyſtem of policy, which will, I truſt, yet preſerve our peace, our honor, and our independence."<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Marſhall's ſpeech, on receiving the news of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's death.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Rejoicing in the happineſs of America, and willing to exert his talents for her ſafety, he forſook, the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond time, the ſweets of private life, aſcended the chair of ſtate, and ſteered the helm of government, with the ſame impartial hand, and the ſame impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial love, that induced him to wield the ſword, in her defence. Amidſt jarring intereſts and different politics, he appeared to have been influenced, by the higheſt good of his fellow citizens. His adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was happy and benign. And, abating ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the people were contented and proſperous, under his government. For one man to pleaſe all claſſes and deſcriptions of men, eſpecially when their ſentiments and intereſts are in oppoſition, is, perhaps, impoſſible. But, amidſt the different views and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of America, no man, it is preſumed, has, ſo generally, had the love and confidence of the great

            <p>"Having been twice unanimouſly choſen the Chief Magiſtrate of a free people, we ſaw him, at a time, when his re-election, with the univerſal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, could not have been doubted, affording the world a rare inſtance of moderation, by withdrawing from his high ſtation to the peaceful walks of private life. However the public confidence may change, and the public affections fluctuate with reſpect to others, yet with reſpect to him, they have, in war and in peace, in public and in private life, been as ſteady as his own firm mind, and as conſtant as his own exalted virtues."<note n="*" place="bottom">See the abovementioned ſpeech, which was received after the ſermon was delivered.

            <p>After having retired, the ſecond time, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing ſcenes of private life, and taken an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate farewel of a grateful people, in an addreſs, (E) that honored his genius and his heart, he was, for the third time, called, by the general government, to take the command of the army, they thought proper to raiſe for the public ſafety. In the opinion of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and impartial men, this was eſteemed an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional luſtre to his glory; as he had been, once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Commander in Chief of the American Army, and twice choſen to the Supreme Magiſtracy of the United States. His accepting a General Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy, under theſe circumſtances, was clear proof of the goodneſs of his heart, and that he preferred the weal of his country to the etiquette of honor.</p>
            <p>In private life, he was ſocial, courteous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending; a tender huſband, a kind friend, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036793_0012_100B0F4C75954CE8"/>
pleaſant companion. In public life, he was affable, grave, prudent, and energetic. His eye was piercing, his aſpect commanding, (F) and his morals unblem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. (G) Although born and educated in the midſt of pleaſures and gaiety, he ſhone in the morals of a Seneca, the philoſophy of a Socrates, and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm of a Cato. In his character were happily blended all the endearing and illuſtrious qualities of a huſband, a friend, a citizen, a general, and ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. With equal facility and grace, he could command the pen, the ſceptre, and ſword. Such were the ſweetneſs of his mind and happy talents, in doing buſineſs, he could refuſe, without diſobliging; and puniſh, without offending. (H) Like Virgil's man of gravity, "At his preſence the maddening crowd would ſtand, with liſtening ears, and ſedition hide its head." With a little variation, we may ſay of him, as Cicero ſaid of the celebrated Roſcius, "Though he died in advanced age, yet ſuch was the excellence and inimitable beauty of his art, that we thought him worthy of living forever."</p>
            <p>But he has gone from "The buſy ſcenes of life" to the world of ſpirits. He has bidden a farewel, a long, eternal, farewel to his dear and amiable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, to his friends, to his country, to his greatneſs, and dignity below the ſun. "Our Waſhington is no more! The hero, the ſage, and the patriot of America—The man, on whom, in times of danger, every eye was turned, and all hopes were placed, lives now <hi>only</hi> in his own great actions, and in the hearts of an affectionate and afflicted people." As David ſaid of Abner, <hi>"That a prince and a great man is fallen, this day, in Iſrael;"</hi> ſo we may ſay of the illuſtrious Waſhington, that a prince and a great man has fallen, in our nation. To ſay, he was, in all reſpects,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036793_0013_100B0F4EB7052CB0"/>
the moſt dignified character in America, is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the living. "I receive," ſaid the Preſident of the United States, in his anſwer to the Houſe, "I receive with great reſpect and affection the condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Houſe of Repreſentatives on the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and afflicting event, in the death of the <hi>moſt illuſtrious</hi> and <hi>beloved perſonage,</hi> which this country has <hi>ever</hi> produced."</p>
            <p>In him the officers and ſoldiers of the late conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental army, have loſt a man, whom they loved, feared, and reſpected. In him America has loſt her beſt general, her wiſeſt counſellor, and trueſt friend. At his death, every heart muſt grieve, and every eye ſtand big, with the tear of mourning. In this great hero and ſtateſman are ſtrictly verified the words of our text, <hi>"I have ſaid, ye are gods.—But ye ſhall die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes."</hi> Raiſed to eminent ſtations of honor and truſt, by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and repeated voice of America, he diſcharged his duty with fidelity and punctuality. By unſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en perſeverance in righteouſneſs, he gained a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of renown, which has eclipſed the greateſt heroes of ancient and modern times. Born to a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and endowed with brilliant talents, he devoted his intereſt, and time, and abilities, to the good of his country, and deeply fixed his memory in their affections.</p>
            <p>But neither his fortune, nor talents, nor character, nor the affections of his citizens, have been able to defend him againſt the awful meſſenger of death. Like a man he has died. Like a prince he has fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; and he is, now, ſlumbering in the ſilent tomb, <hi>"not to riſe again, till the heavens be no more."</hi> Though removed, by death, from his friends and country, yet his name will, forever, remain impreſſed on their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036793_0014_100B0F50B9337E60"/>
hearts, as on pillars of marble. By the page of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, his memory will be tranſmitted to the remoteſt generations. And, whenever, in future times, the infancy and riſing glory of America ſhall be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of converſation, the name of Waſhington will be mentioned, with wonder and delight.</p>
            <p>In the preſent criſis of human affairs; when ſuch important and aſtoniſhing events are riſing to view, on the great theatre of Europe; when <hi>"nation is riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt nation, and kingdom againſt kingdom, and men's hearts are failing them for fear, and for looking for thoſe things, that are coming on the earth,</hi> and the calamities of war are raging through cities and towns, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſuch awful deſtruction of men, the death of our illuſtrious General muſt be ſenſibly affecting to every true American. Removed as we are from theſe dreadful ſcenes of carnage and deſolation; we are, however, in a great meaſure, connected with the politics and revolutions of Europe. And the preſent times, eſpecially in America, <hi>demand men of firmneſs, of cool tempers, of diſpaſſionate hearts, and impartial love</hi> to guide the people in the path of righteouſneſs and ſafety. Although we are not deſtitute of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed characters, both in the cabinet and field, yet the name of Waſhington was <hi>alone</hi> worth a hoſt of vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran troops. In the courts of Europe, his reputation had riſen to the higheſt grade of ſame. And, while they viewed him as firmly attached to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and beſt good of his country, the proſpect would, naturally, give a check to their intrigues and manoeuvres to draw us, with themſelves, into the ſame vortex of ruin.</p>
            <p>In the late glorious ſtruggle for our rights and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties, when oppreſſed by a domineering nation, we ſaw him at the head of our armies, directing all his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036793_0015_100B0F5332BB1B38"/>
plans, with the greateſt wiſdom, ſecrecy, (I) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. When raiſed to the head of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he appeared in all the ſagacity and dignity of the moſt profound ſtateſman. And we hoped to have enjoyed, in his laſt acceptance of office, his counſel and arm to defend our neutrality and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace, in our borders. But America was not deſtined to enjoy, any longer, his preſence, the good of his counſels, nor ſtrength of his arm. At no time, could his departure from this vale of tears have been more intereſting to this land, and to the world. By a ſudden, unexpected, malady, the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign diſpoſer of men has taken him from this to the unſeen world. His ſun has ſet forever.—"No; the name of WASHINGTON—the American Preſident and General, will triumph over death; the uncloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brightneſs of his glory will illuminate future ages."</p>
            <p>To the rulers in America, his death affords a moſt ſolemn, affecting, admonition. Could greatneſs of mind, could dignity of perſon, could uſefulneſs, and the love of his country have preſerved him, he <hi>"would not have died."</hi> But neither greatneſs of mind, nor dignity of perſon, nor uſefulneſs, nor the love of one's country is able to retain the ſpirit, in the hour of death, in whoſe <hi>'war there is no diſcharge.'</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though exalted to the high ſtation of gods, yet rulers muſt "die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes." To them the grim <hi>'king of terrors'</hi> will pay no more reſpect, than to the loweſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. From their ſeats of renown and power, they will be taken down, by the hand of death, and laid in the duſt, on a level with their fellow worms.—From the active ſcenes of life, of power, and glory, they will, ere long, be ſummoned to the bar of that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036793_0016_100B0F55358FFD88"/>
holy, impartial God, who ſhows no reſpect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but judgeth and rewardeth every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his conduct in this life. In the preſence of the omniſcient and holy God, kings, and princes, and preſidents, and governors, and generals, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and people will appear on equal footing, and each receive, in the final judgment, according to the deeds done in the body. In the final day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, the virtuous, upright, and faithful magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate will receive the approbation of his Judge and be ſeated on a throne of unfading glory. But the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and oppreſſors of mankind; <hi>"who have cauſed their terror, in the land of the living,"</hi> will be frowned from the preſence of Jehovah, and filled, with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſhame. <hi>"Be wiſe, therefore, O ye kings: Be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ſubject may remind all claſſes not to truſt in health, nor in power, nor in <hi>"uncertain riches; but in the living God."</hi> While in health and uſefulneſs, <hi>"the rich man's wealth is his ſtrong city."</hi> But experience has, often, taught, that <hi>"riches profit not in the day of wrath."</hi> Of what avail are fine houſes, beautiful gardens, fertile fields, bags of gold, and a numerous train of ſervants, in the hour of death. Agonizing with pain, and expecting, every moment, to launch into eternity, the trembling ſoul can receive no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from its popularity and hoards of wealth. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the <hi>only</hi> comfort of a dying man. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of having commanded armies and gained victories, of having ſwayed the ſceptre of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obtained the applauſe of nations, will not ſoften the pains of a dying man, nor give eaſe to an accuſing conſcience. When earthly wealth and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur are failing, and nature ſinking under a load of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036793_0017_100B0F56ED37C670"/>
diſtreſs, the <hi>"rejoicing"</hi> of a good man is, <hi>"the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom; but, by the grace of God, he has had his converſation, in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May God grant, that all the rulers, in America, may feel, though they are gods, they muſt die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes. Impreſſed with this ſolemn thought, may they realize the importance of religion, the neceſſity of being influenced, by the principles of righteouſneſs and fidelity, in the making of laws, and carrying them into execution. In all their conduct, in the legiſlative, judicial, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive departments, may they feel their accountability to God, the force of religion in their own hearts, and their own mortality. Acting under the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe ſentiments, may their lives be long, their adminiſtration happy, and may they <hi>"come to their graves, in full age, like as a ſhock of corn cometh in, in his ſeaſon."</hi>

               <p>GENERAL WASHINGTON departed this life, on the 14th December, 1799, of an inflammation in his throat, as appears by a letter from his private Secretary, Mr. Lear, to the Preſident of the United States. "It is with inexpreſſible grief, that I have to announce to you the death of the great and good General Waſhington; he died, laſt evening, between 10 and 11 o'clock, after a ſhort illneſs of about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours. His diſorder was an inflammatory ſore throat, which proceeded from a cold, of which he made but little complaint, on Friday. On Saturday morning, about 3 o'clock he became ill.—Every med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical aſſiſtance was afforded, but without the deſired effect. His laſt ſcene correſponded with the whoſe tenor of his life. Not a groan, nor a complaint, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped him, though in extreme diſtreſs. With perfect reſignation and full poſſeſſion of his reaſon, he cloſed his well ſpent life."</p>

               <p>The voice of America, reſpecting the eminent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and worth of General Waſhington, is happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the communications and doings of the Fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Government, in conſequence of receiving the melancholy news of his death.</p>
               <p>In his MESSAGE to both houſes of Congreſs, the Preſident ſays, "It has pleaſed Divine Providence to remove from this life, our excellent fellow citizen GEORGE WASHINGTON, by the <hi>purity</hi> of his character and a long ſeries of ſervices to his country, rendered <hi>illuſtrious</hi> through the world. It remains for an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate and grateful people, IN WHOSE HEARTS HE
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036793_0019_100B0F5BCB46EAC8"/>
CAN NEVER DIE," to pay ſuitable honor to his memory."</p>
               <p>In waiting on the Preſident, "The Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives" unanimouſly ſay, "Penetrated with a ſenſe of the irreparable loſs, ſuſtained by the nation, by the death of that great and good man, the ILLUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIOUS AND BELOVED WASHINGTON," We "wait on you, Sir, to expreſs" our "condolence on this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and diſtreſſing event."</p>
               <p>To which the Preſident made the following reply, "I receive, with great reſpect and affection, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and afflicting event in the death of THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND BELOVED PERSONAGE, WHICH THIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED. I ſympathize with you—with the nation, and with good men, through the world, on this <hi>irreparable</hi> loſs ſuſtained by us all."</p>
               <p>To honor this worthy chief, directions have been given to the Navy of the United States, in theſe words, "Deſirous, that the Navy and Marines ſhould expreſs, in common with every other deſcription of American citizens, the high ſenſe which all feel of the loſs our country has ſuſtained, in the death of this good and great man, the Preſident directs, that the veſſels of the Navy, in our own, and foreign ports, be put in mourning for one week, by wearing their colors half maſt high, and that the officers of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and the Marines, wear crape, on the left arm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the elbow, for ſix months."</p>
               <p>To the Army of the United States, the orders are given, in theſe words, "The Preſident, with deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, announces to the Army the death of its beloved Chief, Gen. George Waſhington. Sharing in the grief, which every heart muſt feel for ſo heavy and afflicting a public loſs and deſirous to expreſs his high ſenſe of the vaſt debt of gratitude, which is due to the virtues, talents, and ever memorable ſervices of the ILLUSTRIOUS deceaſed, he directs, that funeral honors be paid to him, at all the military ſtations, and that the officers of the army and of the ſeveral
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036793_0020_100B0F5D6C3346F0"/>
corps of volunteers wear crape on the left arm, by way of mourning, for ſix months."</p>
               <p>The reſolutions of Congreſs, on this mournful event, reflect the higheſt honor on our nation, and on its late illuſtrious Chief, now in the manſions of the dead. They are thus expreſſed, <hi>"Reſolved,</hi> that a Marble Monument be erected, by the United States, in the Capitol, in the city of Waſhington, and that the family of Gen. Waſhington be requeſted, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his body to be depoſited under it; and that the monument be ſo deſigned as to commemorate the great events of his military and political life.—That it be recommended to the people of the United States to wear crape, on the left arm, as mourning, for thirty days.—That there be a funeral proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Congreſs Hall to the German Lutheran Church, in honor of the memory of Gen. George Waſhington, on Thurſday the 26 inſtant, and that an oration be prepared, at the requeſt of Congreſs, to be delivered before both Houſes, on that day."</p>
               <p>If we look through the annals of all nations, we ſhall find no evidence, that ſimilar tribute of reſpect was ever paid to the memory of any man. When the great heroes of antiquity died, the world, inſtead of being clad in mourning, rejoiced, and felt, not that great, good, and virtuous men had departed from their affections; but that <hi>monſters,</hi> in human ſhape, had made their exit. As to the greater part of thoſe heroes, they were the mere <hi>ſcourges</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>butchers</hi> of the innocent. But the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Hero was humane and benevolent, virtuous and brave, the friend of the people, the defender of his country, the ſcourge of oppreſſors, and a ſhining ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample worthy of the imitation of every ſucceeding General and Preſident. At his death all hearts are grieved, and the mourning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
