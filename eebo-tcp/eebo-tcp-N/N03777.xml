            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOUGH I know no Reaſon why you ſhould be ſollicitous about any thing that happens to ſuch a dead Dog as I am, yet as your Love (<hi>Oh unmerited Kindneſs</hi>) abounds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly towards me, I am poſitive you will give Thanks unto our good GOD for all the Mercies he has conferred upon me; therefore have ſent you as full and particular Account of the Remainder of my Voyage, as the little Leiſure I have had from my Miniſterial Offices would permit me to give.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Feb.</hi> 20. 1737. Spent the Morning on board, in writing Letters to my dear Friends in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to acquaint them of my fate Arrival. Went in the Afternoon on Shore to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably delighted with the Proſpect of the Place.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004632_0003_100DB200697966B0"/>
My Friend <hi>H.</hi> and I dined at an Inn, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went with Capt. <hi>W.</hi> and ſome other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to view one Side of the Fort, which to us ſeem'd impregnable; and at the Sight of it I could ſcarce avoid crying out, <hi>Who is ſo good a GOD as our GOD?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeeing Perſons of all Nations and Languages gave me great Pleaſure: And the Difference of the Value of their Money and ours, gave me Occaſion to reflect on the Stupidity of thoſe who place their Happineſs in that which has no intrinſick Worth in itſelf, but only ſo much as we arbitrarily put upon it.</p>
            <p>Went into a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Chapel, wherein were the Reliques of a vaſt deal of Pageantry, and ſeveral Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> dreſſed up, not like a poor <hi>Galilean,</hi> but in her Silks and Damaſks. <hi>Oh</hi> (thought I) <hi>who hath bewitched this People, that they ſhould thus depart from the Simplicity of CHRIST, and go a whoring after their own Inventions?</hi> Surely, Was great St. <hi>Paul</hi> to riſe from the Dead, and come and view the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> his Spirits would be ſtirred up within him, as it was at <hi>Athens,</hi> to ſee them thus <hi>wholly given to Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, Feb.</hi> 21. After having read Prayers, and wrote ſome more Letters to my Friends in <hi>England,</hi> went again to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> to pay my Reſpects to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>S.</hi> being told by Capt. <hi>M.</hi> that he expected to ſee me. The worthy old Gentleman, like <hi>Sergus Paulus,</hi> received me with the utmoſt Candor, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004632_0004_100DB23368BB9CC0"/>
gave me a general Invitation to come and dine with him every Day, during my Stay at <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> I thanked him for his Kindneſs; had about a quarter of an Hour's Converſation with him, and took my Leave for that Time.</p>
            <p>At One o'Clock, I returned to dine with him, according to his Appointment; and was well pleaſed with the regular Behaviour of the Officers at Table. We had what an Epicurean would call <hi>Caena Dubia.</hi> At three I took my Leave, and walk'd about with Capt. <hi>W.</hi> and other Friends, to take a ſecond View of the Fort; went on board about Five; read Prayers, and began expounding the Creed in the Cabbin; wrote ſome more Letters, and went to Bed, very thankful to GOD for ſending me abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, Feb.</hi> 22. This Day I intended to ſtay on board, to write Letters, but GOD being pleaſed to ſhew me it was not his Will, I went again on Shore, and paid both the Miniſters of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> a Viſit, who receiv'd me very affectionately, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me the Uſe of the Pulpit. <hi>Oh what a bleſſed Thing it is for the Clergy to dwell together in Unity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At Eleven went to publick Prayers, and was much pleaſed to ſee many Officers and Soldiers attend the General to Church. <hi>Methinks Religion looks doubly amiable in a Soldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Prayers, dined again with the General, who gave me another particular Invitation, as I went out of the Church. He treated me with uncommon Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and deſired me to preach the following <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004632_0005_100DB2039573F568"/>
Had an Opportunity of ſending a Packet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with my Journal to my dear Friends in <hi>England. May the good LORD give them his Bleſſing!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Went in the Afternoon to viſit a Deſerter, who had ſent me a Letter, deſiring me to intercede for him with the Governor, he being apprehenſive he ſhould die for Deſertion; I intended to anſwer his Requeſt, but the Governor was ſo merciful that he order'd him to be whip'd only, which I thought Puniſhment little enough. <hi>O Sin, what Miſchief doſt thou make in the World!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening return'd as uſual on board, read Prayers and expounded in the great Cabbin, buried a Child, made an Exhortation to the Soldiers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Occaſion, wrote to ſome Friends at <hi>Deal;</hi> and went to Bed with unuſual Thoughts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions that GOD would do ſome great Things at <hi>Gibraltar. Oh that I was a pure Veſſel fit for my Maſter's Uſe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, Febr.</hi> 23. Continued all this Day on Board, did my uſual Duty in the Ship, and put my dear Friend <hi>Br</hi>'s Sermon into the Hands of two Officers at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> who came to dine on board with Lieutenant <hi>D.</hi> They behaved very much like Gentlemen, and ſeem'd pleaſed with ſerious Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. <hi>May the GOD whom I ſerve add the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to the Gentleman!</hi>
            </p>

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004632_0006_100DB23594CD4D58"/>
reached <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> I pray'd that GOD would open an effectual Door, at the Place whither we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and direct me where I ſhould lodge; and lo! this Day He has anſwered me.—About Ten in the Morning comes Capt. <hi>M.</hi> on board, telling me that one Major <hi>S.</hi> (a Perſon I never ſaw) had provided me a convenient Lodging at one Merchant <hi>B</hi>'s, and deſired that I would come on Shore. I looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as a Call from Providence, received it with all Thankfulneſs, and went with Friend <hi>H.</hi> on Shore, but not without firſt praying that GOD would direct us how to behave.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the Town Major <hi>S.</hi> gave us the Meeting, conducted us to our new Lodgings (which were very commodious) and engaged us to dine with him and Captain <hi>M. When I ſent you without Scrip or Shoe, lacked ye any thing? and they ſaid, Nothing, LORD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Eleven was introduced by Doctor <hi>C.</hi> to General <hi>C.</hi> who was deſirous of ſeeing me. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me exceeding kindly, and after a little ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Converſation, we went to the Governor <hi>S</hi>'s, from thence to publick Prayers; and I was highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee ſo many Officers attending on the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to Church. Doctor <hi>C.</hi> told me he had not known Governor <hi>S.</hi> abſent himſelf from Prayers once theſe ſeveral Years, except when he was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by real Sickneſs. <hi>O that all others would let their Light ſo ſhine before Men!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Retired in the Evening to our Lodgings, had Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004632_0007_100DB205AB0B8FD0"/>
Prayer, wrote ſome few religious Letters, and ſpent near half an Hour in ſerious Converſation with the People of the Houſe, gave Thanks for the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Day, and was ſoon convinced that GOD had ſent me that particular Lodging of a Truth. <hi>Be careful for nothing, but on every (even the minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt) Thing, make your Wants known unto GOD. For he careth for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Feb.</hi> 25. About Six this Morning went with Friend <hi>H.</hi> to the Church to pray with ſome devout Soldiers, who I heard uſed to meet there at that Time, and with whom my Soul was knit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. <hi>For all my Delight is in the Saints that are in the Earth, and in thoſe that excel in Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After we had finiſhed our Devotion, I made an Enquiry into their State, and found that their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been ſubſiſting about twelve Years, and that one Serjeant <hi>B.</hi> (a devout Soldier indeed) now amongſt them was the firſt Beginner of it. At firſt they told me they uſed to meet in Dens and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Caves in the Rocks; but afterwards upon their applying for Leave to build a little Place to retire in, Doctor <hi>C.</hi> and Governor <hi>S.</hi> gave them the free Uſe of the Church, where they conſtantly meet three Times in a Day, to pray, read, and ſing Pſalms, and at any other Seaſon when they pleaſe. They have met with Contempt, and are now in Deriſion called the <hi>New Lights.</hi> A glorious Light they are indeed. For I converſed cloſely with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them, and they made me quite aſhamed of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004632_0008_100DB23901D1BA90"/>
my little Proficiency in the School of CHRIST. Many have joined with them for a Time, but a ſervile Fear of Man, <hi>that Bane of Chriſtianity,</hi> made them draw back. However, ſome continue ſtedfaſt and immoveable, and tho' deſpiſed by the World, are no doubt highly favoured of GOD. Governor <hi>S.</hi> countenances them much, and has ſpoke of them often to me with Reſpect. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD, even the Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who hath not left himſelf without Witneſs in any Place, but hath ſome every where, who ſerve him and work Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sunday</hi> before we came hither, I was telling my Friend <hi>H.</hi> that I had reaſon to think, by what had happen'd to me, that GOD had ſome Work for me to do at <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> he anſwer'd that there could not much Good be expected from among Soldiers. I replied—No doubt GOD has ſome ſecret ones in all Places, who tremble at his Word. And lo he hath this Day brought me to them. <hi>By this I know thou favoureſt me, O LORD thou King of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo another Society of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church, who in Contempt are called <hi>Dark Lanthorns.</hi> It has ſubſiſted about a Year, and is made up of many ſerious Chriſtians, as I was informed. I did not think it agreeable to viſit them, but I ſent them, as well as the other Society, ſome proper Books; had religious Talk with ſeveral of them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to unite both Societies together. <hi>Oh when will that Time come, when all Difference about Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004632_0009_100DB207360C4DC0"/>

            <p>About Eight return'd to my Lodgings, and after having wrote ſome Letters, went on board the <hi>Amy</hi> to marry a Couple who ſent to me Yeſterday to come and <hi>celebrate their Nuptials.</hi> I took that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of exhorting them all to <hi>take heed to the Things that belong to their Peace.</hi> Some, I believe, were affected, but the Generality of them behaved ſo careleſs, that I could not but ſee a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe that have a Miniſter and thoſe that have not.</p>
            <p>About Twelve went on board my own Ship, dined, did ſome neceſſary Buſineſs, read Prayers, gave my Flock a warm Exhortation, and returned about Five on Shore, where I ſpent near two Hours with the devout Soldiers in the Church. Many of them converſed moſt ſpiritually, and ſeem'd well acquainted with the Pangs of the New Birth. <hi>May GOD perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts! O how amiable are thy Servants, O LORD of Hoſts!</hi> How would the World admire them did they ſee their Beauties! But Satan does now as formerly dreſs them in Bears Skins in order to have them baited.</p>

               <hi>Sunday, Feb.</hi> 26. Between Five and Six in the Morning went with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> (which I did all the while I was at <hi>Gibraltar</hi>) and ſung Pſalms, prayed and expounded the Leſſons to the devout Soldiers in the Church, and was much enlarged. <hi>Thanks be given unto Thee, O LORD.</hi>

Intended to go and preach to my People; was prevented by the Violence of the Wind; but was pleaſed to hear from ſome <hi>Gibraltar</hi> Officers, who dined that Day on board the <hi>Whitaker,</hi> that ſome of my Flock had the Courage to read Prayers and ſing Pſalms themſelves, and (as I found afterwards) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo to do, during my Abſence from them. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD! I hope I ſhall have ſome that dare be ſingularly Good, and will not be kept out by the Preſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preached in the Morning at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> before ſuch a Congregation of Officers and Soldiers as I never before ſaw: The Church, tho' very large, was quite thronged: And GOD was pleaſed to ſhew me, that he had given extraordinary Succeſs to my Sermon. <hi>O how is the divine Strength magnified in my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! O grant I may like a pure Cryſtal tranſmit all the Light thou poureſt upon me; and never claim as my own what is thy ſole Propriety!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dined with Friend <hi>H.</hi> at Governor <hi>S'</hi>s, who ſent moſt kindly to invite us. The Law at his Table was the ſame with that of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> "No one was compelled:" And all the Officers behav'd in ſuch a decent innocent Manner every Time I dined there, that they pleaſed me very much. <hi>Surely ſome Fear of GOD is in that Place!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Evening Prayers (for there is no Sermon in the Afternoon) I went and expounded, prayed and ſung Pſalms with the Society, and had near thirty Hearers. <hi>May the good LORD give it his Bleſſing.</hi>

At Night had ſome devout Converſation with my Hoſt and Hoſteſs, who ſeemed to love me as their own Soul, prayed for abſent Friends, and went to Bed aſhamed I had done ſo little for GOD on a Sabbath Day. But when we cannot do as we <hi>would,</hi> we muſt do as we <hi>can.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Feb.</hi> 27. Went to the Church, and did as Yeſterday: and was viſited afterwards by two of the Nonconforming Society, who ſeemed to be <hi>Iſraelites indeed:</hi> I exhorted them to Love and Unity, and not to let a little Difference about a few Externals occaſion any Narrow-ſpiritedneſs to ariſe in their Hearts. I adviſed them to come and hear me expound in the Church, which they did; and providentially the Leſſon was the 4th of the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> from whence I took Occaſion to urge on them the Neceſſity of loving one another with a Catholick diſintereſted Love; to be of one Heart and one Mind, and to join without Reſpect of Perſons in haſtening the Kingdom of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. I hope GOD gave a Bleſſing to what was ſaid: For I obſerved they came conſtantly afterwards, and was told there was a perfect Harmony between them. <hi>What infinite Miſchief have needleſs Diviſions occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned in the Chriſtian World?</hi> Divide &amp; Impera, <hi>is the Devil's Motto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dined and ſupped at General <hi>C</hi>'s with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and was received moſt courteouſly: <hi>The LORD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him in that Day!</hi> The Officer ſeem'd ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to oblige me, and to be ſollicitous for my Stay

               <hi>Tueſday, Feb.</hi> 28. Expounded in the Church as uſual; went on board, read Prayers and expounded to my own Flock; dined with Friend <hi>H.</hi> at Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>S</hi>'s, who ſent to invite us; and expounded to a large Number of Soldiers, in the Evening at Church.</p>
            <p>Was aſked by Dr. <hi>C.</hi> in the Name of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Colonel <hi>C.</hi> to preach every Prayer Day whilſt I ſtay'd at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> which I promiſed to do, and perceived the Word of GOD to run very ſwiftly. Many of the Inhabitants preſſed me to ſtay with them, and were exceeding kind to thoſe who were with me, for my ſake. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD, for thus giving me Favour in his People's Sight! LORD, what am I, or what is in me, that thou ſhouldeſt thus ſo highly honour me? Grant, O LORD, the more thou exalteſt me, the more I may abaſe myſelf, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be looking to the Rock from whence I was hewn?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Converſed with one of the devout Soldiers, who was under ſtrong ſpiritual Trials; and GOD was pleaſed to give him Comfort. I find it neceſſary more and more every Day, that Miniſters ſhould be tempted in all Things like unto their Brethren, that they may be able experimentally to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, March</hi> 1. Expounded in the Morning, and was highly pleaſed at my Entrance into the Church, to ſee ſeveral Soldiers kneeling in ſeveral

            <p>Expounded twice in the Church, as uſual, and at Night had above three hundred Hearers; amongſt whom were many Officers, Ladies, and Dr. <hi>C.</hi> the Miniſter of the Church himſelf, who would have had me went up into the Reading D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This Morning, beſides a great Number of the Soldiers, near if not more than a Dozen of the Town's People came to Church to hear me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. Afterwards, we breakfaſted with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who ſent by Major <hi>S.</hi> to invite us, and moſt gladly received us into her Houſe. About Ten I preached my Sermon againſt <hi>Swearing,</hi> and made a Farewel Application to the Soldiers that were going over to <hi>Georgia</hi> out of that Garriſon. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor had that Morning review'd them; and as I could not be in the ſame Ship with them, I deſired they might be ordered to come to Church, that I might have an Opportunity of telling them how to behave in that Land which they were going over the Sea to protect. The Colonel and Governor moſt readily conſented; there was a moſt thronged Audience, and GOD was pleaſed to ſet his Seal to my Sermon: Many Officers and Soldiers wept ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a viſible Alteration was obſerv'd in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon for ſome Days after. <hi>O that their Convictions may end in their Converſion, and that they may bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit!</hi>

Evening, and went up into the Deſk, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Dr. <hi>C.</hi> who now conſtantly makes one of my Hearers. After this, we ſupp'd at Mr. <hi>B'</hi>s of the Victualing-Office, and returned home with Joy and great Gladneſs of Heart. <hi>Who can expreſs the loving Kindneſs of the LORD, or ſhew forth all his Praiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, March</hi> 4. Expounded in the Morning: More Hearers than ever, ſome of which wept. Dined and ſupped with General <hi>C.</hi> who ſent laſt Night to invite me and my Friend, and treated us with particular Reſpect.</p>
            <p>Went in the Afternoon to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue, and was ſurpriſed to ſee one of the Head of them come from the fartheſt End, and put me in one of their chiefeſt Seats: But afterwards he told me he had heard my Sermon Yeſterday againſt <hi>Swearing,</hi> and thanked me for it. <hi>Not unto me, not unto me, O LORD, but unto thy Name be all the Thanks and Glory!</hi> I continued with them their whole Service, and ſpent moſt of my Time there in ſecret Prayer to GOD, <hi>That the Veil might be taken from their Hearts, and that bleſſed Time might come when his choſen People ſhould again be engrafted into their own Olive-Tree, and all</hi> Iſrael <hi>be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Viſited an unhappy Man in Priſon, who laſt Night, in a drunken Fit, murdered a Fellow Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. I providentially met him juſt as he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and laid before him the Terrors of the LORD. At firſt he ſeemed unconcerned; but in a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004632_0016_100DB240FA8F12D8"/>
ſhort Time he was pricked to the Heart, deſired me to come and ſee him, and to-day trembled and wept bitterly. <hi>Oh Drunkenneſs, what Miſchief haſt thou done? Thy Name is Legion; for behold a Troop of Sins come along with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening I had near, if not more, than a thouſand Hearers; and I took Occaſion, from the poor Man's Example before mention'd, to warn the Soldiery not to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs; a Sin that moſt eaſily beſets the Men of <hi>Gibraltar. May they hear and fear, and ſin no more preſumptuouſly.</hi> I had a great Hoarſeneſs upon me; but notwithſtanding, GOD enabled me to ſpeak with Power. <hi>When we are weak, then are we ſtrong. What Mercies has GOD ſhewn me this laſt Week! Oh that my Friends, when they hear of it, may praiſe him! for ſurely GOD has hearkened to their Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, March</hi> 5. After Morning Expoſition in the Church, went and ſaw the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> at their high Maſs; and ſhall only make this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark: That there needs no other Argument againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> than to ſee the Pageantry, Superſtition, and Idolatry of their Worſhip.</p>
            <p>About Ten, went to the Church belonging to the Garriſon; preached to a moſt thronged Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and received (what my Soul longed after) the Sacrament of CHRIST's moſt bleſſed Body and Blood: Both the Generals were there, and near fifty more Communicants. The weekly Collection for the Poor was larger than ever was known:
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004632_0017_100DB210DEAC8A00"/>
And ***** was ſo affected, that he wiſhed himſelf a deſpiſed <hi>Methodiſt. We are not fit for GOD to work by, 'till we are deſpiſed by Men, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Power of Preaching may be ſeen to be of GOD only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dined at Governor <hi>S</hi>'s, and, at the Requeſt of the Inhabitants and Gentlemen of the Garriſon, preach'd in the Afternoon. Expounded in the Evening to above a thouſand Hearers, of all Denominations; ſupped with General <hi>C.</hi> went home betimes, full of unſpeakable Comfort: I am never better than when I am on the full Stretch for GOD. <hi>GOD grant I may not, like</hi> Jehu, <hi>drive furiouſly at firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fall back; but, forgetting thoſe Things which are behind, may I reach out to thoſe Things that are before, and preſs forwards towards the Mark, for the Prize of my high Calling in CHRIST JESUS!</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear my dear Friends ſay ſilently,<hi>Amen.

               <hi>Monday, March</hi> 6. Had near, if not more than a hundred at Morning Expoſition; and it being the laſt Day of my ſojourning at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> many came to me weeping, telling me what GOD had done for their Souls, deſiring my Prayers, and promiſing me theirs in Return. Others both gave and ſent me Tokens of their Love, as Cakes, Figs, Wine, Eggs, and other Neceſſaries for my Voyage, and ſeemed to want Words to expreſs their Affection. <hi>The good LORD note their Kindneſſes in his Book, and reward them a thouſand ſold!</hi>

About Twelve, went to the Church, according to Appointment, and made a farewel Exhortation, as GOD gave me Utterance, to a great Number of weeping Soldiers, Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after which we kneeled down, and having recommended each other to the Care of GOD, I left them, went and took my Leave of the two Generals; viſited the confined Priſoner; dined at a Gentlewoman's Houſe of the Town; left near fifty Letters to be ſent to <hi>England;</hi> and about Four went on board, accompanied to the Sea-ſide with near two hundred Soldiers, Women, Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who all ſorrowed at my Departure, and wiſhed me good Luck in the Name of the LORD. Surely I may now expect greater Succeſs abroad, having ſuch an Addition of Interceſſors in my Behalf. <hi>O LORD, put their Tears into thy Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and let their Cry come unto Thee.</hi>

And yet I have not been amongſt any Set of People, where GOD has made his Power more to be known. Many that were quite ſtark blind, have received their Sight; many that have fallen back, have repented, and turned unto the LORD again; many that were aſhamed to own CHRIST openly, have waxen bold; and many that were Saints have had their Hearts filled with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory. <hi>This is the LORD's Doing, and it is marvellous in our

Eyes: May he give a Bleſſing to the Books diſperſed amongſt them, and perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts, till the Day of our Lord JESUS! May they be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing at the laſt Day; and may GOD's Mercies to me in every Place make me more humble, more zealous, more thankful, and more ſteady to do or ſuffer whatever my dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath allotted for me. Into his Hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit, as into the Hands of an all powerful Preſerver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Five came on board, and was gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by my Flock, whom I hope to love better for being a little abſent from them. Interceded and gave Thanks as uſual, at Night on Deck; and was pleaſed that I was again retired from the World.

               <hi>Saturday, March</hi> 11. Bleſſed be GOD, this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Storm began to blow over, and Light broke in upon my Soul. Was enabled to read Prayers and expound both in the Cabbin and to the Soldiers, with more Vigor than I have ſince we left <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> Had Reaſon to think my late Indiſpoſition had been ſanctified to me. <hi>Suffering Times are a Chriſtian's beſt improving Times:</hi> For they break the Will, wean us from the Creature, prove the Heart; and by them GOD teaches his Children, as <hi>Gideon</hi> by Thorns and Briars taught the Men of <hi>Succoth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Time of my Indiſpoſition, my dear Friend <hi>H.</hi> mourned over me like a Dove. Bleſſed be GOD, Familiarity does not breed Contempt between us, but our Love to each other increaſes daily. <hi>JESUS CHRIST is the only Rock whereon alone true Friendſhip can be built.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, March</hi> 12. Expounded with more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement than uſual, and gave my People Notice that I intended ſpeaking to them one by one, to ſee

what Account they could give of their Faith. <hi>I have not ceaſed warning every one of you,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. <hi>May I follow his Steps!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preached the Sermon GOD enabled me to make in the Storm before we came to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> in the great Cabbin; and GOD was pleaſed to ſet his Seal to it. Had ſome cloſe Converſation with my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions about their Interior; interceded for abſent Friends, and had Reaſon to hope my weak Efforts to promote his Glory had not been in vain in the LORD. <hi>May GOD give me a thankful Heart!</hi>

               <hi>Monday, March</hi> 13. Bleſſed be GOD! this is the moſt comfortable Day I have had ſince I came laſt abroad, ſlept better than uſual; was enabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe freely; [perceived my Appetite to return] was enlarged much in Interceſſion, and found I had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to give Thanks for my late Indiſpoſition. <hi>O how gently does my gracious Maſter deal with me! Though Sorrow may endure for a Night, yet Joy cometh in the Morning. LORD, grant I may ſpend that Health thou haſt now reſtored to me to thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Service! It is good for me that I have been a little chaſtiſed; for who knows but I might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have periſhed by being lifted up above meaſure with my laſt Succeſs?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 14. Began to put in Execution what I promiſed on <hi>Sunday,</hi>—enquired into the Faith of thoſe committed to my Charge; and tho' all of

them were not ſo great Proficients as I could wiſh, yet I find they know enough to ſave them, if they put what they know in practice; ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge GOD, if they miſcarry. <hi>Oh! that the LORD may give them his Bleſſing!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had much of the Preſence of GOD with me, and felt ſuch a fervent Love for my Chriſtian Friends, that I feared how I ſhould behave, was GOD to call any of them from me. But I truſt ſufficient for ſuch an Hour will be the Strength thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, March</hi> 15. Was much pleaſed with my preſent Situation, and had Reaſon to bleſs GOD for ſome further viſible good Effects of my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Was highly delighted in ſeeing Friend <hi>H.</hi> active in teaching the Lambs of my Flock: He has now gotten a regular School, and the Children began to-day to come at regular ſet Hours: Several alſo of the Soldiers learn to write and read; ſo that my Friend is like to make an uſeful Man. <hi>GOD make him more and more ſo every Day!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, March</hi> 16. Preached this Afternoon my Sermon againſt Swearing, at which ſeveral of the Soldiers wept. Bleſſed be GOD! that Sin is much abated amongſt us; and I think a viſible Alteration may be perceived through the whole Ship. <hi>Not unto me, not unto me, O LORD, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Name be the Glory!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was much ſtrengthned in my preſent Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, by reading the Story of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and joined in Interceſſion with thoſe who ſet apart that Day as a

Day of Faſting and Prayer for the Sins of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which we belong. <hi>May they prove as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as thoſe which</hi> Moſes <hi>put up for the Children of</hi> Iſrael!</p>
            <p>The Sick increaſed to-day; viſited near a Dozen. <hi>May I by this frequent viſiting ſick Beds, learn to improve my Time of Health: For, alas, What can be done in Time of Sickneſs?</hi> I find but few that are able with any tolerable Patience to ſuſtain their bodily Infirmities: <hi>But to have a wounded Spirit at the ſame Time, Good GOD, who can bear it?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Friday, March</hi> 17. Laſt Night GOD ſent us a fair Wind; and we began to ſail moſt pleaſantly: I was comforted on every Side, and enabled to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed fervently for all Mankind. <hi>Oh that the Love of GOD and Man was ſhed abroad in my Heart!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, March</hi> 18. The Weather being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair, and the Sea calm, I went with Capt. <hi>W.</hi> on board the <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> dined with the Gentlemen belonging to the Ship and Colonel <hi>C.</hi> who came on board to pay them a Viſit: Married a Couple; diſperſed <hi>Bibles, Teſtaments, Soldiers Monitors</hi> amongſt the Men; exchanged ſome Books for ſome Cards, which I threw over-board; preach'd a Sermon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Drunkenneſs, which GOD enabled me to finiſh Yeſterday; and returned in the Evening, highly delighted with ſeeing the Porpoiſes roll about the great Deep. <hi>O LORD, the Sea is full of thy Riches! marvellous are thy Works, and that my Soul knoweth right well. O that I may live to praiſe thee for them!

What Mercies have I received this Week! they are more in Number than the Hairs of my Head. Oh that my Friends would give Thanks for me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, March</hi> 19. Went with Captain <hi>W.</hi> on board the <hi>Amy;</hi> read Prayers and preach'd to above two hundred and twenty Hearers; and married a Couple, who did not behave ſo well as I could wiſh: The Bridegroom laughed ſeveral Times in the midſt of the Solemnity, upon which I ſhut up my Prayer-Book: But he ſhewing his Concern by weeping, I then proceeded, gave him and the Bride a Bible, as the beſt Preſent I could make them; and exhorted all to Holineſs of Life. <hi>GOD give them a hearing Ear, and an obedient Heart!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dined with Colonel <hi>C.</hi> who treated me with the utmoſt Civility, and took care to diſpoſe or ſome Books I brought with me to proper Perſons.</p>
            <p>About Three we returned to the <hi>Whitaker,</hi> read Prayers and preached my Sermon againſt Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; after which Capt. <hi>M.</hi> made a uſeful Speech to the Men, and exhorted them to give heed to the Things that had been ſpoken. Religion is likely to go on well, when both the Civil and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Powers are engaged in keeping up the Purity of it. <hi>But, LORD, unleſs thou aſſiſt us, all our Endeavours are but in vain.

            </p>
            <p>Had above an Hour's cloſe Converſation with my Companions concerning their Interior; and walked with Friend <hi>H.</hi> on Deck 'till Twelve at

Night, admiring GOD's Wonders in the Deep. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD for ſending us abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, March</hi> 20. To-day Colonel <hi>C.</hi> came to dine with us, and in the midſt of our Meal we were entertained with a moſt agreeable Sight; it was a Shark about the Length of a Man, which followed our Ship, attended with five little Fiſhes, called the Pilot Fiſh, much like a Mackarel, but larger. Theſe I am told always keep the Shark company; and what is moſt ſurpriſing, tho' the Shark is ſo ravenous a Creature, yet let it be never ſo hungry, it never touches one of them. Nor are they leſs faithful to him: For if at any Time the Shark is hooked, theſe little Creatures will not forſake him, but cleave cloſe to his Fins, and are often taken up with him. <hi>Go to the Pilot Fiſh, thou that forſakeſt a Friend in Adverſity, conſider his Ways and be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</hi> This ſimple Sight one would think ſufficient to confute any Atheiſt (if there be ſuch a Fool as a ſpeculative Atheiſt) in the World.</p>
            <p>After Dinner I read Prayers and expounded to my own People; and then went aboard the <hi>Amy</hi> with Colonel <hi>C.</hi> who uſed me with uncommon Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; married a Couple; and came back to the <hi>Whitaker,</hi> rejoicing to ſee the Works of the LORD, and the Beauty of the great Deep. <hi>Who would but come abroad?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had near two Hours cloſe Converſation with a Gentleman, in whom appear many Marks of the New Birth. Surely he will prove a devout Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion!

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 21. Had freſh Reaſon to be thankful: Captain <hi>M.</hi> made me a kind Preſent; the Weather exceedingly pleaſant; and what was the greateſt Bleſſing of all, GOD's Holy Spirit ſeemed to be moving on the Faces of ſome of the Souls in the Ship.</p>
            <p>The Weather growing warmer, Friend <hi>H.</hi> had ſome Cloths hung over to cover his School: His Children come very regular both to learn and ſay their Prayers at Night: Capt. <hi>W.</hi> takes great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them: Capt. <hi>M.</hi> much encourages the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to read and write; ſo that we begin to live as regular now as we could wiſh to do on Shore. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD for thus making his Power to be known!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though GOD gives me ſo much Comfort, yet my dear <hi>England</hi> Friends are ſeldom out of my Mind; though abſent in Body, I am preſent with them in Spirit. <hi>The LORD direct my Way unto them, and grant if ever I return it may be in the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Peace!</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, March</hi> 22. Saw a large Grampus rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſpouting out Water for a long while, at a ſhort Diſtance from our Ship: It put me in mind of the Behemoth ſpoken of by holy <hi>Job,</hi> and of the Leviathan mentioned by the royal Pſalmiſt. <hi>O GOD, who is like unto thee!</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Was very fervent in Interceſſion for abſent Friends and all Mankind. <hi>Oh, Interceſſion is a moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Exerciſe! How does it ſweeten and purify the Heart!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Viſited near twelve or fourteen ſick Perſons; and yet ſuch is GOD's Mercy to me, that tho' the Place where they lye is much confined, and they catch the Fever of one another, yet GOD keeps me from Infection. <hi>The Way of Duty is the Way of Safety.</hi> Now GOD has ſent his Viſitations abroad amongſt us, I hope we ſhall learn Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, March</hi> 24.

            <p>Churched a Woman who lately was delivered of a dead Child, and afterwards gave her an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applicable to her Circumſtances. <hi>GOD grant ſhe may apply it to her Heart!</hi>

This Day GOD I truſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his Power in the Converſion of a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on board, whom he has been pleaſed to viſit with a Fever. His Convictions were ſtrong, and, as far as I could find, a thorough Renovation begun in his Heart: <hi>The good LORD perfect it till the Day of his Diſſolution.</hi> Now GOD begins to ſhew me wherefore he hath ſent me: <hi>O that I was humble! that I might be fit for the High and Lofty One, who inhabiteth Eternity, to work by.</hi>

            <p>Preached a Sermon in the Afternoon, on <hi>Luke</hi> iii. 14.—<hi>And the Soldiers likewiſe came unto him, and demanded, ſaying, And what muſt we do? And he ſaid unto them, Do Violence to no Man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be content with your Wages.</hi> I made it at the Requeſt of Capt. <hi>M.</hi> who ſeems in earneſt about the great Work of his Salvation: He has read <hi>Arndt'</hi>s <hi>True Chriſtianity,</hi> and is now reading <hi>Law'</hi>s <hi>Chriſtian Perfection;</hi> Books worth their Weight in Gold, and which GOD has bleſſed to the Converſion of many. <hi>But what are Books without thy Spirit, O LORD?

Exchanged ſome bad Books that were on board (which I threw immediately into the Sea) for ſome good ones, bleſſed be GOD; all that I have found them with, as yet, have been ready to ſurrender them up.

               <hi>Friday, March</hi> 31. This being the Crucifixion of our bleſſed LORD, I preached a Sermon on the <hi>Penitent Thief,</hi> and I hope GOD gave it his Bleſſing. We begun Prayers later than uſual, ſo that before I had done, Darkneſs came upon us, which put me in mind of that Darkneſs which overwhelmed the World, when the GOD of Nature ſuffered. <hi>Oh that our Hearts may rend like the Rocks, and our

Souls ariſe from the Death of Sin, as the Bodies of thoſe did from their Graves who appeared to many in the Holy City, after our LORD's Reſurrection!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had a good Inſtance of the Benefit of breaking Children's Wills betimes. Laſt Night going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Decks (as I do every Night) to viſit the Sick and to examine my People, I aſked one of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to bid her little Boy that ſtood by her, ſay his Prayers, ſhe anſwered, His elder Siſter would, but ſhe could not make him. Upon this, I bid the Child kneel down before me, but he would not 'till I took hold of its two Feet and forced it down. I then bid it ſay the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> (being informed by his Mother he could ſay it if he would) but he obſtinately refuſed, 'till at laſt after I had given it ſeveral Blows, it ſaid its Prayers as well as could be expected, and I gave it ſome Figs for a Reward. And this ſame Child, tho' not above four Years of Age, came to Night on Deck, when the other Children came to ſay their Prayers to my Friend <hi>H.</hi> and burſt out into a Flood of Tears, and would not go away 'till he had ſaid his too. I mention this as a Proof of the Neceſſity of early Correction: Children are ſenſible of it ſooner than Parents ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. And if they would but have Reſolution to break their Wills thoroughly when young, the Work of Converſion would be much eaſier, and they would not be ſo troubled with perverſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are old.</p>

ſtill, and what was infinitely better, had Reaſon to think ſeveral went forward in the great Work of their Salvation. <hi>Oh that we may be buried with CHRIST in Baptiſm, and riſe with him to Newneſs of Life!</hi>

               <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 2. Roſe early this Morning, and joined in Spirit with my dear abſent Friends, who were receiving the Holy Eucharist, and celebrating our Bleſſed LORD's Reſurrection. I find my not being in Prieſt's Orders is a great Hindrance to my Miniſtry, which will oblige me to return to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> as ſoon as poſſible. <hi>The good LORD prepare me for that ſecond Impoſition of Hands!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preached a Sermon in the Afternoon, on <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 10. <hi>That I may know Him, and the Power of his Reſurrection.</hi>—<hi>Oh that we may all experience it in our Hearts! for without it, CHRIST as to us is dead in vain.</hi>

               <hi>April</hi> 3. Had ſome farther Converſation with the young Gentleman whoſe Converſion I mentioned before, and who I hope is really quickened from Above. He told me he uſed to wonder to hear me talk that all our Thoughts, Words and Actions, ought to be dedicated unto GOD, but now he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what I ſaid to be true. <hi>How does the new Nature give us new Notions!</hi> It ſeems a difficult Taſk to the natural Man to turn his whole Life into one continued Sacrifice, but the ſpiritual Man does it with Eaſe: He feels a divine Attraction in his Soul, which as ſenſibly draws his Heart towards
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004632_0036_100DB25772307AF0"/>
GOD, as the Load-stone attracts the Needle. <hi>Draw us then, O GOD, and our Affections will aſcend up after Thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Eleven went on board the <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> prayed with a ſick Man, preached my Sermon on the <hi>Penitent Thief.</hi> Afterwards went on board the <hi>Amy,</hi> catechiſed the Children, dined on a Dolphin, had ſome uſeful Converſation, preached to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, returned home about Six, read Prayers, viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sick, interceded for Friends, and went to Bed praiſing and bleſſing GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 7. Great Enlargement of Heart has been given me for theſe four Days laſt paſt, particularly to-day, in which GOD hath vouchſafed me much of his Preſence and aſſiſting Grace; obſerv'd ſtill ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Signs of a thorough Converſion being wrought on ſome aboard; had moſt delightful ſailing, and every thing as pleaſant as this vain World can afford. Theſe are Preparatives for future Trails: Welcome in the Name of GOD: He will uphold me. If it was not for the Corruptions of my own Heart, which are continually ſtirring, what have I to diſturb my Peace; but as long as thoſe <hi>Amalekites</hi> remain in my Soul, I ſhall never be perfectly at eaſe. <hi>LORD, keep me but ſtriving, and I ſhall at laſt be more than Conqueror, through JESUS CHRIST that loved me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 8. Went on board the <hi>Lightfoot</hi> and <hi>Amy,</hi> and preached to the Soldiers of each Ship; dined with Colonel <hi>C.</hi> who continued extreamly civil;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004632_0037_100DB2281BD1FA90"/>
and at my return found the Sick increaſe upon my Hands. But few in the Ship eſcape: <hi>The good LORD make all their Beds in their Sickneſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had much of the Preſence of GOD with me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. The Heat uncommonly temperate, as it has been for ſome time, and the Ship ſailed all Day as tho' ſhe was carried on the Wings of the Wind. Preached two Sermons beſides my Expoſition at Six in the Morning, and I hope GOD ſet his Seal to them. Was well pleaſed to hear by my Friend <hi>H.</hi> (who is very active in carrying Things to the Sick) that the poor People between Decks prayed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for me.</p>
            <p>And now indeed we live more comfortably in the great Cabbin than can eaſily be imagined. We talk of little elſe but GOD and CHRIST. GOD has greatly bleſſed <hi>the Country Parſon's Advice to his Pariſhioners,</hi> that excellent Book; and ſcarce a Word is to be heard amongſt us when together, but what has Reference to our Fall in the firſt, and our New Birth in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the LORD from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo that we all, I truſt are reſolved to put my Afternoon's Text into Practice, and are <hi>determined not to know any thing ſave JESUS CHRIST and him crucified. Grant this, O Father, for thy dear Son's ſake. Oh that I knew how to be thankful! Oh that Heaven and Earth would join with me in praiſing GOD!</hi>

               <hi>April</hi> 10, 11. Spent good Part of theſe two Days in mending my Nets. Had exceeding pleaſant Weather. Some more of the Sailors were convicted of Sin, and others ſend Notes to be prayed for, and give Thanks as regularly as in any Pariſh. Bleſſed be GOD, we live very comfortably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 12, or 13. To-Day Captain <hi>W.</hi> caught a Dolphin, which was moſt beautiful when drawn out of the Water, but its Colour ſoon changed. <hi>Juſt ſo is Man; he flouriſhes for a little while; but when once Death cometh, how quickly is his Beauty gone!</hi> A Chriſtian may learn a Leſſon of Inſtruction from every thing he meets with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 14. To-day I could have wiſhed for ſome young Prodigals aboard the <hi>Whitaker,</hi> to ſee one of our Soldiers dying. Alas, how did his Breaſt heave, his Heart pant, and great Drops of Sweat trickle down his Face! his Eyes looked ghaſtly, and the whole Man was in a bitter Agony. Captain <hi>W.</hi> went down between Decks once or twice to ſee him: And I uſed the laſt Prayer ſeveral Times. About Nine at Night he expired, I fear without Hope; for he killed himſelf by Drinking. <hi>Oh that all Drunkards would learn from him to be wiſe in Time, and practically conſider their latter End!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 15. This Morning I buried the dead Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in time of publick Prayers, choſe proper Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004632_0039_100DB22ACD263600"/>
and gave the Soldiers a ſuitable Exhortation; but I was ſo affected with a Senſe of the Miſery of fallen Man, that I could not ſpeak with my uſual Vigour.</p>
            <p>To-day was called in a Hurry to pray by one of the devout Soldiers who came from <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and who was ſuppoſed to be expiring. I came, [I ſaw] and rejoiced in Spirit; for his Soul ſeemed full of GOD. Inſtead of being affrighted at the Approach of the King of Terrors, he welcomed it, and ſaid he was going to his dear Redeemer; then he fell as it were into a Trance, and poured out his Heart in repeating ſome very applicable Verſes out of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Upon which we thought he would have died: But lo! God brought him from the nethermoſt Hell. From that Inſtant the Fever left him, and he recovered. Oh, what Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there between him that feareth GOD, and him that feareth him not, in their laſt Hours! <hi>LORD, let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my future State be like his!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exerciſed a little Diſcipline this Evening on a Boy, whom Captain <hi>M.</hi> took notice of above a Week ago for behaving ill at Church, and ſaid he would deliver him up to me: I therefore, by the Advice of his Maſter, ordered him to be tied, 'till he could ſay the 51ſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which he repeated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night very ſolemnly in the midſt of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. May it be a Warning to him for the future!</p>

               <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 16.

All the Officers continue extremely kind, and ſeem ſtudious to oblige me all they can. <hi>The good LORD reward them a thouſand fold!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Evening I was ſent for by a Sailor, who has been the moſt remarkable Swearer on board; and whom I in an eſpecial Manner warned about two Days ago, telling him, I believed GOD would remarkably viſit him, as well as the others. He laughed, and ſaid he hoped not. But to night he ſent for me, trembling, and burning with a Fever, told me what grievous Sins he had been guilty of, and prayed moſt fervently for Repentance. Two or three of the ſame Stamp have been taken in the ſame Manner. <hi>GOD grant they may flee from the Wrath to come! Sinners muſt either bend or break.</hi>

Everlaſting <hi>I AM</hi> ſaid to the Sea at that Inſtant, <hi>Let there be a Calm in that Place:</hi> For by that Means our Ship was immediately ſtopped in her Courſe, and ſo the Water-ſpout paſſed by before we came up to it; otherwiſe it would have torn our Sails in Pieces. GOD's Hand was ſo viſible in this, that ſeveral ſaid, they never beheld the like before. <hi>O how does Providence watch over us, when we think nothing of it! Who would but live well to be under the immediate Protection of ſuch an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Power?</hi> After this, ſeveral Squalls came upon us, which afforded me glorious Matter for adoring that great good GOD, whom Winds and Storms obey. The Sailors were in great Hurry and Confuſion, but to my Comfort not <hi>one ſingle Oath</hi> was heard all the while: A Proof this, that Sailors may pull their Ropes without Swearing, and that the Words ſpoken to them have not altogether fallen to the Ground: <hi>Bleſſed be GOD!</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, April</hi> 22. Fled as it were on the Wings of the Wind for three Days paſt, ſailing ſometimes an hundred and ſeventy, ſometimes an hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles in twenty-four Hours. I find that GOD generally ſends us ſtrongeſt Winds when neareſt our Port. <hi>May I learn from hence a Leſſon of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and the nearer I come to my Haven of eternal Reſt, the quicker may I move!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spent moſt of theſe Days in writing to my dear Friends in <hi>England,</hi> and in particular Supplication
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004632_0042_100DB25C643C8510"/>
for Direction how to act in the Land whither I am going. The Thoughts of my own Weakneſs, and the Greatneſs of thoſe Trials which I muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily meet with, fill me with a holy Fear. <hi>But wherefore do I fear?

Preached twice to my People to-day, and ſpend moſt of the reſt of the Day in earneſt Prayer for the Divine Aſſiſtance in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Undertaking, being as we imagined near the Haven where we would be. The Morning Leſſons were exceeding applicable, ſo that we could not help taking Notice of it. <hi>By this I know GOD favours me.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Monday, May</hi> 1. This Morning went out upon Deck, after being confined to my Bed a Week by a violent Fever, with which all except three or four in the Ship have been viſited. I was blooded thrice, and bliſtered and vomited once, and, bleſſed be GOD I can ſay, <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted:</hi> For as Afflictions abounded, Conſolations much more abounded; and GOD enabled me to rejoice with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory. <hi>Satan</hi> deſired to have me to ſift me as Wheat, but JESUS CHRIST prayed for me, and my Faith failed not. I had all the Conveniences I could have on Shore: Capt. <hi>W.</hi> reſigned his own Bed to me; <hi>J. D.</hi> and Friend <hi>H.</hi> ſat up with me every Night; and nothing was wanting to make my Sickneſs comfortable and eaſy. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD for theſe

            </p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall now experimentally ſympathiſe with thoſe that are ſick, and learn to be more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted to my Fellow <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> I am now made whole: <hi>May I ſin no more, be more fervent in Spirit, ſerving the LORD! leſt a worſe Evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal me.</hi>

               <hi>Friday, May</hi> 5. About Ten o'Clock this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried the Cook of the Ship, who expired laſt Night. I could have wiſhed for a hundred Tongues to have ſounded a loud Alarm to the People; but the Sight of the Corpſe, and the Weakneſs of my Body, would but juſt permit me to read out the Office. <hi>LORD, what is Man?</hi> Oh why are others taken and I left, but that GOD's long Suffering ſhould lead me to Repentance? <hi>Grant it, O LORD, for thy dear Son's ſake!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Afternoon I privately baptized a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Infant. Thus it is, ſome coming into the World, others going out of it continually. <hi>Good GOD! Who can deſire to live here always?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Afternoon, after having lain about a Week on this Coaſt, we ſaw <hi>Savannah</hi> River, and ſent off for a Pilot. Oh what Joy appeared in every one's Countenance!

            <p>After this, I took Boat with my Friend <hi>H.</hi> and arrived ſafe at <hi>Savannah,</hi> having a moſt pleaſant Paſſage, about Seven in the Evening. How GOD is pleaſed to deal with me here, I'll endeavour to inform you hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, fail not to give Thanks for the Mercies I have received. Though we have had a long, yet it has been an exceeding pleaſant Voyage.
