            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have for a long time been deeply sensible of the great hurt that many, professing the same Truth with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (called in scorn <hi>Quakers</hi>) have received, and do remain under in these Parts, as to their Souls inward state in the growth and prosperity of Truth, and the work and effect of it upon them, so that to our certain Observation divers are come to a great loss and decay thereby, as to their inward state in the Truth, by their medling with Worldly Government, in the several parts of it, and respective Offices thereunto belonging; as some being Judges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are or may be concerned to pass Sentence of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Punishment upon some, as not only of an Eye for an Eye, but of Life for Life; the which, although proper and necessary to be executed by Worldly Rulers and Judges, yet seeing Christ hath forbid it unto his Followers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.38.39. it is not proper for such as profess to follow Christ, according to the most perfect and clear Gospel Dispensation and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000637_0002_0FA962550EF982E8"/>
Ministration professed by us; and as it doth not become any of our Profession to receive or undertake the Office of a Worldly Judge, to judge in a matter of Life and Death, or any degree of corporal Punishment, so it is our Judgment and Perswasion, that those of our Profession of the faithful People (called in scorn <hi>Quakers</hi>) should not meddle or be concerned with any other part or office of any worldly Rule or Government, as to be Justice, Sheriff or Constable, or Jury-man in any Criminal Causes, or to chuse or be chosen so to sit in an Assembly or Provincial Council to make Laws against Criminal Offenders, extending either to the taking away of Life, or any other corporal punishment. And for this our Perswasion, we give these following Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> Because Christ hath expresly forbid it to his Followers, <hi>To take an Eye for an Eye, or a Tooth for a Tooth, nor to resist Evil</hi>; for the same Reason, not to take Life for Life, or Limb for Limb, or to use any Corporal Punishment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Because <hi>Paul</hi> said, in behalf of himself and all good <hi>Christians,</hi> according to that clear Gospel Dispensation that they were come unto, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The Weapons of our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not Carnal.</hi> Ephes. 2.12. <hi>And we wrestle not against Flesh and Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Because Christ our Leader and Example said, <hi>He came not to destroy mens Lives, but to save them,</hi> Luke 9.56. And when the Woman taken in Adultery was brought before him, though by the Law she deserved Death, yet he did not condemn her, but said, to her, <hi>Go, sin no more,</hi> John 8.11. And when some of his Disciples asked him, <hi>Wilt thou that we command Fire to come down from Heaven to consume them?</hi> Luke <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.54. he turned, and rebuked them, and said, <hi>Ye know not
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000637_0003_0FA96255C8C963C0"/>
what manner of Spirit ye are of</hi>; and these concerning whom some of the Disciples spake, were <hi>Samaritains,</hi> that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Village, who would not receive Christ into their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which was a great breach of Humanity and humane Society, and by his words it appeareth, that to call for fire from Heaven to destroy the Life of Man, or kindle a fire upon Earth to do it, belongeth not to the perfect Gospel Spirit or State, but is of the Law.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Because Christ has expresly forbidden his Disciples <hi>To exercise Lordship,</hi> or <hi>to lord it over their Brethren,</hi> Luke 22.25, 26. And he said unto them, <hi>The Kings of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise Authority upon them are called Benefactors; but ye shall not be so, &amp;c.</hi> And since Christ hath allowed and appointed in his Church a spiritual Rule and Authority, that some are to have over others, by the Power of his Spirit in them, that place <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood to forbid amongst his Disciples &amp; Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a spiritual Government and Rule in his Church; and therefore what he forbids is Worldly Government among his Followers, according to the World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. &amp; 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> From these &amp; other places of Scripture, our Friends from the beginning have solemnly declared against all use of the carnal Sword, or of any carnal Weapon to hurt the Body of any man, or take away the Life of any man or men in any case, whether offensive or defensive; and for our part we do see it very clearly and plainly, that the use of the Sword, or of some carnal or bodily Weapons, is so necessary to the World<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y Magistrate to punish such as deserve it, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive part of his Office cannot in an ordinary way (and without Miracles) be done without it; and Practice doth sufficiently confirm it in this part of the World, where for<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:000637_0004_0FA96256986D1128"/>
professing the same Principle with us against the use of the carnal Sword, or other carnal Weapons, yet because of their Office (some being Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) have passed Sentence of Death, and other corporal Punishment upon Offenders; and they could do no less to answer the Trust of the Office they had taken unto them; and all rational men will judge, that a pair of Stocks, Whipping Post and Gallows, are carnal Weapons, as really as Sword or Gun, and so is a Constables Staff, when used, as hath been by some, to beat and knock down the Bodies of some obstinate Persons <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd if Bodily Violence may be used by a Constable with his Staff against one, if that one get Ten to rescue him from the Constable and his Assistance, this doth necessarily engage into a carnal way of Fighting in the pursuance of Justice against Offenders; for it is not the number being great or small that makes a thing to be right or wrong: If it be a transgression of Christs Command to raise 1000 men with Clubs, Swords and Guns to subdue &amp; bring under 1000 men that are unjust Pursuers and Invaders of other mens Properties and Liberties, it is by the same Reason to raise ten or five. And if any Invasion by Gods permission, should happen by <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Indians</hi> against the Inhabitants in these parts, if any of us be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates at that time, they cannot discharge the trust and duty that belongeth to them, as such, without raising force of Arms against them; which would be a plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the former Testimony of our Friends; and to use any Violence to the Body of man, by any Bodily Force, is a Contradiction to that great and Gospel Promise, <hi>They shall beat their Swords into Plow Shares, and their Spears into Pruning Hooks, Isa.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.3. And, as for those Reasons we judge it altogether improper for any who are sincere to their Profession, (who are in scorn called <hi>Quakers</hi>) to be any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000637_0005_0FA9625752CE54C0"/>
of way concerned in any part of Office-bearing in worldly Government or Execution of Justice, that toucheth the Body or Life of Man, by any corporal Punishment, so more especially to such it is most improper and unbecoming, and unsavoury and hurtful, who profess to be Ministers of the perfect Jesus, who became our Example to suffer all things patiently, and not to do violence to any man, to have a hand or part in the inflicting any corporal Punishment upon any for any Offence or Crime whatsoever; for how improper and unsavoury is it for one and the same man to day to sit on the Bench, bearing the Office of a Judge, and to pass sentence on an Offender, to take an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, Limb for Limb, Life for Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to morrow to stand up and preach Christs words, Mat. 5.38 39 <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been said, an Eye for an Eye and a Tooth for a Tooth, but I say unto you, Resist not Evil?</hi> for scarcely in any other <hi>Protestant</hi> Profession of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> is it allowed for Ministers of the Gospel to be Judges in secular matters.</p>
            <p>But to prevent all occasion of mistakes or offence, we do solemnly declare our perswasion, That we really believe, and are perswaded, that Magistracy and Worldly Government is an Ordinance of God, and every Magistrate, lawfully called to his Office, is the Minister of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil, and that he beareth not the Sword in vain, the which Sword is the Sword of Justice, that ought to be drawn to punish Offenders with corporal Punishment, greater or smaller, acco<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

one professing <hi>Christianity</hi> ought to be subject to all lawful Commands of the Magistrate, as all such are that neither contradict any of the Laws of God, testified and reco<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>athen</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> so called, or by any other Name. Yet notwithstanding, we judge that the bearing Office in any Worldly Government of Magistracy, doth not belong to the perfect and clear Dispensation and Minist<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>on of the Spirit, under the clear Gospel Day of Christ that is dawned amongst us, after the long dark Night of Apostacy. And before the dark Night of Apostacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the clear Gospel and perfect Day of Christ, and clear Gospel Dispensation and Ministration of the Spirit of Christ did shine in great Glory from the time immediately after Christs Ascention and giving the holy Ghost, during which time of the clear Gospel and perfect Day of Christ, we find not that any sincere <hi>Christians</hi> did bear the Office of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate under Kings or Princes of this World, until the Night of Apostacy came upon the generality of Professors of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the which Night came gradually upon them, and not all at once; and in this Night of Darkness there hath been a great Mixture of Truth and Error, as well as of Law and Gospel, that hath had place among the general <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Professors, and many or most that have been called <hi>Christians,</hi> that have had a measure of sincerity &amp; integrity,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000637_0007_0FA9625BA8727A18"/>
have been more of a legal or Law Spirit than of a Gospel Spirit, and have been rather under the first Ministration of the Spirit than under the second, in great part. And Wars, even in case of Defence, and Worldly Government belong to the first Ministration of the Spirit, that is of the Law, common to pious <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and many called <hi>Christians,</hi> but are not proper, nor belonging to the second Ministration of the Spirit, that brings to perfection in the <hi>Christian Life</hi> and <hi>Virtues</hi>; Therefore we caution and exhort all, who have the perfect Life and State of Christianity, and the Virtues of it, as their mark &amp; aim before them, not to meddle with Worldly Government or Magistracy, or to act in it by way of Force and Rule, but rather to leave it to others, to whom it is more proper; and yet to be subject to all lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of all Magistrates actively; and if they command unlawful things, to be passive, and not to resist, but patiently to suffer whatever may be inflicted upon them, and pray for all men, for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that we may live a godly and quiet Life under them.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. But if any say, <hi>it is better for honest good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men (called</hi> Quakers) <hi>to rule over their Brethren and others, who may be expected, that they will rule well, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Justice impartially, and mix Mercy with Justice in cases that may allow, than by their refusing to bear the Office in Worldly Government, to give up the Government to others, that may do very unjust things, and persecute, yea, exercise great Cruelty over the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this we answer, <hi>first,</hi> Men ought not to do evil that good may come of it, seeing Christ hath commanded his Disciples, <hi>Not to exercise Lordship or Worldly Authority over men</hi>; they must regard his Commandment, hoping that all will be turned unto good to them that fear and love God.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000637_0008_0FA9625BB57063B0"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> There may be found men that are more fitted and qualified for Worldly Government, to administer Justice impartially, than the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> because they may be more knowing and expert in the Laws, and may be men of a just Principle, in whom the just Principle of Truth may in good measure rule, though they be not of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, nor of our Faith or Perswasion in many things; for there are just men that may be found, and have been found amongst those called <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and why not much rather amongst the lower Professions in <hi>Christendom,</hi> who though they are not come clearly to the second Ministration of the Spirit, yet may be under the first Ministration thereof, and may be both just men, and better skilled in the Laws than them called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and therefore more qualified for bearing Office in Worldly Government. And as concerning Persecution and Cruelty, there is a hand of God in suffering those things, when they come, either for the sins of the People, or to try their Faith and Patience, and for the exercise of their <hi>Christian Virtues</hi>; and if Persecution and Cruelty be used or Injustice done to any, it is more tolerable that others be the Instruments of it, than any called <hi>Quakers</hi>; for if any called <hi>Quakers</hi> do any unjust thing, it is a great Reflection upon the whole Profession; but if none of them have any Office in the Government, and any thing be done amiss therein, they will not be chargeable with it. But we hope none will construe our sence or intention, as if we desired Persecution to come either upon us, or any others; for we do judge and esteem, that outward peace, quiet and freedom from Persecution is a great mercy and blessing of God, which we desire to bless God for, and all his other Mercies; and our Prayer to God is that none may abuse their outward Liberty, but that it may be blessed to them;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000637_0009_0FA9625C4599EDF0"/>
and that they may use it to Gods Glory, and their Souls peace and prosperity in the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. And if any further Objections be made against this Position, we may conclude they are such as can be made against that position, <hi>That under the pure Gospel Dispensation we are not to war nor fight with carnal Weapons</hi>; which our Friends have plainly witnessed against; nor will this position give any just cause of Offence to superiour Magistrates, but rather it will give them great Satisfaction, to find us a people that are no wise ambitious of Worldly Government, and wholly principled to be subject to their Authority in all things, either actively or passively: By this means all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of jealousie or distrust will be removed from them, after they have good tryal of us, by finding us constant to our Principle, that they can be in no danger by us, of being guilty of any Plots or Conspiracies against the Government; and it can give as little cause of offence to inferiour-Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, because men commonly desire places of Office in Magistracy and Government, and if all of our Profession refuse such Places and Offices, this will the more oblige them, by their having the more ready opportunity to have their minds answered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But if any further object, <hi>What if one that is a Magistrate be convinced and perswaded to be of our Way, must he leave off being a Magistrate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is easily answered, If he be really convinced and perswaded by the Spirit of God to be of our way, the same Spirit that hath convinced him of the Truth of our Way in other things, will convince him of the Truth of it in that also; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, he will freely and willingly desire to lay down his former Power as a Magistrate, to receive greater <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000637_0010_0FA9625C941EC1C0"/>
said, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World</hi>; and as his Kingdom is not of this World, so nor will ours be, if we be faithful Followers of him. Nor is this to unchristian all others who are Magistrates, or may not be of our mind in this case; for we distinguish betwixt the first and second Ministration of the Spirit, and betwixt the present <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And to such who aim to arrive to this degree, it may be said, If thou wilt be perfect leave the Worldly Government, and follow Christ, in order to attain the desired Perfection; for as there are higher and lower degrees in <hi>Christianity,</hi> so it may be more tolerable or excusable to one in his lower degree, that seeth no further, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

It is generally confessed by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that to <hi>Swear</hi> or <hi>pay Tythes</hi> are short of

               <hi>Christian Perfection,</hi> and ought not to be done, and yet they are more Charitable than to judge, that no man is in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree a <hi>Christian</hi> that doth <hi>Swear</hi> or <hi>pay Tythes,</hi> or contribute to a Worldly Ministry, because there are many yet see not the evil of those things, and yet in other things are consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, and endeavour to walk in faithfulness to what they know. And as Charity ought to be extended unto them who <hi>Swear</hi> and <hi>pay Tythes,</hi> if they see no further, and do not willfully shut their Eyes against a further discovery, so the like Charity may be extended to them who may be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Wars or Government, if they do not see into it, that it belongeth not to the <hi>Perfect Dispensation of Christianity.</hi>

            <p>IT is well known that the despised People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have been great Sufferers for their Testimony against <hi>Swearing</hi> in any case, some by long and close Imprisonments, and others by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the Sentence of Praemunire, to the loosing their Estates, and remaining Prisoners during Life, and others have sustained great losses and damages for want of taking of Oathes in Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, <hi>&amp;c</hi> whereby they could not clear the Titles of their Lands, nor prove their Debts, and thereby have lost them; and many Books have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and published by the said People against Swearing in any case, particularly that called, <hi>A Treatise of Oathes, containing several weighty Reasons why the People called</hi> Quakers <hi>refuse to Swear, and those confirmed by numerous Testimonies out of</hi> Gentiles, Jews <hi>and</hi>

Christians, <hi>both Fathers, Doctors and Martyrs. Presented to the King and Parliament in the Year</hi> 1675. and subscribed on the behalf of the rest of our Friends, by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and twelve more. Now we being, and desiring to remain in Unity with our faithful Friends, and with their living &amp; faithful Christian Testimony against Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any case, do hold ourselves obliged to maintain and stand up for the said Testimony, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.54. <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all.</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 5.22. <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, Swear not.</hi> Therefore we declare unto all People, that we cannot for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake take an Oath, or tender it to any other, neither in the form as used in <hi>England,</hi> by kissing the Bible, nor are we free in our Conscience to take that manner of Attestation as used here in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania,</hi> when administred in their Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz. <hi>Thou shalt solemnly declare in the Presence of God and this Court, &amp;c.</hi> because to say, <hi>I do solemnly declare in the Presence of God,</hi> is a calling upon God to be Witness to the truth of the Testimony given, which we look upon to be no less than a presumptuous Tempting of God to summon him as a Witness, not only to our Terrene, but Trivial Businesses, as W. P. &amp;c. hath expresly said in that before-cited Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, pag. 17. with which we do cordially agree. But to the grief of our Souls we may say, such Darkness, Ignorance and Apostacy pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth the hearts of many of those called <hi>Quakers</hi> here in <hi>Pennsilvania,</hi> that they are frequently found in the aforesaid Practices, and do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently use Arguments in the defence thereof; therefore we can do no less than to give forth this our Christian Testimony against <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fighting</hi> in any case, as above, hoping the Lord will be with us, and preserve us, and enable us to stand faithful in the aforesaid Testimony, whatever Tryals, Sufferings, Losses and Temptations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may attend us for the same.</p>
