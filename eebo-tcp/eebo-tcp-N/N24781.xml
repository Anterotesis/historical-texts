            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I CAN not reſiſt the feelings which impel me to ſeize this firſt, and perhaps only, opportunity, of publicly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to you my reſpect and affection.—To you I am indebted, not merely for life, but for inſtruction and example happily calculated to explain, and impreſs me with a ſenſe of, its value, and the ineſtimable purpoſes to which it may be applied. If, in my paſt or future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, any conformity to your deſires and precepts appear; if, by any paſt or future exertions of mine, the welfare of mankind be in any degree promoted; to your cares, to your vigilance, to your virtues, will it be owing. It is, therefore, a ſimple act of juſtice, to make my firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to you.—The panegyric of a poet, on his patron, may juſtly be ſuſpected; but who will venture to queſtion the ſincerity of a ſon, who dedicates to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents?—Nor need your modeſty be wounded, by this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mark of my eſteem. Should my conduct prove me worthy to claim relation to you, it will beſt pronounce your eulogy: my follies and my vices can only affect myſelf.— Accept then, my dear parents, this new proof of my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and filial love.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AN Author, of ſome reputation, has declared it as his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that every Preface ſhould be hiſtorical; and explain, not only the deſign of the work it precedes, but the circumſtances and motives which led to its compoſition. It would ill become me to controvert a doctrine ſo convenient for my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Authors, it is true, are apt to meaſure the reſpect of others for their productions, by the eſtimation in which they are held by themſelves. In this they may be, and often are, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Yet, perhaps, they do not greatly err, when they ſuppoſe the hiſtory of their performances would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to thoſe who have thought the performances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of their attention. Such an error, at leaſt, is venial; and will, I hope, be pardoned by thoſe who may deem the ſucceeding ſtatement unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>The principal ſcenes of the following Drama were compoſed in March, 1791; as an exerciſe, to beguile the wearineſs of a ſhort period of involuntary leiſure; and without any view to theatrical repreſentation. From that time, till the month of October, 1793, they lay neglected, and almoſt forgotten. An accident then bringing them to recollection, ſeveral ſhort ſcenes were added, agreeable to my original deſign; and the whole adapted to the Stage. The piece was preſented to the <hi>then</hi> Managers of The Old American Company, for their acceptance, the December following; but the peculiar ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Theatre prevented any attention to this application, till June, 1794; when, on a change in the management, it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032843_0005_0FF5B6A4150D09C0"/>
was accepted. An interval of ſix months, and a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Stage, had convinced me that the Piece might undergo alterations, with advantage. Theſe were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, immediately: the loſs of a comic character, which was now rejected, was ſupplied by two new ſcenes; addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſongs were compoſed; and a Drama of two acts, in proſe, was converted into the Opera, in its preſent form, in the courſe of the ſucceeding month. The inherent defects of the plan were ſuch as could not be remedied, without beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſubject a degree of attention incompatible with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional engagements; and which I, therefore, thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſtified in withholding. But ſhould this performance meet the ſame generous indulgence, in private, with which it was received, in public, I ſhall neither attempt to diſarm Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm of her ſeverity, nor be aſhamed of this feeble effort to contribute to the rational amuſement of my fellow-citizens.</p>

                  <hi>P. S.</hi> It may not be improper to obſerve, (though the reader can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed uninformed, in this particular,) that the firſt, ſecond, third, fifth and ſixth ſongs, in the third Act of the following Drama, are from Goldſmith; and all, except the firſt, from the Ballad of "Edwin and Angelina." I have taken the liberty to make a ſlight alteration in the ſecond, to accommodate it more perfectly to my purpoſe; and it will be obvious that, in the principal ſcene between Edwin and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelina, I have availed myſelf of the ſentiments, and, as far as poſſible, of the very expreſſions of the Author.</p>
