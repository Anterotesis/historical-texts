            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>HISTORY no where informs us of any event ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as the late revolution in France.—If viewed on all ſides, with its attending circumſtances, by an attentive and unprejudiced eye, it muſt ſurely excite the greateſt aſtoniſhment; and thoſe who have been uſed to unite in their mind; the providence of God with human occurrences, (whether they approve of this great change of things or not) cannot help inquiring, <hi>Is this from men, or is it from God?</hi> Is it one of thoſe commotions produced by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting paſſions of men, that riſe and ſink, and are ſoon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? or is it one of thoſe events which mark the great eras of time, and from which originate now orders of things?—If the latter, it is undoubtedly the theme of prophecy.</p>
            <p>Appearances indicate that this will be a fatal ſtroke to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal uſurpations, and the reign of deſpotiſm. Thoſe prophecies therefore which direct our hopes to that intereſting period, when all antichriſtian tyrannies are to periſh, deſerve at this time, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar attention. But where ſhall we find a clue to guide us in our inquiries? The author of the following thoughts conſulted commentators the moſt generally approved, on the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation of John. He ſound much to edify and to excite curioſity, but was ſtill in the midſt of a wilderneſs. At length he was determined to commit himſelf to his own inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and explore theſe regions of wonders, without placing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit confidence in any guide. Circumſtances led him to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the beaſt which John ſaw coming up out of the earth was <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth,</hi> or the French tyranny, perfected by him; and that it was this beaſt which ſlew the witneſſes. This is the clue which he has followed, and he thinks it is that by which the mazes of theſe wonderful viſions, at leaſt as far as they have been accompliſhed, may be traced with preciſion, and ſome things, which are yet to come, be conjectured with great advantage. But without this to guide us, all is confuſion.</p>
            <p>A ſerious application to the ſtudy of the prophecies, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive obſervation of the ſigns of the times, have produced in my mind the ſtrongeſt perſuaſion that the utter downfal of the papacy, the final overthrow of deſpotiſm, the reſioration of the Jews and
<pb facs="unknown:046985_0003_10228961282DA500"/>the renovation of all things, are near at hand; and that every year will aſtoniſh us with new wonders. <hi>"As the days of Noe were, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away, ſo ſhall alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of Man be."</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxiv. 37, 39.</note> From this perſuaſion ariſes the indiſpenſible duty of calling the attention of mankind, with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar earneſtneſs to the things which belong to their peace. <hi>"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and ſound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand."</hi>

            <p>I know what an author, who writes on ſubjects like theſe, has to expect. But my heart tells me, that I publiſh theſe thoughts with the pureſt intentions, and that my only aims are to ſerve the intereſts of Chriſtianity, to promote the welfare of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen and the common cauſe of humanity, by inviting men to conſider <hi>the ſigns of the times;</hi> that, as <hi>individuals</hi> and as a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we may examine our ways; <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>reform,</hi> and that thus the divine diſpleaſure may be averted, and <hi>that</hi> conſtitution, which has ſecured to this empire, ſo many bleſſings, to which moſt other nations are ſtrangers, may be purified and ſtrengthened, and by theſe means be continued to our poſterity. I do therefore moſt fervently pray that God may ſucceed this feeble attempt, and bleſs <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>all men</hi> with peace.</p>

            <head>PREVIOUS THOUGHTS.</head>
            <p>THE kingdom which God was to ſet up under the Meſſiah, according to the prophets, was to be a kingdom of righteouſneſs, peace and joy. <hi>"Unto us a child is born—the government ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulder—Of the increaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end.—The wolf and the lamb ſhall feed together. He ſhall ſpeak peace to the heathen,"</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. ix. 6 and 7.</note> who have long been the prey of deſtroyers, and of one another. If we contemplate the principles of the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, they promiſe fair to produce the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that which the prophets predicted. But where is the effect? The annals of the Chriſtian world, as well as thoſe of the pagan, diſcover to us little more than the hiſtory of ambition, ſuperſtition, and bloodſhed. The career of this kingdom began in piety towards God, and in love and peace to all mankind. But ſyſtems of error, ſuperſtition, and oppreſſion, ſoon interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its progreſs, and perverted its principles. Chriſtianity has been converted into a ſyſtem of commerce, and thoſe called the miniſters of Chriſt, have been a corporation of traders, in the ſouls and liberties of mankind.</p>
            <p>Were I to attempt to define the character of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I ſhould ſay, <hi>It is all that which oppoſes itſelf to the kingdom of Chriſt, whether it flow from the eccleſiaſtical or civil powers.</hi> The civil conſtitutions of nations, as well as the eccleſiaſtical, ſo far as they accord with or have a tendency to promote that pride and that ambition which lead to oppreſſion, perſecution, and war, are antichriſtian. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in religion is deſtructive of union among Chriſtians, which leads to domination over conſcience, to hinder free enquiry after truth, or any way oppreſſes and perſecutes men for matters cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zable only by God; is antichriſtian. Wherever there is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, —wherever we find conditions of communion among Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians impoſed, which Chriſt hath not clearly enjoined; whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever creeds and modes of worſhip are enforced by human power; wherever men are made to forfeit any of their civil rights, or are ſtigmatized, on account of their religious creeds; in what caſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one Chriſtian, or ſect of Chriſtians, aſſumes the ſeat of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and judgment in the church of Chriſt; whether they call for fire to deſtroy thoſe who different from them, or only exclude them from their communion and affection, there is a portion of that ſpirit
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:046985_0005_10228965697989D8"/>of Antichriſt which has ſo long oppoſed itſelf to the benign principles of the kingdom of the Prince of Peace. To this ſource it may be eaſy to trace innumerable evils, nor can it be doubted but that this has been the occaſion of making the inconſiderate eſteem the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able religion of Jeſus, as a ſource of miſchief inſtead of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence! Alas, how much of this ſpirit remains amongſt us all! How few have learned that<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. vii. 19.</note> 
               <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt circumciſion is nothing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are aſſured from the ſcriptures, that all theſe uſurpations and antichriſtian principles ſhall have an end; and that the goſpel ſhall produce the various happy effects which are predicted. The religion of Chriſtians ſhall then no longer conſiſt in<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 17.</note> 
               <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink, but in righteouſneſs, peace and joy;</hi> the practice of <hi>juſtice;</hi> the cultivation of <hi>harmony,</hi> and the diffuſion of <hi>happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The queſtion is, When may we hope to ſee theſe predictions accompliſhed? Long have a pious few had their eyes fixed on the promiſes of God, with ardent expectation, and been crying, <hi>"How long, O Lord, ere thou wilt avenge the blood of thy ſaints, and create J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem a quiet dwelling place, and Zion the joy of all the earth! Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly!—Behold I come at an hour when ye think not! bleſſed is he that watcheth."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some ſuppoſe, that in vain are our enquiries about the time of the accompliſhment of the predictions relative to the downfal of Antichriſt, which is to prepare the way for the peaceful kingdom of the Redeemer. If ſo, wherefore is it ſaid, <hi>"Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy?"</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. i. 3.</note> 
               <hi>"Here is wiſdom, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt."</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">xiii. 8.</note> Though the meaning of the prophecies is neceſſarily wrapt up in modes of expreſſion not eaſily to be underſtood, as they would otherwiſe operate againſt their own accompliſhment; yet they may not be abſolutely inſcrutable; and eſpecially when their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment approaches nearer, and increaſing light is caſt upon them by the ariſing of circumſtances connected with them, which ſeems in Dan. xii. and 9, to be predicted.</p>
            <p>Much has my mind been of late affected with the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things in the Chriſtian world, and with the occurrences which have, within theſe few years, burſt upon us.—Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which are unparalleled in the hiſtory of nations.</p>
            <p>In America a revolution has taken place which is ſingular in its conſequences, and eſpecially as they concern the ſtate of religion. We have long been told that if the Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were left unprotected by eſtabliſhments, and unſupported by emoluments, it would ſoon be borne down, and all its ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties forſaken and deſpiſed. The experiment has now been made,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:046985_0006_1022896A04A81F98"/>and fact demonſtrates the fallacy of ſuch concluſions. The people are eaſed of a heavy burden, and pure and undefiled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion flouriſhes more than ever. Hirelings have withdrawn, but piety and virtue, charity and union increaſe. But a few years after this grand event, one of the firſt nations in Europe, long enſlaved, and blinded by ſuperſtition, at once broke its chains, and tore away the bandages with which popiſh prieſts had bound the eyes of the multitude. Civil liberty had long been forgotten, and for more than a hundred years, no liberty of conſcience was permitted to the inſulted people. And as a nation, they had for ages been made, by their tyrants, the ſcourge of all their neighbours. This people have, to the aſtoniſhment of the whole civilized world, aroſe up as in one day, and, in oppoſition to the combined power of their king, their prieſts, and nobles, have dared to ſay, <hi>We will be free—We will have juſt and equal laws—No man ſhall puniſh—No man ſhall be puniſhed but as the law commands—The poor no leſs than the rich, ſhall be protected—Conſcience is the property of God, and every man ſhall worſhip his Maker as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes —We will never make war, but in ſelf-defence, and will embrace all men as our brethren.</hi> And this was not the reſolution of a few, it was the ſolemn covenant of twenty-ſix millions of people. What a phaenomenon in the hiſtory of man! What an epoch in the hiſtory of the church! But deſpots and their creatures, whoſe exiſtence depends on the ignorance and ſervility of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, fearing the influence of ſuch an example, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting all their power to cruſh this riſing ſpirit of liberty, and to ſupport the falling papacy. But by whoſe hand was it, let me aſk, that they and their remnant were driven back with loſs and ſhame? By His, who maketh <hi>the wrath of man to praiſe him.</hi> —Alas! the calamities which oppoſition to the moſt benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſentiments has occaſioned! The paſſions of men have been enraged, and in the paroxiſm of reſentment fear and deſpair, the beſt of cauſes, the cauſe of liberty, has been ſtained by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of crimes which afflict a great majority of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the genuine friends of liberty and juſtice through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. Who can contemplate them but with the keeneſt anguiſh, thoſe only excepted who are watching for occaſions to ſlander all who reſiſt oppreſſors? The circumſtances of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful revolution, mark it as an event of vaſt importance, and as probably big with conſequences beyond all conjecture.</p>
            <p>The prophecies reſpecting the downfal of the Antichriſtian aſurpations, muſt have their accompliſhment in ſome era, it may be the preſent. It is therefore ſurely worth our while to enquire how far the predictions of God's word will agree with the riſe and progreſs of known events.</p>

Thus it has appeared to me, and the more I have examined and thought upon the ſubject, the more clearly do I ſeem to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that the laſt days ſpoken of by God's ſervants the prophets, are faſt approaching; <hi>"when Babylon the great ſhall come in remen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and God will avenge the blood of his ſaints, and the kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt;"</hi> by not only profeſſing the religion of Jeſus, but acting under its influence and copying after <hi>his</hi> example who was meek and lowly in heart, and who came "not to deſtroy men's lives but to ſave them."—Not a kingdom of anarchy, but a ſtate of things, in which the governors and the governed, and all the different ranks in ſociety will unite to promote the general good. It is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the preſent ſhaking of nations ſhould bring about this deſirable event. Some however object that the progreſs of the French revolution has been marked with too much outrage and blood; and that the perſons engaged in it are of a character too bad to admit it to be from God,—a work which he approves, and which he intends, as the introduction to thoſe happy days of which the prophets have ſpoken. But granting that the leaders in the French revolution have been as atrociouſly wicked as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, this does not in the ſlighteſt degree, affect our hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. What was <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> who began our reformation? A monſter! What were his motives? the gratifications of his luſts. What were the means which he employed.—How blind is man! We only know that in God dwell the attributes of wiſdom, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and goodneſs, but we are incapable of tracing the ſphere of their operations. He ſaw fit to make uſe of the Jewiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſyſtems of ſuperſitition and tyranny to be overthrown by a few ſmooth words of benevolence and wiſdom? Happy if they could! Are the dragon and the beaſts, which have ſo depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the earth for ages, to periſh without convulſion? Read,—<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 6.</note> 
               <hi>"They have ſhed the blood of ſaints and prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink for they are worthy."</hi> When this period ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive there will be much work to do, for the execution of which the meek of the earth are by no means qualified. To cenſure diſorder, to ſhudder at bloodſhed, and to practiſe mercy, is our duty; for neither God's ſecret counſels, nor his providential judgments, are to be the rule of our conduct. We know who hath ſaid, <hi>"Love your enemies, and do good to them that hate you."</hi> This is our rule.</p>
            <p>The French revolution then may be of God, and deſigned to iſſue in good, although diſgraced by outrages which nothing can juſtify.</p>

            <head>FIRST INQUIRY.</head>
            <p>IN endeavouring to make good this hypotheſis, that <hi>the ſigns of the times</hi> indicate the ſpeedy downfal of all that ſpiritual and civil tyranny, which for ſo many ages, has prevailed in oppoſition to the principles of the kingdom of Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, there are three Inquiries which claim our attention.</p>
            <p>The firſt reſpects the <hi>dragon</hi> and the <hi>beaſts,</hi> which John ſaw in his viſions. Rev. xi. 7. xii. and xiii.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reſpects the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> Rev. xi. and the third Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, Whether all the numbers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> which refer to the latter days, will agree with the preſent times? Let us, with that reverence and devout candor which become us when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the word of God for inſtruction, attend to theſe ſeveral Inquiries.</p>
            <p>The grand ſcene of the prophetic viſion of John opens in the <hi>fourth chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and is continued to the end of the book. The whole may be conſidered as a number of ſcenic pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Chapter the eleventh</hi> is a miniature picture of the hiſtory of the church from the earlieſt times to the downfal of all antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian uſurpations. The following viſions are the ſame picture vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egated, for our inſtruction, on a larger ſcale.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider the viſions in the twelfth and thirteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and eſpecially the viſion of the ſecond beaſt, chap. xiii. and 11. for, if theſe be underſtood, we ſhall have a key to unlock, not only the myſteries of the eleventh chapter, but of many oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which follow. Chapter xii. 3. <hi>"And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold, a great red dragon, having ſeven heads and ten horns, and ſeven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the ſtars of heaven, and did caſt them to the earth,"</hi> &amp;c. Moſt of the authors whom I have conſulted, though they allow this chapter to contain a repreſentation of the perſecutions of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Rome, yet have ſtrangely ſpiritualized this dragon, ſo that whilſt we are cautioned of our danger from inviſible ſpirits, the true object is forgotten, and we beat the air.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt, but the devil is a principal agent in all tyrannies, eccleſiaſtical and civil; but what is here repreſented by the moſt terrifie imagery appears to be no other than that cruel ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil tyranny of the Romans, which caſt down all the powers, and ſwept away all the remains of liberty in Europe, the then ſuppoſed third part of the world; and which, while the imperial head remained in full power, perſecuted with unrelenting cruelty, the church of Chriſt in its infancy; and under all the deſpotims
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:046985_0009_1022896FDD08CCE0"/>which have ariſen from it, has more or leſs, continued to oppoſe the kingdom of Chriſt. This dragon, therefore, repreſents the civil tyranny exerciſed by the Roman Emperors, and by their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in the ſeveral kingdoms which have ariſen out of the ruins of that empire; and ſpecially by thoſe who are now called the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of Germany,</hi> who profeſs, more immediately, to ſucceed the deſpots of ancient Rome. While the firſt beaſt, in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is the repreſentation of <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual</hi> tyranny, this dragon repreſents <hi>civil</hi> tyranny. They have the ſame origin, and their juriſdiction is alike extenſive, and hence they both appear with ſeven heads and ten horns. This dragon, we ſhall find, gave to the beaſt his power and his ſeat, and great authority; but he ſtill continued, and although wounded, remains to this day, nor has he ever ceaſed to practiſe deſtruction. All the world have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped <hi>him</hi> that gave power unto the beaſt; yea, ſo baſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile have men been, that they have paid divine homage and paſſive obedience to their deſtroyer, and have ſaid, in the fulneſs of their folly, not only of ſpiritual tyranny, Who is like unto the beaſt! but of civil deſpotiſm, Who is like unto the dragon!</p>

Thus far, I think, the likeneſs is perfect; and allowing <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. or the French tyranny, brought to perfection by him, to be the object of the viſion, it appears eaſy to be underſtood; but on every other hypotheſis, which I have ſeen, it is encumbered with inexplicable difficulties. Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi> ſays, <q>What the image of the beaſt is, diſtinct from the beaſt itſelf, I confeſs I know not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This part of our Inquiry upon which matters of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance are ſuſpended, will I hope be attentively conſidered; as likewiſe whatſoever concerns this <hi>ſecond</hi> beaſt and the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the tyrannic proceedings of <hi>Lewis</hi> to the character and conduct here predicted. The fact here contended for being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we have a maſter key to unlock the greater part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies before us, particularly that in the <hi>eleventh chapter</hi> from ver. 7. And even ſuch leſſer myſteries as thoſe contained in chapter xvi. and 2. where the firſt vial is poured out upon two deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions of men; upon them who have the <hi>mark</hi> of the beaſt, <hi>papiſis;</hi> and upon thoſe who only <hi>worſhip</hi> or <hi>ſerve</hi> his <hi>image,</hi> thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who yield aſſiſtance to the antichriſtian party in France.</p>
            <p>"<hi>And he cauſed all, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their forehead, and that no man might buy or ſell ſave he that had the mark,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It was cuſtomary to mark ſlaves and ſoldiers with ſome impreſſion on the hand or forehead, that it might be known to what maſter or commander they belonged: and it was a practice alſo with devout idolaters to mark themſelves with the ſignature of the god they worſhipped. To theſe cuſtoms, it is not to be queſtioned, there is here an alluſion.</note>

It is the pleaſure of Heaven, that it ſhould be enveloped in conſiderable obſcurity. I make no pretenſions to critical acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but it appears to me that here are two conditions repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of enjoying the loweſt rights of citizens, unlimited ſubmiſſion to the authority of the church, the Pope and his clergy; and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience to the deſpotiſm of this ſecond beaſt. Where theſe were refuſed no man might buy or ſell. With this deſcription the<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>To exclude mankind from <hi>any</hi> of their <hi>civil</hi> rights, for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to matters of conſcience, and to gratify a party, that that party, in return, may ſupport the views of ambitious men, is of the dragon and the beaſt; but that to pleaſe the prieſthood, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en deſpotiſm, a man for being a Proteſtant ſhould be excluded from acting as a cuſtom-houſe officer, a ſtage-coachman, or a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:046985_0015_102289838F531880"/>was a moſt wanton exerciſe of antichriſtian power indeed; and this was the exact caſe in the matter under conſideration, for not only <hi>Lewis,</hi> but <hi>Mazarine,</hi> his miniſter, and the other petty deſpots about the throne, found their account in theſe proceedings. In this manner did they get rid of a body of men who were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemies to their ſchemes of ambition. The court gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the prieſts, and in return, the prieſts ſupported court meaſures, and helped <hi>Lewis,</hi> not only to get rid of theſe friends to liberty and juſtice, but alſo to cruſh the Parliaments, which till now poſſeſſed conſiderable power.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we count the number of the name of the beaſt? <hi>No man might buy or ſell ſave he that had the mark, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name. Here is wiſdom, let him that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding count the number of the beaſt, for it is the number of a man.</hi> Not to ſpecify particularly what others have ſaid about this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, there are two ways of calculating it which agree with <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourteenth, as the perſon in whom the French monarchy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a perfect beaſt. And the text ſuggeſts that there ſhould be two, the <hi>number of the beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>number of his name.</hi> The nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meral letters in the name of <hi>Lewis,</hi> as written in Latin give 666.

            <p>It was to be the <hi>number of the name</hi> of the beaſt, and the <hi>number of a man,</hi> or of a man's name.</p>
            <p>Although ſo much ſtreſs is not, perhaps, to be laid upon the following way of calculating this number of the ſecond beaſt, yet it is worth taking notice of; and poſſibly the Holy Spirit might point out that, by a remarkable providence, a twofold way of counting this number ſhould be afforded, that thus the identity of the perſon and tyranny, might be aſcertained with the greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Of this I ſhall ſay nothing, but leave every one to his own judgment. The firſt way of calculating aſcertains <hi>the name of the man</hi> who ſhould bring the tyranny to perfection, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:046985_0016_10228985508AC590"/>the <hi>length of time</hi> it ſhould be in perfecting; ſince the anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that man began it. And on examination we find, that from the time when <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> ſeized the throne of France, to the time, when the French, under <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. began that career of blood, which, for many years, proved ſo calamitous to Europe, and eſpecially to the Proteſtants, was exactly 666 years. <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> ſeized the throne in 987, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. came to the throne, on the death of his father <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. in 1643, came to his majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in 1652, and in the following year war was made upon Spain. Here he begins to riſe above the ſurface of that bog in which his tyranny had been gendering for 666 years.</p>
            <p>Thus, if I am not deceived, there is every proof which can be expected, proof, which amounts much nearer to a demonſtration than is uſual on ſuch ſubjects, that the French monarchy, was the ſecond beaſt which came up out of the earth. And though I would guard againſt raſh confidence, I feel a perſuaſion which I cannot overcome, that this is the truth. And if it be, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which are united with it are to the laſt degree intereſting, both to the church and to mankind at large.</p>

The number of theſe witneſſes has in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral been but ſmall, yet, though they have propheſied in ſackcloth, God in his good providence, has always preſerved to mankind a ſucceſſion of both deſcriptions. Even wiſe and good men have not, perhaps, ſufficiently conſidered the worth and importance of the witneſſes of the latter deſcription, in fulfilling the great deſigns of God's goodneſs towards men; and hence they have almoſt always interpreted this prophecy as relating to the <hi>ſtate of religion</hi> only; as if the <hi>civil and political</hi> ſtate of men, were held in little conſideration by the Lord of the whole earth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Before I offer my interpretation of this number, there is one conſideration which claims a previous attention. On a careful examination, we ſhall find in all the predictions of the prophets, that although they give us aſſurance of the facts, yet the time of their accompliſhment is left in a ſtate of uncertainty. And even where dates are fixed, as in the predictions reſpecting the return of the Jews from Babylon, after 70 years captivity; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Meſſiah after 70 weeks, or 490 years; yet the commencement of theſe periods is involved in obſcurity, till light is thrown upon them by the event. It never was intended that men ſhould know with certainty when any future event is to take place, and this for an obvious reaſon. The prophecies, we ſhould remember, were deſigned not to gratify our <hi>curioſity,</hi> but ſo confirm our <hi>faith</hi> in the truth of the divine word, by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. And hence the neceſſity that theſe <hi>three days and a half</hi> ſhould have a different meaning from the common prophetic days, that thus the time might not ſo eaſily be aſcertained till the accompliſhment ſhould lead me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to their true intention. Were the prophecies ſo clear that every one could preciſely know the circumſtances and the time to which they refer, hindrances, if we may ſpeak thus, would be thrown in the way of God's deſigns, and, in many caſes, a check would be given to the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions and purſuits of men. All the latter part of the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, thinking people of all countries, were expecting the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the 1260 years, (the time of the beaſt's power.)

And on this ground, the idea of <hi>lunar days</hi> or months, ſeems a vaſt deal more feaſible.
<p>Originally, the Jews meaſured their months by the <hi>ſun,</hi> and then every month conſiſted of thirty days. But after they came out of Egypt they meaſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thirty</hi> multiplied by <hi>three,</hi> adding <hi>fifteen</hi> for the half day, makes 105. When this way of reckoning firſt occurred to my mind, I had no idea of the events which this number connected; for I did not recollect the year when the <hi>Edict of Nants</hi> was revoked. But looking over <hi>Quick</hi>'s <hi>Synodicon,</hi> I found it to be October 18th, 1685, to which if 105 be added, it brings us to 1790. Take off a few months, (if that ſhould be thought neceſſary,) for the event taking place before the half day is quite expired, and it brings us to 1789, when the witneſſes were to be quickened. Whether this may ſtrike others as it ſtruck me, when I firſt obſerved the coincidence, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; but, from this agreement of the number 105, with the time which elapſed between one of the greateſt perſecutions that was ever experienced by Chriſtians, and this wonderful revolution which has taken place, a thouſand ideas ruſhed upon my mind.

Black and conflicting clouds will darken the hemiſphere and obſcure our proſpect; but they will ſpend themſelves and vaniſh. But were we ſure that this event is what we conjecture, yet no man could ſay, how long it would be before the ſpirit of life from God would, in that larger degree, which we look for, enter into the witneſſes for goſpel truth; for they may be quickened with political life and yet remain ſome time with a ſmall ſhare of <hi>ſpiritual life.</hi> But,</p>

The <hi>eighteenth verſe</hi> obliges us to interpret it thus: <hi>The nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they ſhould be judged.</hi> The time when thou wilt avenge the blood which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants have ſhed—<hi>and deſtroy them which have deſtroyed the earth.</hi> The nations will be enraged at this change of things, and unite to oppoſe it, and great woes are to follow. Woes, which all deſcriptions of men, it is likely, will feel, that they may be brought to repentance; but which will, in their iſſue, fall chiefly upon the heads of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian oppreſſors, the upholders of the papacy. Now the angels begin to pour out the vials of the wrath of God; for, as we have already obſerved, this chapter contains a complicated viſion of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ong courſe of events, in miniature, which is afterwards illuſtrated by ſeveral diſtinct viſions on a larger ſcale.</p>
            <p>But before we enter upon the conſideration of the vials, permit me to adduce ſome authorities, which eſpecially if we conſider the time when they were written, more than a hundred years ago, tend very much to ſtrengthen the argument in favour of my hypotheſis, reſpecting the witneſſes; their ſlaying and reſurrection. The firſt I ſhall mention is <hi>Peter Jurieu,</hi> a French Proteſtant miniſter, whoſe works were publiſhed in Engliſh in 1687. He ſays, "The tenth part of the city which here fell, will, at ſome future time, appear to be the kingdom of France, where a revolution will take place about the year 1785, and a ſeparation from the papacy follow, when the names of Monks and Nuns, of Carmelites and Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Dominicans, &amp;c. ſhall periſh for ever, and all thoſe vain ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and armorial bearings, which ſerve for ornament and pride, ſhall vaniſh; and brotherly love make all men equal. Not that there ſhall be no diſtinctions, for it is not a kingdom of anarchy; but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall then be without bride and inſolence; without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and violence, and ſubjects ſhall obey their governors with an humble ſpirit." The time required, according to this author, after the quickening of the witneſſes, (<hi>i. e.</hi> from the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution) to deſtroy antichriſt, will be twenty or twenty-ſive years;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:046985_0028_102289A42F193488"/>and that it will take about ſeventy years more for the aboliſhing of ſects and parties among Chriſtians, and for the converſion of the Jews and Heathens. "And all this," he ſays, "cannot be brought about without confuſion and tumult. The popiſh empire cannot fall, but it muſt cauſe blood and a mighty noiſe." Thus far <hi>Jurieu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Goodwin, who wrote a hundred and fifty years ſince, in his <hi>Expoſition upon the Revelations, Part</hi> I. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. has a great deal which is as aſtoniſhing as it is appoſite to the preſent argument. He ſays, (ſect. 6.) "The ſaints and churches of France, God has made a wonder to me in all his proceedings towards them, firſt and laſt; and there would ſeem ſome great and ſpecial honour reſerved for them, yet at the laſt; for it is certain, that the firſt light of the goſpel, by that firſt and ſecond angels preaching in <hi>chapter the fourteenth</hi> (which laid the foundation of antichriſt's ruin) was out from among them, and they bore and underwent the great heat of that morming of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, which was as great, if not greater than any ſince.—And ſo, as that kingdom had the firſt great ſtroke, ſo now it ſhould have the honour of having the laſt great ſtroke in the ruin of Rome."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5th, he ſays, on <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. "By the earthquake here is meant a great concuſſion or ſhaking of ſtates politics, or eccleſiaſtical.— The effect of this earthquake and fall of this tenth part of the city, is killing <hi>ſeven thouſand of the names of men.</hi>—Now, by men of name, in ſcripture is meant men of title, office and dignity.—As in the caſe of Corah's conſpiracy, ſo here a civil puniſhment falls upon theſe. For having killed theſe witneſſes, themſelves are to be killed (haply) by being bereſt of their names and titles, which are to be rooted out for ever, and condemned to perpetual forgetfulneſs."</p>
            <p>The ſingular agreement of preſent events with what theſe authors foretold, from the prophecies, ſo many years ago, is a circumſtance which merits the ſerious attention of all wiſe and conſiderate men; for it certainly adds great weight to the conjecture, that what has taken place in France, is the beginning of the final downfal of the papal uſurpations and tyrannies. And if it ſhould be ſo—woe be to them, who attempt to uphold what God has willed to fall! In the ordinary wars which nations have waged, they have, perhaps, loſt one or two hundred thouſand lives, and ſlaughtered as many of their enemies; countries have been laid waſte, and taxes incurred to the oppreſſion of the induſtrious; but in other reſpects they may have ſat down much as they were; but, if the preſent conteſt be what there is reaſon to ſuſpect it; not merely a war of <hi>man</hi> againſt <hi>man;</hi> but of <hi>God</hi> againſt <hi>antickriſtian uſurpations</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> the iſſue to thoſe who oppoſe his deſigns, muſt be different.

Let us now revert to the queſtion, What are to be the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the reſurrection of the witneſſes? Soon after it, the ſeventh trumper is to ſound, which is the ſignal for the ſeven angels to pour out their vials of God's wrath upon the antichriſtian kingdom.— Has this ſeventh trumpet been blown? Is it ſounding? Or is it about to ſound for the angels to prepare to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>As to the gathering of the vintage in the fourteenth chapter, it appears to me, that it properly falls under one or more of the vials, and as Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> has well explained it, ſeems to be a viſion of the vengeance which is to be executed upon the Proteſtant party; for the wine-preſs is ſaid be trodden <hi>without the city, i. e.</hi> without the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or reach of the city of Rome; and is repreſented in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate viſion, on purpoſe to ſhew that vengeance will fall even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch kingdoms and nations as had caſt off the Pope's ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Dr. <hi>Gill</hi> and others have ſuppoſed, that the Proteſtant nations will again return to Popery, and perſecute with great violence. But Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s idea is more probable.

D. 2130, which appears too far; for, ſuppoſing the 1260 years power of the beaſt, predicted in the Apocalypſe, were to be calculated from the time when the Pope became a temporal prince from the <hi>exarchate of Ruvenna</hi> being given to him by Pepin A.

            <p>In Dan. XII. we have three different numbers. (The firſt agrees with that in chap. vii. 25.)

            <p>But how can we reconcile thoſe three different numbers of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, with the ſeven (two in Daniel and five in the Apocalypſe) which agree?</p>

               </gap>f thoſe heathen nations, not before gathered to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But, perhaps, it may be aſked, What arguments are there which favour the conjecture of the 529th year of Chriſt being that from which the power of the beaſt is to be dated? I own I have put this year down by accident, as the meaſurement back from 1789. To demonſtrate, that in this year, he came to ſuch a ſtate of maturity (for he was in embryo in the apoſtles days, and continued to grow for ages) as to conſtitute him a beaſt, is not eſſential to the making good our hypotheſis. But though no man, from the hiſtory of paſt times, can determine the exact year from which God dates the kingdom of antichriſt, yet there are good reaſons from which a probable conjecture may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that it was as early as the <hi>ſixth</hi> century. Some of our moſt able critics, as <hi>Biſhop Newton</hi> and <hi>Mr. Lowman,</hi> are of opinion, that by the wound which the firſt beaſt received, chap. xiii. 3. we are to underſtand the blow which was given to the majeſty and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:046985_0040_102289C26FB00200"/>power of Rome, by ſubjecting it to the exarchate of Revenna, and that by its being healed, is intended, its reſtoration to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dignity by this exarchate being given to the Pope, by which he became a temporal prince. Now, this wounding took place A. D. 568, and continued 206 years. If this be well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it tends much to ſtrengthen our argument. But farther to confirm our hypotheſis, conſider the ſtate of ſociety, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the ſtate of what was called the church, in this ſixth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. Magiſtrates were tyrants, and prieſts were wicked, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and intolerant beyond any former age. Now, numberleſs laws and regulations were obtruded upon the church by human authority, which at once violated the authority of Chriſt, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtianity, and robbed Chriſtians of their deareſt liberties. And in this very year 529, which we are looking for, the <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an code</hi> was firſt publiſhed, by which thoſe powers, privileges and immunities were ſecured to the clergy; that union perfected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things civil and eccleſiaſtical, and thoſe law, impoſed on the church, which have proved ſo injurious to Chriſtianity, and ſo calamitous to mankind. And which code, through the zeal of the clergy, has been received, more or leſs, as the foundation of the juriſprudence of almoſt every ſtate in Chriſtendom; and that not only in things <hi>civil,</hi> but <hi>eccleſiaſtical;</hi> and by this means, as ſome author has obſerved, the old fancy of the Romans, about the eternity of their command, is thus far verified.</p>
