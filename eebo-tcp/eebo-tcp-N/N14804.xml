            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ELIZABETH RUTGERS AGAINST JOSHUA WADINGTON.</head>
            <p>THIS was an action of treſpaſs brought againſt the Defendant upon an act of the Legiſlature of this ſtate, paſſed the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of March, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-three, for the occupation of a brew-houſe and malt-houſe of the Plaintiff, from the thirteenth day of Auguſt, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-eight, until the time of paſſing the act above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. The cauſe came on to be argued upon demurrer, before the Honorable James Duane, Eſq. Mayor, Richard Varrick, Eſq. Recorder, Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Blagge, William W. Gilbert, William Neil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Thomas Randal, and Thomas Ivers, Eſquires, Aldermen, on Tueſday the twenty-ninth day of June paſt.</p>
            <p>The Counſel for the Plaintiff, were Mr. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, aſſiſted by the Attorney-General, Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cox, and Mr. Troupe. Thoſe for the Defendant,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018773_0004_0FA819175733E548"/>
were Mr. Hamilton, aſſiſted by Mr. B. Livingſton, and Mr. Lewis.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lawrence opened the pleadings and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the part of the Plaintiff, and was followed by Mr. Wilcox. Mr. Livingſton, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Hamilton, were next ſucceſſively heard, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Defendant; and were replied to by Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Troupe, and the Attorney-General. The arguments on both ſides were elaborate, and the authorities numerous.</p>
            <p>The Court took time to adviſe, until Tueſday the twenty-ſeventh day of Auguſt, and then the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Mayor proceeded to deliver the judgment of the Court, as follows:</p>
            <p>"IN the caſe of Elizabeth Rutgers, verſus Joſhua Waddington, which we gave notice ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined this day, the Court now proceed to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is repreſented to be a controverſy of <hi>high importance;</hi> from the <hi>value</hi> of the property, which in this and other actions depends on the ſame <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> from involving in it queſtions, which muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>national character:</hi>—Queſtions whoſe deciſion will record the ſpirit of our Courts to proſperity! Queſtions which embrace the whole law of nations!</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed, that a cauſe of this magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was not to receive its firſt impreſſion from a Court of ſuch a limited juriſdiction, as that in which we preſide;—from <hi>Magiſtrates actively</hi> engaged in eſtabliſhing the police of a diſordered city, and in other duties, which cut them off from thoſe ſtudious reſearches, which great and intricate queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

            <p>The Counſel on both ſides, who have managed this cauſe, and by whoſe diligence and abilities, ſo much learning, on an uncommon ſubject, hath been drawn into view, have ſpared us much labour.</p>
            <p>We cannot but expreſs the pleaſure which we have received, in ſeeing young gentlemen, juſt call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bar, from the active and honorable ſcenes of a military life, already ſo diſtinguiſhed as public ſpeakers, ſo much improved in an arduous ſcience.<note n="*" place="bottom">

uſe and occupy the ſaid malt-houſe and brew-houſe, from the ſaid 28th day of September 1778 incluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the laſt day of April 1780 incluſively: By virtue whereof they entered and occupied the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, from the firſt of the two laſt mentioned days to the laſt incluſively; and the Defendant as their ſervant and at their command, horn time to time, and at divers times rom the firſt to the laſt of thoſe days, entered into and occupied the ſaid brew-houſe and malt-houſe, for the benefit of the ſaid Benjamin and Evelyn; Quae eſt eadem &amp;c. whereof the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff complains, in the firſt count of her declaration.</p>
            <p>And as to the occupying the ſaid brew-houſe and malt-houſe, from the laſt day of April, 1780, to the 17th of March, 1783, he pleads over again the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of independence of theſe ſtates; the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thereof by the Convention of the ſtate; and the recognition and confirmation thereof by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; the conqueſt of the city of New-York by the Britiſh: And that the brew houſe and malt-houſe, being out of the poſſeſſion of the Plaintiff, the Commander in Chief of the ſaid army, on the laſt day of April, 1780, gave his licenſe and permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as by the laws of nations he might lawfully do) to the ſaid Benjamin and Evelyn (deſcribing them as in the other plea) to enter into and occupy the ſaid brew-houſe and malt-houſe, from the laſt day of April, 1780, until the ſaid licenſe and permiſſion ſhould be revoked; paying therefore to ſuch perſon as the Commander in Chief ſhould authorize to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame, at the rate of one hundred and fifty pounds for each year, in quarterly payments, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He then avers that they accordingly entered and occupied the ſaid brew-houſe and malt-houſe, on the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018773_0010_0FA8191D1E4D3F78"/>
1ſt day of May, 1780, and continued the occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof until the 17th day of March, 1783, till when the ſaid licenſe remained in force; and then avers as before, that he as their ſervant, and at their command, from time to time and at divers times, between the two laſt mentioned days, did enter and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the ſaid brew-houſe and malt-houſe, &amp;c, quae eſt eadem &amp;c. concluding with an averment, that the ſaid Benjamin and Evelyn did pay the ſaid one hundred and fifty pounds a year to John Smith, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the ſaid Commander in Chief to receive the ſame.</p>
            <p>For further plea to the whole of the treſpraſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of the ſtatute, the Defendant ſaith, that the Plaintiff actionem non &amp;c. Becauſe he ſaith, that after the paſſing the act of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this ſtate, in the declaration mentioned, to wit, on the 3d day of September, 1783, at &amp;c. a certain definitive treaty of peace, between the king of Great-Britain and his ſubjects, and the United States and the ſubjects and citizens thereof and of each of them, was entered into, made and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by plenipotentiaries on the part of the ſaid king and ſtates reſpectively (naming them) in virtue of full powers &amp;c. which definitive treaty, on the 14th day of January, 1784, at Annapolis, &amp;c. by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States of America in Congreſs, then and there aſſembled in due form, was ratified and confirmed; and afterwards on the ſame day, announced and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by proclamation under the ſeal of the United States, to all the good citizens of the ſaid United States; enjoining all magiſtracies, legiſlatures, &amp;c. to carry into effect the ſaid definitive treaty &amp;c. prout &amp;c. In virtue of which ſaid definitive treaty,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018773_0011_0FA8191E53FE9F30"/>
all right, claim, &amp;c. which either of the ſaid contracting parties, and the ſubjects and citizens of either of them might otherwiſe have had to any compenſation, recompence, retribution, or indemnity whatſoever, for or by reaſon of any injury, or damage, whether to the public or individuals, which either of the ſaid contracting parties, and the ſubjects and citizens of either might have done or cauſed to be done to the other, in conſequence of, or in any wiſe relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the war between them, from the time of the commencement to the determination thereof, were mutually and reciprocally, virtually and effectually, relinquiſhed, renounced and releaſed to each other &amp;c. —And he avers, as in his other plea, that from the time of his birth, and at all times ſince, he hath been and ſtill is a ſubject of the king of Great-Britain: And between the times in his plea mentioned, as a ſubject of the ſaid king, reſided in the city of New-York, uſing the art, trade, &amp;c. of a merchant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of the army of the ſaid king, then waging war againſt the ſaid ſtate; et hoc paratus eſt verificari: Wherefore he prays judgment whether the ſaid Plaintiff, her action againſt him ought to have or maintain; with this, that the ſaid Joſhua will verify that the whole of the treſpaſs by him ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be committed, is for certain acts &amp;c. by him ſuppoſed to have been done while he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding as a ſubject of the ſaid king, and under the protection of the army of the ſaid king, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>to the war</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The Plaintiff replies as to the plea of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, as to the reſidue of the treſpaſs, by him done as aforeſaid, by him above pleaded in bar, that ſhe by reaſon thereof ought not to be barred
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018773_0012_0FA8191F9927A6C8"/>
from her ſaid action; becauſe ſhe ſays, that by the act &amp;c. for granting a more effectual relief in caſes of certain treſpaſſes, in her declaration in part recited, it is alſo among other things enacted, that no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant or Defendants, ſhall be admitted to plead in juſtification any military order, or command what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of the enemy, for ſuch occupancy: And avers, that the ſaid Commiſſary-General and Commander in Chief were, at the time of giving the permiſſion or licenſe, ſubjects to the ſaid king of Great-Britain, the enemy mentioned and intended by the act afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and in the military ſervice of the ſaid king: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that the ſaid Joſhua hath acknowledged the treſpaſs by him done as aforeſaid, the ſaid Elizabeth prays judgment and her damages, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as to the further plea of the ſaid Joſhua, to the whole of the treſpaſs aforeſaid by him pleaded in bar, the Plaintiff demurs.</p>
            <p>And the Defendant on his part demurs to the plea of the Plaintiff laſt above pleaded.</p>
            <p>The pleadings cloſe with joinders in demurrer, in the uſual forms.</p>
            <p>From theſe pleadings, and the arguments which they have produced, three queſtions are preſented for our conſideration.—</p>
            <p n="1">Iſt. Whether the Plaintiff's caſe is within the letter and intent of the ſtatute on which this action is grounded?</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly. Whether the laws of nations give the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Defendant under them, rights which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the operation of the ſtatute and bar the preſent ſuit?</p>
            <p n="3">IIIdly. Whether there is ſuch an amneſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded or implied in the definitive treaty of peace, as virtually or effectually relinquiſhes or releaſes the Plaintiff's demand under the ſaid ſtatute?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018773_0013_0FA819205AE813A8"/>Under one or other of theſe heads, all the reaſons and authorities which have been offered on both ſides, may be properly applied:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Then we are to enquire, whether the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff's caſe is within the letter and intent of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, on which this action is grounded.</p>
            <p>From the conceſſions which ariſe out of the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we find, that according to the letter of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, ſhe was an inhabitant of this city, who by reaſon of the invaſion of the enemy, left her place of abode; and that ſhe hath not ſince voluntarily put herſelf into the power of the enemy; that the brew-houſe and malt-houſe in queſtion, were part of her real eſtate;
<q>that they were occupied by the Defendant as charged in the declaration, and at the time of ſuch occupancy, were in the power of the enemy:</q>
and nothing more is required to make Mrs. Rutgers a compleat Plaintiff, within the ſtatute.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of conteſting this point, the Defendant's counſel endeavour to ſhew, that according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Legiſlature, the ſtatute cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Defendant. For this purpoſe, they ſtrongly rely on his being a Britiſh ſubject, reſiding in this city as a merchant, under the protection of the Britiſh army, when the cauſe of action accrued.</p>
            <p>Without embarraſſing the queſtion <hi>at preſent</hi> with the privileges claimed for the Defendant, either from the temporary <hi>conqueſt</hi> of the city, or the <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive treaty,</hi>—which will hereafter meet with due attention —it ſeems proper to conſider ſimply, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the nature of the proviſion, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Defendant, he was <hi>intended</hi> to be included in the ſtatute, for if it doth not extend to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018773_0014_0FA8192126C50898"/>
him there is an end of the ſuit—if it doth extend, there will be a fair opening to examine—whether the temporary conqueſt, or the treaty of peace, operate as an extinguiſhment, or releaſe of the cauſe of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And here it will be proper to enquire into the <hi>occaſion</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of the ſtatute—the <hi>remedy</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides— and the <hi>rules</hi> by which it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued.</p>
            <p>The ſtatute was made at the eye of a war, when peace, and an evacuation of the ſouthern diſtrict, were like to take place. The object of it, as the title expreſſes, was for granting a more effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in caſes of certain treſpaſſes. The perſons who are to be redreſſed are the exiles, who were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to retire from their eſtates, on the invaſion of the ſouthern diſtrict: The perſons to be proſecuted, were thoſe who had occupied, injured, or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the real or perſonal eſtates of thoſe exiles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of the enemy: and it is provided, that every Defendant who had occupied, injured or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the property, ſhall be held to bail; and that no Defendant ſhall be admitted to plead in juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, any military order, or command of the enemy for ſuch occupation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This then is clearly a <hi>remedial law.</hi> Great pains have been taken on both ſides, to enforce the <hi>rules</hi> by which it ought to be expounded.</p>
            <p>The counſel for the Defendant urge, that a ſound legal diſcretion ought to be uſed in recurring to firſt principles; ſo as to make law a rule of right, and not a net to entangle juſtice. That <hi>Ratio eſt anima legis: et qui haeret in litera haeret in cortice;</hi> they point

            </p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018773_0016_0FA81923119AC278"/>In one point, both parties agree, that the advice of Plowden is moſt worthy of attention.
<q>In order, ſays he, to form a right judgment whether a caſe be within the equity of a ſtatute, it is a good way to ſuppoſe the law maker preſent, and that you aſked him the queſtion—did you intend to comprehend this caſe? Then you muſt give your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch anſwer as you imagine, he <hi>being an upright and reaſonable man,</hi> would have given. If this be, that he did mean to comprehend it, you may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold the caſe to be within the equity of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; for while you do no more than he would have done, you do not act contrary to but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the ſtatute.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reſult of all theſe rules is obviouſly this— that <hi>remedial laws</hi> are ſo to be expounded as to have their <hi>full force</hi>—in <hi>advancement</hi> of the <hi>remedy</hi>—upon an equitable interpretation—according to the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Legiſlature—to be ſought after by a <hi>ſound, legal diſcretion</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the impreſſion of theſe maxims, it is aſked whether the law <hi>intended</hi> to <hi>exempt,</hi> or to <hi>include</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under the circumſtances or deſcription of the Defendant.</p>
            <p>Here then is a Britiſh merchant, who merely for the purpoſe of commerce reſided in the city, while it was in the power of the Britiſh, for his own private accomodation: He was permitted by the <hi>Commiſſary-General,</hi> and afterwards by the Commander in Chief, to enjoy the Plaintiff's property for near ſix years: He has paid as a rent, one hundred and fifty pounds a year, for three years only of the term, to the order of the Britiſh Commander in Chief. He remains in the city, purſuing his buſineſs as a merchant, altho'
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018773_0017_0FA819239D8F17C8"/>
thoſe under whoſe protection he exerciſed his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are long ſince withdrawn.</p>
            <p>The temporary conqueſt and the definitive treaty out of the queſtion, what can exempt him from the deſcription of the ſtatute? Can any or all the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims laid down by his counſel for its conſtruction? Before aſſent is yielded to ſuch a propoſition, let us take a nearer view of his caſe as connected with his principals under whom he juſtifies.</p>
            <p>If they did not come to this country to join the military in its oppreſſion, and to enrich themſelves by its ſpoils—a ſuſpicion too diſhonorable to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained! If they reſided here under the protection of the Britiſh army, to purſue their <hi>private</hi> affairs as merchants—as their pleas avow, and we are bound to believe.—If for their <hi>private</hi> purpoſes, without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to or connection with the war, they occupied the Plaintiff's tenements, confeſſedly for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the time without any conſideration at all? why it is repeated ſhould they be exempted from this ſtatute?</p>
            <p>How, as applied to them perſonally and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of national conſiderations, can it be harder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon or juſtice, that they ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to pay an adequate rent for the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they have enjoyed? why ſhould they even wiſh to be exempted at the expence of a widow, driven into exile by the dread of a <hi>ſiege,</hi> or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a <hi>ſtorm?</hi> would not this be unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unjuſt? If, according to the advice of Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, we were to ſuppoſe ourſelves converſing with the members of the Legiſlature; that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant's caſe was fairly ſtated, as it in fact exiſted, at the moment of paſſing the ſtatute; and that they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018773_0018_0FA819242C23A6F0"/>
had been aſked whether they meant to comprehend ſuch a caſe, what would probably be their anſwer? there is no doubt in our minds but it would be in the <hi>affirmative.</hi> The ſpirit import general terms of the ſtatute; its deſign and the circumſtances which gave it birth, ſeem fully to juſtify this concluſion.</p>
            <p>Beſides that Legiſlature knew too well the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of war, to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Commiſſary-General</hi> of a Britiſh army had competent authority to grant the licenſe or permiſſion in queſtion: From the nature of his office the contrary would be preſumed, eſpecially when the pleas themſelves aver expreſsly,
<q>that the ſaid brew-houſe and malt-houſe, by <hi>virtue of authority from the Commander in Chief</hi> of the ſaid army, were taken poſſeſſion of by the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-General for <hi>the uſe of the ſaid army.</hi>
               </q>
The licenſe then from the Commiſſary to occupy thoſe tenements for the private purpoſes of the Defendant's employers was repugnant to the orders of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief; an encroachment on other depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for which there was no colour of right; and it is conſequently to be conſidered as a mere nullity. This had the facts been fully repreſented, the Legiſlature could not but have obſerved: To give it now its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per weight will be the duty of the court.</p>
            <p>As a circumſtance of much moment to the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant it is contended, that the <hi>obtaining and the occupancy</hi> of the tenements in queſtion, related to the war.</p>
            <p>In arguments, which diſplay great ſkill, and an uncommon degree of zeal and induſtry, this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing point is ſlightly touched.</p>
            <p>The <hi>relationſhip to the war</hi> reſults from the capture of the city, ſay the gentlemen, by which the right to the uſe of the lands veſted in the <hi>conqueror:</hi> His
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018773_0019_0FA81924DD2F4870"/>
authority to the Defendant to uſe it continues the relation, and by way of illuſtration this caſe is ſtated —
<q>a prize ſhip is condemned and ſold—the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer is a merchant: tho' this is a <hi>private ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on his part, yet the damage done was in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the war, and the ſale and purchaſe good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this is a remote argument indeed. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant here had no other agency than to purchaſe a prize lawfully condemned, in which, by the law of nations, the original owner no longer had any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the property being abſolutely and effectually changed. Can it then be ſaid with the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reaſon, that this purchaſe was an act which bore a relation to the war? it is true the original capture and the damage ſuſtained by it were conſequences of the war; but theſe circumſtances could produce no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionſhip between the act done by the merchant— The purchaſe, which is the true point—and the war.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>us</hi> ſuppoſe a caſe; a ſtatute paſſes to criminate every man within the power of the enemy, who had voluntarily done any act on the ſide of the enemy, in relation to the war; could this Defendant on the facts ſtated in the pleadings, have been convicted? Take up that part of the caſe, which would have been moſt unfavourable to him—his contract with the Britiſh commander: He hired the tenements from him; but it was for the purpoſe of his own <hi>private commerce:</hi> The rent which he paid contributed to ſtrengthen the hands of the enemy; but they had a right to raiſe contributions; they had a force to collect them, which could not be reſiſted. Here then is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of hoſtility or enmity, of a concern in or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the war. The moſt zealous of our friends, within their power, could have been compelled to be related to the war in this way: They muſt either
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018773_0020_0FA819259CA6EE30"/>
ſubmit to be accommodated on the terms of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, or to periſh in the ſtreets. Under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution then which we have ſuppoſed, the Defendant muſt have been acquitted.</p>
            <p>We muſt not be amuſed by high ſounding words —too much is attempted—if a conſtruction of the licenſe from the Britiſh commander to occupy the tenements for the three laſt years of the term, had depended <hi>abſtractedly</hi> on the voice of reaſon, we muſt have found it difficult to conceive how even ſuch a licenſe bore a <hi>relation to the war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here however, other conſiderations, which it will be premature to explain in this place, muſt have their weight.</p>
            <p>But when it is inſiſted that the remainder of the term for which the tenements were held under the bare unauthoritative permiſſion of the Commiſſary-General, had <hi>any relation to the war,</hi> it is altogether without foundation.</p>
            <p>We proceed now to the ſecond general head, in which it is propoſed:</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly. To enquire—whether the law of nations gives the captors, and the Defendant under them, <hi>rigths</hi> which <hi>controul</hi> the operation of the ſtatute, and <hi>bar</hi> the preſent ſuit?</p>
            <p>To maintain thoſe rights and that controul, the Defendant's counſel have entered into a large diſplay of the law of nations, its principles, diviſions, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and effects, and have pointed out the ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its authority, and the temerity and diſhonour, in a national view, of countenancing any act repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to it.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, one of the Plaintiff's counſel from a view of the contradictory opinions, which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018773_0021_0FA81926D70BDF30"/>
were read, ſeemed to think that this law afforded no rule of right, and ought to have no influence on the government of a people.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that the law of nations is a noble and moſt important inſtitution: The rights of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, and the happineſs of the human race, are promoted by its maxims and concerned for its vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
            <p>We hitherto have not been ſo loudly called upon to form and inculcate an extenſive knowledge of this intereſting ſcience; but now ſince we are placed in a new ſituation, as one of the nations of the earth, it is become an indiſpenſable obligation. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to revere the rights of human nature; at every hazard and expence we have vindicated, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully eſtabliſhed them in our land! and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reverence a law which is their chief guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian—a law which inculcates as a firſt principle— that the <note n="*" place="bottom">Principles of the Law of Nature, referred to.—That man was made for <hi>ſociety</hi>—that ſociety is abſolutely neceſſary for <hi>man</hi>—that the <hi>public good</hi> ought always to be the ſupreme rule—that the ſpirit of <hi>ſociability</hi> ought to be <hi>univerſal</hi>—that we ought to have the ſame diſpoſition towards other men, as we deſire they ſhould have towards us—that we ſhould behave in the ſame manner towards other men, as we would be willing they ſhould behave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in the like circumſtances—that we ſhould preſerve a benevolence even towards our <hi>enemies</hi>—that although the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of benevolence towards our enemies may from neceſſity be <hi>ſuſpended,</hi> yet we are not allowed to <hi>ſtifle</hi> its principle; that revenge introducing, inſtead of benevolence, a ſentiment of hatred and animoſity is condemned; becauſe ſuch a ſentiment is vicious in itſelf, and contrary to the public good.</note> amiable precepts of the law of nature, are as obligatory on nations in their mutual intercourſe, as they are on individuals in their conduct towards each other; and that every nation is bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all in its power to the happineſs and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others! What more eminently diſtinguiſhes the refined and poliſhed nations of Europe, from the piratical ſtates of Barbary, than a <hi>reſpect</hi> or a <hi>contempt</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018773_0022_0FA8192719B832B0"/>
for this law. Books therefore which treat of the law of nations have always been received with avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and applauſe.</p>
            <p>The principal authorities adduced in this cauſe, are from Grotius, Puffendorff, Wolfius, Burla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maqui and Vattel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">A profeſſor of the law at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>roningen.</note> in his book <hi>de jure belli et pacis,</hi> profeſſes to treat of but a ſmall part of the law of nations— marriage—the power of fathers —maſters—and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns—promiſes—contracts—oaths—treaties—ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors —burials—puniſhments—peace and war.</p>
            <p>Commentators have obſerved, that tho' this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated work contains many excellent precepts, it is neither methodical nor comprehenſive.</p>
            <p>Puffendorff next compoſed his treatiſe, <hi>de jure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae et gentium,</hi> in which we find more order, and great erudition: But it has been obſerved, that this work is not free from error, and that the author has not ſhewn how the civil does not deſtroy <hi>natural</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and that the <hi>latter</hi> only ſerves to perfect the <hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are informed, that to illuſtrate this was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by <hi>Wolſius;</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">The great Saxon philoſopher.</note> and after him by <hi>Burlamaqui.</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Profeſſor of civil and natural law at Geneva.</note> This laſt work, ſays a writer, is evidently rather an <hi>introduction</hi> than a <hi>ſyſtem;</hi> and it ſerved only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a deſire to ſee it continued with equal perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and elegance. The honor of this taſk was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the great Vattel, whoſe work is entitled to the higheſt admiration? He modeſtly takes Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius for his guide; but in numberleſs paſſages cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, abridges and improves him. What Wolfius has diffuſed into fourteen volumes, our author has contracted into one; at the ſame time that his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018773_0023_0FA81927D74FBA48"/>
are clear and ſatisfactory, and carry nothing of the dryneſs of an abridgment.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that the writers on the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are diſtinguiſhed philoſophers, of different countries and ages; ſome educated in <hi>republics;</hi> ſome in <hi>monarchies;</hi> ſome at a time when <hi>prejudice,</hi> and an ignorance of the rights of mankind prevailed; and others when <hi>philoſophy</hi> had refined the reaſon, and in ſome meaſure ſubdued the fiercer paſſions of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind.</p>
            <p>Hence it can be no more an objection or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the law of nations, than it is to any other ſcience (for all partake of imperfection)—that a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of ſentiments and opinions ſhould be diſcovered among different authors!—A further uſe intended by theſe obſervations, is to juſtify the preference, which we ſhall give to Mr. Vattel, in points where we ſhall find him at variance with other writers.</p>
            <p>But to return from this digreſſion, to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before us: It has been objected by one of the Plaintiff's counſel, that theſe ſtates are not bound by the <hi>cuſtomary and voluntary law of nations,</hi> any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as either of them, has adopted or engrafted them.</p>
            <p>But the objection has been fully anſwered: By our excellent conſtitution, the common law is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be part of the law of the land; and the <hi>jus gentium</hi> is a branch of the common law. <hi>In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica maxime conſervandi ſut jura belli,</hi> is an ancient adage.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Co L. p. 11, b. Black. 4, p. 67, Burr. 3 vol. p. 14 30.</note>The authorities cited on this point for the Defendant are full and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
            <p>Indeed if we ſhould not recogniſe the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018773_0024_0FA8192895338550"/>
neither ought the benefit of that law to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to us: and it would follow that out <hi>commerce,</hi> and our <hi>perſons,</hi> in foreign parts, would be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the great ſanctions, which it has enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—</p>
            <p>After being thus explicit, it is almoſt unneceſſary to touch a more limited queſtion, of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which has been debated in the courſe of the arguments, viz.</p>
            <p>Whether the common laws of war which apply to <hi>two great nations,</hi> apply to <hi>two great parts</hi> of the ſame nation?</p>
            <p>The manner in which Mr. Vattel treats this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is highly ſatisfactory; and humanity forbids, that his principles ſhould be ever called in queſtion!</p>
            <p>When a nation becomes divided into two parties abſolutely independent, and no longer acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common ſuperior, the ſtate is <hi>diſſolved;</hi> and the war betwixt the <hi>two parties,</hi> in every reſpect, is the ſame with that of a public war, <hi>between two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nations.</hi> Independent of each other, they can have no <hi>judge;</hi> like two different nations, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the <hi>ultima ratio regum</hi>—they decide the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel by arms—were it not for the reſtraints impoſed by the law of nations, ſuch a civil war would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion cruel and deſtructive. Haſty pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, in the moment of rage and animoſity, would mark its progreſs with injuſtice, ſlaughter and deſolation.</p>
            <p>But alas! have the reſtraints of that benevolent law protected our country in the late war, from the miſeries we have deſcribed? They have not!—Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance unreſtrained, and undiſtinguiſhed, hath been let looſe upon us in all her horrors!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:018773_0025_0FA81929B48F1018"/>But it is peace!—Let our injuries and our reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be buried forever in the definitive treaty!—</p>
            <p>What <hi>we</hi> have ſuffered cannot alter the common laws of war: they are founded upon reaſon and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and will prevail as long as reaſon and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are cultivated. As philoſophy and the love of mankind extend themſelves, theſe beneficial inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will, we truſt, be ſtill further improved, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the human paſſions, and mitigate the aſperities of war; till in the end hoſtilities ſhall be baniſhed from the world, as diſgraceful to our nature.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ancients it is remarked, were impreſſed with but a very faint idea of the law of nations. Some are of opinion, that it had its origin in the reign of Charlemagne, about the middle of the eighth century, before which time the nations of Europe, but little civilized, obſerved few treaties: Others fix it at a much later period, affirming that all knowledge of the ſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reign of Maximilian Iſt. (about the beginning of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury) is rather matter of curioſity than inſtruction. However ſince this laſt period, its progreſs hath been gradual, and its influence more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive.</note> But to return to the point.</p>
            <p>The words which follow, are the deciſion of Vat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, ſpeaking of the caſe before us—"The obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" ſays he,
<q>of obſerving the common laws of war,<note place="margin">Vatt. b. 3, p. 111, laſt clauſe of § 3.</note> is therefore <hi>abſolute indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to both parties; and the ſame which the law of nature <hi>obliges all nations</hi> to obſerve between ſtate and ſtate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here it is queſtioned, whether ſince the law of nations is obligatory, it may in any part be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a particular ſociety, ſo as to deprive a foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when reſiding in that country, of his appeal to them?</p>
            <p>The Defendant's counſel deny, that in <hi>theory,</hi> a particular ſtate hath ſuch a right. They raiſe this diſtinction, that where there is merely an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>local law,</hi> foreigners like all others, muſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018773_0026_0FA8192C20A1B6C8"/>
be judged by that law: But where the tranſaction originally affects a man's conduct, as <hi>a member of a foreign nation,</hi> he may appeal to the law of nations, and by that law, which is part of the law of the land, the thing muſt be decided.</p>
            <p>And they conſider the foederal compact as giving additional force to this reſtraint—</p>
            <p>In ſupport of this reaſoning, a paſſage from the elements of juriſprudence,<note place="margin">Elem. Juriſp. page 62.</note> is cited to this effect:</p>
            <p>"States like the individuals who compoſe them, are moral perſons, they have a public will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, are capable of natural and acquired rights, and ſuſceptible of reſpective obligations. The <hi>primary</hi> law of nations therefore is no other than the <hi>law of nature,</hi> ſo far as it is applicable to them. Whatever, in this behalf, reaſon dictates is a duty of natural juſtice, from the neceſſary law of nations."</p>
            <p>Thus far we could agree with the profeſſor, that to ſtate can by its ſeparate ordinance, prejudice any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſuch a law—nay, that all the ſtates of the world united could not; becauſe being of moral obligation, it is immutable. But when this doctrine is applied in general to all cuſtoms, which prevail <hi>by tacit conſent</hi> as part of the law of nations; we do not find that he is warranted by authorities.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Hook. ec. pol. b. 1. g. 10.</note>Hooker's ec. pol. not being at hand, we have not examined him.</p>
            <p>But Vattel treating of the <hi>neceſſary law of nations</hi>— which Grotius calls the <hi>internal law of nations,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others the <hi>natural law of nations,</hi> uſes theſe ſtrong expreſſions.</p>
            <p>"Since then the <hi>neceſſary law of nations</hi> conſiſts in the application of the law of nature to ſtates, and is
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018773_0027_0FA8192C556B71B8"/>
               <hi>immutable,</hi> as being founded on the <hi>nature of things,</hi>— and in particular on the nature of man: It follows, that the neceſſary law of nations is immutable, and whence, ſays he, as this law is immutable, the obligations that ariſe from it <hi>neceſſary and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable,</hi> nations can neither make any change in it, by their <hi>conventions,</hi> diſpenſe with it <hi>themſelves,</hi> nor <hi>reciprocally</hi> with reſpect to each other.</p>
            <p>The reſtraint then of which the lecturer ſpeaks is not perhaps ſo general, as he teaches; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Mr. Vattel, it ſeems only to be applicable to <hi>laws of moral obligation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vattel, p. 2 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now we know, that there are uſages of nations which are indifferent, and which, as Mr. Vattel ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, different ſtates may agree to eſtabliſh by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or introduce by cuſtom, at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to ſuch uſages, it might perhaps have been conſidered that every nation by the law of nature, is free and independent of all foreign and external controul; but if one nation muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, at all events, to uſages which ſhe cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, becauſe others may have thought fit to adopt them, her liberty would no longer remain entire.</p>
            <p>The uſage of ranſoming captures at ſea ſeems to have been dictated by a ſpirit of benevolence; it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured perſonal liberty; it afforded ſome alleviations to the misfortune of the captive merchant and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, who, unconnected with the war, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in the purſuit of their private concerns; it was an uſage which, we believe, every poliſhed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adopted: Nevertheleſs, when Great-Britain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that this uſage did not correſpond with her intereſt, her Parliament did not heſitate to abrogate it; for by a ſtatute paſſed ſo lately as 1782, it is made unlawful for any Britiſh ſubject to ranſom his ſhip or effects when captured, "and all contracts
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018773_0028_0FA8192D84DEFE78"/>
and agreements which ſhall be entered into, and all bills and other ſecurities which ſhall be given to any perſon or perſons, ſhall be abſolutely void."</p>
            <p>It cannot be ſaid, that this is a law operating only on the ſubjects of the Britiſh ſtate. All commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial nations appear to be intereſted in the uſage; it was a benefit to the <hi>captor</hi> as well as the <hi>captive;</hi> nor is any proviſion made for ranſom bills, which might have taken effect before the law could be promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the different parts of the world.<note place="margin">Doug. Kep. P. 169.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This circumſtance proves, at leaſt, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation did not conſider itſelf bound by the broad principles laid down by the lecturer.</p>
            <p>Time will not permit us to give this ſubject a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>We muſt acknowledge there appears to us very great force in the obſervation ariſing from the foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral compact. By this compact theſe ſtates are bound together as one great independent nation; and with reſpect to their common and national affairs, exerciſe a joint ſovereignty, whoſe will can only be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the acts of their delegates in Congreſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. As a nation they muſt be governed by one common law of nations; for on any other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples how can they act with regard to foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and how ſhall foreign powers act towards them? It ſeems evident that <hi>abroad</hi> they can only be known in their foederal capacity. What then muſt be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? What the confuſion? if each ſeparate ſtate ſhould arrogate to itſelf a right of changing at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thoſe laws, which are received as a rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, by the common conſent of the greateſt part of the civilized world.</p>
            <p>We ſhall deduce only one inference from what
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018773_0029_0FA8192DD6EF1800"/>
hath been here obſerved—that to abrogate or alter any one of the known laws or uſages of nations, by the authority of a ſingle ſtate, muſt be contrary to the very nature of the confederacy, and the evident intention of the articles, by which it is eſtabliſhed, as well as dangerous to the union itſelf.</p>
            <p>We are next led by the arguments which have been offered, to examine—whether the <hi>war</hi> was of ſuch a <hi>nature;</hi> and the capture ſuch a <hi>conqueſt</hi> as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to transfer, under the idea of an uſufruct, the rents and iſſues of houſes and lands to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Commander, during his occupancy of the city?</p>
            <p>On the part of the Plaintiff it is inſiſted, that the war which was waged againſt us by Great-Britain was <hi>unjuſt.</hi> As a matter of fact this cannot be denied—the honour of every American is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in its eſtabliſhment. Every patriot knows and feels it. Upon account of the injuſtice of the war, he renounced his allegiance and committed his fortune and his life to uncertain hazard. Upon account of the injuſtice of the war, Lord Chatham exclaimed in the Britiſh Houſe of Peers that he rejoiced America had reſiſted.—Againſt the injuſtice of the war Lord Cambden and his compeers proteſted; and the great cities of England itſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated: And finally, on account of the injuſtice of the war, even the Britiſh Houſe of Commons, in ſpite of the influence of the court, reſolved againſt its further proſecution.—And it is not too preſumptuous to think that upon account of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, all the aſtoniſhing efforts to ſubdue our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were blaſted by the hand of Heaven!</p>

            <p>Without entering into a minute examination of the reaſons and authorities, by which the parties have attempted to maintain opinions ſo oppoſite to each other; we ſhall conſider the ſubject in a more enlarged view.</p>
            <p>It is a maxim founded in reaſon and humanity, that the reſtoration of peace, whatever may be the cauſe of a war, ought always to be in contemplation. Every impediment then, which might retard this bleſſing, ought to be diſcountenanced—every faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which could promote it, encouraged; in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the refinements of civilization enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mankind, it was to be expected that the law of nations, foſtered and cheriſhed by philoſophers, ſhould become more benevolent, and more ſuitable to the dignity and happineſs of man. Hence the doctrine, that the ſolemnity and juſtice of a war were eſſential in aſcertaining the rights acquired as the effects of war, came to be exploded; becauſe experience had fully proved, that it was productive of miſchief. The ſhedding of human blood, and the ruin of families and countries could be but poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compenſated by the moſt humiliating conceſſions; while ſuch is the influence of pride and ambition, that two nations, equally convinced that it is their duty and their intereſt to embrace an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, often ſuffer the calamities of war to rage only
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018773_0032_0FA819301B1A9940"/>
from the fear of being degraded, by making the firſt advances towards peace. They wait for ſome ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did victory, which may never happen, to have an opportunity of manifeſting their ſuperiority, and of oppoſing what is neceſſary to their affairs, as an act of <hi>generoſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then every treaty of peace was to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by the preciſe rules of juſtice: If it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be acknowledged on one ſide, that the cauſe of the war was, on their part, unjuſt, or hoſtilities were commenced by them without thoſe previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſolemnities which have once been deemed eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; where is the nation which would confeſs their wantonneſs or injuſtice? or where the tribunal to whoſe arbitration they would ſubmit their honour? It is therefore for the happineſs of mankind; found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a manner, in neceſſity, that in a treaty of peace neither party ſhould be condemned for, or be bound to acknowledge, precipitancy, or the want of ſolemnity, in certain formalities in the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the war; and much leſs the injuſtice of their cauſe; and that the odium of all the blood which had been ſhed, was imputable to them. This would be to ſubſcribe to an indelible diſgrace, to which a ſovereign power very ſeldom would conſent, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but in the laſt extremity. If then it is plain, that no acknowledgment of ſuch a nature can be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated in a treaty, and there is no tribunal to judge between ſovereign powers, all enquiry into the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or ſolemnity of a war muſt ceaſe, and thoſe facts be incapable of ſervings the baſis of a precept—. in ſhort, that they can be no otherwiſe material, than <hi>in foro conſcientiae.</hi>—Theſe obſervation are juſtified by the authority of Mr. Vattel; they are corroborated
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018773_0033_0FA81930F7206D40"/>
by the uſage of nations; and in the particular queſtion before us, govern our deciſion.—We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that if there had been a want of ſolemnity, or the uſual formalities in the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the war—which we do not think is the caſe—and altho' as a <hi>matter of fact</hi> this war, both in its principle and progreſs, hath been marked with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parralleled injuſtice and violence; none of theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are of any avail in the preſent caſe.<note place="margin">3 Vatt. 110.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The next point which has been raiſed, is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the capture and occupancy of the city of New-York, is ſuch a conqueſt as veſted the Britiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander with the diſpoſal of the rents and profits of real property?</p>
            <p>To maintain the negative of this queſtion, the Plaintiff's counſel have recourſe to the doctrine of Poſtliminium—which is that right, by virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, perſons and things are reſtored to their former ſtate; when coming again under the power of the nation to which they belong.</p>

            <p>The two authorities quoted from Grotius, and on each ſide of the queſtion, ſeem at the firſt view, to be repugnant; but on an attentive examination it will appear otherwiſe: In the firſt caſe he is ſpeaking of profits of <hi>lands to be reſtored.</hi> He conceives, that
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018773_0035_0FA81934526C6670"/>
the profits of ſuch lands ought to be recovered on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the antecedent right of ſoil to which they were annexed.</p>
            <p>But in the laſt caſe, he ſpeaks of a <hi>new right,</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the articles of peace, which had no prior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, there he ſays the profits ſhall be allowed from the time of the grant, <hi>and not before.</hi> That this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction is juſt will appear from a view of the whole of the laſt authority:</p>
            <p>To whom any thing is granted by articles of peace, to him are alſo all the profits allowed from the time of the grant <hi>but not before;</hi> then follows this paſſage which explains the ſenſe of the author— "As Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar well argued againſt Sextus Pompeius, who having Peleponneſus granted to him, would have alſo had all the tributes, which <hi>were in arrear</hi> for ſome years paſt before the time of that grant."</p>
            <p>Thus Grotius is at unity with himſelf: But it is not in our power to reconcile him to Vattel. Theſe authors differ in their opinions with reſpect to the reſtitution after peace, of the fruits collected by a captor during the war. Beſides this, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, there are ſeveral ſtrong paſſages in Vattel, which corroborate the ſame doctrine; and it receives additional force from the authority of Burlamaqui and of Barbeyrac in his notes upon Grotius.</p>
            <p>We are therefore of opinion, that reſtitution of the <hi>fruit,</hi> or in other words, the rents and iſſues of houſes and lands, which have been <hi>bona fide,</hi> collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by or under the authority of the Britiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, while he held poſſeſſion of the city, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, <hi>according to the law of nations,</hi> be required.</p>
            <p>The uſufruct ſeems to be placed on the footing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018773_0036_0FA81935892431D8"/>
of any other contribution exacted by a conqueror in the courſe of a war; and the right of demanding contributions in ſuch caſe, hath, we believe, never been queſtioned.—With reſpect to the products, which might be due on the concluſion of a peace, they muſt ceaſe to be recoverable by the captor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſtoration of the town, unleſs the treaty ſhould provide for it by an expreſs ſtipulation.</p>
            <p>But this doctrine in its fulleſt extent will prove no effectual relief to the Defendant. As we have before obſerved the rights of the Britiſh General as the effect of a temporary conqueſt, could only be communicated by his <hi>immediate</hi> authority; the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Commiſſary General in diſpoſing of thoſe rights, was an act of uſurpation; and it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that meerly as Britiſh merchants and Britiſh ſubjects, either the Defendant or his employers had any claim or intereſt in the uſufruct.</p>
            <p>The Defendant therefore, upon the moſt liberal conſtruction of the law of nations, remains charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Plaintiff in this action.</p>
            <p>We proceed therefore to the third general head, to enquire—</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Vatt. B. 4. c. 2. P. 120.121 § 18 to 21 Grot. B. 3. c. 20. P. 699 and Barbeyrac's Note.

            <p>And here the Defendant's counſel inſiſt, that every treaty of peace implies an amneſty and oblivion of damages and injuries in the war; and rely on the authority of Grotius, Barbeyrac, Barlemaqui and V<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tel in ſupport of the propoſition.</p>
            <p>A treaty of peace can be no more than an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018773_0037_0FA819370E5D6DE0"/>
The effect of it is to put an end to the war, and to aboliſh the ſubject of it: as it forbids the revival of the ſame war, by taking up arms for the cauſe which firſt enkindled it, it is in reality perpetual.</p>
            <p>An amneſty is a <hi>perfect</hi> oblivion of what is paſt, and the end of peace being to extinguiſh all ſubjects of diſcord, this ſhould be the leading article of the treaty. This accordingly, ſays Vattel, at preſent is the conſtant rule.</p>
            <p>But tho' the treaty, he adds, ſhould be wholly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent on this head, the amneſty, by the <hi>very nature of the peace,</hi> is neceſſarily implied in it.</p>
            <p>In another paſſage, he obſerves, that the effect of the amneſty, cannot be extended <hi>to things of no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the war</hi> concluded by the treaty.</p>
            <p>Theſe principles are well eſtabliſhed by the law of nations; and they are even admitted by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the Plaintiff.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, on their part, that the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the tenements in queſtion by the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, <hi>had no relation to the war;</hi> and that therefore the amneſty cannot acquit him.</p>
            <p>This objection has been fully conſidered; and we have given an opinion that the term for which the tenements were held by the permiſſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary General can, on no conſtruction, <hi>have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the war:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The amneſty implied in the treaty cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtify the Defendant; for all the authorities prove, that it can be only extended <hi>to things done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The parties have indeed joined their iſſues upon other points, upon which, if the cauſe had entirely reſted, judgment ought to have been given.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:018773_0038_0FA81937B804A708"/>
               <q>But it is a known rule, that if upon the whole record, matter in law appear why judgment ſhould be given againſt one party, the court muſt judge ſo, for it is the office of the court to judge the law upon the whole record, and the conſent of parties cannot prejudice their opinions, nor acquit them of their office in that point.<note place="margin">Hob. 56.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It has been further objected, that Congreſs could form no treaty of peace to reach our <hi>internal</hi> police.</p>
            <p>There is a great diſtinction between the authority of the treaty; and its operation and effects.</p>
            <p>The firſt we hold to be ſacred and ſhall never, as far as we have power, ſuffer it to be violated or queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>It is the great charter of America—it has formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and forever releaſed us from foreign domination— It has confirmed our ſovereignty and independence; and aſcertained our extenſive limits.</p>
            <p>Our union as has been properly obſerved, is known and legalized in our conſtitution; and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a fundamental law in the firſt act of our legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. The foederal compact hath veſted Congreſs with full and excluſive powers to make peace and war. This treaty they have made and ratified, and rendered its obligation perpetual.</p>
            <p>And we are clearly of opinion, that no ſtate in this union can alter or abridge, in a ſingle point, the foederal articles or the treaty:</p>
            <p>But the operation and effects of the treaty, within our own ſtate, are fit ſubjects of enquiry and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: According to its ſpirit and true meaning we muſt determine our judgment: Nor ſhall any man, by any act of ours, be deprived of the benefits which, on a fair and reaſonable conſtruction, he ought to derive from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:018773_0039_0FA819386580F3C0"/>On this occaſion, we ſay with the ſage—<hi>fiat juſtitia ruat coelum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot, it is urged by the Defendant's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, impoſe a ſenſe upon the treaty different from that which it intrinſically bears. "The rules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among nations muſt interpret treaties."</p>
            <p>This is an unneceſſary obſervation: No diſpute hath ariſen reſpecting the intrinſic ſenſe of the treaty: The Plaintiff's counſel repeatedly inſiſted that the article of the treaty which reſpected an indemnity related to <hi>public offences</hi> —the Defendant's counſel in anſwer frankly confeſſed, that though that article was mentioned by <hi>one</hi> of them, it was <hi>not relied on.</hi> That they reſted on two things; one, the <hi>right</hi> which the law of <hi>nations</hi> gives the <hi>captors;</hi> the other the <hi>amneſty</hi> included eſſentially in every treaty, whether expreſſed or not, agreeably to the current of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and the reaſon of the thing.</p>
            <p>It is then an implied and not an <hi>expreſs</hi> amneſty, on which the Defendant relies; an amneſty which neceſſarily reſults from every treaty of peace—And thus, the intrinſic ſenſe of the treaty and the rules for its interpretation are out of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>We have in ſome meaſure anticipated another queſtion, which was much debated at the hearing—</p>
            <p>Whether the courts of juſtice ought to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> where it clearly militated againſt the law of nations.</p>
            <p>Here it is material to obſerve that the <hi>deſcription of perſons,</hi> who are ſubject to be ſued by this ſtatute is <hi>general;</hi> extending to all who had occupied or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the real or perſonal eſtate of the exiles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of the enemy.</p>
            <p>The counſel for the Defendant, by ſtating a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018773_0040_0FA819391C5697C8"/>
of pointed caſes, ſhewed clearly, from the nature of things, that the ſtatute muſt admit of exceptions. Mr. Attorney-General, one of the counſel for the Plaintiff, who argued the cauſe very ably, admitted that many caſes may be out of the ſtatute, tho' the Plaintiff's is not of the number.</p>
            <p>Thus then, it ſeems to be agreed, on both ſides, that the proviſion in the ſtatute, being general, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend to all <hi>caſes:</hi> and muſt therefore receive a <hi>reaſonable interpretation</hi> according to the <hi>intention;</hi> and not according to the <hi>lattitude of expreſſion</hi> of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature: It follows as a neceſſary conſequence, that the interpretation is the province of the court, and, however difficult the taſk, that we are bound to perform it.</p>

            <p>However contradictory theſe authorities may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſuperficial obſervers; they are not only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018773_0041_0FA81939D9568AB0"/>
of being reconciled; but the reſult of the whole will appear to be wiſe, ſuited to human im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and eaſily explained.</p>
            <p>The ſupremacy of the Legiſlature need not be called into queſtion; if they think fit <hi>poſitively</hi> to enact a law, there is no power which can controul them. When the main object of ſuch a law is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the intention manifeſt, the Judges are not at liberty, altho' it appears to them to be <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi> to reject it: for this were to ſet the <hi>judicial</hi> above the legiſlative, which would be ſubverſive of all government.</p>
            <p>But when a law is expreſſed in <hi>general words,</hi> and ſome <hi>collateral matter,</hi> which happens to ariſe from thoſe general words is <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> there the Judges are in decency to conclude, that the conſequences were not foreſeen by the Legiſlature; and therefore they are at liberty to expound the ſtatute by <hi>equity,</hi> and only <hi>quoad hoc</hi> to diſregard it.</p>
            <p>When the judicial make theſe diſtinctions, they do not controul the Legiſlature; they endeavour to give their <hi>intention</hi> it's proper effect.</p>
            <p>This is the ſubſtance of the authorities, on a comprehenſive view of the ſubject; this is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Blackſtone in his celebrated commentaries, and this is the practice of the courts of juſtice, from which we have copied our juriſprudence, as well as the models of our own internal judicatories. To apply theſe general remarks to the particular caſe under our conſideration—The American priſoners of war, in the power of the enemy, were quartered in the houſes of the exiles: they in fact occupied thoſe houſes by a <hi>military order or command,</hi> and are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the general deſcription of the ſtatute,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018773_0042_0FA8193AA73E4F78"/>
which according to the letter, extends to <hi>all perſons</hi> without any exception, who have ſo occupied or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured ſuch houſes. But can we force ourſelves to believe, that the Legiſlature could have been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and oppreſſive, as to add to the ſufferings of the patriot ſoldier, conſigned after fighting the battles of his country, to a long captivity by making him pay for the fetters, which he had worn in the ſervice of his country, or for want of means, to undergo a ſecond loſs of liberty?</p>
            <p>That the legiſlative, judicial and executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of government ſhould be independent of each other, is eſſential to liberty.</p>
            <p>This principle entered deeply into our excellent conſtitution, and was one of the inducements to the eſtabliſhment of the Council of Reviſion, that the judicial and executive of whom it is compoſed, might have the means of guarding their reſpective rights, againſt the encroachments of the Ligiſlature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by deſign, "or by haſte or unadviſedneſs." For this and other purpoſes, all bills, which have paſſed the Senate and Aſſembly, before they become laws, are to be preſented to the Council for their reviſal and conſideration; that if it ſhould appear impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them, that any bill ſhould become a law, it may be returned with their objections for further conſideration, and become ſubject to the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two-thirds of the members of each houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be a law.</p>
            <p>From this paſſage of our conſtitution, Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſeems to regard this determination of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Reviſion on the law in queſtion, in the light of a judicial deciſion; by which this court ought to be guided, for the ſake of <hi>uniformity</hi> in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018773_0043_0FA8193B56009D38"/>
of juſtice. But ſurely the reſpect, which we owe to this honourable Council, ought not to carry us ſuch lengths; it is not to be ſuppoſed, that their aſſentor objection to a bill, can have the force of an adjudication: for what in ſuch a caſe, would be the fate of a law, which prevailed againſt their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Beſides in the hurry of a ſeſſion, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſlagrante bello, they have neither leiſure nor means, to weigh the extent and conſequences of a law, whoſe proviſions are general, at leaſt not with that accuracy and ſolemnity, which muſt be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ender their reaſons incontrovertible, and their opinions abſolute. The inſtitution of this Council is ſufficiently uſeful and ſalutary, without aſcribing to their proceedings, effects ſo extraordinary; nor is it probable, that the high judicial powers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, would in the ſeat of judgment always be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, even by their <hi>own</hi> opinion given in the Council of Reviſion;—for inſtance, if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a bill, <hi>general in its proviſion,</hi> and in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice they diſcovered, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter, it comprehended caſes, which rendered its operation <hi>unſeaſonable, miſchievous</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intention</hi> of the Legiſlature, would they not give relief? ſurely it cannot be queſtioned.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, this being a ſtatute is obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and being general in its proviſions, collateral matter ariſes out of the general words, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be unſeaſonable. The Court is therefore bound to conclude, that ſuch a conſequence was not foreſeen by the Legiſlature, to explain it by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to diſregard it in that point <hi>only,</hi> where it would operate thus unſeaſonably.</p>
            <p>The queſtions then, whether this ſtatute hath <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

any reſpect revoked the law of nations, or is repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the definitive treaty of peace, are foreign to the circumſtances of the caſe: neither will happen, nor ought to be apprehended.</p>
            <p>There is not a tittle in the treaty, to which the ſtatute is repugnant. The <hi>amneſty</hi> is conſtructive, and made out by reaſoning from the law of nations to the treaty.</p>
            <p>The repeal of the law of nations, or any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with it, could not have been in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in our opinion, when the Legiſlature paſſed this ſtatute; and we think ourſelves bound to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt that law from its operation: Firſt, becauſe there is no mention of the law of nations, nor the moſt remote alluſion to it, throughout the whole ſtatute: Secondly, becauſe it is a ſubject of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt national concern and of too much moment to have been <hi>intended</hi> to be ſtruck at in <hi>ſilence;</hi> and to be controuled <hi>implicatively</hi> under the generality of the terms of the proviſion: Thirdly, becauſe the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on itſelf is ſo indefinite, that without any controul, it would operate in other caſes <hi>unreaſonably,</hi> to the <hi>oppreſſion</hi> of the <hi>innocent,</hi> and contrary to <hi>humanity;</hi> when it is a known maxim
<q>that a ſtatute ought to be ſo conſtrued, that no man who is <hi>innocent</hi> be puniſhed or <hi>endamaged:</hi>
               </q>
Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtatute under our conſideration, doth not contain even the common <hi>non obſtante clauſe,</hi> tho' it is ſo frequent in our ſtatute book—"And it is an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed maxim, where two laws are ſeemingly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and there be no clauſe of non obſtante in the latter, they ſhall, if poſſible, have ſuch conſtruction, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <hi>poſteriores leges prioribus derogant,</hi> to uſe the language of Sir Thomas Powis, in the Dutcheſs of Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's caſe,—at the ſame time it muſt be remembered, that repeals by <hi>implication</hi> are disfavoured by law, and never allowed of but where the <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> and <hi>repugnancy</hi> are <hi>plain, glaring</hi> and <hi>unavoidable:</hi> for theſe repeals carry along with them a tacit reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Legiſlature, that they ſhould ignorantly, and without knowing it, make one act repugnant to and inconſiſtent with another: and ſuch repeals have ever been interpreted ſo as to repeal as <hi>little</hi> of the precedent law as poſſible.<note place="margin">10 Mod. 118.</note>

               <note place="margin">Dyer 348, at the bottom. Hard. 344.</note>The Plaintiff's counſel, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves argued in favour of this laſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, adduced ſeveral authorities to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Whoever then is <hi>clearly exempted</hi> from the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſtatute by the law of nations, this Court muſt take it for granted, could never have been <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> to be comprehended within it by the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>It is aſked by the Defendant's counſel, whether if a perſon within the power of the enemy, had been ordered by them <hi>on pain of death,</hi> to injure or deſtroy the property of an exile, he could have been ſued under this ſtatute, for obeying ſuch order? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is obvious—if he did the injury under coertion, and for the preſervation of his life, the dureſs on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principle of law and reaſon, ought to work out his juſtification;—for no one can conceive that the ſtatute, comprehenſive as it is in the proviſion, could have been intended to be applied to ſuch a caſe of extreme and fatal neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Again it is aſked, whether veſſels condemned here in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

ſtatute. Whether the Britiſh Generals, Howe and Clinton can be proſecuted under it for damages which they have committed on the property of the exiles, in relation to the war? The principles, which we have lain down, clearly ſhew that ſuch veſſels cannot be recovered: That thoſe Generals cannot be ſued; becauſe theſe are all acts done in <hi>relation to the war,</hi> which according to the law of nations, are virtually and effectual buried in oblivion by the definitive treaty: every ſuch treaty in its very nature imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a general amneſty.</p>
            <p>We have gone further perhaps into many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubjects, which have been brought into view by this controverſy, than was ſtrictly neceſſary; but it is time that the law of nations and the nature and effects of treaties ſhould be underſtood: And in the infancy of our republic, every proper opportunity ſhould be embraced to inculcate a ſenſe of national obligation, and a reverence for inſtitutions, on which the tranquility of mankind, conſidered as members of different ſtates and communities ſo eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
            <p>Beſides the maxim <hi>intereſt reipublicae ut ſit finis litium,</hi> never applied more forcibly, than it now doth to us in our preſent circumſtances; and it is hoped by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus explicit, we may eaſe the minds of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſuitors, whoſe cauſes are depending here under this ſtatute—at all events we ſhall relieve this Court from an unuſual weight of judicial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, which a want of time <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon the whole, it is the opinion of this Court, that the plea of the Defendant as to the occupancy of the Plaintiff's brew-houſe and malt-houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the 28th day of September, 1778, and the laſt day of April, 1780; and the laſt plea of the Defendant as to the whole of the treſpaſs, charged in the Plaintiff's declaration are inſufficient in the law; <hi>and</hi> that only the plea of the Defendant in juſtification of the occupancy between the laſt day of April 1780, and the 17th day of March 1783, is good and ſufficient in the law.—</p>
