            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Epiſtle TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Faculty in Man, by which he is raiſed above the Reſt of the viſible Creation: And as this Power is the Glory of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; ſo the Perfection and Glory of this conſiſts in the <hi>Knowledge of GOD.</hi> All other Knowledge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this is mean and trivial; and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make us wiſer or better, unleſs placed in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and Subſerviency to our Acquaintance with the Bleſſed GOD. This Knowledge is not perfected in a bare <hi>Contemplation of the</hi> DEITY; but when true and genuine will exerciſe <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Soul,</hi> and transform it into the Image of Divine Purity and Glory. Hence all the vital Acts of Religion are either comprehended herein, or do flow here-from.</p>
            <p>To attain this Knowledge is our great <hi>Work</hi> on Earth; and the Perfection of it is reſerved for our <hi>Reward</hi> in the expected World of Happineſs:
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004489_0003_100D57469F586230"/>Where <hi>to ſee GOD as He is,</hi> and to be <hi>like Him</hi> will be found to be Life Eternal. And the higher our Improvements are herein in this Life, the more of Heaven do we at preſent <hi>enjoy,</hi> and the greater is our <hi>Preparation</hi> for the happy State of <hi>Viſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW nothing is more neceſſary to our right Knowledge of GOD than that all our Enquiries after this <hi>Glorious</hi> BEING be temper'd with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Senſe that <hi>Incomprehenſibleneſs is a Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute;</hi> and that it is the <hi>ſole Prerogative of</hi> HIM, <hi>whoſe Underſtanding is Infinite, fully and adequately to know Himſelf.</hi> We muſt remember that the moſt <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>enlarged Conceptions</hi> of the uncreated Excellencies of the Divine Nature, which our Minds can form, when ſtretch'd to their utmoſt Capacity, are <hi>Inadequate</hi> to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Subject, and fall infinitely ſhort of the Glory of thoſe Perfections, which are concentred in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and ſhine forth in the glorious <hi>Works</hi> of Nature, Providence and Grace. The <hi>Object</hi> is too vaſt and bright, and our <hi>Faculties</hi> too ſhort, weak and limited, to take, or bear, a full and comprehenſive View thereof. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity</hi> of every Perfection in GOD, and the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs</hi> of our Powers of Knowledge, between which there is no Proportion, will forever render a <hi>comprehenſive Knowledge</hi> of GOD an utter Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility. His Excellencies would not be the Perfections of a GOD were they not Infinite, they would not be Infinite could the Creature enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a full View, and form an adequate <hi>Mea</hi> of them. The <hi>eſſential Glory</hi> of GOD, if unvailed, would confound and over-power our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004489_0004_100D57498DC7B1D8"/>with its <hi>inſufferable Brightneſs.</hi> What Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can thus <hi>behold</hi> GOD <hi>and live!</hi> It is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to our Infirmity that He <hi>holds back the Face of His Throne, and ſpreads a Cloud upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED in the <hi>Future State,</hi> where all faulty Ignorance ſhall be done away, the Minds of the Bleſſed will be raiſed to their full <hi>Strength, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Capacity,</hi> and theſe filled with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD, which ſhall render them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly <hi>bleſſed:</hi> Which Knowledge is repreſented to us under the Phraſes of <hi>Seeing</hi> GOD <hi>as He is, and Face to Face;</hi> yet this will fall infinitely ſhort of <hi>Comprehenſion.</hi> For yet there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>infinite Truths,</hi> and <hi>adorable Myſteries</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover'd for the glorify'd Underſtanding to be prying into, and reaching after a fuller Proſpect of, which will render the Knowledge of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>eternally Progreſſive;</hi> and yet after all they can't <hi>find out the Almighty to Perfection.</hi> The <hi>Angels,</hi> who excel in Strength, Purity, and Glory, are not here <hi>Comprehenſors;</hi> for there are <hi>Secrets</hi> of Wiſdom and Grace which they ſtill <hi>deſire to look into.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW much ſo ever this may <hi>upbraid</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Weakneſs of the moſt exalted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it certainly loudly <hi>proclaims</hi> the Excellency of the CREATOR, whoſe Nature and Perfections are vaſtly extended beyond the largeſt Proſpect of a <hi>created Intelligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Incomprehenſibleneſs</hi> of GOD is not to be look'd on as meerly <hi>Speculative,</hi> to amuſe the Mind; but will admirably advance
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004489_0005_100D574BC4502FE0"/>the great Intereſt of Piety when underſtood, weigh'd and realized.</p>
            <p>DID Men <hi>live</hi> under a lively Senſe of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Greatneſs,</hi> and Perfection of GOD, what holy Impreſſions would direct and govern the Inclinations of their Souls! With what <hi>Humility, Reverence</hi> and <hi>Awe</hi> would they Think and <hi>Speak</hi> of the Bleſſed GOD: being ſenſible that they know not how to <hi>order</hi> their Thoughts or <hi>Speech</hi> of Him <hi>by reaſon of Darkneſs?</hi> With what <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> and <hi>Proſtration of Spirit</hi> would they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Him in all the Duties of <hi>Divine Worſhip!</hi> How <hi>modeſt</hi> in their <hi>Enquiries</hi> into, and how little Poſitive in their <hi>Determinations</hi> concerning, the Secrets of Divine Counſel; which are at preſent, in a great meaſure, <hi>bid within the Vail?</hi> With what <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Reſignation</hi> would they ly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Throne</hi> of Divine <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled with <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs?</hi> Nothing wondring that they can't unfold the dark Riddles of Divine Providence; remembring that GOD's <hi>Judgments are Unſearchable, and His Ways paſt finding out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WERE the Hearts of Chriſtians <hi>animated</hi> with theſe juſt Apprehenſions of the GOD they have to do with; with what <hi>Abaſement</hi> of Spirit would they reflect upon their moſt perfect Praiſe, and beſt Services? And with what <hi>Tranſports</hi> of <hi>Admiration, Love</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> would they conſider the Condeſcentions of Heaven to them, and all the Fruits of Divine Care and Love, which daily incircle them? At how high a Price would they rate the <hi>Revelation</hi> GOD has made of Himſelf in
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:004489_0006_100D574D4BE32AC8"/>His Word, where the Light of <hi>the Knowledge of the Glory of</hi> GOD ſhines bright <hi>in the Face of Chriſt?</hi> And with what <hi>profound Veneration</hi> would their Underſtandings <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible <hi>Myſteries of Chriſtianity?</hi> Not daring to <hi>darken Counſel by Words without Knowledge.</hi> How much would this <hi>inflame</hi> their Thirſt, and <hi>quicken</hi> their Endeavours after a fuller Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with GOD? And how ardently would they <hi>long,</hi> and how carefully <hi>prepare</hi> for Heaven? Where they ſhall no longer view Him <hi>thro' a Glaſs darkly; but Face to Face, ſee as they are ſeen, and know as they are known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>promote</hi> theſe Deſigns of Holineſs theſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> which are now put into our Hands, are wiſely adapted: In which we have the <hi>ſublime Subject of</hi> GOD's <hi>Incomprehenſibleneſs</hi> treated of with a becoming Modeſty and Reverence, with an agreeable Life, Judgment and Perſpicuity.</p>
            <p>THE Character of the Reverend <hi>Author,</hi> and his Performances are too bright to receive any Luſtre from my <hi>Recommendation.</hi> However I muſt be allow'd to rejoice in, and to bleſs the <hi>great Head of the Church</hi> for, thoſe uncommon Gifts His Servant is endow'd with; which appear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervably in theſe Diſcourſes. And ſure I am, It is not <hi>Partiality to a Friend,</hi> but Juſtice to the Merit of the Performance, which compels me to believe, That every impartial judicious Reader will eſteem theſe <hi>Meditations</hi> every way fitted to entertain, and <hi>improve</hi> the Underſtanding of the moſt Intelligent; and to <hi>quicken</hi> the Devotion of the moſt devout Chriſtian.</p>

FOR what will be thought ſuitable to afford <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> to the pious Mind, if <hi>theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations on</hi> GOD will not? In <hi>theſe</hi> we have the Light, Beauty, and infinite Fulneſs of the <hi>Divine Eſſence</hi> repreſented, acknowledged and adored as Unapprochable, Impenetrable and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable.</p>
            <p>IN theſe we have celebrated the unſearchable Greatneſs, and Excellencies of GOD, as they ſhine in the <hi>Works of Nature:</hi> And illuſtrated by many bright <hi>Hints</hi> drawn from the Glory and Beauty of the <hi>greater and leſſer World:</hi> In all Parts whereof there appear legible Characters of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that are paſt finding out.</p>
            <p>IN theſe we are entertained with a Proſpect of Divine <hi>Providence;</hi> diſplayed in its Extent from the higheſt <hi>Angel</hi> to the meaneſt <hi>Inſect;</hi> and in the uncontrolable Power, impenetrable Wiſdom, and myſterious Methods of Divine Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>IN a Word, here the Wonders of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> in the Recovery of apoſtate Man are aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſplay'd. In which we are led into a ſurprizing Contemplation of the <hi>Glories of the Attributes of</hi> GOD, as they are manifeſted in the <hi>Perſon, Office</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> of our REDEEMER; In the Impetration, Application, and Perfection of our Salvation; in all which the Depths of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Riches of Grace, and the Triumphs both of Mercy and Juſtice, are illuſtrated.</p>

               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:004489_0008_100D57510E7704A8"/>
THESE exalted and myſterious <hi>Doctrines</hi> are here handled with an uncommon Force and Flame of Thought, expreſſed mainly in the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Divine Oracles,</hi> which gives Life, Beauty, and Solemnity to the Diction.</p>
            <p>WHEN theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> were deliver'd from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> I have good Reaſon to think, that they were heard with a ſingular Reliſh and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by a <hi>numerous and judicious Audience.</hi> And this excited me once and again to move the Reverend <hi>Author</hi> to publiſh them; that they might become more extenſively ſerviceable to the grand Intereſts of Religion. I am firmly perſwaded that the great Aim of the Author in theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> was to advance the Glory of GOD and the Good of Souls; I cannot therefore but with an hearty Importunity wiſh Proſperity from Heaven to his pious Intentions.</p>
            <p>AND may the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> on whom all Succeſs depends, ſend His <hi>Spirit</hi> to bleſs theſe Labours of His Servant; that they may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to beget in Chriſtians <hi>a more awful Senſe of the Great</hi> GOD, to ſtir up and cheriſh the Life of Devotion in their Souls, to render them more Solemn in all Acts of Worſhip to Him, and more Holy in all Actions of Converſation before Him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>How little did the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the <hi>Heathen World</hi> ſearch out and diſcover of the <hi>Great GOD?</hi> One of the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> Things in <hi>Athens</hi> was (it may be)

               <p>BUT this is not all: Not only is the <hi>Divine Being and Nature</hi> Unſearchable to meer natural Reaſon; but alſo,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> SO is He to us <hi>after our Illuminations from his Holy Word,</hi> wherein He hath <hi>revealed</hi> Himſelf to us. GOD has made known ſo much of Himſelf as is neceſſary in order to our ſerving him here, and to bring us to the Enjoyment of him for ever: but no more. The <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of the Almighty implies nothing of the <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of him. The <hi>deep Things</hi> of GOD are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us to be believed, not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us. We know but little of GOD now to what we ſhall do hereafter, if our Spirits are gather'd to the Aſſembly of the Saints in Heaven; yet they and we for ever, even there, ſhall know but a little part of <hi>Him the infinite Being:</hi> for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Natures,</hi> how ever <hi>vaſt</hi> their Capacities and Perfections, can never in any Meaſure contain or <hi>attain unto</hi> what is Infinite. The Light of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven compar'd to what we now can know of GOD, even after ſaving Illumination, and the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Study of GOD's Word or the Works of Nature, is as the <hi>Day</hi> now is with us unto the <hi>Night:</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>Now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly, but then Face to Face: Now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am known.</hi> But what is this?—<hi>even as I am known?</hi> Do

                  <hi>Angels</hi> know GOD in any Equality as they are known of Him? No: <hi>He charges his Angels with Fooliſhneſs!</hi> they <hi>pry</hi> into the Myſteries of his infinite Eſſence, Decrees and Works: they grow daily in Knowledge and Happineſs by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him as He is: their Knowledge of GOD is certain and true, diſtinct and clear, ſo far as their enlarged Minds can receive of the bleſſed Object: but a <hi>comprehenſive Knowledge is everlaſtingly far from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOW much leſs then can <hi>We</hi> ſearch out the Almighty unto Perfection in this our <hi>imperfect</hi> State on Earch? We that have no immediate <hi>Viſion</hi> of his Glory, but <hi>ſee as through a Glaſs darkly:</hi> thro' the Glaſs of his Works, his Word and Ordinances. <q>A Glaſs gives but a weak and languid Repreſentation, a vaniſhing and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Glimpſe.

Job 36.26. <hi>Behold God is great and we know him not, neither can the Number of his Years be ſearched out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. HOW Unſearchable is the <hi>Spirituality and Simplicity, Infiniteneſs and Immenſity</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature? GOD is an infinite Mind or Spirit, included no where, nor excluded any where: So that ſuppoſing <hi>Millions</hi> of Worlds he is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and equally in every Part and with every Creature in them all; at the ſame time and at all times upholding, diſpoſing, governing them all. Now what an unſearchable Idea is this? 1 Kings 8.27. <hi>Behold the Heaven, and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee.</hi> Pſal. 139.7, 8. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there: If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the utmoſt Parts of the Sea; even there ſhall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand ſhall hold me.</hi> Here is Infinity: and that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite cannot be meaſur'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. HOW unſearchable is the <hi>Knowledge and Wiſdom of God,</hi> particularly his <hi>Preſcience.</hi> The LORD is a God of Knowledge: He is the <hi>Only-Wiſe;</hi> there is no ſearching of his Underſtanding: it is infinite: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.28. Angels are dark and fooliſh and blind when ſet before this Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created and ineffable.

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004489_0017_100D576527D45D88"/>Creature: There muſt be ſome <hi>mighty Mind</hi> that has a perfect Comprehenſion of <hi>univerſal Nature;</hi> the Powers, Qualities and Circumſtances of all Creatures. He who made all, and by whom all things conſiſt, muſt have a perfect Knowledge of all. But who can think what this <hi>boundleſs</hi> Mind itſelf is? Such Knowledge is too wonderful for us, it is high, and we cannot attain unto it. Job 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.4. <hi>He that is perfect in Knowledge is with thee</hi> GOD knows the Secrets of all Hearts, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of the Thoughts: yea he ſees them afar off. He knows all future Events, that as yet are in the Womb of Time; and every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent thing is from Everlaſting with GOD. But what a dazling Light is this to us ignorant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! as the Sun is to our weak Eye, over-pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking away the Sight.</p>
               <p>IT is moſt plain from the Holy Scriptures, and is eaſily demonſtrable to our Reaſon, that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is a divine Attribute. Yet how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it with the Creatures <hi>Liberty</hi> is a great deep: and ſo with the Permiſſion of the Sin and Miſery which Men and Devils involve themſelves in. When we are loſt almoſt by plunging into this Abyſs, we muſt recover our ſelves with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Words, not daring to impeach what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fathom or dive to the Bottom of: Rom. 11.33. <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out! for who has known the Mind of the Lord? or who has been his Counſellor? or who has firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenced to him again! for of him,

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. HOW unſearchable is the <hi>Power, Sovereigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dominion</hi> of GOD? <hi>God has ſpoken once, twice have we heard this, that Power belongeth to GOD.</hi> But <hi>how little a Portion is heard of it? The Thunder of his Power who can underſtand?</hi> Almighty! Omnipotent! how do they found! <hi>Abſolute</hi> Power is only with GOD. The <hi>Powers</hi> on Earth would be ſo, and they call themſelves <hi>Moſt Potent, High and Mighty;</hi> but they are vain and empty Names: GOD is the thing it ſelf: Rom. 1.20. <hi>His eternal Power and Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN his Power is founded his <hi>Dominion;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Majeſty and Empire ſhines forth. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord pleaſed that did be in Heaven, on Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep Places. He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can think.</hi> All the Powers of Creatures are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him, for they all flow'd from him; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Degrees of Power ſtill remain with him to controul the moſt potent Creatures. At his Word the Worlds and all their mighty <hi>Orbs</hi> came into Being, and he can caſh them to Pieces one againſt another when he will. In <hi>his</hi> almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hand all Creatures are lighter than the Duſt of the Ballance is in <hi>ours.</hi> He holds the Waters in the hollow of his Hand; and weight the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance. His Dominion is univerſal, ſupream, eternal. Dan. 4.35. <hi>His Dominion is an everlaſting Dominion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation: the Inhabitants of the World are reputed anothing,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004489_0019_100D57690CD05D70"/>and he doth according to his Will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth: and none can ſtay his Hand, nor ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> Thus great is the Lord, and <hi>of great Power;</hi> his Greatneſs is unſearchable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. HOW unſearchable is the <hi>Goodneſs, Mercy and Grace</hi> of GOD! We may well <hi>pry</hi> into this with devout Admiration; <hi>how great is his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> His <hi>common Beneficence</hi> is for Number, Swiftneſs, Conſtancy, like the Rays of Light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted daily by the Sun. His Mercy is <hi>great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heavens:</hi> like it for Amplitude, and like the Stars of Heaven for Multitude and Brightneſs. All Creatures are the Emanations of overflowing Goodneſs, and all do continually ſubſiſt by it. <hi>Redeeming Mercy</hi> is ſuch in the Salvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man as has aſtoniſh'd <hi>Angels; they deſire to look into it.</hi> And <hi>Saints</hi> will to Eternity be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring and lauding it.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. HOW unſearchable is the <hi>Holineſs, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs</hi> of GOD! The <hi>Seraphims</hi> cry <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> covering their Faces; not able to behold the Brightneſs of the Glory thereof; and being <hi>unclean</hi> in their own Eyes before it. The crowned and victorious Saints ſing of it as great and marvellous, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.4.</p>
               <p>GOD is the <hi>Holy One:</hi> there is none holy as the LORD; the Heavens are not clean in his Sight.</p>
               <p>COMPARE the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of GOD together and how wonderful are they! A glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004489_0020_100D30D934E92E68"/>BEING who made us happy and holy, and is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; and yet has not taken Vengeance of our Sin and Apoſtacy, but has meditated and with an infinite Price ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd our Redemption; in a Way wherein his Holineſs and his Grace have an equal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. A GOD good to the Evil tho' he be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely provoked by our Sins! and who waits to be merciful to that Enmity which he deteſts and can deſtroy! who ſo loves our Souls that rather than theſe ſhonid periſh without Remedy has not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his own Son, but given him up for us all! and yet ſo abhors our Sins that no leſs Atonement for them would he accept than the infinite Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in his Death.</p>
               <p>WHAT unſearchable Holineſs, and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Grace are here equally diſplay'd! which of the <hi>two</hi> are moſt to be admir'd and ador'd by us! Myſterious Union, and Exaltation in our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! which Angels pry into with Wonder! they being too good not to <hi>commiſerate</hi> us, and too pure not to <hi>loath</hi> us, and not ſo knowing but to <hi>deſpair</hi> of us! They pitied our loſt Souls, but the Holineſs of GOD was dearer to them far than theſe! nor could they but with high Reſentment doom them a Sacrifice thereto! Then did <hi>the holy and juſt One,</hi> while holy Angels cover'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in awful Reverence, and guilty Devils lay proſtrate and trembling in Fear and Horror! while Angels, could they mourn in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd our Ruin; and Devils triumph'd in the ſure Deſtruction they hop'd they had effectually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd us into! Then (I ſay) did <hi>the holy and juſt One</hi> reveal his eternal Purpoſes of Grace, his

But how to be entertain'd with Aſtoniſhment and Thankſgiving by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Children of Men! before by their Sin the Heirs of Wrath and Children of Death; and now again the Children of GOD and Heirs of Glory by Faith in JESUS CHRIST. In HIM the <hi>Holineſs,</hi> in HIM the <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD have their full Diſplay, their laſt Glory, and are to be ſeen in their trueſt Light! <hi>Whom</hi> all the Angels of GOD therefore worſhip! congratulate us, and give Glory to GOD on high! <hi>Whom</hi> Devils trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before and fly from, tormented at his Name, knowing who he is, <hi>the holy One of GOD.</hi>

YOU know there is a <hi>great GOD,</hi> You ſay: You do well to believe it and tremble. But O what need is there that our Thoughts, our <hi>Ideas</hi> of this great and bleſſed Being be enlarged! Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infinitely were it poſſible like his Eſſence. What narrow, low, unworthy Conceptions ſhall we at the beſt have of him? When <hi>Saints</hi> come into the other World to <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd will they be of all their little Ideas of GOD here? "<hi>We think as a Child, we ſpeak as a Child.</hi> And when <hi>Sinners</hi> in the next State fall into the Hands of the living GOD, and under his Wrath, how will they be amaz'd at the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, carnal, curſed, mean Thoughts which they now have of him.</p>
               <p>VAST are the <hi>Works</hi> of GOD we ſee: Vaſt our own <hi>Faculties,</hi> the leaſt of us are ready to think: Glorious is the Repreſentation of GOD given us in his Word: Vaſt is every ſingle Perfection which we aſcribe unto him: Vaſt is our Opinion ſometimes of the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Man: Yet GOD is often among the <hi>leaſt</hi> and moſt <hi>diminutive</hi> Things that occur to the Minds or in the Mouths of Men. We think and ſpeak of him lightly: which we could never do did we conſider how incomprehenſibly Great and Good, and Holy and Wiſe and Powerful a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty he is. No, the boldeſt and moſt profane would not dare then to uſe <hi>that glorious Name</hi> in helliſh Blaſphemies, looſe Jeſts, licentious Oaths, Imprecations and Curſes, or in guilty Perjuries: Nor others mock him in falſe ſhews of Devotion; Formality, Hypocriſy and Irreverence in their very Prayers. For if GOD be ſo <hi>great,</hi> can a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004489_0027_100D577AEB0CDFC0"/>common thought of him be innocent? And yet how often are we guilty of this even in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Acts of Prayer or Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. IF GOD be unſearchable, then how faulty are we that we do no more diligently Study, and Search out what may be known of him from his Word and from his Works. How little ſhould we be content in the Knowledge we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? What a Progreſs and Improvement is there eternally to be made? and how ſhould we long for that State of Viſion, where all Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall be done away for ever! Let it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us in the Study of GOD, his Word, and all divine Things. Our Preparation for the Viſion of GOD hereafter lies in our preſent Increaſe in the Knowledge of GOD.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Incomprehenſibility</hi> of GOD is no excuſe for <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Sloth</hi> in us. We may know much more of GOD than we do, and it is our Duty to aſpire and labour after more. Our <hi>intellectual</hi> Perfection and Felicity lies in this. The true Pleaſure and Bleſſedneſs of the intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lies in the Knowledge of the <hi>Creator.</hi> This is the Food of pure Minds, their Light and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diancy.</p>
               <p>SAY not, I can never attain it all: Thou canſt eno', and yet never eno': Thou canſt all that a Creature of thy Faculties was made for; and that is ſo much as ſhall greatly honour thy <hi>Maker,</hi> and advance thee high in Glory and Joys un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable. This Knowledge will be pleaſant to thy Soul; a continual Feaſt, Refreſhment and

               <p>WHAT is more valuable than Knowledge? What do vain Men more affect, than to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd for it? but what is all Science and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Knowledge of God? where is the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> where is the <hi>Scribe,</hi> and the <hi>Wiſdom of this World?</hi> Is it not empty, unprofitable Folly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to this Wiſdom that is from above? As GOD is greater than his Works; ſo is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him before that of all created Things. The Study of <hi>Nature</hi> is of uſe chiefly and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to lead us to the Knowledge of him. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge exalts the human Soul; purifies it now, and glorifies it hereafter. This is to be <hi>wiſe as an Angel of GOD. This is Life eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us bleſs GOD for the Knowledge we have; and being found in the uſe of the Means neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our growth therein, let us pray unto him the <hi>Father of Glory, that he would give us the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of himſelf; the Eyes of our Underſtanding being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

That the People may praiſe him, that all the People may praiſe him! And let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory: Amen and Amen.</hi>

III. IF GOD be unſearchable in his Eſſence, then <hi>what a great Evil is it to Sin againſt him, and to be under his Wrath?</hi> How evil the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how unſearchable the Deſert of Sin? From the Greatneſs of GOD Sin takes it Dimenſions, and is an unknown Evil. It cant be <hi>little</hi> when GOD is ſo <hi>great,</hi> againſt whom it is committed.</p>
               <p>WONDER not at the infinite Puniſhment threatned againſt it: it can deſerve no leſs than infinite Wrath. Guilt and Wrath take their Dimenſion from the infinite Perfections and Glory of GOD. How then do they paſs all Imagination and Fear. Job 37. ult. <hi>With GOD is terrible Majeſty; touching the Almighty we cannot find him out: He is excellent in Power, and in Judgment, and in Plenty of Juſtice: Men do therefore fear before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LITTLE do Sinners conſider with what a <hi>great GOD</hi> they have to do! they have <hi>little</hi> Tho'ts of him, and ſo eaſily deſpiſe his holy Will and dreadful Vengeance! Whereas an Apprehenſion of the divine Greatneſs ought to ſtrike <hi>Terror</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul of every impenitent Sinner. <hi>What wilt thou do when GOD riſeth up? and when he viſiteth, what wilt than anſwer him? Haft thou an Arm like GOD,</hi> and <hi>canſt thou Thunder with a Voice like Him? Dick now thy ſelf with Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>caſt abread the Rage of thy Wrath,</hi> or fear <hi>that</hi> of his, when he ſhall ariſe to Judgment!</p>
               <p>WHEN GOD came down on <hi>Sinai,</hi> and they beheld his Glory, how did the People <hi>quake,</hi> (both Saints and Sinners fearing to be <hi>conſum'd</hi> before
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004489_0030_100D5782499BA010"/>him. And who ſhall be able to ſtand before the fovereign Judge, when he ſhall come at the laſt Day in his Power and great Glory.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. ON the other hand, If the Greatneſs of GOD is unſearchable, then <hi>what a great Thing is it to have his Favour and Bleſſing?</hi> The <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin; <hi>Peace</hi> with him, a <hi>Relation</hi> to him, and <hi>Intereſt</hi> in him; his <hi>Image</hi> in us, his <hi>Comforts</hi> with us, and the Hopes of the <hi>overlaſling Enjoyment</hi> of him in Heaven.</p>
               <p>HOW great muſt <hi>theſe</hi> things be, if GOD is ſo great! <hi>Truly Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it enter into the Heart of Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Things which GOD has prepared for them that love him!</hi> How immenſly Bleſſed muſt they be who are the <hi>elect</hi> and choſen Favourites of this great GOD! who are beloved of him, and ſanctified by him, and who ſhall ſee his Face, and dwell in his Preſence for ever more! When <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Magnificence was beheld, ſaid the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring <hi>Queen, Happy are theſe thy Servants.</hi> How bleſſed then thoſe Souls that ſhall be before the Throne of GOD, and of the Lamb above! The Bleſſedneſs of Heaven muſt be like the Greatneſs of the divine Majeſty who dwells there. As is his Perfection, Power, Dominion and Glory, ſuch muſt the Gifts be that he will beſtow, and the Felicity of his Court. If GOD were leſs, ſo would the Bleſſedneſs of Saints be leſs in Heaven: but as his Greatneſs cannot be ſearched out, ſo the Felicity of Heaven muſt ſurpoſs all our preſent Conceptions. <hi>Compaſſes all Underſtanding,</hi> and therefore ſo does <hi>his Peace.</hi> As the Height and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004489_0031_100D5784011DD7C8"/>Depth, the Length and Breadth of his <hi>Eſſence</hi> can't be taken, ſo neither of his <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN GOD appear'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> it was by the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>GOD Almighty;</hi> GOD Immenſe and Alſufficient: and as was ſaid to him,—<hi>Look now to Heaven, and ſee the Stars—</hi> ſo ſay I— Look we thro' the immenſe Spaces of the Creation and ſee the Greatneſs of the <hi>Former</hi> of all Things; ſuch is the Spread of thy <hi>Happineſs,</hi> if thou art a Child and Servant of GOD. GOD himſelf is thy Portion and exceeding great Reward: this great GOD is thy Friend, and Father, and Saviour: <hi>He has bleſſed thee and thou ſhalt be bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VERILY, for want of enlarged Tho'ts of GOD Saints themſelves have but too little Tho'ts of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel, and the Good contained in them. Does GOD offer his Spirit and Grace, his Son and Juſtification thro' him, his Heaven and Himſelf to us? and are you an Heir of all this, by a Covenant Title, of the free Grace of GOD? O your Bleſſedneſs! while others ſet ſo light by the Offer! ſo eaſily hear it made to them and neglect it! Ah, dull Souls that we have, to be no more affected with, nor moved at, nor wrought upon by theſe incomprehenſible things! Think only <hi>what GOD is,</hi> and it gives all the <hi>Motives</hi> of the Goſpel their true light. <hi>Such</hi> is his Wrath, ſuch is his Love; <hi>Such</hi> is the Loſs, and ſuch the Gain; according to the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of GOD. The Light of Heaven is unapproachable, becauſe GOD is the Light thereof? The Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Hell is inſufferable, becauſe the Vials of

               <p n="5">V. IF GOD is ſo great, <hi>then how great are our Souls?</hi> Whether we conſider them, I. <hi>As the Offspring</hi> of this great Being, and bearing his <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;</hi> in Spirituality, Knowledge, Holineſs, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.

               <p>HE has given his own SON to die in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and redeemed us by his own Blood. He has united himſelf to us and became Man, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced our Nature in that perſonal Union above all Angels and every Name in Heaven.</p>
               <p>OF what Worth and Value then were our Souls in his Eyes? What Thoughts and Counſels has the <hi>great GOD</hi> ſpent upon them?

               <p>THE <hi>leaſt Thought</hi> taken by ſo great a Being, the <hi>leaſt</hi> Thing done by him for our Salvation, would argue the Worth of the Soul exceedingly.

To conclude, Great is the <hi>Faith, Adoration, Submiſſion and Obedience,</hi> which the unſearchable Greatneſs of GOD demands from us.

            <p n="1">1. GOD is unſearchable and incomprehenſible in his Works of <hi>Creation.

            <p n="1">1.

It is the <hi>fixt Opinion</hi> now of <hi>learned Men,</hi> from what they do ſee and know of the Creation by <hi>Telleſcopes,</hi> that there may be, and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are, many ſuch <hi>Worlds</hi> as this which we behold; many ſuch <hi>Circles</hi> as this which our Eyes view, when we take the Compaſs of the Heavens with them.

            <p>How ſoon ſhould I loſe my ſelf in ſpeaking of what we call the <hi>Sky,</hi> containing as we imagine vulgarly the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars.</hi> It would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſtoniſh and amaze moſt of you, if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what <hi>Philoſophy</hi> has advanced about 'em, by the beſt Obſervations, and niceſt Calculation.

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:004489_0039_100D579684949B80"/>but are <hi>Suns to other Worlds,</hi> like what the Sun (in our Heaven, we ſay) it to <hi>our World.</hi> And to come within our own certain Limits, they tell us ſuch inconceivable Things of the <hi>Diſtances</hi> and <hi>Magnitude</hi> of the Sun and Planets within our own <hi>Circle,</hi> that it quite aſtoniſhes a common Mind.</p>
            <p>So that ſuppoſing our own <hi>Syſtem,</hi> which we ſee thro' but very darkly, to be indeed the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> yet is it demonſtrably ſuch a Space as we know not ſcarce how to ſpeak of, but as <hi>Immenſe, Infinite,</hi> &amp;c. tho' in Truth and ſtrictly Speaking multiply this Space a Million times over, and thoſe again Millions of Millions, all together would have a Limit at laſt, and not be properly <hi>Immenſe.</hi> However, to abide by the Word in the <hi>Text,</hi> it is a Space properly <hi>unſearchable,</hi> while we loſe our ſelves in <hi>Numbers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Almighty</hi> put it to <hi>Job,</hi> 38.18. <hi>Haſt thou perceived the Breadth of the Earth?

            <p>And,</p>

            <p n="3">3.

1. <hi>OUR Bodies</hi> are a ſtupendous Piece of divine Workmanſhip.

            <p n="2">2. How much more unſearchable are our <hi>Sculs,</hi> the more immediate <hi>Offſpring</hi> &amp; expreſs <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Father of Spirits.</hi> Indeed we have but poor and confus'd <hi>Ideas</hi> of our own Souls; but that we have Souls we feel and know, being endowed with ſuch <hi>Faculties</hi> as can in no wiſe agree to <hi>Matter</hi> in it ſelf alone, but only to a <hi>ſpiritual Nature.</hi> We find in our ſelves the <hi>Powers</hi> of thinking, reaſoning, remembring, willing, chooſing, deſiring, loathing, ſelf-judging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We can eaſily argue that theſe do not belong to dull and ſtupid <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and therefore that there is in us a <hi>Spirit,</hi> which tho' <hi>united</hi> to this Body is yet <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it, and <hi>performs</hi> theſe noble and ſuperior Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by its vital Union <hi>enlivens</hi> and uſes the Body in its various Offices and Actions of Life, to whoſe Service therefore the Body is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted. It is the <hi>living Soul</hi> that gives the Body
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004489_0049_100D57AC7890E178"/>its Life, Majeſty, Beauty, Vigour: without <hi>this</hi> it becomes a Carcaſe, unſightly, gaſtly, noiſome. The Soul ſits on the <hi>Eye,</hi> and iſſues out its Will at the <hi>Lips,</hi> and all the <hi>Members</hi> are under its Authority.</p>
            <p>MOST wonderful is the ſtrict <hi>Union</hi> of Soul and Body, in which Union both do delight inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and by a moſt tender <hi>Sympathy</hi> ſhare in each others Joys and Sufferings. But what Art or Power could join <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> thus toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and make them ſo natural that their Eaſe and Pain, their Pleaſure and their Grief ſhould be one and the ſame! What has ſo endear'd Things ſo widely different in their Natures!</p>
            <p>THUS are we a Myſtery to our ſelves, and find that within our ſelves which we know not how to deſcribe: A <hi>Mind,</hi> a <hi>Will,</hi> a <hi>Conſcience, Deſires and Affections,</hi> which <hi>how</hi> they are, and how we received them, and how we exerciſe'em we know very imperfectly: but that we have 'em, and that we exerciſe 'em we are very ſure.

            <p>THE Soul of Man is a moſt wonderful thing; the <hi>Light</hi> is not brighter nor ſwiſter than its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it ſurveys the viſible World in a Moment of Time, and forms Images of infinite inviſible Things. It is made to <hi>rule,</hi> to rule the Body, and over the lower Creatures, yea and one <hi>ſingle Mind</hi> over mighty <hi>Nations.</hi> It is nobly endow'd,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004489_0050_100D57AEA0C12990"/>and form'd for great things. A ſovereign Power reſides in it: high are its Attainments: Itaſcends to GOD and Heaven, can know much of him who is inviſible, be <hi>like</hi> him, <hi>honour and glorify</hi> him: which is more than to ſay, that it can <hi>dive</hi> into the Secrets of <hi>Nature,</hi> take the Rule of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> the <hi>Good</hi> of every Thing in it. How tranſcendently Great and Glorious is the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Former</hi> of theſe <hi>noble Beings,</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Men.</p>
            <p>Now if we know not our <hi>little Selves,</hi> how ſhall we conceive of GOD? if we are puzled in our Searches into the Nature of a <hi>finite Spirit,</hi> the Perfection and Powers of an <hi>Angel</hi> or human Soul, how ſhall we underſtand Him who is the <hi>infinite and eternal Spirit!</hi>

               <hi>GOODNESS</hi> form'd our Body for the Soul, and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> breath'd the heaven-born Spirit into the Body. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> furniſh'd the World for our

LET us infer <hi>the Duty of the raitional Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> reſulting from the viſible Creation, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template GOD in his Works,</hi> and to give him <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> and <hi>Praiſes</hi> on account of them. The rational Mind, the Eyes and Tongues of Men were certainly made for this. At the Formation of the Earth <hi>the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of GOD ſhouted</hi> the Praiſes of the CREATOR. The <hi>ſtupid Maſs,</hi> out of which our Bodies were formed, and the Creatures brought forth, could not praiſe him: but <hi>Angels</hi> beheld theſe Worlds of ours come into Being, and then into Order, and gave him the Glory due unto his Name. So neither can the <hi>World that now is,</hi> the Earth and Sea, with the <hi>dumb</hi> Creatures in them, know and laud the <hi>Creator;</hi> but <hi>We</hi> have Underſtanding and Speech to do it for them and from them, and from us the Almighty expects
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004489_0058_100D57C1D3340BD0"/>the Tribute. The <hi>Heathen Poet</hi> this and ſaid, <hi>Os Homini ſublime dedit,</hi> &amp;c.

And this Date of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and conſequent Admiration and <hi>Worſhip</hi> is abundantly preſſed on us in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> A Duty which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are ſadly <hi>wanting</hi> in, tho' why has GOD made us <hi>wiſer</hi> than the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Field, and than the <hi>Fowls</hi> of Heaven, but for this!

We ought fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to conſider with <hi>David,</hi> GOD's <hi>Heavens, the Work of his Fingers, the Moon and the Stars</hi> which he has created; and while we do ſo we ought to be making our devotional Reflections on the Greatneſs, Glory, Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power of the great CREATOR. <hi>The Works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have Pleaſure therein. I will praiſe thee, O LORD, with my whole Heart, I will ſhow forth all thy marvellows Works. Among the Gods there are none like unto thee, O LORD, neither any Works like unto thy Works: All Nations whom thou haſt made ſhall come and worſhip before thee, O LORD, and ſhall glorify the Name: for thou art Great, and doeſt wondrous Things, thou art GOD alone.</hi> Thus ought the <hi>great GOD</hi> to be greatly reverenc'd and honoured by his <hi>reaſonable Creatures.</hi> And indeed the very <hi>Heathens</hi> are left <hi>inexcuſable</hi> in their <hi>Idolatries</hi> and groſs <hi>Immoralities,</hi> from what GOD has ſhewn us of his <hi>Greatneſs and Glory</hi> in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004489_0059_100D57C3AE5FA0B8"/>his <hi>Works.</hi> Excellent is the Strain of Argument and Reaſoning to this purpoſe in the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> No Man that will uſe his Senſes, and obſerve the Heavens and the Earth, can without forfeiting his Reaſon, and the higheſt Contradiction to it, worſhip a <hi>Stock and Stone,</hi> or the Image of Heaven; for if he will but think he muſt eaſily know that all theſe things have ſome glorious <hi>Maker,</hi> whoſe Creature he himſelf is alſo, and <hi>whom</hi> only he muſt therefore Worſhip If a <hi>Heathen</hi> will not thus uſe his Reaſon, he <hi>deſpiſes his Maker,</hi> and diſhonours and abuſes his own Nature: or if he <hi>violates</hi> his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Conſcience, lives like a <hi>Brute</hi> or worſhips a brutal <hi>Form,</hi> he does deſpight unto GOD and is guilty before him as truly, tho' not ſo heinouſly, as we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are if we periſh under the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law.</hi> The Law of <hi>Nature</hi> is a very <hi>ſacred</hi> Law, and the Light of Nature a very <hi>great Light:</hi> to <hi>live up</hi> to it is a very great Thing; and to <hi>quench</hi> it by Luſt, or wilfully to Sin againſt it is a very <hi>high Guilt.</hi>

            <p n="3">3, and laſtly, <hi>NONE</hi> of the Creatures of GOD are in themſelves <hi>vile or diminutive;</hi> but how <hi>little</hi> a Creature is <hi>Man</hi> in the Univerſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his MAKER?

All are admirable: Much of GOD, his Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs and Dominion is to be ſeen in each, and in all of them. GOD who knows his own Work treats them all with a Regard.

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004489_0060_100D57C534B8F2C0"/>Heads are numbred by him.

Let the Work of GOD be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways honourable and glorious to us; and as GOD has put the Honour of a <hi>ſuperior Nature</hi> on us, crowning us with his own <hi>Image and Likeneſs;</hi> ſo let us <hi>reverence our ſelves</hi> and debaſe neither Soul nor Body from thoſe rational and religious Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the LORD our GOD has deſign'd us for.</p>
            <p>BUT at the ſame time, in the midſt of this vaſt Creation, <hi>LORD, what is Man!</hi> What Reaſons for <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Abaſement in our own Eyes may we fetch from the Unſearchableneſs of GOD in his Works? How <hi>little</hi> is it that any ſingle Perſon <hi>poſſeſſes</hi> of this vaſt Creation? The <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the Earth parcel it out among themſelves, but what have they at laſt to be proud of?

            </p>
            <p>THAT there is a glorious <hi>Providence</hi> exerciſed over all things, whereby in all their Motions and Actions all Creatures are upheld and govern'd, in a moſt holy wiſe and powerful Manner, is one of the <hi>firſt Doctrines of natural Religion.</hi> As ſure as the <hi>Being</hi> of a GOD, and the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, ſo ſure is the Doctrine of his <hi>Providence.</hi> If GOD <hi>created</hi> it, he muſt <hi>uphold</hi> it. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Things in their beautiful and uſeful Order requires the ſame Power and Wiſdom which gave them their Being and Uſe. If GOD made
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004489_0063_100D57CCB9BF0CF0"/>the World it can neither be <hi>below</hi> him, nor <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> to him to govern it: Nay, it muſt be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his <hi>Glory,</hi> and part of his <hi>Felicity</hi> to do ſo. Can it be his <hi>Diſhonour</hi> to be the <hi>Governor of the Univerſe?</hi> the LORD over all, in the actual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>Rule?</hi> or can it be a <hi>Burthen</hi> to the <hi>infinite Mind,</hi> to the <hi>almighty Word,</hi> to which all Things are alike <hi>eaſy?</hi> A <hi>Million</hi> as <hi>One!</hi> and the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> as the <hi>Leaſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, I ſhall now take it for granted that there is an all-diſpoſing <hi>Providence,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have only to ſay—<hi>How unſearchable the Greatneſs of GOD is appearing in it!</hi> in the <hi>Order, Suſtentation</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of every thing which we behold.</p>
            <p>IN general: How unſearchable is the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality</hi> of a Providence! A <hi>ſufficient</hi> Care had to <hi>all</hi> Things, infinitely <hi>various,</hi> however <hi>diſtant,</hi> however <hi>oppoſite</hi> in their Nature; at the <hi>ſame</hi> Time, for <hi>Ever-more,</hi> and with infinite <hi>Eaſe!</hi> What a <hi>glorious Mind</hi> is it that does this! Every <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Kind</hi> preſerv'd, and in all their <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals</hi> ſupply'd, in their conſtant <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> from the Beginning of the World unto this Day! and all over-rul'd and directed to the wiſeſt and beſt <hi>Ends,</hi> by his ſovereign Influence and Will! So that in the infinite Variety and Contrariety of Creatures, they are all made together to ſerve unto the <hi>general Good</hi> of the Univerſe, the <hi>mutual Benefit</hi> of one another, and the <hi>high Glory</hi> of the CREATOR ultimately. Here is perfect <hi>Order</hi> in ſeeming wild Confuſions, and perfect <hi>Harmony</hi> in all preſent ſeeming Diſcords and Jarrings.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004489_0064_100D57CE57A0D400"/>But the mean while it is perfect <hi>Myſtery</hi> and an unſearchable Conduct. Eccl. 3 11. <hi>He has made every Thing beautiful in his Time, alſo he hath ſet the World in their Heart,</hi> ("given a whole World of Matter for the Hearts of Men copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to meditate on) <hi>yet ſo that no Man can find out the Work that GOD maketh from the Beginning to the End.</hi>

            <p n="1">I.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THE greateſt <hi>Things.</hi> By which I mean the viſible <hi>Orbs</hi> and <hi>Globes;</hi> the vaſt <hi>planetary Bodies,</hi> whereof our Earth is one. What a <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Being</hi> is HE, who has aſſign'd to <hi>theſe</hi> their <hi>Diſtances, Places, Motions, Center, Magnetiſm,</hi> and they inviolably obey the <hi>Law</hi> he gave them for Ever-more, in their exact <hi>Revolutions.</hi> If the great GOD did not govern <hi>theſe</hi> in our Favour, how ſoon wou'd the Earth <hi>ſink</hi> under us, and the <hi>Pit open</hi> and ſwallow us quick; or the Sea <hi>drown</hi> us! If the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhould roll near to us it would ſoon <hi>ſcorch</hi> us to Death; or if the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhould roll further from it we ſhould be as ſoon <hi>frozen</hi> ſtiff with Cold: if the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhould leave us and

Now how great is that <hi>Providence</hi> which keeps theſe <hi>vaſt Bodies</hi> in their Places, and makes 'em ſo kindly miniſter to one another thro' every Generation? So that <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Winter; Tides, Dews</hi> and <hi>Rains</hi> do not fail us; but <hi>vital Heat and Moiſture and Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is provided for and preſerved unto us and all the living Creatures!</p>
            <p>BUT to keep to our own <hi>Limits</hi> a little more,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is the <hi>unſearchable Power</hi> of GOD that commands the <hi>Winds,</hi> and infinite is the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> which orders that mild or wild <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the <hi>Air.</hi> How thin, and light, and ſoft and yielding an Element in its <hi>Calm?</hi> how ſtrong, and fierce, and raging, ſpreading wide Deſolations, when GOD bids it ſtorm? How much is the World govern'd by the Miniſtrations thereof? GOD uſes it, raiſes and ſtills it as he pleaſe. <hi>His Way is in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Duſt of his Feet!

               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:004489_0066_100D57D367D39A38"/>
THUS GOD looks to the Ends of the Earth, and ſeeth under the whole Heavens, to make the Weight for the Winds, and to weigh the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by Meaſure; to give Decrees to the Rain, and to make a Way for the Lightning and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; he ſees it and declares it, he prepares it and ſearches it out; which none beſide him can do. He cauſeth it to come whether for Correction or Mercy. Now out of the <hi>South</hi> comes the <hi>Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> out of the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>Froſt</hi> is the Breath of GOD: Preſently again he <hi>quieteth</hi> is the Earth by the ſame <hi>South Wind,</hi> and we know not how our <hi>Garments grow warm</hi> upon us. Now he <hi>perſecutes</hi> a guilty World by his Tempeſts, and makes them afraid by his Storm; again he merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>fanns</hi> and <hi>purges</hi> the Air for us, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Winds out of his <hi>Treaſures,</hi> and the pleas'd <hi>Mariners</hi> improve the welcome <hi>Gale,</hi> the <hi>Ships</hi> ſtagger under their Courſes, and are driven with their rich <hi>Freight</hi> to their <hi>Port.</hi> Thus the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs of GOD is ſeen in the <hi>blowing</hi> of the Wind.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

There <hi>go the Ships,</hi> and there <hi>plays Leviathan!</hi> Let us look and <hi>dive</hi> a little into this <hi>wide and great Sea,</hi> wherein are Things creeping <hi>innumerable,</hi> both ſmall and great Beaſts, which do all wait upon GOD, as
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004489_0067_100D57D543D55A90"/>much as the Creatures on the <hi>Land</hi> do, and he gives them their Meat in due Seaſon, they are filled with Good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Men</hi> go down to this <hi>Sea</hi> in Ships, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Buſineſs</hi> on theſe <hi>mighty Waters;</hi> they ſee the <hi>Works</hi> of GOD and his <hi>Wonders</hi> on the Deep: Sometimes to their Terror and great Danger he commandeth and raiſeth the <hi>ſtormy Wind,</hi> which lifteth up the Waves; they <hi>mount</hi> up to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, they <hi>go down</hi> again to the Depths, their Souls <hi>melt</hi> for Trouble, they <hi>reel</hi> to and fro, they <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> like drunken Men, and are at their Wits end: then they <hi>cry</hi> unto the LORD in their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (to <hi>Him</hi> that made the Sea and rules it, and is the <hi>Confidence</hi> of all that are afar off upon it) they cry to him as from the <hi>Belly of Hell,</hi> and he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them out of their <hi>Diſtreſſes:</hi> He maketh the Storm a Calm, the Waves are ſtill, the <hi>Mariners</hi> Hearts at eaſe and glad, ſo he bringeth them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>deſir'd Haven, Pſal.</hi> 107.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>what Manner of Word</hi> and Rule is this, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Winds and Seas obey?</hi> The <hi>eternal Word</hi> as it were <hi>awaked</hi> in the <hi>Storm</hi> and rebuking it: ſaying—<hi>Peace be ſtill—and there is a great Calm!</hi> O that Men would <hi>praiſe</hi> the LORD for his Greatneſs, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men!

            </p>
            <p>THIS is no ſmall part of the divine Dominion, <hi>from Sea to Sea.</hi> His <hi>Way</hi> is in the Sea, &amp; his <hi>Paths</hi> in the great Waters, and his <hi>Footſteps are not know,</hi> Pſal. 77.19.

The <hi>Floods</hi> may lift up their <hi>Voice</hi> and their Waves, but the LORD on high is mightier than the <hi>Noiſe</hi> of many Waters, yea than the <hi>mighty Waves</hi> of the Sea.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>dry Land,</hi> our <hi>habitable Earth,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a moſt wonderful, wiſe, gracious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preſervation and Government. How is it <hi>ſtock'd</hi> with Creatures, and not a Species loſt!

What rich and vaſt Stores of <hi>Vapours</hi> are daily aſcendings, and by Night deſcending in <hi>Dews</hi> on us? Why does not the Earth <hi>ſink</hi> in the vaſt Abyſs, how does it <hi>ſwim</hi> ſo <hi>even</hi> in it, and ſo <hi>ſafely</hi> in the ſtormy Day? Or rather what Power <hi>reſtrains</hi> the foaming Waters in its ſpacious <hi>Womb?</hi> What ſaves us from deſolating <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> and who is it that now and then creates that <hi>new</hi> and rare <hi>thing;</hi> when the Earth opens its Mouth and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up <hi>Cities;</hi> Multitudes go down together quick and <hi>alive into the Pit. "He removeth the Mountains at his Pleaſure, and they know it not, he overturneth them in his Anger; he ſhaketh the Earth our her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble,</hi> Job 9.5, 6. But the <hi>ordinary Courſe</hi> of his Providence is <hi>gracicus</hi> and bountiful, a <hi>tender Car:</hi> and Mercy to us: "<hi>By his Strongth he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth faſt the Mountains, being girded with Power; be makes the Morning and Evening to rejoice; he

            <p>AND thus I have in the <hi>Phraſe of Scripture</hi> meditated the divine <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> reſpecting the greater Parts of the <hi>Creation;</hi> the <hi>Orbs</hi> and <hi>Globes</hi> we ſee in <hi>our</hi> World, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly our own <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea.</hi>

Yet did not the Beaſt, the Miniſter of the divine Juſtice that Day, harm him at all, not having the Commiſſion from GOD.</p>
            <p>To name no more: When the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> weary of the <hi>Ark</hi> had put it in a <hi>New Cart,</hi> and their <hi>Sin-offering</hi> with it, to be drawn by two <hi>Milch-kine</hi> that had never before been <hi>yok'd,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the <hi>late Diſpenſations</hi> of Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them upon this Iſſue: 1 Sam. 6.9. <hi>If it goeth up by the Way of its own Courſe,</hi> (i e. in the <hi>Road</hi> and ſtreight <hi>Highway</hi> toward the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Road that the Creatures had never gone, nor indeed had they ever drawn at all in a Yoke) <hi>then hath the GOD of Iſrael done us this great Evil; but if not, then ſhall we know that it was not his Hand that ſmote us, but it was a Chance that hapned to us.</hi> Providence <hi>agreed</hi> and join'd <hi>Iſſue</hi> on the <hi>Event,</hi> and both the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw the Glory of JEHOVAH, the only true and living GOD.

            </p>
            <p>NOW what an unſearchable Government is this over the living Creatures and <hi>brute Animals,</hi> beſides their uſual abundant Services to Man. But to paſs from the <hi>greater Things and Creatures;</hi> unto <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Intelligences</hi> created.</p>
            <p n="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Providence of GOD in its Government of <hi>intelligent and rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> whether in Heaven, Earth or Hell; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Men and Devils.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>boly Angels</hi> and their <hi>high Orders,</hi> we know by Revelation that they are a <hi>noble Part</hi> of GOD's Dominion. We read of their ready Obedience, Subjection and Miniſtrations. "<hi>They excel in Strength, and do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hearkning unto the Voice of his Word: Are they not miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth?</hi> And do they not gladly <hi>come,</hi> pleas'd in the loweſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to Men? They humbly own themſelves the <hi>Fellow-Servants</hi> of Prophets and holy Saints. They worſhip and adore GOD the CREATOR, and the <hi>Lamb</hi> our SAVIOUR with more Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as Fervour and Delight, than we on Earth can attain unto. They <hi>cover their Faces,</hi> tho' ſo bright, and cry—<hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD GOD of Hoſts! the whole Earth is full of thy Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:004489_0073_100D57E25AF86758"/>
AT the ſame time theſe <hi>Thrones</hi> and <hi>Dominions</hi> in the Heavens are ſuch <hi>high and potent Beings,</hi> that the Empire over a few of theſe we may think more glorious to the CREATOR, than the Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Nations of the Earth. They ſeem, ſome of them, to have a <hi>Preſidency</hi> as <hi>Princes</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Empires</hi> here below; but however that be, we know them to be ſo mighty Beings, that a <hi>ſingle One,</hi> by the divine Commiſſion, could ſlay <hi>Nations</hi> in a Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>DEVILS</hi> that fell from Heaven, yet have not made their <hi>Eſcape</hi> from the divine Dominion and Government. When ſome of the <hi>Hoſts</hi> of Angels revolted from GOD, how eaſily were they caſt down to Hell? And ſhall be ſhut up there for ever in a Pit and <hi>Priſon,</hi> together with the weaker wretched <hi>Ghoſts</hi> of ungodly Men. This <hi>infernal</hi> Priſon ſhews the Greatneſs and Dominion of Providence, as well as the <hi>Palace</hi> of Heaven: Here the Triumphs of <hi>Grace,</hi> and there thoſe of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Read the Power of GOD over <hi>Devils:</hi> Rev. 20.1, 2. <hi>And I ſaw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the Key of the bottomleſs Pit, and a great Chain in his Hand; and he laid hold on the Dragon, that old Serpent the Devil and Satan, and bound him—, and caſt him into the Pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a Scal upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED <hi>evil Spirits</hi> have a <hi>Range</hi> permitted to them, and are <hi>us'd</hi> too by Providence in <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Executions,</hi> as in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Seduction, and <hi>Judas</hi> his tragical End. But they are under <hi>Reſtraints,</hi> and <hi>Fruſtrations;</hi> are limited, and over-rul'd to good, as well as wicked Men. The Devil could
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004489_0074_100D57E499B24EE0"/>not touch <hi>Job</hi> nor his Subſtance till GOD ſuffer'd him: nor enter into the Herd of <hi>Swine</hi> without our SAVIOUR's Permiſſion; at whoſe Sight he trembled alſo and lay groveling in Torment. In their malicious Deſires and Deſigns againſt GOD and our Souls, they are often made Inſtrumental to the Salvation of Souls; as eminently in the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> It is the Greatneſs and Glory of GOD to have theſe <hi>"Slaves at the "Oar,</hi> while Providence <hi>ſteers</hi> the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. GREAT is the Providence of GOD in the Government of <hi>Mankind. In his Hand is the Soul of every living Thing, and the Breath of all Mankind,</hi> Job 12.9. <hi>He ruleth by his Power for ever, his Eyes behold the Nations,</hi> Pſal 66.7. Let us here contemplate:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Greatneſs of Providence in the Diſpoſal and Government of the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the Earth.</item>
                  <item>2. Of every <hi>individual Perſon.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Greatneſs of Providence is illuſtrious in its Government of <hi>Nations, Kingdoms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi> By GOD <hi>Kings rule and Princes decree Juſtice;</hi> yea, even the inferior <hi>Judges</hi> of the Earth are ordained by him. He ſetteth up Kings and removeth them, he exalts and abaſes them; he enlarges the Nations and diminiſhes them again. <hi>GOD is the King of all the Earth: GOD reigneth over the Heathen; GOD ſitteth upon the Throne of his Holineſs: the Shields of the Earth belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD; he is greatly exalted,</hi> Pſal. 47.9.</p>
            <p>HE has ordained <hi>Government</hi> for the Good of the World. He permits <hi>Tyrants</hi> for a Scourge
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004489_0075_100D57E7E6340B68"/>and Puniſhment of it. He uſes the <hi>Powers</hi> on Earth to ſerve his Church and Truth, when they know it not nor mean it. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was his <hi>Shepherd,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was his <hi>Rod. Daniel's four Beaſts</hi> in their rice, ravages and final Deſtruction, were each under the ſtrict notice of Providence: and ſo is the <hi>little Horn,</hi> which yet keeps boaſting of its Power from Heaven, to bind <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves and the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of their People.</p>
            <p>PROVIDENCE <hi>reſtrains</hi> the proud Powers on Earth, and takes its time to <hi>puniſh</hi> them. It decks it ſelf now with <hi>Majeſty and Excellency,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rays it ſelf with <hi>Glory and Beauty:</hi> It caſts abroad the <hi>Rage</hi> of its Wrath, and beholds every one that is proud to <hi>abaſe</hi> him. It treads down the wicked in the Duſt; and it is gloriouſly ſeen that the <hi>Moſt High ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men,</hi> and giveth them to whomſoever he will.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, He giveth <hi>Salvation unto Kings;</hi> takes their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> under a more ſpecial Care and Guard, and their <hi>Counſels</hi> under a ſpecial gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Influence. He <hi>turns</hi> their Hearts, which are <hi>deep,</hi> as the <hi>Rivers</hi> of Waters, and by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or diſpiriting, infatuating or directing them, be brings about what <hi>Revolutions</hi> he pleaſes with the utmoſt Eaſe and Certainty: A <hi>ſingle</hi> Spirit in his Hand being as the <hi>Helm</hi> in the <hi>Pilots,</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the vaſteſt Bodies of People, either in Mercy or in Judgment. At the <hi>Council-Board</hi> divine Providence preſides, fruſtrating the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> and he <hi>hangs</hi> himſelf for Madneſs; and circumventing the deep Deſigns of <hi>Haman,</hi> and hangs him on the <hi>Gallows</hi> which he had rear'd
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004489_0076_100D57E9950DC158"/>for another. Job 12.16—23. <hi>With him is Strength and Wiſdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his. He leadeth Counſellors away ſpoiled, and maketh the Judges fools. He looſeth the Bond of Kings, and girdeth their Loins with a Girdle. He leadeth Princes away ſpoiled, and overthroweth the Mighty. He removeth away the Speech of the truſly, and taketh away the Underſtanding of the Aged. He poureth Contempt upon Princes, and weakneth the Strength of the Mighty. He diſcovereth deep Things out of Darkneſs, and bringeth out to Light the Shadow of Death.</hi> Now if this be the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of GOD over Kings and Governments, what muſt we ſay of it but as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did, <hi>I bleſs the moſt High, and I praiſe and honour him that liveth for ever, whoſe Dominion is an everlaſting Dominion, and his Kingdom is from Generation to Generation: — I extol the King of Heaven, all whoſe Works are Truth, and his Ways Judgment, and thoſe that walk in Pride he is able to abaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. UNSEARCHABLE is the Providence of GOD in its governing, ordering and diſpoſing the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of every <hi>individual Perſon, Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Child,</hi> thro' every Generation: the <hi>Care</hi> that extends to all, the Power that <hi>protects,</hi> the Goodneſs that <hi>ſupplies</hi> all, and the Wiſdom that <hi>orders</hi> the Concerns of all, in the <hi>beſt</hi> manner, for all <hi>together,</hi> and for each <hi>diſtinctly.</hi> This we muſt needs believe, but it is too <hi>myſterious</hi> to ſee clearly thro' it now.</p>
            <p n="1">1. UNSEARCHABLE is GOD's Empire over the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, their <hi>Mind, Thoughts, Conſciences, Wills, Deſires, Purpoſes. The LORD ſearcheth
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004489_0077_100D57EBD2F8A4C8"/>all Hearts,</hi> and knows all Thoughts: He gave <hi>Solomon</hi> his Wiſdom and Largeneſs of Heart, <hi>David</hi> his Courage and Art for War, <hi>Abithophel</hi> and <hi>Huſhai</hi> their Spirit of Counſel and Judgment; and <hi>Abſalom's</hi> Raſhneſs and Fickleneſs was alſo from his Dominion over the Spirit. As to Men's <hi>Deſires</hi> he reſtrains them when he will, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Will: as he with-held <hi>Abimelech</hi> from touching <hi>Sarab,</hi> how fierce ſoever his Love, and his Soul inflam'd by her Beauty. Mens <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> he lays, as he does the <hi>raging of the Sea</hi> and the noiſe of its Waves; ſo the <hi>Tumult of the People.</hi> Even the Spirits of the <hi>mutinous Multitude</hi> he governs, in all their wild <hi>Projects</hi> and <hi>Executions.</hi> He turns the Heart in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Hatred to Love, as <hi>Eſau's</hi> to <hi>Jacob:</hi> and from Revenge into Endearment, as <hi>David</hi>'s before the wiſe <hi>Abigail;</hi> and again from Envy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Admiration &amp; Eſteem, as <hi>Saul</hi> when he ſtopp'd in the midſt of his purſuit at the Voice of <hi>David,</hi> and turn'd back praiſing and bleſſing him. In like manner when the <hi>Soldiers</hi> in the heat of <hi>Fight</hi> and fluſh'd with <hi>Victory</hi> were ruſhing upon <hi>Jeboſhaphat,</hi> the <hi>good King</hi> did but <hi>cry</hi> to the LORD and they <hi>turn'd</hi> from him. I might alſo ſpeak here of GOD's Empire over <hi>Conſcience,</hi> making Men a <hi>Terror</hi> to themſelves when he pleaſes, as <hi>Cain, Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> In <hi>theſe</hi> and many other ways GOD appears the Governor and the Judge of the <hi>Spirits of all Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. GREAT is the Empire of Providence <hi>in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and over-ruling the Luſts and Sins of Men to its own Glory, and abundance of Good ſometimes to Themſelves and Others.</hi> It is a <hi>Myſtery</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004489_0078_100D57EEAE69CA48"/>which only <hi>Revelation</hi> can unfold to us and enlighten us in, that ſo much <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> therefrom is permitted to be in the World. But as Man bro't Sin and Miſery upon himſelf, being made by GOD at firſt holy and happy; ſo the great GOD lets the fallen Creature ſee his Glory and Greatneſs in that he can yet <hi>govern Him,</hi> and his very <hi>Sins,</hi> and all the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Diſorders</hi> that attend the ſame, unto moſt <hi>wiſe and great and holy Ends;</hi> to <hi>his own</hi> Glory, to the Good of <hi>others,</hi> and even to the Salvation of Sinners themſelves. <hi>Joſeph's Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> ſinn'd in <hi>ſelling</hi> him, his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> alſo in her foul and falſe <hi>Accuſation</hi> of him; they glutted their <hi>Hatred and Spite,</hi> and tho't they had <hi>ruin'd</hi> him for ever: but all the while they were the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> of Providence toward his <hi>Advancement,</hi> and the ſaving of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> from Famine. <hi>Haman</hi> meditated his own <hi>Revenge,</hi> and the ſatiating his <hi>bloody Hatred</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but Providence made it the very means of their <hi>Peace &amp; Enlargement. Pharaob</hi>'s <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> gave GOD and his <hi>Iſrael</hi> thoſe <hi>Triumphs,</hi> which will be celebrated in the <hi>Church</hi> for ever. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans, Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> united againſt the LORD <hi>CHRIST</hi> and <hi>crucify'd</hi> him; but it was to do what the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> of GOD had <hi>before determined</hi> for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of the World, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.26, 28. Yea, Mens <hi>foul Sins</hi> have been made the Means of their own <hi>Converſion:</hi> O <hi>myſterious</hi> Providence, and <hi>unſearchable</hi> Grace! Thus are Sinners ſometimes effectually <hi>awakened</hi> to ſee their own exceeding <hi>Vileneſs,</hi> and Sins <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> 
               <q>Thus <hi>Medicines</hi> are made of <hi>Poiſons,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:004489_0079_100D57F0D4A7D780"/>and the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of the <hi>Scorpion</hi> a <hi>Cure</hi> for the <hi>Bite</hi> of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Myſtery of GOD's governing Providence in the <hi>preſent unequal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Proſperity and Adverſity.</hi> This from the Days of Old has been a <hi>Wonder</hi> in Providence, if not an <hi>Objection</hi> againſt it. <hi>Job</hi> in his <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſpake of it, as well as <hi>Aſaph</hi> in his <hi>Inſirmity</hi> complain'd of it. But it is eaſy to clear the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of Providence in this Diſpoſition of Things, from the Conſideration of GOD's <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> our own <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Deſerts,</hi> the diſtinguiſhing <hi>Judgments</hi> we ſee at times inflicted on <hi>ſingular Sinners,</hi> and the Knowledge we have of a <hi>future State,</hi> and a <hi>juſt Recompence</hi> then to every one according to his Works done here in the Body. Yet nothing is more Myſterious and Unſearchable than <hi>this Conduct</hi> of Providence in a thouſand <hi>particular Inſtances,</hi> if we conſider them by <hi>themſelves.</hi> Thus for Inſtance, <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>Trial</hi> was an unſearchable Thing; <hi>amazing</hi> to himſelf, as well as <hi>confounding</hi> to his wiſe and religious Friends. And ſo very often have the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence been dark and myſterious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Church.</hi> Iſai. 31.2. <hi>He alſo is wiſe and will bring Evil.</hi> 45.15. <hi>Verily thou art a GOD that hideſt thy ſelf, O GOD of Iſrael the Saviour.</hi> Pſal. 36.6. <hi>Thy Righteouſneſs is like the great Mountains, thy Judgments are a great deep; O LORD thou preſerveſt Man and Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have very briefly conſider'd the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty of GOD in that Providence, which HE exerciſes over the Higheſt and Greateſt of his

THE Greatneſs and Majeſty of GOD is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable in that Providence which he exerciſes over the <hi>leaſt and loweſt of his Creatures.</hi> For it is moſt certain that the preſerving and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence of GOD extends to the <hi>meaneſt and moſt minute Things</hi> which he has made: Nor can this look <hi>little</hi> in the <hi>ſupream Majeſty</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but it is his <hi>true and infinite Greatneſs.</hi> It is not like the contemptible <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> who was trifling and <hi>catching Flies</hi> when he ſhould have been at the <hi>Council-Board,</hi> bearing and directing the weighty Affairs of the <hi>Empire.</hi> GOD <hi>neglects none</hi> of his Creatures, and leaſt of all do the <hi>greater Affairs</hi> of the World eſcape him. His <hi>general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Care</hi> is to the <hi>leaſt,</hi> a more <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> is over the <hi>greateſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE narrow Mind of <hi>Man</hi> can attend but to a <hi>few</hi> Things at a time, and therefore they had need always be the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>weightier:</hi> but the infinite <hi>GOD</hi> with the ſame Eaſe governs and cares for a <hi>Million</hi> of Creatures as <hi>One;</hi> and <hi>ten
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004489_0081_100D57F4E59E43A8"/>Million ſwarms of Gnats,</hi> as a Family of Men. Nor is it <hi>below</hi> him, any more than it was to <hi>create the Inſect,</hi> which all the Art and Powers of Creatures can't do. Nay, the Things which GOD has ſeen good to make, he <hi>muſt needs</hi> take care of, for they are the Work of his Hand.</p>
            <p>"Do you ſee thouſands of <hi>little Motes and Atoms</hi> wandring up and down in a <hi>Sun-Beam?</hi> (ſays Biſhop <hi>Hopkins</hi>) it is GOD that ſo peoples it: He <hi>guides</hi> their in numerable and irregular Stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Not a <hi>Duſt</hi> flies in the beaten Road, but its uncertain Motion is guided, and the <hi>Storm</hi> ſhall not carry it further than its appointed Place.</p>
            <p>OUR SAVIOUR tells us that the <hi>Hairs of our Head are numbred,</hi> and that tho' <hi>two Sparrows</hi> be but the Price of a <hi>Farthing, yet not one of them falls to the Ground without our Father in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 10.29, 30. The <hi>great GOD</hi> alſo was pleaſed to <hi>magnify himſelf</hi> to his Servant <hi>Job,</hi> from the Care he takes of the <hi>wild Goats of the Rocks,</hi> and the <hi>wild Aſſes of the Wilderneſs. David</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates his Maker likewiſe from his Care of the <hi>Birds of the Air,</hi> and the <hi>Shoals of ſmall Fiſh in the Sea.</hi> It is the Honour and Glory of GOD thus to extend his Care to the moſt <hi>minute</hi> of his Works.</p>
            <p>FOR how <hi>great</hi> would that <hi>King</hi> be tho't, who were <hi>able to know and ſupply</hi> every Want of the leaſt of his Subjects, and could daily ſerve them with the Fruits of his <hi>royal Bounty?</hi> It is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Honour of the <hi>Grecian Prince,</hi> that he could callevery one of his vaſt <hi>Army</hi> by Name; and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004489_0082_100D57F7F4E4FC30"/>is it not the Glory of GOD to know and provide for the leaſt of all <hi>his Hoſts?</hi> That as it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo in a Senſe it may be of <hi>every Creature, — I know thee by Name, and thou haſt found Grace in my Sight,</hi> ſo far as the Neceſſities of thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Place in my Creation requires. Or as it is ſaid of the <hi>Stars,</hi> ſo may it be of a <hi>Fly</hi> or a <hi>Mote,</hi> Pſal. 147.4. <hi>He telleth the Number of them all, he calleth them all by their Names: Great is our LORD, and of great Power, his Underſtanding is infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, We know alſo how GOD <hi>uſes the ſmalleſt Creatures</hi> in his wiſe Providence <hi>to the greateſt Effects,</hi> and in unſearchable <hi>Manner</hi> to the <hi>Preſervation</hi> or <hi>Deſtruction of Mankind.</hi> How many groſs and <hi>noxious Attoms</hi> do the <hi>Flics,</hi> the <hi>Spiders,</hi> the <hi>Toads,</hi> &amp;c, ſuck in and deliver us from? And ſo GOD's Care of them is his Care of <hi>us:</hi> Their <hi>miniſtry</hi> to us is unknown. Again, GOD brings forth his <hi>great Armies of Caterpillars, Locuſts, Canker-Worms, and Palmer-Worms,</hi> and how do the Inhabitants of the Earth tremble and fail before them? Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> were plagued with <hi>Lice,</hi> and beaten by <hi>Frogs and Flies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III To multiply no further Inſtances: The Greatneſs of Providence is unſearchable in its Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, Diſpoſing and Government of what we call <hi>Accident and Chance, Fortuitous and Caſual.</hi> Many things are ſo <hi>to us,</hi> but nothing is ſo to GOD. They are his <hi>Counſel,</hi> tho' to us <hi>Contingent.</hi> The <hi>Divine Mind</hi> directs in all caſual <hi>Motions and Events.</hi> There is no <hi>Goddeſs Fortune</hi> to be found
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004489_0083_100D57F98137F360"/>
               <hi>in Heaven,</hi> however the blind <hi>Heathen Poet</hi> wou'd have <hi>plac'd her there.</hi> It ſuits only the Mouth of a <hi>Philiſtine</hi> to ſay, <hi>A Chance has hapned unto us.</hi> There is no ſuch Thing to an <hi>Omniſcient Mind,</hi> an <hi>all-diſpoſing Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Lot <hi>is caſt into the Lap, but the whole diſpoſing it is of GOD,</hi> Prov. 16.33 Thus <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> was accurately ſelected out of the many thouſands of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It was an <hi>Appeal</hi> to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence to diſcover the <hi>Sinner</hi> and his <hi>accurſed Thing.</hi> So <hi>Jonathan</hi> was taken, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>raſh Father</hi> for his unadviſed <hi>Adjuration.</hi> Hence the uſe of <hi>Lottery</hi> has been by many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed too <hi>ſacred</hi> to be made common; becauſe the LORD only can <hi>give a perfect Lot.</hi> To be ſure the religious and ſolemn Uſe of it ſuppoſes the Government of divine Providence in thoſe things that are moſt contingent with us.</p>
            <p>DISGUIZED <hi>Ahab</hi> was thus ſingled out, not by the <hi>Soldier,</hi> but by <hi>Providence</hi> in the <hi>Battel. He drew a Bow at a venture,</hi> but the Arrow enter'd between the <hi>Joints of the Harneſs of the King of Iſrael. Accidental</hi> to their own Intention Men often accompliſh <hi>ſpecial Purpoſes</hi> of GOD; and are <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> of much undeſigned Good in their <hi>occaſional Actions; Natural, Civil and Political. Pharaoh's Dau'ter</hi> came accidentally to the <hi>River</hi> to take up <hi>Moſes,</hi> and give him a <hi>Princely Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> to be in time the <hi>Deliverer of Iſrael. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> his <hi>Taxing</hi> the World fulfilled the glorious <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah's Birth at Betblehem. Saul</hi> by wandring after his <hi>Aſſes</hi> is led to a <hi>Crown.</hi> When a Man <hi>ſhoots</hi> after <hi>Game</hi> and kills his
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004489_0084_100D57FB2773ABA0"/>Nei'bour whom he ſaw not, or if a Man be <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Tree</hi> and the Head of his <hi>Ax</hi> fly off and kill his Nei'bour, in theſe Caſes the <hi>LORD is ſaid to deliver</hi> the one and the other into his Nei'bours Hand.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort:</p>
            <p>WHATEVER is done <hi>by Deſign,</hi> or wherein the Wills of Men are purſued, is by do means done at laſt without the Will of GOD <hi>over-ruling</hi> them: And whatever is effected <hi>without</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> the Mind of Creatures, has the Counſel and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of GOD in it.</p>
            <p>AND now let us make a <hi>pauſe</hi> a little, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the unſearchable <hi>Perfection</hi> ſhining forth in <hi>this Government</hi> of the World! What <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge!</hi> What <hi>Goodreſs, Care</hi> and <hi>Bounty!</hi> What <hi>Power!</hi> and in <hi>all</hi> what <hi>Greatneſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>WISDOM and Knowledge.</hi> So <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in Viſion ſaw the <hi>Wheels</hi> (the Globes and Orbs of the Univerſe, rolling like Balls) on their <hi>four Sides;</hi> the Rim of them high and dreadful, and <hi>full of Eyes</hi> round about. The Eye of Providence is on the whole <hi>Circle</hi> of Creatures, and all their Motions are wiſely directed thereby; as if every <hi>Orb</hi> had a Million of <hi>Eyes,</hi> and each of them a <hi>wiſe Intelligence</hi> for its Guidance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>GOODNESS</hi> to the <hi>leaſt</hi> and to the <hi>worſt</hi> of Creatures: rich, free and ſovereign <hi>Goodneſs!</hi> Never weary, never failing! never ſhort or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! But abundantly ſufficient, and ſuper-abundant
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004489_0085_100D57FE2AD4D030"/>to all the Numbers, and all the wide Extents, and all the capacious Natures in the Univerſe. <hi>The Earth is full of his Riches.</hi> The World ſwims in it as in a boundleſs <hi>Ocean;</hi> and its <hi>Streams</hi> run circling thro' all its habitable Parts to water them: the <hi>River of GOD which is full of Water!</hi> all Creature daily drink thereof and are filled. The divine Bounty that ſupplies us Day by Day is like the <hi>Manna</hi> every Morning about our Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and the <hi>Flights</hi> of <hi>Quails</hi> of old might ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er far be numbred than the Supplies of every Evening. <hi>The Earth is the LORD's, and the Fulneſs thereof:</hi> It's Stores are divided among the Children of Men with a munificent Hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE <hi>Power</hi> is diſplay'd in the Exerciſe of a <hi>Providence</hi> over all Things. <hi>The Eyes of the LORD run to and fro, thro' the whole Earth, to ſhow himſelf</hi> STRONG, 2 Chron. 16.9. There is no Government without <hi>Power,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, conſtrain &amp; puniſh. Much leſs can the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe be govern'd without ſupream, abſolute and irreſiſtible Power. No Creature has Power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it ſelf, and leſs can any one uphold another in Being and Action. <hi>Equal</hi> is the Power of God ſeen, whether in keeping to the <hi>ordinary</hi> Courſe of Nature, or in <hi>preter-natural</hi> Effects: Whether when he keeps on in the uſual Courſe of <hi>Mercy</hi> to a ſinful World; or when he changes the Face of Providence and comes forth in ways of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He equally ſhows the Might of his Arm, when he caſts down the <hi>Mighty</hi> from their Seat, or when he exalts the <hi>Humble:</hi> when he ſhowers down <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> or when he pours down <hi>Hail and Fire:</hi> when he uſes a <hi>Fly</hi> as when he uſes an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:004489_0086_100D58004F8AC668"/>to miniſter unto his Will. For which is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? to effect great Things by <hi>ſmall Means,</hi> or to uſe thoſe which he has <hi>greatly endowed,</hi> and made in ſome Meaſure equal to the Effect produced. In either the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of Providence doth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear. Joh 42.2. <hi>I know that thou canſt do every Thing, and that no Thought can be withholden from thee.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>RESIGNATION to the great GOD in all his unſearchable Providences:</hi> whether of a <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Reference, or of a <hi>publick</hi> Nature and Concern.

            <p>IT is not for us to <hi>Doubt</hi> or Queſtion the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Righteouſneſs or Wiſdom of GOD.

            <p>THIS is by way of Eminence <hi>the Myſtery.</hi> It is ſo to <hi>Angels</hi> as well as <hi>Men.</hi> Myſterious <hi>Grace!</hi> which we could never have conceived of, and which it had been high Preſumption and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

            <p>WE read, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. Of <hi>the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt. Riches</hi> imply <hi>abundance,</hi> and an abundance of thoſe Things which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of great <hi>intrinſic Worth,</hi> Price and Value. <hi>Theſe</hi> are immenſly to be found in Chriſt; the <hi>Treaſures</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNSEARCHABLE Riches! never to have been <hi>diſcovered</hi> by the Wit of Man, and <hi>incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> to us now after the Diſcovery of them. The <hi>Myſtery</hi> hid from Ages and Generations, but now made manifeſt to the Saints; (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi>) to whom GOD would make known the <hi>Riches of the Glory</hi> of it; which is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in you the Hope of Glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.</p>
            <p>IT is a wonderful Paſſage in Eph. 3.10. <hi>To the Intent that now unto the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places, might be known by the Church the manifold Wiſdom of GOD</hi> The Myſtery of our <hi>Redemption</hi> was a <hi>ſecret</hi> to the glorious <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> who <hi>gradually</hi> have come into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it by <hi>Revelation,</hi> and that <hi>mediately</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> on Earth, as GOD has occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it more and more to us. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Angels deſire to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Things,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. They are ever ſeeking and ever gaining a more perfect <hi>Inſight</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:004489_0094_100D5813A43491E8"/>into this Myſtery; and as they gaze on this <hi>Light of GOD's Glory in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo grows their Admiration and Delight in their high State of Bleſſedneſs. Therefore were the <hi>Cherubims</hi> placed over the <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi> of old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.20. to fignify how <hi>Angels pry</hi> with Wonder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Admiration into the Myſteries of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.

            </p>
            <p>INDEED the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſpeaks of the Capacity of <hi>all Saints,</hi> GOD granting them <hi>according to the Riches of his Glory, to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Might by his Spirit in the inner Man, to comprehend what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Heighth, and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſes Knowledge,</hi> being <hi>filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD.</hi> But theſe Words explain themſelves, for there can be no proper <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion</hi> of that which <hi>paſſeth Knowledge;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s meaning can be no more than this — Such a <hi>ſimple Apprehenſion</hi> and Belief of the myſterious Truths, ſuch a <hi>clear and diſtinct</hi> Underſtanding of them, as to <hi>affect</hi> our Souls with the unſearchable Wiſdom and Grace of GOD therein diſplay'd.</p>

            <p>THUS unſearchable is the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of GOD, or his <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of our Nature.

            <p>IT muſt needs be <hi>ſtupendous</hi> to us to meditate, the <hi>ſupream Lawgiver</hi> obeying and fulfilling the divine Law, to work out a Righteouſneſs for the Juſtification of Sinners; and then bearing the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the holy Law to expiate and atone for our Guilt in the Tranſgreſſion thereof.

            <p n="1">1. The Worth of <hi>pardoning Mercy: Adoption</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>Juſtification</hi> thro' him, and <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to God.

            <p>HEAR the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of a juſtify'd State <q>— I know in whom I have believed—Behold, now are we the Sons of God—and if Children then Heirs—Ye know that ye have eternal Life— Who is it that condemneth, it is Chriſt that

            <p n="2">2.

IV. UNSEARCHABLY great and glorious is the <hi>Adminiſtration of the Kingdom of Grace, and GOD's gracious Working on the Souls of Sinners by and with the Diſpenſation of his Word and ordinances.</hi> We <hi>ſce</hi> the glorious Effect wro't, we <hi>feel</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'ning refreſhing Gale blow: The Thing is <hi>ſenſible,</hi> the Manner incomprehenſible. John 3. 9. <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the Sound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, or whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> He works arbitrarily, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, myſteriouſly. Unaccountable it is—<hi>where,</hi> in <hi>whom, when,</hi> and in what <hi>manner</hi> he pleaſes to work. The <hi>Breathings</hi> of the HOLY SPIRIT are like the <hi>Wind</hi> upon us, both in reſpect of the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> and <hi>Variableneſs</hi> of its Motion. GOD blows out of his <hi>Treaſuries</hi> upon us, from what <hi>Quarter,</hi> in what <hi>Meaſure,</hi>with what <hi>Continuance,</hi> with what <hi>Intermiſſions,</hi> with what <hi>Changes, more or leſs,</hi> as he pleaſes. <q>It is very <hi>ſecret</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>various</hi>

            </p>
            <p>REGENERATION is the <hi>Riches of CHRIST.</hi> It is <hi>Chriſt formed</hi> in us: The <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> given
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:004489_0105_100D582503199828"/>to us: The <hi>lmage</hi> of Chriſt reſtor'd in us. He has <hi>purchas'd</hi> this invaluable Gift for us: It is the <hi>Spirit of the Son</hi> ſent forth into our Hearts; the <hi>Comforter whom 1 will ſend</hi>—ſaid our aſcending <hi>Saviour; be ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you:</hi> the <hi>Graces,</hi> the <hi>Comforts,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> which I have <hi>purchaſed</hi> for you, he ſhall <hi>produce</hi> in you, and <hi>prepare</hi> you for.</p>
            <p>BUT to be more <hi>particular:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. UNSEARCHABLE is the Adminiſtration of the Kingdom of Grace, <hi>in God's ſending the Goſpel to ſome and not to others; to one Country and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not to another.</hi> It was altogether ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and unaccountable, that firſt <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be ſingled out from an <hi>idolatrous World,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> be ſhut up within the narrow Walls of his <hi>Houſe,</hi> which by a Covenant of Peculiarity and <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> as by a Wall of <hi>Partition,</hi> was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the reſt of the World, for ſo many Ages and Generations. And now that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> are <hi>Fellow-Heirs</hi> and Partakers of the Promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel, it is the unſearchable Conduct of divine Grace to leave great <hi>Empires,</hi> and vaſt <hi>Territories</hi> of the Earth in the Darkneſs of Nature and without a <hi>Revelation:</hi> to uſe the <hi>Words</hi> of Scripture,—<hi>without GOD</hi> in the World, <hi>aliens</hi> to the Covenant of Promiſe, <hi>afar off and without Hope;</hi> while other Places and People are <hi>made nigh,</hi> bro't near, and exalted high in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Privileges.</p>
            <p>WHAT a dark and melancholly Myſtery is it, in Providence and in Grace, that ſo great a part
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:004489_0106_100D58269F5E0B68"/>of the known Earth is at this Day periſhing in <hi>Pagan Idolatries,</hi> ſerving <hi>dumb Idols</hi> even as they are blindly led by <hi>Satan?</hi> Again, that ſo great a part of it lies ſunk under the <hi>Mahometan Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture?</hi> and ſo great a part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> alſo in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtitions and Abominations? And why to <hi>us</hi> in theſe <hi>remote Regions</hi> ſhould the <hi>Truth and Worſhip</hi> of GOD be ſent, and preſerved <hi>pure?</hi> A Mercy deny'd to <hi>Millions</hi> better than we! Why theſe <hi>late barbarous and ſalvage</hi> Places of the Earth be <hi>illuminated,</hi> and honoured to become the <hi>viſible Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> while the <hi>noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of the Eaſt, China</hi> and others, are left in their deplorable Ignorance!</p>
            <p>IT is not that we are <hi>greater</hi> or better than they, as was ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> when they were choſen, called and ſeparated from the World: but altogether of the ſovereign and unſearchable Will, Wiſdom and Grace of GOD. As of old it was with the <hi>Seed of Abraham;</hi> not <hi>all</hi> of them were alike <hi>adopted;</hi> but in <hi>Iſaac</hi> was his <hi>Seed cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> And again, when <hi>Rebecca had conceived, the Children not being yet born; neither having done either Good or Evil, that the Purpoſe of GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Election might ſtand, not of Works, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid unto her, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger; Jacob have I loved and Eſau have I hated,</hi> Rom. 9.10,—13. And what ſhall we ſay to this, ſave to adore the Sovereignty of the divine Will! As he ſaith to <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
               <q>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have Compaſſion on whom I will have Compaſſion!</q> 
               <hi>To ſhow his Wrath and to make his Power known,</hi> he rejects <hi>Places</hi> as well as <hi>Perſons,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004489_0107_100D582A2AF642B0"/>fitted for Deſtruction,</hi> like the <hi>Cananites</hi> of old; and again to <hi>make known the Riches of his Mercy</hi> on thoſe whom he hath ordained unto <hi>Glory,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <q>us whom he hath called of the Gentiles; as he ſaith in Oſee, I will call them my People which were not my People, and her beloved which was not beloved: And it is come to paſs that in the Place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my People, there are they called the Children of the living GOD.</q> In this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> it is, even of the <hi>Riches</hi> of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, by the <hi>Fall and Diminiſhing of the Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> crys out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <q>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of GOD! how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out! For who hath known the Mind of the LORD, or being his Counſellor hath taught him?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. UNSEARCHABLE it is <hi>that the ſame Means enjoy'd by many, are ſo efficacious upon ſome and not on others.</hi> The divine <hi>Election and Purpoſe</hi> of Merey makes here the like wonderful Difference between <hi>Perſons,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>internal Efficocy,</hi> as the divine <hi>Providence</hi> does any where in reſpect of <hi>outward Call and Privilege.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Words</hi> us'd in <hi>that Caſe,</hi> are meant and applied in this too by the HOLY GHOST. It is not of him that <hi>wilieth,</hi> nor of him that <hi>runneth,</hi> but of GOD that ſheweth Mercy. There is the ſame <hi>corrupt Nature</hi> in one and all, the ſame natural <hi>Enmity</hi> and Oppoſition to the almighty Grace of GOD, the ſame <hi>Inability</hi> both to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> in one and another: there is the ſame <hi>Guiltineſs</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and very often more <hi>increas'd</hi> by vicious
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004489_0108_100D582C4C99D480"/>Practice, where the divine <hi>Election</hi> is ſhown after all. We little know where GOD <hi>means to work;</hi> but it is often there where Man leaſt expects, and where our Deſires and Prayers have been leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. Nor is it more admirable to any than to the happy <hi>Veſſels of Mercy</hi> themſelves, to find themſelves ſingled out when ſometimes they cou'd leaſt of all have look'd for it: As the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> was full of <hi>Adorations</hi> that he ſhou'd be called to <hi>preach</hi> the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt, in the very Heat and Act of his fierce Oppoſition to, and Perſecution of the Name of <hi>JESUS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort:</p>
            <p>THERE is an Excellency of Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty in theſe Things, that we may admire GOD in his free and <hi>effectual Calling whom he will,</hi> and <hi>working what,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> he will. He <hi>divideth</hi> to every Man ſeverally as he will, and hath <hi>Mercy</hi> on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he <hi>hardneth.</hi> To ſome of the ſame Congregation it is given to <hi>know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> to others it <hi>is not given.</hi> Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will begat be us by the Word of Truth.</hi> He cou'd of the ſame <hi>Maſs</hi> of Pollution, and from the ſame <hi>Quarry of Stones,</hi> have raiſed up other Children to <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet here and not there have the <hi>purifying</hi> and <hi>ſoftning Dews</hi> of the Word fell and abode, or the <hi>rending Flaſhes</hi> of it ſtruck, and not there. Eph. 2.1,—7. <q>And you hath he quickned who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins: wherein in time paſt ye walked according to the Courſe of this World—: Among whom alſo we all had our
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004489_0109_100D582DD2F98F28"/>Converſation in time paſt, in the Luſts of our Fleſh, fulfilling the Deſires of the Fleſh and Mind, and were by Nature the Children of Wrath even as others: But GOD who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — For by Grace ye are ſaved, thro' Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY <hi>Saint</hi> may look in upon <hi>himſelf,</hi> if he perce ves a ſaving Change wro't in him, and ſay, <hi>LORD, why me?</hi> And every <hi>Miniſter</hi> or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will find frequent Reaſon to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire with reſpect to <hi>others,</hi> and ſay (not from <hi>Complaint,</hi> but full of humble <hi>Adoration) Why here</hi> (bleſſed GOD) <hi>and not there!</hi> Why on <hi>this</hi> Soul, and not on <hi>that! Even ſo Father, becauſe it pleaſes thee! O that Iſhmael alſo might live in thy Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is <hi>the Diverſity of the Ways and Manner whereby</hi> it pleaſes GOD to work ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly on the Souls of Men. Theſe are <hi>many,</hi> and all <hi>myſterious,</hi> comparing the <hi>Means</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Glory and Greatneſs of the <hi>Effect.</hi> It is the Glory of GOD to uſe the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> Means, to the moſt <hi>illuſtrious</hi> Effect; and ſometimes to bring about his own <hi>great Ends</hi> by <hi>ways</hi> ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>croſs</hi> thereunto; that ſo his Hand may be the more <hi>ſignal,</hi> and the Event the more <hi>ſurprizing.</hi> As the <hi>Heavens</hi> are higher than the Earth, ſo are his <hi>Tho'ts</hi> above ours. The <hi>Variety</hi> here is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to contemplate, working with the moſt ſweet <hi>Harmony</hi> to one bleſſed End. The Heart of <hi>one</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:004489_0110_100D582F66CE5B50"/>is <hi>ſoftly opened,</hi> ſweetly dilated and quickned by the <hi>ſilent</hi> Breath of the Almighty: Another is <hi>prick'd to the Heart,</hi> has his Conſcience <hi>gaſh'd,</hi> and lies in <hi>Agonies</hi> of Spirit. Sometimes a <hi>Word</hi> does either of them; ſometimes a <hi>gracious Providence</hi> the one, and an <hi>awakening Affliction</hi> the other. He worketh <hi>ſeverally as he willeth.</hi> To name a <hi>few of his Ways,—And how little a Portion is heard of him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is of the unſearchable Riches of Grace <hi>that the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching ſhould ſave any.</hi> This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> amplifies on as a ſtrange but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious thing; the Effect and the Means not at all proportionate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18,—21. It is the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the World, that the Doctrine of a <hi>crucified Saviour,</hi> and of the <hi>Croſs</hi> to be taken up by his Diſciples, ſhould ever prevail over the Hearts of Men; their Hearts oppoſite to the <hi>Shames</hi> of the one, and to the <hi>Pains</hi> of the other! And that the <hi>naked Propoſal</hi> of this divine Doctrine by Men of no Learning or Influence ſhould ſo Triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Prejudices, Superſtitions and Cuſtoms of People. Yea, the daily Efficacy of the preached Goſpel, is to our own Times a living laſting Wonder.</p>
            <p>CAN <hi>we</hi> ſpeak to the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, or can we reach their <hi>Hearts?</hi> And very often can the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Preacher?</hi> (whoſe <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Compoſures</hi> are in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and Judgment of <hi>Man</hi> yet more <hi>Fooliſhneſs) who</hi> yet is uſed by God moſt of all to <hi>enter</hi> into the Souls of Sinners! 2 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>For we have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels, that the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:004489_0111_100D58319685A7D0"/>Excellency of the Power may be of GOD, and not of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT pleaſes GOD for his own Glory to put a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Treaſure</hi> in his poor <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and to diſplay his <hi>own Power</hi> in their weak Adminiſtrations. There is an <hi>Excellency</hi> of Power diſplay'd in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</hi> and <hi>humbling</hi> the Souls of Sinners, in <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning,</hi> purifying and <hi>ſanctifying</hi> them; in the <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin and Luſt in them, and in the <hi>Dominion</hi> of Grace upon its Expulſion. There is an Excellency of Power in reaching the Hearts and Conſciencies of Men, and in a manifeſt <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> over the <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Will, Mind</hi> and <hi>Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHO is ſufficient for theſe Things?</hi> What Means or Inſtruments <hi>equal</hi> to them? Truly none: yet how eaſily is it all effected by the poor Labours of <hi>weak Men,</hi> ordained and bleſſed of GOD hereunto? The <hi>Effect</hi> equally wonderful if you thro'ly conſider it, as when <hi>the Waters divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> againſt their Nature and Courſe at the Word of <hi>Eliſha!</hi> Or as when the <hi>Midian Army</hi> was routed before the blaſt of a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and the Lamps in their <hi>earthen Pitchers.</hi> Or as when the <hi>great Syrian Leper</hi> was cleanſed by <hi>dipping</hi> in the Waters of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſince I have nam'd <hi>him,</hi> let it be the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> for the <hi>illuſtrating</hi> this <hi>Head.</hi> A little <hi>Iſraelite Girl</hi> was the firſt Means toward the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this <hi>noble Syrian:</hi> but when he came to the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and was bid to <hi>go and waſh himſelf ſeven times</hi> in the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> how did he <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:004489_0112_100D5833CC37BB38"/>thing? How did he pet and ſtorm at the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven? Were there not as <hi>good Rivers in Syria</hi> for him to have waſhed at? Had the Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> any natural Virtue more than <hi>thoſe?</hi> No, no more than the Lips of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or their Preaching has in it ſelf a Power to purify the Heart. Yet was it ſoon found that the <hi>ordained Waters,</hi> like thoſe of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>healing Power</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> with them: the <hi>Leper's Fleſh</hi> was reſtored like a <hi>new-born Child,</hi> or a <hi>ruddy Youth</hi>'s for Purity and Beauty; he was a <hi>new Creature,</hi> as one <hi>form'd</hi> and <hi>born</hi> anew: He admir'd the wondrous <hi>Renovation,</hi> ador'd the Power and Mercy of GOD in the Change wro't, declar'd that there is <hi>no GOD beſide him</hi> in all the Earth, would needs have ſome of the <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Earth of Iſrael</hi> to build an <hi>Altar</hi> in his own Country, and vow'd that he wou'd never worſhip or do ſacrifice to any dumb <hi>Idol</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> any more. Truly the Ordinances of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in their Effects upon the Soul, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in their Effects upon the Body of <hi>Naaman.</hi> John 15.3. <hi>Now are ye clean thro' the Word that I have ſpoken to you.</hi> Heb. 4.12, 13. Pſal. 45.3, 5. 1 Cor. 1.21,—28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Operations of the divine Grace on our Souls by particular Providences, both merciful and afflictive,</hi> are equally unſearchable. <hi>Theſe</hi> in themſelves are equally <hi>ineffectual,</hi> as thouſands do experience, as the <hi>Teachings out of GOD's Law.</hi> Both Mercies and Judgments are loſt on Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. Yet <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> GOD pleaſes to work by either, they have (both one and other) an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Conſtraint; the <hi>one</hi> to allure and draw
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004489_0113_100D5835EB0D9370"/>and bind the Soul by the Bands of Love, the <hi>other</hi> to compel and force and drive us to GOD, not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> the Will, but by a potent <hi>Conqueſt</hi> &amp; turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>UNSEARCHABLE are the <hi>Purpoſes</hi> of Mercy, and the evident <hi>Proofs</hi> thereof in the End, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>terrible Diſpenſations</hi> of Providence to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Families.</hi> The greateſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Rebukes</hi> prove not ſeldom the greateſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mercies, and <hi>ſureſt Conſolations</hi> of their Lives. However Nature may groan and cry out under the <hi>Operation,</hi> yet the Life and Health of the Soul is graciouſly conſulted, and marvellouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. We often ſee People <hi>take on</hi> grievouſly now, at thoſe things which they will rejoice in for ever, with <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> All <hi>that</hi> ſeems ſadly <hi>againſt them,</hi> which is making marvellouſly for their <hi>everlaſting good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN what Anguiſh cry'd the poor <hi>Mother</hi> to the <hi>Prophet, O Man of GOD! art thou come to call my Sins to remembrance, and to ſtay my Son?</hi> Ah, bleſſed <hi>Mean</hi> of a more effectual Calling her Sins to Remembrance, and working her up unto a more full Repentance, and a future Life of more Faith in GOD, and Devotedneſs unto him. <hi>Heaven</hi> will unriddle many of the dark Works of GOD's Grace now.</p>
            <p n="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Conduct of divine Grace in making the very <hi>Sins</hi> of Men, and their <hi>foul Falls</hi> into Sin, to be the <hi>Occaſion</hi> very often, and <hi>effectual Means</hi> of their Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation Happy the Sinner that is bro't to ſee the

               <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> of Sin, and his <hi>own</hi> exceeding <hi>Vileneſs.</hi> But it is a melancholy Way to Conviction, by ſome <hi>Over-Wickedneſs</hi> to raiſe a hideous Guilt, to <hi>glare</hi> us in the Face, and fright us to our Knees. <q>By <hi>one</hi> Sin breaking out GOD often diſcovers to a Perſon <hi>more</hi> Sin in himſelf; as if you ſtir a Pool of Water the Mud and Filth of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom riſes and ſhews it ſelf.</q> Conſcience is made <hi>tender</hi> by its Wound, and <hi>watchful</hi> by its Fall and Bruiſe. GOD ſometimes mercifully <hi>ſhames</hi> Souls into a ſaving Humiliation by a ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on their Scandals; they ſee their own Deformity in the Glaſs of <hi>GOD's Word,</hi> and are covered with Bluſhes and deep Confuſion before GOD and Man. They are <hi>frighted</hi> to ſee their own Faces, and <hi>aſham'd</hi> to be ſeen of others. From loathing a <hi>particular Fact</hi> they come to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>Manner of Sin,</hi> as ſuch. <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> and into what a glorious Exerciſe of Repentance did it caſt him? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Peter</hi> by his Fall learn'd <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and ſo gain'd a future <hi>Stability. Paul</hi> doubled his Induſtry and Adorations of GOD, when he remembred his old <hi>perſecuting the Saints.</hi> No Good can poſſibly be in Sin, and yet ſaving Good is bro't out of it.

4. And laſtly, UNSEARCHABLE is the Method of Grace alſo in making the <hi>great Temptations, Aſſaults and Terrors of Satan,</hi> not ſeldom the Means of the Converſion and Salvation of them that ſuffer by 'em. The <hi>Purgatory</hi> (I may ſay) thro' which <hi>elect and choſen Veſſels</hi> are often made to paſs, and by which they are <hi>refined</hi> and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Glory. It looks all to be of <hi>Wrath,</hi> and the Blackneſs or Flames of <hi>Hell</hi> about the Soul; but in the End it is found full of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of <hi>Love</hi> and utmoſt <hi>Compaſſion.</hi> As were the kind and <hi>tender Tho'ts</hi> of Heaven to <hi>holy Job,</hi> while the <hi>Devil</hi> for his <hi>Trial</hi> and Increaſe of Grace had Permiſſion to fright and ſcare him.</p>
            <p>HOW myſterious is it to ſee <hi>gracious Perſons</hi> annoy'd with impure, diabolical, curſed, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tho'ts, which they loath and deteſt, and fly from; but are <hi>haunted</hi> and purſued by, as by ſome hideous <hi>Spectre</hi> or <hi>unclean Spirit,</hi> which terrifies becauſe it ſeems to pollute them. It looks to them even as <hi>Satan's Poſſeſſion</hi> of them, when indeed it is the Means of his utter <hi>Ejection,</hi> and of the souls being cleans'd and <hi>ſwept</hi> from all Impurity and Defilement, and becoming a <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE <hi>helliſh Aſſaults</hi> have often driven Souls to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the impregnable <hi>Reck:</hi> theſe foul <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions</hi> have left no <hi>Ordure of Hell</hi> behind them; but bro't the poor Soul to ſee and loath its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pollution and Defilement, and haſtned its Flight to the <hi>open Fountain</hi> for Cleanſing in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Theſe <hi>curſed Blaſphemics,</hi> hated as they are to the ſuffering Heart, have only fix'd
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004489_0116_100D583CCCB15420"/>and raiſed it in the Reverence and Love of GOD, and in the Spirit of Devotion. Theſe <hi>Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Diſquiets</hi> have only eſtabliſh'd the Soul in a <hi>ſober Fear,</hi> and a compoſed, humble, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, prayerful, ſteddy Courſe of <hi>Obedience</hi> &amp; <hi>Truſt</hi> in GOD.</p>
            <p>IT is in the Works of <hi>Grace</hi> as it is in thoſe of Providence: As <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sorrows and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were but the wiſe and happy Means of their future Honour, Safety and Comfort; ſo is the Malice and Envy, the Rage and Fury of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and the inexpreſſible Sufferings of Souls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, often the ſure Means of their eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Felicity and Glory.

LET us <hi>reflect</hi> on what hath been ſaid, &amp; <hi>infer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE incomprehenſible Glory of our SAVIOUR.</hi> His Glory is <hi>great</hi> in our Salvation; <hi>Honour and Majeſty</hi> does it put upon him: it declares him <hi>moſt Bleſſed</hi> for ever: His Name ſhall continue <hi>as the Sun;</hi> and Men ſhall be bleſſed <hi>in him;</hi> all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall <hi>call him Bleſſed.</hi> His Dignity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, Merits and Benefits fill the whole Earth with his Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Reproach of the</hi> CROSS <hi>ceaſeth.</hi> A Glory dwells upon it: The <hi>King of Glory</hi> hung upon it. No more let it be called the <hi>curſed Tree,</hi> but the <hi>Tree of Life;</hi> like <hi>that</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>Paradice of GOD,</hi> yielding <hi>all manner</hi> of rich and precious <hi>Fruit.</hi> With what <hi>Garlands</hi> and <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies</hi> is the <hi>triumphant Standard</hi> hung?

            </p>
            <p>BUT when I ſpeak of the CROSS you know how to take me right, of the <hi>meritorious Sacrifice</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thereon, by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>moſt bleſſed Effects</hi> of that Offering. Men may magnify the <hi>material Croſs</hi> to groſs <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and abuſe the <hi>Sign</hi> of it to <hi>Superſtition;</hi> but the Virtues of a <hi>crucified Saviour,</hi> the Merits and Power of his <hi>Death,</hi> can't be too much honoured by us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. FROM all the incomprehenſible Things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of we may well infer, <hi>What is not an Intereſt in Chriſt worth?</hi> A <hi>Relation</hi> to him, a <hi>Fortion</hi> in him, a <hi>Name</hi> among his <hi>redeemed!</hi> O

GOD is Unſearchable,</hi>—therefore we muſt ſubmit to the <hi>Revelation</hi> which he makes of Himſelf. Our Reaſon is by no Means the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Truth. <q>No Man hath ſeen GOD at any time; the Only-Begotten of the Father he hath revealed him. The Glory of GOD is now to be ſeen in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. He that hath ſeen Him hath ſeen the Father.</q> 
               <hi>Our Faith muſt ſtand in the Wiſdom of GOD,</hi> and his plain Declarations concerning <hi>himſelf,</hi> who is <hi>Truth,</hi> and who is <hi>Incomprehenſible,</hi> by a Neceſſity of Nature.</p>

               <q>Now to the only-wiſe GOD our SAVIOUR, be Glory, and Majeſty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
