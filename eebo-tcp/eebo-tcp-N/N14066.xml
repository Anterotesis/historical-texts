            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>O WHAT comfortable Words are theſe! Words ſufficient to chear the Hearts of the Mourners, and to cauſe the Outcaſts to rejoice. Here is an Invitation to thoſe who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Word of the LORD, they are called to hearken to the chearing Voice of their GOD, who promiſes to appear to their Joy, and to the Shame of their Brethren, who caſt them out, under a Pretence of glorifying GOD thereby.</p>
            <p>Let us in the firſt Place inquire into the Characters of thoſe who are ſpoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the Words of my Text; they are ſuch as <hi>tremble at the Word of the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>We read in Ezra, x. 3, of thoſe who trembled at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of GOD. Theſe are ſuch as believe the Truth of GOD with their whole Hearts, who feel the Power of the ſame within their Breaſts; who loathe themſelves on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Iniquities, and live ſo under a Senſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of GOD, that they are continually abaſed and humbled before him. Perſons of this Character are very dear to GOD, as we find written in Pſalm xxxiv. 18. "The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken Heart; and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite Spirit," and in Pſalm li. 17, "The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of GOD are a broken Spirit; a broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Heart, O GOD, thou wilt not deſpiſe," and Pſalm cxxxviii. 6. "Though the LORD be high, yet hath he Reſpect unto the Lowly; but the Proud he knoweth afar off," and Pſalm cxlvii. 3, "He healeth the broken in Heart, and bindeth up their Wounds," and in the 57th Chapter of this Prophecy of Iſaiah, and 15th Verſe, we read, "For thus ſaith the high and lofty ONE that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe Name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones," and in the ſecond Verſe of this Chapter, we read "But to this Man will I look (or have
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017803_0004_0FA31AAEC4229800"/>
Regard) even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my Word."</p>
            <p>And how often doth our Saviour ſay, <hi>"He that humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be exalted."</hi> Matt. xxiii, 12. Luke xiv. 11. xviii. 14. There is nothing ſo contrary to God as a proud haughty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but he delights in the humble. Let us therefore humble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt us in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Time; yea, let us be clothed with Humility, for God re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I. Peter, v. 5, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The nearer Brings are to God, the more humble they are; and the farther from him, the prouder. A better Inſtance to prove this can hardly be found than that of Michael the Archangel. Contending with the Devil (or Lucifer) he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted about the Body of Moſes, yet durſt not bring a railing Accuſation againſt him, but ſaid, "The Lord rebuke thee. Jude, Ver. 9." But Satan is ſaid to be the "Accuſer of the Brethren, which accuſed them before GOD Day and Night. Rev. xii. 10." See Michael the nigheſt Being to GOD, and Lucifer the fartheſt from him; one filled with the profoundeſt Humility, and the other with the moſt daring Pride and Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; Michael not daring to bring a railing Accuſation againſt the Devil himſelf, yet the Devil daring to accuſe the Brethren Day and Night before GOD. The Difference is amazing, and is a proper Looking Glaſs for us all. Pride is the Image of Satan, Humility the Image of Chriſt, in which all Beings ſtand that are conformed to him, in Proportion as they are ſo.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who tremble at the Word of the LORD, may be deſcribed in the following manner:</p>
            <p>They feel the Power of it in their Hearts:</p>
            <p>They believe every Word of GOD is true, and ſhall have its Accompliſhment:</p>
            <p>They fear to deny with the Mouth what they believe in the Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even though the Confeſſion of the ſame ſhould expoſe them to the Scorn and Deriſion of their Acquaintance:</p>
            <p>They endeavour to be conformed, both in Temper and Conduct, to the Will of GOD made known to them; and to obey GOD rather than Men.</p>
            <p>I think theſe are the true Marks of thoſe who tremble at the Word of GOD. Happy are they who anſwer this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription!</p>
            <p>Having very briefly deſcribed thoſe to whom the LORD ſpeaks, let as conſider what he ſaith, "Your Brethren that hated you, and caſt you out for my Name's Sake, &amp;c."</p>

               </gap>me of his intimations of that Kind, I will repeat to you: "And ye ſhall be hated of all Men for my Name's Sake, Matt. x. 22, xxiv, 9. Mark xiii, 13. Luke xxi, 17."—"It is enough for the Diſciple, that he be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord: If they have called the Maſter of the Houſe Beelzebub, how much more ſhall they call them of his Houſhold? Matt. x. 25."—"If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the World, the World would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you. Remember the Word that I ſaid unto you. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is not greater than the Lord. If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you; if they have kept my Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will keep yours alſo. But all theſe Things will they do unto you for my Name's Sake, becauſe they know not him that ſent me. John xv. 18, 19, 20, 21."—"Theſe Things I have ſpoken unto you, that ye ſhould not be offended. They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea, the Time cometh that whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth GOD Service. In the World ye ſhall have Tribulation. John xvi. 1, 2, 33."</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtles of Chriſt experienced theſe Things, and taught all Chriſtians to expect the ſame. St. Paul, after ſpeaking of his own Trials (leſt any ſhould think t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

II. Tim. iii, 12." And St. Peter ſays, "If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt happy are ye: For the Spirit of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and of GOD reſteth on you. On their Part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your Part he is glorified. I. Pet. iv, l4."</p>

            <p>One great Cauſe of ſo much unprofitable Contention is, that Truth has been divided, torn to Pieces, and ſometimes even loſt in the Debates raiſed about it; one Party has had ſome Truth, another has alſo had ſome, but each thinking they had the whole, have endeavoured to overthrow all that their Antagoniſts held; both have been dividing the living Child of Truth, under a Notion that it was found no where but with them; and thus each have oppoſed the Truth in each other, under the Notion of its being erroneous: On the contrary we ſay, that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of his Love muſt finally come to the Enjoyment of himſelf; and that his Mercy endureth for ever, and cannot fail. We heartily believe both theſe Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>One will aſſert that, Chriſt died for all, taſted Death for every one; the other, that Chriſt ſhall ſee of the Travail of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied, and that all for whom his Blood was ſired, ſhall be cleanſed thereby: All this we ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly believe.</p>
            <p>One will declare that GOD willeth that all ſhall be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth; the other, that whatever GOD willeth, muſt be accompliſhed at laſt.</p>
            <p>None can ſay with Truth, that we deny either of theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions.</p>
            <p>One will ſay that GOD at firſt purpoſed all his Creatures to praiſe and glorify his Name to all Eternity, and to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the Enjoyment of himſelf; the other will declare that the Purpoſes of GOD muſt ſtand, that with GOD there is no Variableneſs, nor Shadow of Turning, that he is of one Mind, and that none can turn him, and that what his Soul deſireth, that he doth: We freely conſent to the Truth of all this.</p>
            <p>One will ſay that GOD would ſave all if he could, that his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017803_0008_0FA31AB1C31A47F0"/>
Will is good towards all; the other will aſſert, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely able to do all that he pleaſes, and that he could bring all to him if he would.</p>
            <p>And do not we as fully believe both of theſe Poſitions, as we do our own Exiſtence?</p>
            <p>One will declare that the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt was freely ſhed for all; the other, that his Blood is infinitely ſufficient to cleanſe and purity all. This is what we believe.</p>
            <p>One will ſay, with the Scripture that all Things are given to Chriſt; the other, in Conformity to the ſame ſacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, will maintain, that all that the Father giveth him ſhall come to him; that he will give eternal Life to as many as the Father has given him. This is our Belief. We believe the Truth of both thoſe Poſitions. None will come to Chriſt but thoſe whom the Father giveth him; and he hath given him all Things without Exception. Thus we ſee that our Belief is in Fact the Belief of all the Chriſtian World put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And inſtead of tending to increaſe the divided Churches, it tends to unite them all in one, as it allows the Truth in a Meaſure amongſt all, and that as there is no Church wholly pure in all Things, ſo none can be found but what has ſome true Witneſſes for God therein; ſome Tokens of the Divine Preſence, and ſome glorious Truths remain in every Church under the Sun; and this glorious Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n of Truths that, we believe, bids fair one Day to unite all together in one cloſe Syſtem of Benevolence; and it is my Opinion that the Time is not very remote, when "Zion's Watchmen ſhall ſee Eye to Eye. When we ſhall not need to teach every Man his Neighbour, ſaying, Know the LORD, for all ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt, and ſerve him with one Conſent."</p>
            <p>Our Belief reſpecting the Reſtoration of all Things is not only founded upon the plaineſt Letter of Scripture (as all may ſee, who will be at the Pains to read over the printed Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Texts) but is exactly according to the Experience of every Chriſtian. For let me aſk any who were ever made to experience the Love of God ſhed abroad in their Hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt, theſe Queſtions: Did you not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Did you not view the Love of God infinitely full, free, unmerited, and undeſerved? Did you not behold in Chriſt an infinite Fulneſs, Sufficiency and Willingneſs to ſave all? Did you not earneſtly long that all might come and partake of his Grace? If you had had as much Power as good Will, would you not have brought all to bow to the Sceptre of Grace,

            <p>But above all, Will he ſuffer his Words, his Promiſes, his Oaths, to be made null, void, and of none Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now if we attend to the plain Letter of the Scripture, we ſhall find that GOD hath declared that he will <hi>"make all Things new</hi>; that he will gather together in Chriſt all Things both in Heaven and on Earth; even in him who having made Peace, through the Blood of his Croſs, ſhall have that great Honour to reconcile all Things to GOD, both which are in Heaven and on Earth; yea, he hath ſworn by himſelf, that to him every Knee ſhall bow, every Tongue ſhall ſwear." See Rev. xxi. 5. Epheſians i. 10. Col. i 20. Iſaiah, xlv. 23 Then when all Things ſhall be made new, gathered together in Chriſt, reconciled to GOD, brought to bow the Knee and ſwear to him; ſhall that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Paſſage, Rev. v. 13, be fulfilled. "And every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017803_0010_0FA31AB344165B30"/>
which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, and all than are in them, heard I ſaying, Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the Thron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and unto the Lamb for ever and ever." O what a glorious Day will that be! The diſtant Thought of which fills us with the greateſt Joy and Satisfaction. If "there it Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth," what unknown, what inconceivable Joy ſhall there be when all that have ſinned againſt their great Creator, ſhall repent, acknowledge him to be wholly juſt, and themſelves entirely to blame, fall at his Feet, and ſwear Allegiance to their righteous Sovereign; never more to rebel againſt him to all Eternity! O glorious Period, when the Chordage of all Hearts ſhall be taken in Hand by GOD himſelf, and tuned to his never ceaſing Praiſe!</p>
            <p>But could we believe that Sin and Miſery ſhould endure to all Eternity, that the bleſſed God, worthy of all Praiſe, from all Intelligences, ſhould be hated by vaſt Numbers of the Beings he hath made capable of loving and ſerving him, and that to all endleſs Ages, we ſhould be filled with the greateſt Sorrow imaginable! For even when we ſee poor miſerable Wretches, under the Power and Government of Satan, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning and blaſpheming the Name of God, it fills our Hearts with Grief inexpreſſible; how inconceivable would our Diſtreſs then be, if we could be made to believe, that they muſt, to all endleſs Ages, continue in Rage, Blaſphemy, and Deſpair! But Glory to God in the higheſt, we believe that the Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, of the ever adorable JEHOVAH ſhall ſhine moſt gloriouſly, in the entire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all Evil, and total Subjection, and complete Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of all his Creatures. "We believe, and therefore we ſpeak." Great is our Joy; though we are deſpiſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and treated with Contempt by many for the Goſpel's Sake which we believe, yet we would not part with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction we find therein, for all the Glories of the World, and the Applauſe of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>Many ſay, "What need have we to care about what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of others? If we are happy ourſelves, that is all that we need to ſeek after, or be concerned about." This Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage well enough becomes thoſe that have a Religion found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Selfiſhneſs, or thoſe who have narrow Notions and Ideas of God's Love, ſuppoſing it to be confined to them and their Party; but it is as oppoſite to the true Spirits of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and the Language of thoſe who dwell in "Love, and dwell in God," as Darkneſs is to Light, Evil to Good, or Satan to Chriſt. The Spirit of Jeſus teaches us to fulfil the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017803_0011_0FA31AB402347400"/>
royal Law, "Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf." Chriſtianity leads us to ſeek the Salvation and Happineſs of all; and certainly then to rejoice in the Welfare of all; and he who is not willing that God ſhould bring all to love, praiſe, and enjoy him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, who would not be ready to wiſh, at leaſt, that the Doctrine of the Reſtoration might be true, diſcovers a Temper very different from Chriſt, who died that Sinners might be reſtored; and from Moſes, who begged the Lord to pardon Iſrael's Sins; and if not, to blot him out of his Book; and from St. Paul, who could wiſh himſelf accurſed from Chriſt, for his Brethren, and Kinſmen according to the Fleſh. See Exod. xxxii. 32. Rom. ix. 3.</p>
            <p>The Nature of Grace leads us to deſire the Happineſs of all our fellow Creatures; this is known to all experienced Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and I ſuppoſe that the Joy in Heaven will continue increaſing, as the divine Work of the Reſtoration goes on, and will not come to its higheſt Pitch, till every Creature in the Univerſe ſhall be brought willingly to ſubmit to Jeſus, and be made happy in his Love.</p>
            <p>This is our Belief for which we have ſuffered Reproach, and Cenſure from our Brethren; for this we are called Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Deceivers, deceived ones, &amp;c. Yea ſome of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do not ſcruple to tell us, that we ſhall be damned if we live and die in the Belief of the Reſtoration. <note n="*" place="bottom">This perhaps may ſtartle ſome, but it has been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid; and a certain Miniſter, who held none could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but a certain elect Number, once ſaid to me (among other Things of the like Nature) theſe Words, "If you are one of GOD's Elect, he will bring you off from theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Judge not and ye ſhall not be judged; condemn not, and ye ſhall not be condemned;" Paul ſays, Rom. xiv. 4, 10, 14. "Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth; yea, he ſhall be holden up; for GOD is able to make him ſtand. But why doſt thou judge thy Brother? Or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother? For we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgement Seat of Chriſt. Let us not therefore judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no Man put a Stumbling Block or an Occaſion to fall in his Brother's Way." And in I.

            <p>It is ſaid that we bring in damnable Hereſies, &amp;c. The Words "damnable Hereſies" occur but once in Scripture, viz. in II. Pet. ii. 1. Where we read t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Surely this Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot fairly be applied to us; we truſt that we do not deny the Lord that bought us; but we may obſerve that the Lord bought even the Perſons who denied him; which proves ſomething very different from what the Text is uſually brought for.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pears plain from theſe Words, that a Heretick is one who ſins in ſuch a Manner, as not only to be known, and rejected by others, but to be ſelf condemned; and even then he was not to be rejected till after the firſt and ſecond Admoniti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n: But we can ſay (I believe) with Truth, that we are not ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for our Principles; our Hearts do not condemn us, for believing that he who has conquered our ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>St. Paul, in Acts xxiv. 14, ſays, "But this I confeſs unto thee, that, after the Way which they call Hereſy, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all Things which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e written in the Law and in the Prophets." So we find that Hereſy is an ancient Name for true Religion, and that a Man may believe all that Moſes and the Prophets have written,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017803_0014_0FA31AB64227D970"/>
and truly worſhip God, and yet be charged with Hereſy, which is the Caſe with us at this Time; for we ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that the Scriptures declare, as we underſtand them, and endeavour to worſhip God through Chriſt, according to his Directions; yet we are charged with Hereſy<note n="‡" place="bottom">As for the Word Hereſy, it has been uſed for ſo many different Things, and on ſo many Occaſions, that Nothing can be concluded againſt any Perſons on the Account of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called Hereticks; for it is well known, that all Kinds of Opinions in Matters of Religion have been branded as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; thoſe who have the Power in their Hands, always eſteem themſelves Orthodox, and call thoſe whom they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and perſecute Hereticks; and it frequently happens, that what is called Orthodoxy in one Nation, is called Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in another; and what is praiſed and extolled for Truth in one Age or Generation, is condemned for Error in the next; yea ſometimes in the ſame Age, under different Adminiſtrations of Government, each Party will have an Opportunity of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the other as Hereticks. And it is well known in the World, that not only religious, but philoſophical Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have been called Hereſies; among the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Opinion of there being Antipodes, or People who inhabited an oppoſite Part of the Earth from that where they dwelt, was looked upon abſurd, blaſphemous, and heretical; yet we know the Truth of it now with Certainty. Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus was excommunicated by the Pope's Bull as a Heretick, for daring to believe that there was a weſtern Paſſage to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and for the wild Deſign that he had of ſeeking a new Country, &amp;c. but what a Loſs would it have been to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if he and all others, had been (through Fear of the Curſes of the Church) deterred from making Diſcoveries? Galileo, the famous Improver of Teleſcopes, becauſe he was convinced of the Copernican Syſtem by the Diſcoveries he made, was ſent for to Rome, as being a dangerous Heretick, and was there obliged to renounce his Belief of the Sun's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed in the Heavens, and that the Earth and Planets performed their Revolutions round it, &amp;c. and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into his former Errors again after his Return home, he was ſent for the ſecond Time to Rome, impriſoned in the Inquiſition (it is a Wonder he was not burnt for his Hereſy) and when releaſed from Priſon, was ever afterwards confined to certain Limits, as a very dangerous Perſon, and forbid to propagate ſuch heretical Notions</note>. But that is but a ſmall matter. The worſt Hereſy is that of the Heart, which is a ſelfiſh, envious, proud, wrathful, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017803_0015_0FA31AB70235B450"/>
worldly Spirit; from which if we are entirely delivered, there is Nothing that can harm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>We have experienced what it is to be hated and caſt out by our Brethren, for the Name of the Lord, for the Sake of the dear Saviour, and the Teſtimony that we hold. We have ſearched the Scriptures for ourſelves, and the Belief of them that we have, has not been taught us by Tradition, Education, or the Will of Man; but as we truſt by the Spirit of the living God. Since it has pleaſed the Lord therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm us in the Truth as it is in Jeſus, we have Reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in being perſecuted for his Sake<note n="¶" place="bottom">It is a Queſtion, whether if we had been guilty of any ſcandalous Crimes, ſuch as Lying, Drunkenneſs, or any Thing of the like Nature, we had been caſt out as ſoon for thoſe as we have been for the Belief of what appears to us to be the Truth of God. Are not ſome tolerated and even eſteemed in Churches, who have been guilty of ſome of thoſe Things, while thoſe who have profeſſed the Belief of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, have not had common Civility ſhewn them?</note>.</p>
            <p>Is it not melancholy to think, that different Sentiments reſpecting Religion ſhould cauſe Hatred and Perſecution? Yet this we find to be the Caſe; and eſpecially we ſee, that the Doctrine that we hold, raiſes the Enmity of Mankind more than any Thing elſe; this, it is likely, is becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the entire Deſtruction of Satan's Kingdom at laſt. What makes our Trials the more grievous, is the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that David had, "For it was not an Enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me, that did magnify himſelf againſt me; then I would have hid myſelf from him; but it was thou, a Man, mine Equal, my Guide, and mine Acquaintance: We took ſweet Counſel together, and walked unto the Houſe of God in Company. Pſalm lv. 12, 13, 14."</p>
            <p>Who could have thought that thoſe with whom we were united, ſhould ſo ſoon ſeparate us from their Company, ſince we were willing to allow every one Liberty of Thinking, and Freedom of Converſation, and had no Deſire to break Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with any of them?

            <p>But let us attend to the comforting Words of the LORD. It is ſaid, in the Concluſion of my Text, "But he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to your Joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed."

            <p>"But he ſhall appear to your Joy." O my Brethren, have we not abundant Reaſon to believe that God will appear to our Joy? Has he not manifeſted himſelf already in our Hearts?

            <p>I ſhall now cloſe the whole with an Addreſs to you, who have been hated and caſt out by your Brethren, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Profeſſion of his Goſpel of univerſal Love; called "damnable Hereſy" by many.</p>

                  <salute>My dear Brethren and Siſters,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>You have been highly favoured of the Lord, not only in having experienced the Truth in your Hearts, but in being called to ſtand as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itneſſes of the everlaſting, univerſal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring Love, and Power of our dear Saviour. You have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffered much of your Brethren, and have been rejected by them. Thanks to the Providence of God, we live in a Country where we are allowed to worſhip according to our own Conſciences, and none can hinder us.</p>
               <p>But though we may not expect to meet with Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Baniſhment, Confiſcation of Goods or Death, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; yet we may expect, as we have already experienced, what the Apoſtle Paul calls "cruel Mockings," Reproaches, Revilings, Slanders, Cenſures, and the unbounded Rage

and Perſecution of the Tongue; which is frequently worſe to bear than Death itſelf, as the Experience of many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and therefore it is called by St. Paul "cruel," in Preference to all other Kinds of Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Arm yourſelves therefore continually with Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, univerſal Benevolence, and unfeigned Reſignation to the Will of God; and then you will not only be able to bear all that the Rage and Malice of Men can caſt upon you, with Patience, but will be able to repay them all with loving Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>You muſt expect, that the Adverſary of Mankind will try his utmoſt to draw you off from the Truth; for he is loth to have it known in the World, that he is a conquered Potentate, and that his Kingdom muſt one Day be entirely deſtroyed; and as he has for a long Time kept the Doctrine of the final Reſtoration of all Things, hid and covered, ſo you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he will greatly rage againſt it now it begins again to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But fear not my Brethren, the Cauſe is God's, and not ours; let us commit ourſelves into his Hands, who is able to keep us from falling, and to give us the Victory over the Powers of Darkneſs, through the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of our Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Finally, as our Religion calls us to the greateſt Purity and Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
