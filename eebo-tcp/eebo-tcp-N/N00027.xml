            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But what more disconsonant from, or what more contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory to Scripture, then to teach, that throughout all the time of the Gospel-dispensation, there is no need of the ministry of man? wee appeal to the examples of the <hi>Apistles, Evangelists, Ordinary Office-labourers</hi> in the word &amp; doctrine, and Gospel-churches recorded in sacred writt; as also to the institution of the Gospel-ministry, by <hi>Pastors and Teachers,</hi> for the calling of the Elect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all Nations, <hi>for the perfecting of the saints, untill we come unto a perfect man;</hi> i.e. untill the perfection, of the Mystical body of Christ.</p>

               <p>The Subject spoken of, are such persons, which are actually the people of God, such in whose hearts the Law is written. <hi>The knowledg of God,</hi> is taken either for that knowledg of him, which is essential to effectual vocation, or for the knowledg of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

the <hi>voyce heard in the holy mount,</hi> in relation to the doctrine of Christ: he preferreth (<hi>not as the most true, but,</hi>) as the <hi>most sure ground for Faith</hi> of the two, and upon this account: because the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal testimony of the Apostles, though Apostolical, was as yet but verbal, and not scriptural. So that should this text (upon a false supposition) be looked at as speaking of a believers non-attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Scripture, yet it proceeds not concerning the Scripture in general, but concerning the Scripture of the old testament only, not of the Canon of the new Testament.</p>
               <p>The <hi>day dawning,</hi> and <hi>the day-starr appearing:</hi> denotes either the saving light of the Spirit, making our attention unto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from time to time effectual, during the season of our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance hereupon, throughout this life: or that day-light of the vision of glory: both which senses in conclusion issue in one. But, it cannot be understood of the regenerating-light of the Spirit; because the Apostle speakes to those who are believers, still to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The patticle [<hi>untill</hi>] (any other acception not pertinent to the matter under consideration omitted) either noteth a certain time, before which such a thing is to be, which was not before: or after which such a thing is not to be, which was before. <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet, untill Shiloh come.</hi> Gen: 49. 10. But here it denoteth not any certain time in this life, after which we are not to attend upon the word written. For then, that certain time notified by the <hi>day dawning</hi> and <hi>the day-starr appearing:</hi> must either relate to Christs comming in the flesh, or to the beginning of the Gospel-dispensation, or to the effectual revelation of Christ in vocation, or to some other terme, that may rationally and scripturally be instanced in: but it cannot relate unto the first, because it is not <hi>an appearance in the flesh,</hi> but an <hi>appearance in the heart,</hi> that is here expresly spoken of: and <hi>the day-starr arise in your HEARTS.</hi> Neither indeed, can it relate either unto the first or any other of the termes, or limits mentioned: because <hi>Peter</hi> writes unto such, still to <hi>attend upon the word of Prophecie,</hi> who were regenerate; who were believers: <hi>have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obteined like precious faith with himself, Cap:</hi> 1.

               <p>If with some Orthodox Interpreters, wee understand by a <hi>dark place,</hi> the time of the Church under the old Testament: compared with the night, wherein candles are lighted: and by the <hi>day-dawning,</hi> the time of the Gospel day-light, wherein the Sun shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; the new Testament expounding the old, and thereby giving a greater light.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000056_0024_0F9F1CF6EC805198"/>
now they have no cloak for their sin. John</hi> 15.22. 3. Upon the rejecting of the Doctrine of the great <hi>Teacher,</hi> there are <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> supposed to <hi>come in their own name. A famine of the word of trueth</hi> is a sore judgment. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. But these teachers, are worse then no teachers. Accursed &amp; ominous. 4. That those who <hi>received not Christ, comming in his Fathers name, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive teachers comming in their own name.</hi> No better <hi>Teacher,</hi> no such <hi>teacher,</hi> no other <hi>teacher,</hi> then he was whom they refused. Scarce any (if any) worse <hi>teachers</hi> then those whom they received. Tis not so ready to say, whether their unbelief or belief was more dreadfull. Wofull is their condition, when the <hi>teacher</hi> is accursed <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9. and the hearer bewitched <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they shall believe a ly: that they all might be damned, who believed not the trueth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 11,12. See here the non-<hi>receivers of the trueth in the love of it,</hi> punished both with a penal, and effectual mission of deceivers.</p>
            <p>That this tremendous dispensation, may have the deeper impression upon our hearts: we find the Vindictive hand of God upon the contempt of the Gospel, mentioned thrice in one chapter: and that also, sometime as a forerunner of the destruction of a nation. <hi>Mat:</hi> 24. 5. <hi>For many shall come in my name, saying I am Christ.</hi> False teachers shall come, and lest any should think their comming notwithstanding, happily they shall not prevail: it is added, <hi>and shall deceive many.</hi> Again, verse 11. <hi>Many false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets shall arise.</hi> Forget not again what followeth, <hi>and shall deceive many.</hi> So verse 24. <hi>For there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes &amp; wonders: insomuch; that if it were possible, they should deceive the very Elect.</hi> Hereunto (if with some learned interpreters, we understand by the <hi>end</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. that famous period &amp; destruction of the Nation of the Jewes) we may not unaptly annex that of the Apostle 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18 in the judgment of some as attesting unto <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3,6,33,34. Namely that these grand-deceivers were fore-runners of the then ensuing misery of that nation. <hi>Little children, it is the last time, &amp; as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The summ is; that the <hi>doctrines of Devils</hi> audaciously disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by numerous false teachers, pretending themselves to be

            <p>Sinning against the Gospel, is very sinfull. The Gospel is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution or effect <hi>tempered of the Grace of God, and the blood of Christ</hi> ingredients, neither of which are to be found in the Law. So much as the Gospel excelleth the Law, so much is <hi>sinning against the Gospel</hi> aggravated compared with <hi>sinning against the Law</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against the Gospel is yet heightned by circumstances: that it is given to us after the transgression of the Law. Given to some transgressors, and not unto others. Of them to whom it is given, dispensed with greater light to some, then to others. What Nation gloryed in these priviledges above our own, our selves being witnesses? From the kind of sinning; If the non-recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the trueth in the love of it, exposeth unto this vindictive deception, according to what dreadfull degree shall they be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obnoxious, who persevere in scandals under the light? <hi>Count it pleasure to riot in the day time,</hi> yea fear not to <hi>commit that abomination in Israel, of turning the grace of God into wantonness.</hi> From the doctrine of free grace, drawing a licence to sin, to take their fill o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lust: and that without the guilt of sin, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of sin, yea with a pretended conscience of obedience. In a word, <hi>to feast the old man unto the highest, with the blood of Jesus,</hi> and compleat <hi>the mystery of iniquity, by the mystery of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the non-reception of the trueth of the Gospel, is a fearfull sin, so the fruit thereof is a fearfull evill. Their unbelief is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: their belief is fearfull. <hi>Unbelief of the trueth is iniquity: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a ly, is both iniquity &amp; folly.</hi> The trueth they unbelieve, is a trueth of the greatest wisdom. The ly which they believe is an object of the greatest vanity. To believe the trueth, is a great mercy. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. 25. <hi>As one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithfull.</hi> To believe a destructively, is a great judgment. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>

               <p>The Apostles seem not so to have expected any succession of Apostles. Hence in their life time, they appointed <hi>Elders in every Church, Acts</hi> 14. 23. And left behind them, a prescribed form, as a directory of the Churches, concerning persons to be called by man into the Ministry successively, in the ages to come. 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3 <hi>Titus</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But though we have no promise of any such ministry, yet in the Scripture we have frequent prediction &amp; caution of pretenders to <hi>immediate mission, of deceivers, false Apostles, false Prophets, false Teachers, Speakers of lyes in the name of the Lord:</hi> with <hi>Command</hi> and directions <hi>to try them,</hi> not by their own <hi>profession,</hi> for that is no great thing, if <hi>the ministers of Satan transform themselves into the ministers of Righteousness.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. 15.

            <p>The object subjected to the Coercive power of the Magistrate, must be some Act of the outward man. Tis not <hi>matter of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but <hi>matter of fact,</hi> which Civil-power dealeth with. Hence so far is it from being a truth, that the magistrate proceeding accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rule, either punisheth or troubleth any for their Conscience as that it neither doth nor can concern him, to meddle with the errour of their Conscience,<note place="margin">Lex non Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicar de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Conscience, properly so called, error of Conscience or heresy, heresy uttered &amp; retracted, heresy uttered &amp; not retracted but quiet,(called heresy alone) &amp; heresy Turbulent are all distinct, &amp; of distinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. <hi>Heresy, schimse, and sedition, differ.</hi> Though usually it falls out otherwise, yet a man may be an heretick, who is neither dogmatist, schismatick, or seditious: neither teaching his errours as truthes, nor causing irregular separation from Church-Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, nor sowing seeds of discord, or mutiny in the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Quiet heresy,</hi> or heresy alone; understand heresy although uttered and not retracted, yet without endeavour either directly or indirectly tending to induce others to receive their errours: As also; without disturbance of publick order, either ecclesiast color Civil. This; divers godly-learned do not only exempt from the number of Capitals, but also seeme Cautious, if not silent, concerning subjecting it to any Corporal punishment.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Heresy Turbulent,</hi> understand heresy both uncured and incorrigible; <hi>i e.</hi> in Coniunct on either with, <hi>Teaching lyes in the name of the Lord.</hi> Or with disturbance of publick-order, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil. This is not only heretical, but also pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and here is a season, wherein it is the duety of the Civil-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, to put forth his Coercive power, as the matter shall require in the defence of Religion, Order, Church &amp; common-wealth.</p>
            <p>So farr is our doctrine from asserting subjection of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to the Coercive power of the Magistrate: as that we look at it as irrational, to extend his power unto the error of Conscience as such. We subject not the bare proposal &amp; owning of heresie is cured: as obnoxious unto Civil authority. We affirm not that it belongs to the Magistrate to inflict any punishment for quiet

heresie. We affirm not quiet heresie to fall within the necessary object of Magistratical Cognisance, but leave it unto free disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We know that it belongeth not unto the Magistrate to compel any man to be a believer, nor to punish any for not being a believer. But we believe it belongs to him (in case) to punish a Blasphemer, or turbulent hereticks, who seeth not a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between these?</p>
            <p>Wee through grace abhorre prejudicing the liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the least measure, and account such report of us to be a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And through the same grace; Wee both dread, and beare witness against, liberty of heresy, liberty to Blaspheme the Blessed Trinity, the Person and Office of Christ, the holy-Scripture, the tabernacle of God, and those that dwell in heaven. Howsoever fallaciously transformed into, &amp; mis-represented under the plausible vizard of liberty of conscience falsly so called. We say Religion is to be perswaded with Scripture-reasons, not Civil weapons: with Arguments, not with punishments. But Blasphemies immediate and heresies carried on with an high hand, and persisted in, are to be suppressed with weapons &amp; punishments; where reasons, &amp; arguments cannot prevail.</p>

            <p>And according to this method, hath been the gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Magistrate here, with those (hitherto incorrigible) <hi>Quakers,</hi> who from England have unreasonably and insolently

            <p>Their restraint before the Law published, was but restraint in the Prison, until an opportunity of shipping them away. They who after the Law was published, would that notwithstanding break-in upon us from England, or other forraign parts, by Ro de-Island, after their correction received, and discharging their dues, might return again to the Island, if they pleased.

            <p>The <hi>question is not concerning God's Power, but concerning his Will.</hi> God can preserve his Truth immediatly without any external meanes but his pleasure is ordinarily to doe it mediately. Hence he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Arke according to divine Institution, with a double sence, both Ecclesiastical and Civil. God can also save man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, from evils committed against the second Table, but hee ordinarily effects it by the helpe of the magistrate. The injurie done unto the trueth, hurteth man whose welfare depends upon the imbracing of it. It hurts not God, nor the Trueth in it self, but only in the estimation of man. As Satan is permitted to raise up men to be offendors, so Christ raiseth up men to be defenders thereof: to manifest that through Grace, the Trueth hath even amongst men as great lovers, as it hath haters.</p>
