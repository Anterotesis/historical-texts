            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I HOPE, and have reaſon to believe, there have been many among you, of every Age, <hi>Fearing</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi> before GOD, and <hi>Preparing</hi> to meet Him in the way of His <hi>Judgments;</hi> and therefore you have been ſuch a number of you, ſo deſirous of having the following <hi>Sermon</hi> put into your hands, which if it may any ways contribute to the exciting a holy fear of GOD, and his Terrible Judgments in any, <hi>my Heart ſhall rejoyce, even mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was a pleaſure to me, to ſee your ready and general attendance upon the late day of FASTING and PRAYER, and your diligent and affectionate attention to the meſſages of GOD, then deliver'd to you.</p>
            <p>WOULD to GOD, that this <hi>Sermon</hi> together with the ſeaſonable and pungent Diſcourſe you had from my worthy Brother <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Allin</hi> of <hi>Brooklin.</hi>
               </note> on the ſame day, may in the hands of the Almighty Spirit be inſtrumental to bring on the <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> then earneſtly exhorted to, as the call of GOD to us by his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and by the EARTHQUAKE in a more particular manner.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:002861_0008_0FE679A7C26C3570"/>MOT. I. <hi>THE coming of the Lord is doubtleſs foretold to excite and quicken us to diligence in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ready for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS was written for our admonition and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon whom the <hi>ends of the world are come.</hi> GOD foreſaw how carnally ſecure and ſtupid a wicked World would be, how ready to put far from them the day of his coming; that they might therefore be rowz'd out of ſuch ſecurity, he does by his Prophets and Apoſtles ſolemnly warn a ſecure World to prepare for it, <hi>leſt coming ſuddenly, he finds us ſleeping.</hi> Now ſurely, the Great GOD would not do thus, nor ſpeak ſo much of his <hi>coming,</hi> were it not to quicken us to a diligent and inſtant preparing for it. Hence the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> after he had propheſy'd of the Terrible Day of the Lord approaching, he immediately exhorts to <hi>Repent, and turn to the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12.</note>. So that it ſeems evidently to be the great deſign and end of GOD in denouncing his Judgments and particularly, in the awful predictions of that Great Day of the Lord's coming upon a ſecure World, to awaken Men to the utmoſt care and diligence in getting ready for his <hi>Coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOT. II. <hi>OUR Condition will be unutterably diſtreſſing if we are not prepar'd for the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we ſhall then be found in a Chriſtleſs Eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF that Great and Terrible Day we look for, ſhould ſpeedily arrive, when <hi>the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up;</hi> and the Son of Man, the glorious Judge of the World, ſhall perſonally and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly deſcend with a glorious retinue of Holy Angels, and that voice, that <hi>Midnight</hi> cry, ſhall be heard,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:002861_0009_0FE679A7E5002718"/>
ARISE YE DEAD, AND COME TO JUDGMENT; If this were to be the Day of the glorious deſcent of the Son of GOD, in which he were to puniſh with an Everlaſting deſtruction from his preſence &amp; the glory of his power, all ſuch as have not obey'd his Goſpel: How terrible muſt his Approach be? Finding our ſelves among the number of his Enemies, who would not have him to reign over us. We ſhall in the midſt of our confuſion with <hi>bitterneſs of heart, and bitter wailing</hi> reflect on our paſt refuſals of offer'd Grace and Mercy, when we were ſo often intreated to be reconciled to GOD, to make haſte to Chriſt, as our City of Refuge, that in ſuch a day we might have been hid under the ſhadow of his wings, and had a bleſſed time of refreſhment from the preſence of the LORD:</p>
            <p>WE ſhall think with anguiſh upon the many war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings we had of ſuch a day approaching, and haſtning upon us, and yet that we ſhould regard them no more: that we ſhould notwithſtanding go on in the ways of our hearts and in the ſight of our eyes, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the deſires of the fleſh, &amp; of the mind, without any grief or remorſe of Spirit at all therefor: that the calls we had to <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> one time after another, ſhou'd be ſo ſlighted and diſregarded by us; that tho' Chriſt ſtood ſo long at the doors of our Souls, knocking for entrance, deſiring to come in, and take poſſeſſion of us, for himſelf, that he might rule and reign in us, &amp; conform us to his holy Image and likeneſs; that we notwithſtanding bolted the door faſt againſt him, were ſo ſlothful and ſluggiſh that we would not ariſe to let him in. And alas, We now ſee, we are miſerable and undone without Him, that there's none can ſave or help us but Chriſt: Though it will be now in vain to look for Salvation from the Hills, or the Multitude of the Mountains, yet we ſhall not forbear crying to the rocks &amp; mountains, we ſee making and trembling about us, to fall upon us, and hide us from the preſence of him that ſits upon
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:002861_0010_0FE679AF0E7C6790"/>
the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. We ſhall dread to make our Perſonal appearance before the Judge of the whole Earth; How glad ſhould we be, we might in a moment be annihilated, and return to our firſt nothing? But when we ſee, we muſt whether we will or no, immediately attend the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and appear before our Judge, and receive our Doom; Oh with what reluctance, ſhame and regret, muſt we be forc'd away to the Bar of GOD, whom we ſhall behold as a <hi>conſuming Fire,</hi> ready to adjudge us to Everlaſting Fire with the Devil and his Angels, in this lower World all on Fire ready to devour us; How ſhall we tremble, and die away with anguiſh, to think, we muſt now take up our dwelling in Flames, and though we ſhould lift up our Eyes, and cry for a drop of Water, to cool us while ſo tormented, there would be no hope of obtaining it.</p>
            <p>IF We ſhould beg ſome of the <hi>Saints</hi> to take pity on us, their bowels will not yern towards us; though they know us, as deform'd and wtetched as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and it may be were near and dear to us, while together on Earth, and were then willing to have done their utmoſt for our comfort, they will not at all relent for us, now, they'l be intirely ſatisfy'd in the final determination of the <hi>Righteous Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR will the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> miniſter to our relief, in that day: They were ever ready before, to do us acts of kindneſs, and many were the kind and good Offices done by them for us, and glad would they have been to have ſeen us heirs of Salvation, and to have miniſtred to us, as ſuch, at ſuch a Day; but ſince we were not by all the goodneſs of GOD, engag'd to love, and ſerve, and live devoted to him, they'l know that our condemnation is juſt, that we are juſtly miſerable, and deſerve no pity or relief from them, no more than from the Saints, and therefore they'l never hearken to any cries or intreaties from us. Which way ſhall we then turn our ſelves?—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:002861_0011_0FE679AF2FDA5DC0"/>SURELY we cant hope, nor in the leaſt expect, any relief from the <hi>Evil Angels;</hi> Though they ſooth'd and flatter'd us, while we hearkned to their vile ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, as if there was no danger, we might go on ſecurely, and never feel ſuch impreſſions of the wrath of GOD, we were often threatn'd withal, they'l now its probable be ſo far from attempting our relief, that they'l with cruel Joy be the executiouers of GOD'S holy vengeance on us; and will upbraid us exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for our inexcuſable folly, in regarding their Sollicitations as we did, from one time to another, when even our own Conſciences condemn'd us at the ſame time: They will be doubtleſs inſtrumental of increaſing, if poſſible, our everlaſting vexation and ſorrow, while tormented with them.</p>
            <p>BUT cannot the <hi>Multitudes</hi> in torment with us, afford ſome relief; won't the vaſt numbers of our <hi>Fellow-Creatures</hi> with us, be ſome alleviation, or in ſome Meaſure abate our Torments? Surely we cant have the leaſt hope of this: the beholding of them in Torment may be an aggravation, or increaſe of ours: We may perhaps, behold ſeveral under the ſame condemnation, tearing themſelves and curſing of us, as having been inſtrumental of their ruin, by our evil examples, by enticing them into thoſe paths that led down to thoſe Chambers of Death: If they had not hearkn'd to our Sollicitations to evil, and been Companions with us, they might have been rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with Saints and Angels, in the Kingdom of GOD; but ſuch was the pernicious bewitching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of our evil Converſation, that they were miſerably deluded and led away thereby, and ſo were never reſcued out of the paths of the deſtroyer: With what indignation and revenge muſt ſuch behold one another, and how will ſuch Reflections exaſperate their angry furious minds, and add to their extreme anguiſh?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:002861_0012_0FE679B1CF769E40"/>AND</p>
            <p>FINALLY, When they conſider, there will be no <hi>Intermiſſion</hi> of their Torment, and no <hi>End</hi> of it, that the Worm ſhall never Die, nor the Fire be ever Quenched; who can poſſibly imagine how cutting and tormenting ſuch Reflections muſt be?</p>
            <p>BUT its impoſſible for me to give you any adaequate Ideas or conceptions thereof; I have now endeavour'd to raiſe ſome Ideas in your Minds of the miſerable diſtreſſing Condition you will be in, if found out of CHRIST at his <hi>Coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND I appeal to your <hi>Conſcience,</hi> whether you have not the ſame Apprehenſions as to thoſe, who will be then found in an Unconverted Eſtate; and if you have, ſhould not the Conſideration of it, excite you to the utmoſt care and diligence, that you may be found of him in Peace?</p>
            <p>AND thus I have conſider'd ſomething of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that muſt fill the Souls of thoſe who ſhall be found in a Chriſtleſs Eſtate, if the Day of the Lord ſhould immediately come upon us.</p>
            <p>I will now go on to conſider ſomething of the like diſtreſs, of Chriſtleſs Souls in the day of their Death, when the Lord ſhall in this way come unto them.</p>
            <p>THE Lord may be yet <hi>Long-ſuffering</hi> towards an evil World, and for wiſe and holy ends delay his <hi>Coming</hi> to <hi>Judgment;</hi> GOD may have yet more great and glorious things to accompliſh before his <hi>Coming,</hi> in this ſenſe. But when it ſhall be, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a ſecret in his own Eternal Councils: <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels in Heaven, nor the Son of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:002861_0013_0FE679B1F236FB00"/>BUT if we ſhould ſuppoſe it to be yet a great way off, yet the Day of the Lords coming to us by Death, and ſo calling us immediately after to <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we certainly know, this coming of the Lord, cannot be far off, and that determines our State for Eternity as ſurely, as if it were the general Day of <hi>Judgment.</hi> And how ſoon the day of our Death may come upon us, is altogether uncertain to us; our Souls may this <hi>very night</hi> be required of us.</p>
            <p>IF the Meſſenger of Death were to call us out of this World, before the light of another Morning, ſhould we not dread the King of Terrors thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to us, to behold the <hi>Pale Horſe</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> with him, or <hi>following after him;</hi> If we evidently felt our lives drawing nigh to the Grave, that our Immortal Spirits muſt preſently leave theſe diſſolving Bodies, and take their flight into the unſeen World of Spirits to take up our Everlaſting abode there, if we had the free uſe and exerciſe of our Reaſon and underſtanding, how diſtreſſing would the proſpect be to us, finding our ſelves haſtning to a Day we are utterly unprovided for; a day, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Warnings we have had, we have put far from us — and ſo have left undone many things we ſhould, and thought to have done, and have been doing many things, we had better have left undone, and ſo have been laying in for a bitter Repentance, againſt ſuch a day: We ſhall now find our ſelves in ill terms with Heaven, ſee nothing but Frowns in the face of GOD, and find him rebuking us in his anger, and chaſtning us in his hot diſpleaſure, the terrors of GOD ſetting themſelves in array againſt us, filling us with terrible impreſſions of fiery indignation and wrath ready to devour us; We ſhall with grief of heart reflect on our not being perſwaded by thoſe who knowing the terrors of the Lord were often warning and urging us to flee the wrath to come, to make our peace with GOD, and get ready for a dying Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="unknown:002861_0014_0FE679B957F94888"/>AND now, finding our ſelves utterly unfit for the Kingdom of GOD, having hearts full of enmity to GOD, and Chriſt, and Holineſs, and knowing we have never heartily ſubmitted to Chriſts Kingly power and government, but been trampling his Holy Laws under our feet, and ſo have diſhonor'd his Name, quench'd and vex'd his holy Spirit, and wounded our Souls, and have the guilt of all lying upon us, a burden heavy enough to ſink us into the pit of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſorrows; Oh how oppreſſed and diſtreſſed may we well be? We us'd to think light of Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and could run into the commiſſion of it, with little or no concern; But now we ſee, they are fools who make a mock at Sin, and that all Sin is infinitely more provoking to GOD, than ever we thought it to be: Beginning now to feel what the wages of Sin are, we may well <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>tremble,</hi> The death of the Body is very awful, to think of being preſently turn'd into a lifeleſs lump of Clay, and hid in the Grave; but this has not ſuch a ſhocking, terrifying aſpect, as the fears of a ſecond Death, the death of the Soul, the everlaſting ſeperation of it from the preſence of GOD, to hear from the mouth of our incenſed Judge, that Sentence, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know you not; depart from me ye curſed into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.</hi> Oh the direful convulſions &amp; tremblings we may be well put into! But I paſs from this Melancholy Head, to one more pleaſant and delightful.</p>
            <p>MOT. III. <hi>WE ſhall be inexpreſſibly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably bleſſed, if we are found of our Judge in peace, without ſpot and blameleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF we are of the number who have fled for refuge to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have by a true and lively faith laid hold on his <hi>glorious Righteouſneſs,</hi> and thereby obtain'd <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi> before GOD; with what calmneſs and
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:002861_0015_0FE679B978836C28"/>
ſerenity of Mind, may we entertain the thoughts of the Lords coming, either as to his <hi>viſible</hi> &amp; <hi>perſonal Coming in the glory of his Father, with the Holy Angels, or his coming</hi> to us in the way of <hi>Mortality;</hi> His coming in both ways is what we have employ'd our thoughts much upon, and have been above all things concerned that we might be ready for; while others have made it their great enquiry, what they ſhould eat and drink and wherewithal they ſhould be clothed, it has been our great Sollicitude what we ſhould do that we might inherit Eternal Life, that we might be entituled to, and made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in light; our Souls have been therefore following hard after GOD, prizing and earneſtly ſeeking communion with him in the way of Ordinances, according to his Command and direction, and have thereby obtain'd gracious Manifeſtations of his Love &amp; favour, ſo that we have comfortable grounds of hope, that a new and ſaving change has paſs'd upon us, that we are born of the Spirit, and born from above, are by a gracious adoption become the Children of GOD, and heirs of the Heavenly inheritance, and are daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring &amp; ripening for the employments &amp; enjoyments of the Kingdom of GOD: With what pleaſure and ſatisfaction may ſuch look for the coming of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Clouds of Heaven? When he ſhall thus appear, it will be to their Eternal joy, for in a moment they ſhall be changed, this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality, and ſo Death ſhrll be ſwallowed up in victory, and they ſhall be caught up in the air, and be together, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with the Lord: So that they may now ſincerely and chearfully pray, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> And if He ſhould ſpeedily come by Death, he ſhall be a moſt welcome meſſenger to them. Knowing their Saviour has by dying tak'n away the ſting of Death, they ſhall be able to ſing that Song of triumph; <hi>O Death where is thy Sting, O Grave where is thy

Victory!</hi> Its refreſhing to them to think Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſcended into the dark and ſilent Grave, to make it a bed of reſt for them, that their Bodies might ſleep quietly there, and awake refreſh't in the bright and glorious morning of the Reſurrection, and then ſtand up in their lot, &amp; ſhare in the joys &amp; glories of the Reſurrection World: And that their <hi>Spirits</hi> guarded by Holy Angels thro' the territories of the Prince of the power of the air, ſhall go immediately to the Paradiſe of GOD, to the manſions prepared for them in their heavenly fathers houſe, to aſſociate with glorious and holy Angels, and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, to be led by the Lamb that is in the midſt of the Throne to living Fountains of Waters, and have all tears wip'd away from their eyes, &amp; ſpend an eternity in admiring &amp; adoring riches of redeeming love and grace manifeſted towards them; And they ſhall have an inexpreſſibly ſatisfying aſſurance of all this imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after their Death; for being found cloth'd with the glorious <hi>Robe</hi> of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> they ſhall be preſented before the preſence of his glory, <hi>with exceeding joy;</hi> and immediately hear that Bleſſed Sentence, from the mouth of their Saviour and Judge, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World.</hi> But eye has not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor has it enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive of the bleſſedneſs of thoſe who ſhall be found ready and prepared for the <hi>Coming of the Lord.</hi>

               <hi>THE Judgments of GOD are thoſe manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his vindictive or corrective Juſtice, whereby He lets the World know, what a Sin-hating GOD He is.</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002861_0021_0FE679C1B987BCC8"/>THESE Judgments are Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal. GOD can arm the whole Creation againſt us, and make every thing we enjoy to be deſtructive to us. GOD does not willingly afflict or greive the Children of Men; but when by their Sins they provoke Him, he ſends down his Judgments on them; the Judgments of GOD are the proper Object of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mans fear, for hereby GOD diſcovers his juſt diſpleaſure at Sin, Pſal. 9.15. <hi>The Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth:</hi> Yea, Godly Men have been afraid of GOD'S Judgments; thus was the Pſalmiſt in the Text, <hi>I am afraid of thy Judgments;</hi> ſo was holy Job, 31.23. <hi>Deſtruction from God was a terror to me.</hi> Various are the Judgments of GOD, and the rebukes of Heaven, we lye expoſed unto, and are often ſuffering and groaning under. The Great GOD who is holy in all his ways and righteous in all his works, is ſometimes provok'd to come out in Judgment, and to write bitter things againſt us in the way of his Providence. It is ſometimes the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and holy Pleaſure of GOD, to lay us under ſome ſore Judgments, and to threaten the infliction of yet more, and greater; There are the Judgments of <hi>Sword, Famine,</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> the Lord often brings upon us. He ſometimes ſends cleaneſs of teeth, a great ſcarcity of the neceſſaries of Life, ſometimes he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Rain, which makes the Earth Fruitful, cauſing the <hi>Heavens over us to be as braſs, and the earth under us as iron, and the rain of the land powder and duſt:</hi> We have ſometimes had ſad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay with the Prophet, Joel, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.19, <hi>The fire has devoured the paſtures of the Wilderneſs, the rivers of water are dried up,</hi> &amp;c. So does GOD ſometimes viſit his People with ſcorching Droughts, and ſometimes with long and exceſſive Rains, the Fruits of the Earth have been often diminiſhed, the Trees not yeilded their Fruit, nor the Land its uſual Increaſe. Sometimes GOD ſends Infectious, Epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical

Sickneſs, that proves Mortal, and ſweeps away Multitudes, the ſlain of the Lord have been awfully multiplied in one place and another; there is alſo the Judgment of the <hi>Sword,</hi> when GOD lets looſe the enemy upon us, to waſte our Subſtance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Lives of many. How dreadfully has a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and Righteous GOD puniſh'd us in Years paſt, by long and bloody Wars, when we have ſeen <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments roll'd in Blood, our young Men ſlain,</hi> and many carried into a miſerable Captivity, and there poyſon'd with the <hi>Romiſh Religion?</hi> There are alſo the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Storms and Tempeſts of Wind, Thunder and Lightning,</hi> which we have ſeen and felt to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree, in the Weeks and Months that are paſt; But a very few Weeks ago, upon the Evening before the Sabbath, <note n="*" place="bottom">

And now, upon the Evening after the Sabbath, the Lord has bro't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, the unuſual and terrible Judgment of the EARTHQUAKE; we have thus ſeen that awful word fulfill'd, Iſa. 29.6. <hi>Thou ſhall be viſited of the Lord of hoſts, with thunder, and with Earthquake, and great noiſe, with ſtorm, and tempeſt, and flame of devouring fire;</hi> and that in Pſal. 18.7. <hi>Then the Earth ſhook and trembled, the foundations alſo of the hills moved, and were ſhaken —.</hi> Among the awful Judgments of GOD, this of the EARTHQUAKE is much ſpoken of. It is very particularly and moſt awfully, in the <hi>twenty fourth Chapter of Iſaiah,</hi> which you may do well to read this Day with a very great attention; I will ſingle out a few verſes, and read them to you now; <hi>Behold the Lord maketh the

Earth empty, and maketh it waſt, and turneth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, and ſcattereth abroad the Inhabitants thereof. The Land ſhall be utterly emptied, and utterly ſpoiled, for the Lord hath ſpoken this word, the Earth mourneth, and fadeth away, the World languiſheth. The haughty People of the Earth do languiſh; the earth alſo is defiled under the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the laws, and broken the everlaſting covenant; therefore hath the Curſe devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein, are deſolate, therefore the Inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left, all the merry hearted do ſigh: the noiſe of them that rejoyce endeth; they ſhall not drink wine with a ſong, ſtrong drink ſhall be bitter to them that drink it; all joy is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the mirth of the land is gone; in the City is left deſolation, fear, and the pit, and the ſnare are upon thee, O Inhabitant of the earth; and it ſhall come to paſs, that he who fleeth from the noiſe of the fear, ſhall fall into the pit, and he that cometh up out of the midſt of the pit, ſhall be taken in the ſnare; for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do ſhake: the earth is moved exceedingly, the earth ſhall reel to and fro like a Drunkard: and the tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it, and it ſhall fall and not riſe again.</hi> In Iſaiah, Chap. 2. from the 19 ver. we read, <hi>In that day, they ſhall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the caves of the earth for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the Earth.</hi> In the 13th Chap. at the 13th ver. we alſo read of the Lords <hi>Shaking the Heavens, and the Earth, removing out of her place;</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> alſo ſpeaks of it, Ezek. 38.19, 20. <hi>In that day, there ſhall be a great ſhaking in the Land,</hi> &amp;c.

tremble, for the Day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand, a day of darkneſs, and gloomineſs, a day of clouds, and of thick darkneſs, there has not been ever the like, nor ſhall be any more after it, a fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame burneth, the people ſhall be much pained, all faces ſhall gather blackneſs, the earth ſhall quake before them, the heavens ſhall tremble, the ſun and moon ſhall be dark, and the ſtars ſhall withdraw their ſhining, and the Lord ſhall utter his voice before his army; His Camp is very great, for he is ſtrong that executeth his word, for the day of the Lord is great, and very terrible, and who can abide it?</hi> He ſpeaks of it again in the next Chapter, <hi>The day of the Lord is near,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Lord alſo ſhall rore out of Zion, and the Heavens and the Earth ſhall ſhake,</hi> The Prophet Haggai ſays, Chap. 2 6. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens and the earth, and the Sea, and the dry land, and I will ſhake all nations:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> alſo ſpeaks of this day of the Lord; Mal. 4.1. <hi>For behold the day cometh, that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day that cometh, ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that it ſhall leave them, neither root, nor branch.</hi> In the Goſpel we read of <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,</hi> as forerunners of our <hi>Saviours</hi> coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Math. 24.7, 8. <hi>There ſhall be Famines and Peſtilences, and Earthquakes, all theſe are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſorrows:</hi> He ſpeaks here of the <hi>Son of Man's coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory,</hi> and of the ſame ſigns preceeding it, that the Prophets but now mentioned ſpake of; The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, in the third Chapter of his Second Epiſtle, ſpeaks remarkably of our haſting unto the coming of this Day of GOD, and of its coming moſt ſuddenly and unexpectedly upon a ſecure unprepared World, <hi>When the Heavens ſhould paſs away with a

great noiſe, and the Elements melt with fervent heat,</hi> &amp;c. So that, we may well look for ſuch awful ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpenſations, as we have been this Week under; They are indeed very terrible, and GOD only knows, what will be the iſſue — It certainly looks as if GOD was very Angry with us, and we ripe for his terrible Judgments; And therefore when GOD threatens to bring them, and this of the <hi>Earthquake</hi> in a particular manner he ſays, Iſa. 13.13. <hi>I will ſhake the Heavens, and the Earth ſhall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hoſts, and in the day of his fierce anger;</hi> And alſo in Ezek. 38.19. <hi>For in my Jealouſy, and in the fire of my wrath, have I ſpoken, ſurely in that day there ſhall be a great ſhaking in the land,</hi> &amp;c. Our Fleſh therefore trembles for fear of what GOD may be about to do, by this <hi>Judicial Diſpenſation,</hi> in a more eſpecial manner.</p>
            <p>I might Finally, under this Head ſpeak of <hi>Spiritual Plagues and Judgments,</hi> we ly expos'd to, and its to be fear'd, many have dreadfully expos'd themſelves to their being inflicted on them, and theſe are the worſt of Judgments, to be given up to blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart, to be caſt away from the preſence of GOD, and to have his holy Spirit ceaſe ſtriving with us, to have the word, and means of grace made a ſavour of Death unto Death, having a blinding and hardning efficacy on the hearts of Men. Oh Dreadful Judgments! And above all other to be deprecated, for if this Judgment be inflicted on any, they will ripen apace for Eternal Deſtruction; If they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer upon the Earth, it will be only <hi>to fill up the meaſure of their Iniquities, and treaſure up to themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the righteous Judgments of God, which will be reveal'd againſt them,</hi> and forever inflicted on them in the World they are going into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002861_0026_0FE679D27812B4B0"/>BUT this may ſuffice for the Firſt Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> What may be meant by the <hi>Judgments</hi> of GOD, and What the <hi>Judgments</hi> are, we are expoſed unto, and may be afraid of?</p>
            <p>THEY are outward and Temporal, and alſo Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Eternal Plagues and Judgments.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE Second thing propos'd was to ſhew, <hi>What may be meant by Trembling for fear of GOD, and being afraid of his Judgments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>IT may mean, or imply in it, our Solemn &amp; Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apprehenſions of the Great GOD, who brings ſuch Judgments upon us.</hi> That we adore his Infinite Wiſdom, and Almighty Power, adore Him as a GOD <hi>wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength, againſt whom none ever hardned themſelves and proſper'd, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the mountains, and they know not, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth them in his anger, who ſhaketh the earth out of her place, and at whoſe preſence the pillars thereof tremble:</hi> That we Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and make Him our Fear and our Dread: That we adore his Sovereignty and Righteouſneſs, in his awful diſpenſations, that we imploy our ſerious, devout, and ſolemn thoughts on theſe, and other glorious Excellencies &amp; Perfections of Almighty GOD diſplay'd in his Judgments; they muſt be the Subject of our frequent &amp; ſolemn Meditations, that ſo we may always maintain on our Hearts ſuitable Apprehenſions of the Great GOD who ſends his Judgments upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>IT may imply in it, and mean our being ſenſibly touched and affected with the conſideration of the Judgments that are, or may be yet brought upon us.</hi> That we ſo reſent them, as that they make deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon our Hearts, that our Spirits are moſt ſorrowfully affected with the tokens of the Divine
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002861_0027_0FE679D29DBBD100"/>
anger viſible therein; and that we weep bitterly in ſecret places, in the conſideration thereof, wiſhing <hi>our heads were waters, and our eyes a fountain of tears, that we might weep day and night therefor.</hi> Thus griev'd and concern'd ſhould we be continually, which may be very much meant by our <hi>trembling for fear of God, and being afraid of his Judgments.</hi> Our Hearts then being deeply &amp; ſorrowfully affected with the Judgments of Heaven inflicted, or threatned, may be meant hereby.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>HEREBY may be meant our humbling our ſelves exceedingly before GOD who is thus viſiting, and threatning of us.</hi> That we lay our hands on our mouths, and our mouths in the duſt before Him, and there <hi>repent and abhor our ſelves;</hi> that we do, while trembling before him, judge and condemn our ſelves, acknowledging we are guilty before GOD, and that he might juſtly be angry with us, till he hath conſum'd us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant, nor eſcaping. We muſt humbly acknowledge and declare the Lord to be juſt, in whatever He is pleaſed to lay upon us, that he does right, but we have done wickedly, that he puniſhes us much leſs than our iniquities have deſerv'd, that he ſhall be therefore juſtified when he ſpeaketh, and clear when he Judgeth, that we will accept the puniſhment of our Sins, and bear the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lord, becauſe we have ſinned againſt Him. That we continue ſighing and crying for the abominations that are committed among us, for the many provoking evils that are to be found in the midſt of us, to the infinite diſhonor of the Holy GOD, and the wounding of many precious Souls.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>THIS may imply in it, the greatneſs of our fear and diſtreſs.</hi> It is here ſpoken, as if the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002861_0028_0FE679D3F3EE0588"/>
of GOD'S Judgments did ſo affright the Pſalmiſt, as nothing elſe could. It is doubtleſs thus expreſs'd to ſet forth the greatneſs of his fear, how deeply he reſented the hand of GOD therein; we ſee how <hi>Moſes</hi> reſented the Judgments of GOD, Pſal. 90.11. <hi>Who knoweth the power of his Anger, even according to thy fear ſo is thy wrath.</hi> We muſt ſo reſent the Judgments of GOD, as to manifeſt, they are no light and trivial matters to us, as the Pſalmiſt did, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prays as in Pſal. 6.1. <hi>O Lord Rebuke me not in thine anger, nor chaſten me in thy hot diſpleaſure.</hi> When Men are much affrighted, how do their Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enances change, and their Bodies tremble, and what can cauſe this more than the ſenſe of GOD'S Anger, which he manifeſts in his Judgments, if we are rightly ſenſible of them; How did <hi>Belſhazzars knees ſhake and tremble</hi> at that Judgment threatned in the <hi>Writing on the Wall;</hi> yea, how did the Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk, Tremble</hi> for fear of GOD, Hab. 3.16. <hi>When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, rotteneſs enter'd into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf.</hi> And ſo the Pſalmiſt does in theſe words expreſs the greatneſs of his fear, at the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of GOD'S diſpleaſure in his Judgments. So then they may imply, our fearing nothing ſo much as the Lords anger in his judicial diſpenſations; that the conſideration hereof fills us with the greateſt fear and concern of Spirit, that GOD has been ſo provok'd to come out againſt us in his Anger, and to threaten our utter ruin and deſolation.</p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p n="5">5. &amp; laſtly, <hi>THS fear, and trembling may imply in it, a conſcientious and diligent care to avoid and forſake every provoking evil, and repair to GOD in Chriſt, as our only City of Refuge for Safety.</hi> That our fear of GOD excites us <hi>to depart from all
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002861_0029_0FE679D42F8F3390"/>
evil,</hi> to abſtain from appearances of it, and approaches towards it, that we therefore <hi>Stand in awe of GOD,</hi> and dread to allow our ſelves in the commiſſion of any known evils, which are the procuring cauſes of the Divine Anger; that we do with a holy fear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Soul, in our times of diſtreſs and danger, under Judgments inflicted, or fear'd, make haſte to Chriſt and get under the ſhadow of his wings; that ſhould be our language while we are <hi>Fearing</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi> before Him, Pſal. 57.1. <hi>Be merciful unto me O God, Be merciful unto me, for my Soul truſteth in thee, yea, in the ſhadow of thy wings, will I make my refuge, until theſe Calamities be overpaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH things as theſe may be imply'd in our <hi>Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for fear of GOD, and being afraid of his Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Proceed now to the Third and laſt Head Propounded.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>THAT ſuch may be our Condition and Circumſtances, that we may have abundant reaſon and occaſion thus to Tremble and be Afraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Profeſſing People may be left to fall into ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacies, to forſake the Lord, the Lord GOD of their Fathers, they <hi>may</hi> be left to depart from the bleſſed truths of GOD, and may forſake GOD in reſpect of his holy Inſtitutions, his holy Worſhip and Ordinances, and forſake him in reſpect of Converſation, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ways of <hi>Pride, Senſuality, and Unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs,</hi> by being <hi>Unholy and Profane;</hi> the fear of GOD may be evidently wanting in Men, there may be ſcandalous miſcarriages in many, firming againſt great light, love &amp; grace. Such may be, &amp; are our apoſtaſies from the good ways of the Lord, that He may ſay to us, as in Jer. 2.21. <hi>I planted thee, a noble vine, wholly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002861_0030_0FE679DBEC392AC0"/>
a right ſeed, How art thou turned into the degenerate, plant of a ſtrange vine unto me.</hi> It is recorded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Children of Iſrael, Judg. 2.17. <hi>They turned quickly out of the ways which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Commandments of the Lord; but they did not ſo.</hi> Their Fathers did endeavour to uphold Religion in the power of it, but their Children did not ſo. See how <hi>Moſes</hi> once ſpake to them, Numb. 32.14. <hi>Behold ye are riſen up, in your Fathers ſtead, an increaſe of ſinful men.</hi> Alas! How much is it thus, at this Day; the firſt Generation of Chriſtians is gone off the Stage, &amp; in a manner the ſecond, and is there not another and a more ſinful riſen up in their ſtead? We read in Joel 1.2. <hi>Hear this ye old Men, and give ear all ye Inhabitants of the land, hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your Fathers ſaith the Lord.</hi> Were there ſuch Judgments formerly, as now there are: You may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, you have departed from GOD, and by your ſins have provok'd him ſo to puniſh you. And may it not be thus ſaid, with reference to our ſtate, and circumſtances &amp; the late diſpenſations of GOD towards us, Alas! for us! Had we ever more reaſon to ſtand trembling before GOD under fearful apprehenſions of impending vengeance; when we conſider of the many ſcandalous provoking evils abounding among us, ſuch as <hi>Oppreſſion, Injuſtice, Cozning &amp; Deceit, Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Evil Speaking, Pride, and Contention, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, Drunkenneſs, Unchaſtity, an Exceſſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate love to the World,</hi> and I may add <hi>the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Profaneneſs of Young People?</hi> How is GOD himſelf and our duty to him evidently neglected and forgotten by many, and a form of Godlineſs maintain'd and kept up, without the life and power of it? How is the ſacred and dreadful Name of GOD diſhonored, and blaſphem'd, by profane Curſing and Swearing? How are his holy Sabbaths inſtead of being ſtrictly obſerv'd and ſanctify'd, very much profan'd, by idle,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002861_0031_0FE679DC10F2DE00"/>
vain, trifling and unſutable Carriages? Do not ſome <hi>Forſake the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> frequently neglecting, and needleſſly ſtaying away from the Publick Worſhip of GOD? And have not the Lords holy Ordinances and Inſtitutions a manifeſt contempt put upon them? How many are regardleſs of coming up to them in a ſerious and worthy manner? Finally here, Dont mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Chriſtian love and Charity grow cold, the love of Men to GOD, and their Neighbour, a viſible cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indifference towards GOD and the power of Godlineſs? Alas for this People! Are not ſuch and many more iniquities prevailing among us, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying againſt us, that loudly proclame our impiety and great degeneracy, that we are an impenitent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible, and unreformed People ſtill, and ripening apace for a deſtruction without remedy? Surely then if the caſe be thus with us, we have reaſon to tremble for fear of GOD, and to be greatly afraid of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we may well be afraid of temporal plagues and Judgments, of heavier and ſorer, than we have been yet viſited withall; for the tranſgreſſions of GOD'S Covenant People are evceedingly provoking to Him, and deſerve to be ſeverely puniſh'd, yea, they are the more offenſive and provoking for their being a People in Covenant, GOD'S profeſſing People; Amos 3.2. <hi>You only have I known above all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I puniſh you for your iniquities.</hi> See how GOD once ſolemnly threatned to puniſh a profeſſing People, we may well tremble when we read, and be afraid of the Judgments threatn'd in the 26th <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> from the 14th <hi>v.</hi> 
               <q>But if ye will not hearken unto me, if ye ſhall deſpiſe my Statutes, and break my Covenant, I will do this unto you, I will appoint over you, Terror, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and the burning Ague, that ſhall cauſe ſorrow of Heart, and I will ſet my face againſt you, they that hate you ſhall reign over you; and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I

will puniſh you ſeven times more for your ſins, I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as braſs, the land ſhall not yield its increaſe, neither ſhall the trees of the land yeild their fruits; and if ye will walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring ſeven times more plagues upon you according to your ſins, I will make you few in number, and your high ways ſhall be deſolate, and if ye will not be reform'd by theſe things, but will walk contrary unto me, then will I alſo walk contrary unto you, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins, and will bring a Sword upon you, that ſhall avenge the quarrel of my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and I will ſend the Peſtilence among you, and ye ſhall be delivered into the hand of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and my Soul ſhall abhor you, and I will make your Cities waſte, and bring your Sanctuaries unto Deſolation, and I will bring the Land into Deſolation, your Land ſhall be deſolate and your Cities waſte.</q> Mayn't we be juſtly afraid at this Day of the fulfilment of theſe terrible threatnings; Indeed ſome of them have been awfully inflicted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, &amp; when we conſider of our many and greivous provocations of the Great GOD, maynt we fear, we ſhall be laid utterly waſte and deſolate? Or if the Lord ſhall yet ſpare us, maynt we be greatly afraid of having bro't on us that fearful Judgment denounced againſt Iſrael after the Lord had ſworn He would not forget any of their Sins, and that the Land ſhould tremble for them, ſee Amos 8. 11, 12. <hi>Behold the days come ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a Famine in the land, not a Famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord, and they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North, even to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it.</hi> But if our eyes ſhall yet ſee our Teachers, and our ears yet hear the word of Life diſpenſed to us, have we not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002861_0033_0FE679DD78AAE988"/>
reaſon to fear, that the Lords Ambaſſadors ſhall be ſent on that doleful errand the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Go and tell this People, hear ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</hi> I ſay, when we reflect on our paſt unprofitableneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, under the precious means and advantages enjoyed by us, maynt we fear the Lords thus Judicially coming out againſt us, and cauſing the means of Grace to have a blinding and hardning efficacy upon us? Mayn't we fear, that ſome are, and more ſhall be under ſuch a Judicial diſpenſation, who have not been, nor are like to be reformed either by Signal Mercies, or Terrible Judgments? May not the Lord ſay unto this People, as he once did unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when he wept over it, <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>Oh that thou hadſt known in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace, but now, they are hid from thine eyes!</hi> What awful Symptoms are there, of blindneſs, and hardneſs of heart; Mayn't we fear Men are dreadfully blinded, and hardn'd in their Sins, when there is not ſo much as an <hi>External Reformation,</hi> by all the <hi>Judgments</hi> of GOD? Are not the very iniquities that have been frequently and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly teſtify'd againſt by the Lord's Ambaſſadors, prevailing as much as ever?

            <p>
               <q>;THAT there was not a <hi>General Reformation</hi> in reſpect of ſo much as any one Evil found amongſt us.</q>

of Temporal Judgments, and of ſhaking diſpenſations to be trembled at, Amos 8.7, 8. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, ſurely I will never forget any of their works, ſhall not the Land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein?</hi> But this may ſuffice for the confirmation of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> viz. <hi>That ſuch may be our Condition and Circumſtances, that we may have abundant reaſon to Tremble for fear of GOD, and to be afraid of his Judgments.</hi> And if I am not greatly miſtaken, we are in ſuch a Condition, and in ſuch Circumſtances <hi>at this day,</hi> as may give us ſad Occaſion for ſuch Reflections.</p>
            <p>I Proceed to make ſome APPLICATION of theſe things.</p>
            <p>AND here;</p>
            <p>USE I. <hi>WE learn from what we have heard, the Aſtoniſhing Stupidity, Madneſs, and Folly of ſuch, as fear not the Lord, nor are afraid of his Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINNERS uſually mock at GOD'S Judgments, and put the evil day far from them; but did they conſider that GOD'S omniſcient Eye can find them out, and how his omniſcient Arm can puniſh them, they may juſtly <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Tremble,</hi> as the Godly <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> does here. I would fain hope, there's not a Man, Woman, or Child able to reflect upon the Providential diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD towards us, but what have had, and eſpecially ſince that <hi>lawful Night after the laſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> ſome concern of Spirit awakned in them, about working out their Salvation with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> and thereby preparing for the <hi>coming of the Lord.</hi> Verily, if you cant ſay that it has been ſo — you have been exceedingly Stupid, and if you cheriſh ſuch a frame, you are guilty of the greateſt madneſs &amp; folly, and if you dont fall down before, and give glory to that GOD who has made the Earth to Tremble, and

ſo make Confeſſion of your Sins, and ſeek earneſtly for Peace with him, he may not give you any further Warning, before he executes the fiercneſs of his Anger upon you. Jer. 5.21, 22. <hi>Hear now this O fooliſh People; and without underſtanding, which have eyes, and ſee not, which have ears, and hear not; Fear ye not me? ſaith the Lord; will ye not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at my preſence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE II. <hi>WE hence learn, What is the beſt frame to entertain GOD's Judgments withal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO adore the Perfections of the Glorious GOD diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in them, to be afraid of them, deeply to reſent the Divine diſpleaſure, and humble our ſelves under his mighty hand, and ſo ſtand in awe of him, as to Renounce and Abandon every evil way, and betake our ſelves to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as the only City of Refuge; and happy ſhall they be who do thus <hi>Kiſs</hi> the Son of GOD with a kiſs of Homage and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>They ſhall not periſh from the way; when his wrath is kindled, and he is angry, Bleſſed ſhall they be who thus put their truſt in him</hi>

            <p>USE III. <hi>LEARN hence, that it is no Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize, to be afraid of GOD's Judgments; but very agreable to true Chriſtian Courage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD is no fit match for us to contend withal, <hi>none ever hardn'd themſelves againſt him, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd;</hi> Job 9.3. He is our Creator, we are his Creatures, and are as <hi>Clay in the hand of the Potter;</hi> He is the <hi>King of Kings;</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords;</hi> GOD cannot miſs of his end, as the Princes of this World may, in the execution of their diſpleaſure, thro' im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency or want of knowledge; for he is infinite in

Knowledge, Wiſdom and Power; and there's no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between Infinite and Finite: It is then no Cowardize to fear GOD: our Saviour <hi>Math.</hi> 10.28. adviſes us to this <hi>Fear;</hi> and it is agreable to true Chriſtian Courage; this ſhould be expreſs'd in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a reverential fear of GOD upon our minds, in fighting againſt the Enemies of our Salvation, in mortifying our luſts, and ſtedfaſtly perſevering in all the duties of our Holy Religion, and not in diſobeying his Commands, and deſpiſing his <hi>Judgments,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning his Rod, and ſetting our ſelves in oppoſition to his Threatnings; this is the moſt daring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious f;olly and madneſs, and will be found ſo in the end.</p>
            <p>USE IV. WE learn from what we have heard, <hi>The reaſon of the Lords awful threatning us, as he does at this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR many provoking Iniquities have been the procuring cauſe: our evil ways and doings have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd theſe rebukes from Heaven upon us: We are not humbled even unto this day, neither have we <hi>feared,</hi> nor walked in his Statutes which he ſet before us, and before our Fathers. Therefore the Lord of Hoſts, the GOD of Iſrael, has ſet his face againſt us for evil <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>Wherefore,</p>
            <p>V. &amp; laſtly. <hi>LET our Fleſh now Tremble for fear of GOD, and let us be afraid of his Judgments; and let us once at laſt hearken to the Exhortation, to Reform and Amend ovr ways and doings, if we would look, or hope to be Sav'd from deſtroying Judgments.</hi>

Anger? I am ſure, you ought to be ſo; and if you are not, you are ſtupid indeed! I hope there are few or none before the Lord now, but are in this Day of fear and concern, ſerious and thoughtful, what may be the meaning of GOD in this Terrible Diſpenſation, Surely, the Great GOD is very wroth, and therefore he has been ſo terribly Shaking the Earth <hi>This Week,</hi> and we may look to feel yet more terrible <hi>Shocks</hi> — if a thorough <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> prevent not: And this you have been Oh how often exhorted, and urged to, and the Lord who alone knows &amp; ſearches Hearts, knows how many of You there are, who have never yet comply'd with this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and have therefore been greatly inſtrumental of bringing down this unuſual Judgment of GOD upon us; and unto ſuch I would now addreſs my ſelf, and with bowels of pity and concern, intreat &amp; beſeech them, not to go on any longer in their Sins unrepented of; I would adviſe ſuch, as they would not be deaf to GOD'S voice this Week unto them, to be <hi>ſearching their Hearts, and trying their ways;</hi> that you do without any longer delay, take ſome ſuitable time, to look within your ſelves, and to reflect with all poſſible Seriouſneſs and Solemnity of Spirit, upon all your paſt evil ways and doings, you are able to bring to your remembrance; and eſpecially mourn for the Carnality, the corruptions and great wickedneſs of your evil Heart, that <hi>carnal mind</hi> and heart within you, <hi>which is enmity againſt GOD;</hi> And Oh be perſwaded to bring your hard, corrupt, and depraved heart to GOD, for renewing and cleanſing, for ſoftning and healing: <hi>to take away your heart of ſtone, and give you an heart of fleſh:</hi> And Oh plead with GOD the gracious promiſes he has made to do ſo, unto thoſe who will inquire of, and ſeek to him for it: And bring unto the Lord, as thy corrupt and wicked Heart, ſo come to him alſo with the wickedneſs of thy Life lying heavy upon thy Heart, by which you
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002861_0038_0FE679EB4C46E220"/>
have diſhonour'd GOD, &amp; quenched the Spirit of GOD, and wounded your Soul: Oh let it be with utmoſt grief, diſtreſs and anguiſh reflected upon; know and ſee the evil and bitterneſs of ſuch ways and doings, which your Conſciences muſt tell you, have not been right; abhor your ſelves before GOD in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, judge and condemn your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as utterly unworthy of any Mercy or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from him; and having thus mourn'd for your Provocations of GOD, earneſtly implore Divine pity and Pardoning Mercy thro' the merits of Chriſt, for his ſake alone; and reſolve by the help of Divine grace you will <hi>caſt away from you all your tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> Then might you hope to be Sav'd from the Judgments of GOD, or hid under the ſhadow of his wings untill the heat of his indignation be overpaſt: By ſuch a <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> you may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Lords deſign and end in the <hi>Threatning Diſpenſation</hi> — you might then have reaſon to hope that the Lord would <hi>repent him of the evil</hi> which he had tho't yet further to have bro't upon you. Jer. 26.13. <hi>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced againſt you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OH what Encouragement have we then to be humbling our ſelves before GOD, as we do this day, but what will all our Confeſſions avail, if we will not forſake as well as confeſs our Sins: Let each one of us then, from <hi>this day,</hi> ſet himſelf to reform and amend every thing that is amiſs, every one ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> And have not I done a great deal, to bring down this new and tremendous Judgment? If we dont with the greateſt concern of Soul do ſo, this will not be an acceptable Day unto the Lord. I truſt GOD has a remnant of his reformed and faithful People here, a number of ſuch as tremble at his word, and at his Judgments, Men of a humble &amp; contrite Spirit,

Men of Prayer, and of a holy Converſation, who are laying to heart the Sins of the Times, and of the Place in which they live, and who are daily interceeding with GOD for ſparing Mercy to a ſinful Land: And how many ſuch are there in other Towns &amp; Places doing ſo, and have been in a very ſolemn manner this Week <note n="†" place="bottom">The Day before, all the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Boston</hi> kept a Day of <hi>Foſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and at <hi>Charleſtown.</hi>

Let us beg of the Lord to ſhew to us what he would have us to learn &amp; do, by this awful Voice unto us: I hope <hi>(My Neighbours)</hi> this is your great concern this day; I dare not any longer delay Calling You thus together, that we might once more unite in Humbling our ſelves before GOD, and ſeeking his face and favour, as not knowing what a Day or a <hi>Night may bring forth:</hi> We are told <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3.10.</note>

            <p>I Have wanted very much to write to, and hear from you, ever ſince the firſt <hi>Earthquakes</hi> but I think, have ſcarce had time to write. The <hi>Earthquakes</hi> as far as I can hear, were much more terrible hereabouts than with you; I think there has not the ſpace of 24 Hours paſt, ſince the <hi>Firſt,</hi> but we have heard them.</p>
            <p>As to the Damage done by them, I ſuppoſe you may have had a better Account than I can give, they ſay it has broke the Ground in many places in <hi>Newbury;</hi> in our <hi>Town</hi> I think no ſuch thing has been obſerv'd, but only ſhaking down Tops of Chimneys, ſhattering ſome Brick Houſes, and ſhaking others ſo as to throw Pewter off the Shelves, make Andirons jump off the Hearth, throw down Stone Wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In our Houſe it ſtop'd our Clock juſt half an Hour paſt 10. P. M.</p>
            <p>We were in Bed, and I han't time to tell you how much we were ſurpriz'd, and indeed almoſt all the good People, as well as bad in the <hi>Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſomething of the deep &amp; (I hope) <hi>good</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions it has made on us, I think my ſelf concern'd in honour to our SAVIOUR to relate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002861_0046_0FE679FE3819FBF8"/>The next Day <hi>Oct.</hi> 30. We kept a Publick <hi>Faſt,</hi> and had an extraordinary full Meeting, from all parts of the Town, 6 Miles diſtance, at 2 or 3 Hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I Preach'd from Iſaiah 26.21. <hi>For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh the Inhabitants of the earth for their Iniquity:</hi> We were very earneſt and enlarged in Prayer, which ſeemed to be <hi>a Token for good:</hi> The next <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> (the Earthquakes ſtill continuing) we kept another Faſt, had 2 Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings very full, with only giving notice in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> of <hi>Bradford,</hi> preach'd in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon from Iſa. 27.9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin:</hi> which I hope will be fulfill'd. I preach'd in the afternoon from Iſa. 26.9. <hi>With my Soul have I deſired thee in the night, yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek the early: for when thy Judgments are in the earth, the Inhabitants of the World will learn righteouſneſs.</hi> We were again very much aſſiſted, &amp; enlarged, and the Congregation the moſt affected that ever I ſaw. On <hi>Thurſday,</hi> we met &amp; pray'd at <hi>Bradford:</hi> from thence to Saturday Night, I was fully employ'd in diſcourſing People about their Souls — by night &amp; day. On the Lord's Day, <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. I preach'd on Hoſea 11.8, 9. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger,</hi> &amp;c. Not any further to Alarm, but <hi>melt</hi> our Hearts into Repentance: The ſame Day, ſome Perſons that ſtood Propounded to own the Covenant, were now forthwith admitted to <hi>full Communion,</hi> and above 30 Perſons more were propounded.</p>
            <p>And all the Week before &amp; after <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> I was ſtill full of Company, <hi>rain</hi> or <hi>ſhine;</hi> ſome Days
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002861_0047_0FE679FE5F7FBC68"/>
from Morning till 8 a Clock at Night, without ſo much as time to take any bodily refreſhment. (I had but a few Hours intermiſſion for making my <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> Sermon, from Pſal. 65.1 <hi>Praiſe waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee ſhall the vow be performed.</hi>) The next Sabbath <hi>Nov.</hi> 12. we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded 84 Perſons; and again Yeſterday <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. (for my hands were full the 3d week) 39. and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſtill coming to me. So that now, ſince the <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> I have admitted and propounded 154 Perſons; 87 for the Lords Table, the reſt for Baptiſm, or the Renewing their Baptiſmal Covenant: The number of Men &amp; Women pretty near equal; moſtly younger People, from 15 to 30, ſome upwards. And they that own the Covenant the bigger part unmarried Perſons.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe a great many that have not knowledge enough to make any Profeſſion, yet now gladly come to enquire, <hi>What they ſhall do to be ſaved?</hi> And I never ſaw better Symptoms of <hi>Converſion,</hi>— Perſons ſo deeply affected, and ſeemingly humbl'd for their Sins; and tho' many of them were thoughtful, &amp; I truſt ſomething experienc'd in Piety before, yet I can't but think, ſome have been immediately converted in this Time of the EARTHQUAKES. Some that were the worſt of <hi>Drunkards, Swearers,</hi> often blaſpheming GOD, and others the moſt looſe Livers, are bro't to their Knees, humbled to the duſt, melted into tears, and ſeemingly the profoundeſt reſolutions for a new Life. There ſeems to be in the Town, a <hi>General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> Profaneſs reſtrain'd, Family Worſhip ſet up even in the moſt unlikely Houſes, the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip attended with earneſtneſs; Young Men's Meetings multiply, and increaſe, Family meetings ſet up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Chriſtians generally awakn'd, and ſeem to have quite another view of this &amp; the other World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002861_0048_0FE67A003610A320"/>It has look'd in ſhort, as if we were going into a <hi>New World;</hi> which things have occaſion'd in me various thoughts — and been as ſurprizing as the <hi>Earthquakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I've juſt now on this occaſion been looking over the additions made to our Church heretofore; and I find of 109 Perſons that have owned the Covenant, ſince my Miniſtry, 54 of them have done it ſince laſt <hi>May</hi> was twelve-month, and above 20 Young Perſons unmarried, in the Summer paſt. And of 130 Perſons admitted to the Lords Table from 1719. till theſe Earthquakes, 30 of them have been admitted within a Year paſt, which is 3 times ſo many as in any one Year before, except the firſt Year of my Miniſtry, in which I admitted 32. So that we have for ſome time paſt been growing &amp; ripening for this <hi>Harveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not make any reflections to you, on theſe things, I want very much to hear what effects the awful viſitation has had near, and about you, and what are the thoughts of the moſt Judicious about the <hi>Signs of the Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beg of you to ſend me the beſt accounts, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this where you think proper; That they may Glorify GOD for our profeſſed Subjection to the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by their Prayers for ſuch a miſerable, ſinful People, as in general we have been.</p>
            <p>The Account I have given is in a degree (propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably) true, as far as I can learn, of the Towns hereabouts, conſidering how much leſs reaſon they have had, to be Humbled and Reformed than We.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Exeter</hi> I heard a Week ago, there had been 40 Perſons Baptis'd ſince the EARTHQUAKE: At <hi>Almſbury</hi> (as one inform'd me,) they ſeem'd as if they were willing to ſpend their whole time in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002861_0049_0FE67A005C805B30"/>
of GOD. Tho' too remarkably backward and ſlothful in duty before.</p>
            <p>But I have been ſo buſy at home, I've heard but very little from abroad; But after all, among <hi>Us,</hi> the Impreſſion is not ſo General, but there are ſome, alas too many, remaining to appearance juſt where they were, in their former ſecurity, a Generation in their declining age, <hi>ſettled on their Lees,</hi> (a proof of the Sovereign Grace of GOD in effecting theſe things among us,) <hi>The Lord have Mercy on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Begging your Prayers, the Impreſſions &amp; Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made on ſo many, may Iſſue in a <hi>Repentance unto Salvation not to be repented of,</hi> and that we may be Prepared for all future events of <hi>Providence,</hi> yea, and for the <hi>Coming of the Day of GOD:</hi>
