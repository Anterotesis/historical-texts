         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SEVERAL ARGUMENTS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IF Inoculating the Small Pox be not contained in the Laws of Phyſick, then it is not lawful.</hi> But, <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating the Small Pox is not contained in the Laws of Phyſick.</hi> Therefore, <hi>It is unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall in the firſt Place prove, that it is not contained in Natural Phyſick. 2<hi>dly,</hi> I ſhall conſider it with reſpect to Divinity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With Reſpect to Natural Phyſick.</p>
            <p>Arg. 1. <hi>If Inoculating the Small Pox be not contained in the Rules of Natural Phyſick, then it is not lawful.</hi> But, <hi>Inoculating the Small Pox is not contained in the Rules of Natural Phyſick.</hi> Therefore, <hi>It is unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall prove it thus: The Rules of Natural Phyſick are <hi>Two,</hi> and no more; which are <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy;</hi> and whatſoever is not reducible unto one of theſe, is not contained in the Rules of Natural Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
            <p>Now Inoculating the Small Pox is not a <hi>Sympathy</hi> with, nor <hi>Antipathy</hi> unto a Wound or Diſeaſe already received, but a making a Wound, in order to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a Diſeaſe, which is an Abuſe unto that Text, Math. 9. 12. <hi>They that are whole need not a Phyſician<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they that are ſick,</hi> and a horrid Violation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that our Lord ſaid it for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall now proceed to prove the ſecond Part of the Argument, That Inoculating the Small Pox is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law of Phyſick, as it is conſider'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:039757_0004_1015C14C2D651BE8"/>
In Deut. 39. 15. we have theſe Words, <hi>I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal.</hi> And now in what Senſe are Actions ſaid to be God's. Actions are either to be conſider'd good or evil. As they are to be conſider'd good, God doth will them, and by his Power effect them. As they are conſider'd evil, he permits them to be, as he did Satan to ſmite <hi>Job</hi> with Boils.</p>
            <p>We ſhall conſider in what Reſpect Actions are ſaid to be good, as they are our Actions. They are ſo when they are God-like, which was the State that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man in, which was in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs. Our Actions muſt be in Knowledge of the Will of God, or they cannot be good Actions; and Knowledge of his Will is taught by the Will of God: <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony.</hi> Joh. 5. 39. <hi>They are they that teſtify of me</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> that declare my Will.)</p>
            <p>Arg. 2 <hi>If there is no Rule in the Word of God to found Inoculation upon, then it is not according to his Will nor can it be according to Knowledge.</hi> But, <hi>There is no Rule in the Word of God to found Inoculation upon.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Inoculation cannot be according to the Will of God, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we read in Deut. 27. 19. <hi>Curſed is he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the Judgment</hi> (or Right) <hi>of the Stranger, Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Widow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arg. 3 <hi>If Inoculation has a natural Tendency to the perverting the Right of the Stranger, Fatherleſs and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, then it is an unrighteous Action.</hi> But, <hi>Inoculation has a natural Tendency to the perverting the Right of the Fatherleſs and Widow.</hi> Therefore, <hi>It is an unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4 <hi>If Inoculation be a doing Violence unto the Law of Nature, and the Pattern that God hath ſet us, then it is unholy.</hi> But, <hi>Inoculation is a doing Violence unto the Law of Nature, and the Pattern which God hath ſet us, (which we are to imitate.)</hi> Therefore, <hi>Inoculation is unholy.</hi> Zeph. 3. 5. <hi>The juſt Lord is in the midſt of thee, be will do no Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that Inoculation is unrighteous and unholy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall demonſtrate thus: Every Man has a natural Right to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039757_0005_1015C14DC24B8A28"/>
ſome things in common with all Men, as being of one Blood, made and preſeved by one God, coming from one Root, even <hi>Adam;</hi> a Right in common to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Sun, Moon and Stars, a ſerene and clear Air; yea, to the cloudy Weather and Rain, to the Summer and Winter; and (we us'd to ſay,) to Six Foot of Land, and to his own Houſe; for Man was not made to be by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor for himſelf, but to be in a ſocial Relation one to another, and ſo ſerve God in this Relation. 'Tis a common Saying, <hi>A Man may do with his own as he pleaſes;</hi> but 'tis as falſe as 'tis common; he may not burn his own Houſe if it hazards the Conſuming his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's; neither by this Rule may they do what is right in their own Eyes in their own Houſe: Jam. 2. 12, 13. <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the perfect Law of Liberty; for he ſhall have Judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy, that hath ſhewed no Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to have the Small Pox brought to a Man by a voluntary Act of his Neighbour, by which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he does not indeavour to preſerve the health and life of his Neighbour, but eventually to bereave him of both doth Violence unto the Law of Nature, and the Pattern which God hath ſet us, which we ought to walk by. <hi>Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Pſal. 89. 74. <hi>Justice and Judgment are the Habitation of thy Throne, Mercy and Truth ſhall go before thy Face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we ſay, by Inoculation, the Small Pox hath been carried and ſpread almoſt if not quite over this Town; and our Neighbours have not done as they would have others do to them. 'Tis evident they would not have it brought to them, or elſe why do they fly unto Inoculation. Now to have it brought to them by a voluntary Motion of their Neighbour, is more hard to be born by their injured Neighbour, than if it came to them in or by the common way; (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God caſting it where and when he will) which hath made great Heats, Diviſions and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
            <p>They are guilty of the Breach of the Moral and the Evangelical Law of God; for they have not done by
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039757_0006_1015C1507577CA38"/>
their Neighbour as they would that their Neighbour ſhould do to them, and that in a Caſe of great Moment; not only to the hazard of Life, but the Loſs of many a Life; how many God knows. Math. 7. 12. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we are commanded to love our Neighbour as our ſelves, then they that voluntarily bring in the Small Pox into their Houſes, and not only endanger their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Health and Life, but eventually take both away, do <hi>tranſgreſs the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Matt. 22, 35, 36, 27, 38, 39, 40. And, Oh! What a Fountain of Blood are the Promoters guilty of! God grant them repentance unto life. May it not be ſaid of you, <hi>You lay aſide the Commandments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, and ye have learned the Traditions of Men.</hi> Mark. 7. 9. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Fulwell ye reject the Commandment of God, that ye may keep your own Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Caſe may be ſo circumſtanced, that may make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral. I ſhall demonſtrate it to you thus: A Man in the Country, living far from Neighbours, may have a great Stump of a Tree in his Land, which he may deſire to have out of the Way, and he may put Fire unto it, and burn it down, and do no Body any harm; And I ſee no reaſon the Authority has to call him to an Account for it; but ſhould he for the ſame Reaſon do the ſame thing for kind in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and not only endanger his Neighbours Houſes but eventually conſume them, Will not this be looked upon Immoral, and ought not the Authority to call him to an Account for it? And what faith the Law of God? Exod. 21. <hi>Life for Life, and Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, and Burning for Burning; Wound for Wound, Stripe for Stripe.</hi> And ſeeing this way of Inoculation cannot be carried on without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the Life and Health of People, how does it become our noble Towns-Men to take Care in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if there was no other reaſon to be given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether, the Small Pox be not one of the ſtrange works of God; and whether Inoculation of it be not a fighting with the moſt High, and a vying with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039757_0007_1015C152D4619720"/>
the holy One of Iſrael? <hi>He hath ſpoken, and it ſtandeth faſt, he is of one mind, and who can turn him?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inoculation hath not a ſimilitude unto, and an Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with <hi>Phaorah's</hi> Magicians who did Wonders with their Rods, even to hardning of their Hearts, that God might bring greater Judgments upon them till he had conſumed them, and not a mitigating of his ſtroke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Whether the Small Pox be not a Puniſhment from a righteous God, upon a People for their Sins? And hath it not a crying voice to them, ſaying, <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do good?</hi> And whether the labouring to avert the Stroke in the way of Inoculation, doth anſwer this crying Voice; or whether it be not to provoke him more and more?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Whether Inoculation be not an intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Incommunicable Attributes of God, and alſo upon his Works, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. 1. <hi>He hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. Whether the great mortality that hath been among us in theſe two laſt Months, hath flow'd from this Inoculation? I anſwer, I do believe it hath, &amp; that for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe in the hot Weather, even in the Dog days there was few died, when Inoculation was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in uſe; but ſince Inoculation hath been much in uſe the Weather hath been more temperate, neither hot nor cold, (which I know is beſt for that Diſtemper) yet the mortality hath much increaſed, ſo that there hath been no compariſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. From the different nature of its working it muſt needs have a different malignity: The ſmall Pox when it comes in the good old way, is ripened by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual motion; and ſo when its nature is ſpent, dries away gradually; As it grows gradually, it dies gradually; and if it breaks, it is as it were but a dead Wound: But the wound or inciſion is a living wound, and therefore the matter or putrifaction which comes out of this wound, muſt be more quick and penetrating than the other. Now the Reaſon they render, why there is leſs Puſtules, and leſs Sickneſs, is, becauſe the malignity or venom
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039757_0008_1015C154648FF858"/>
which is in the Blood, is diſcharged by this running Wound. (though they are not always true Prophets; for I have ſeen ſeveral in their Way, that have had as many Puſtules, and as much Sickneſs, and as many bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Kidneys to check the Fever, as in the good old Way; &amp; many in the old way who had as few Puſtules as any of them, even had not their Cloaths off one Hour, ſome at play and others at work.)</p>
            <p>Again, there is living Teſtimony that do ſay, the ſmell of this living Wound upon ſome Perſons, is worſe than ever they ſmelled it elſewhere, and I cannot but believe it; for Reaſon tells me, that it's more raw and contrary unto Nature, and Penetrating on the Organs of the Body of Man, than the other matter, which is dead as it were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Is drawn from the fatal event that Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath had on thoſe that have took the Small Pox of them: Where are they? how few are there of thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that we have reaſon to think took the Infection of them?</p>
            <p>Now to ſave Life, by giving Death for it, it is but a ſwapping, and very dear, though the purchaſer may think he hath a good bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. Why there is ſuch mortality of late, is, as I humbly conceive, from Inoculation. I have proved that Inoculation is not contained in the law of Phyſick, whether we conſider it natural or Divine; and to allude unto <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 31. <hi>Ye have done the thing which I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you not, neither did it enter into my heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. Becauſe this Inoculation is amongſt or by a People that are called by God's Name; to allude unto <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known amongst all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I puniſh you for all your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 6. Becauſe God is a Jealous God; Deut. 32, 22 <hi>They have provoked me to Anger with their Vanities, and I will move them to Jealouſy.</hi> That is, as we walk contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, ſo God walks contrary to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In that this People is oppreſſed and broken in Judgment, and Gods Judgments are as the light that goeth forth;</hi> the

            <p>I ſhall conclude with Amos 5. 14. 15. <hi>Seek good and not evil, that ye may live; and ſo the Lord, the God of Hoſts, ſhall be with you as he hath ſpoken.</hi>

               <p>THE Practice of <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> is not a Rule either of Faith or Manners, and therefore I ſhall diſmiſs that Parapraph, and paſs on to your next.</p>
               <p>II. You ſay, <hi>We bear that ſeveral Phyſicians have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended Inoculation to his Majesty, as a Means to ſave the Lives of his Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Queſtion is not, Whether it may ſave their Lives or not, but rather, as you affirm, whether it may be lawful; which you muſt prove, or you do not what you have undertaken to do. The matter was not diſputed by the Phariſees, whether their Children did caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> the Reflection that our Lord caſt upon them was, that they did it <hi>unlawfully. The King and the Prince have accepted of it as a Means to ſave the Lives of the Subject:</hi> But yet I remember, they have not proved what you have undertaken to do, to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039757_0010_1015C15A6D68DCD8"/>
prove it lawful; neither was the Queſtion propos'd to them.</p>
               <p>Again, You ſay, <hi>If wiſe and learned Men from</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, <hi>declare their Approbation of this Practice; for us to declare our Diſapprobation, will not be for our Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> All that I ſhall ſay at preſent is, If wiſe and learned Men from <hi>England</hi> ſhould declare their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of worſhiping God in the Epiſcopal Way, with all the Ceremonies thereof, (which is a matter of Faith as well as this) for us to declare our Diſapprobation will not be for our Honour. I chuſe at preſent to ſet Honour againſt Honour, that being view'd a while, and brought home, they may ſee each others Similitude.</p>
               <p>III. You ſay, <hi>God hath graciouſly owned it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scores have lived and recovered, and not one died, except Mrs. D—l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhe had the Small Pox in the common Way before,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I believe you cannot know that; for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band told me ſhe was inoculated, and that it came forth at the Time appointed: Now you may take Notice, that Mr. <hi>D—l</hi> and I had ſome Talk before. Mr. <hi>D—l</hi> had ſaid to me, that he thought it a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the Diſcovery of this Inoculation. I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, I believe rather that it is a terrible Deluſion. I ſaid, You know my Mind, and I know yours; now is not a time for us to talk of it: I will ſee her and you, as Mrs. <hi>D—l</hi> and Mr. <hi>D—l,</hi> and not as People that love Inoculation; and he ſaid, So do. Accordingly I went. At firſt the Pock looked likely; but it grew on to be very bad, and ſhe was brought exceeding low, but afterwards there was hope of her recovery, and ſhe was taken out of Bed once or twice, I cannot tell which. In the mean time two of her Children had it unknown to her a little before, ſo lightly viſited, that I think one was not abed one hour; and I heard ſay in the Houſe, they kept the other abed becauſe he ſhould not run in to diſturb his mother: And the Children being brought in to her, ſhe received them with ſurpriſing Joy, and ſoon fell into a Fit. We know ſhe was a thoughtful Woman, and the neighbours ſaid, ſhe could not bear the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039757_0011_1015C15FB97797F8"/>
how lightly they had it in the common Way, and how bad ſhe was in the new way. Had it not been a time of great trouble with Mr. <hi>D—l,</hi> I ſhould have had more diſcourſe with him about it, but had not. I ſympathiſed with him, and do believe that his loſs is her gain. This is a true relation of that matter.</p>
               <p>But I paſs on to conſider ſome of your other Reaſons. You ſay, <hi>That the known Children of the Wicked one are generally against Inoculation, which is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>Your Argument is, <hi>A moſt ſucceſsful and allowable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preventing Death, and many other grievous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, by the Small Pox, is not only lawful but a Duty, to be uſed by thoſe who apprehend their Lives indangered by the terrible Diſtemper.</hi> But, <hi>The managing and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Small Pox, in the way of Inoculation, is a moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful and allowable Method of preventing Death, and many other grievous Miſeries by this dreadful Diſtêmper.</hi> Therefore, <hi>it is not only lawful, but alſo a Duty to make uſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, You tell me, None but very fooliſh and very wicked People will deny the Propoſition. How can you tell that? Are you only capable to tell a Man what he muſt not do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he doth that which you think not good, muſt you enter into Judgment, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him <hi>very fooliſh and very wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, Whatever you think of your Propoſition, I think it a poor and a beggarly thing, to take that for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which is denyed, to put into your Propoſition.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt tell you, that the Word <hi>Allowable</hi> is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, and ſhall diſtinguiſh and enquire what you mean by it: If you mean <hi>humane Authority,</hi> I ſhall take no Notice of it. <hi>To the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> law and to the Testimony, and if they ſpeak not according unto that, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> But if you mean an allowable Way by the Law of Phyſick, then I deny your <hi>Propoſition.</hi> And now let us ſee who is the Fool. Your Propoſition is, <hi>That it is a most ſucceſsful and allowable Method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Death.</hi> Now we fear there are many in the Grave the More for it; therefore we cannot believe that it is a ſucceſsful Way of preventing Death.</p>
               <p>And now I deny the Conſequence of your Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and ſay, that cannot be accounted a ſafe way, which hath an evil Tendency, and a bad end, (eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Death) of more than it hath ſaved alive; not to be allowed, except God ſays Amen to it. You go on to ſay, <hi>The Testimonies that our People have been frighted with, are not worth a Straw; no Man of Senſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers them, can lay weight upon them.</hi> Anſwer: If you are a man of ſenſe, if you conſider my Argumnets, they will bring you upon the Care<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

I could tell you of many more ſuch Things, with reſpect to the Event, which are good to a Perſon or People; but that does not prove it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which you ſhould have done, if you underſtand your Argument.</p>
               <p>I will load <hi>Succeſs</hi> a little further, it may be you may think too far. It was good that Satan ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of his Habitation which he had taken up in Men in our Lord's Day; but it was not lawful that the Children of the Phariſees ſhould caſt them out by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the help of <hi>Beelzebub:</hi> We muſt always have an Eye to the Matter of what we do as well as to the Reſult, if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

to keep a good Conſcience towards God.</p>
               <p>From the Means and End of effecting the Action, it is well or ill diſpoſed. 'Tis a Duty to go to hear God's Word preached, but 'tis unlawful to ſteal a Horſe to ride to hear it. 'Tis lawful to preſerve Life, but it muſt be in a lawful way. All Circumſtances muſt concur to make the Action good: The failing but in one Circumſtance doth make the Action evil. See <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>

               <p>Now it appears to me to be but a Deluſion of Satan, covered over with more Cloaks than the Doctor's; under which he carries not only the poiſonous Venom of the Small Pox, but alſo perverſe Diſputings of Men, every evil Work, as Strife, Hatred, Back-biting and Lying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is no Wonder, if we conſider who was the firſt Inoculator, <hi>Tim.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3, 4, 5, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>

Again, you ſay, <hi>Suppoſe here was a mortal Sickneſs in the Town, as the Bloody-Flux, and a Phyſician is Maſter of a Purge, which whoſoever takes, is in an ordinary Way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delivered from the Danger of that Diſtemper. An Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Purge ſaves him from Death by the Natural Purge which he is expoſed unto. Will any ſcruple the taking of this</hi> Artificial Purge, <hi>Surely none but ſuch as want a Purge of</hi> Hellebore!</p>
               <p>What aileth thee, O man, that underſtands not your own Argument. I muſt tell you, had you taken a Purge of Hellebore to have cleared your Brain, your Argument might have been better drawn with reſpect to the Figure and mode.</p>
               <p>Your Argument is drawn from an Artificial Purge to ſtop a Natural Purge, which no body denys; but this is foreign to the Caſe in Hand.</p>
               <p>But you ſhould have ſaid, (if you had ſpoke to the purpoſe,) ſuppoſe the bloody Flux prevail in the Town where I live, and a Phyſician goes to one of their houſes, and takes a Bottle of that fluxical bloody Excrement, &amp; put it into a Man, (by a Clyſter Pipe or any way elſe,) and gives him he Bloody-Flux, which whoſoever takes, is delivered in an ordinary Way from the danger of that Diſtemper. And now, if you pleaſe to take a Pinch of Hellebore, to clear up your Senſes, you may draw this natural Concluſion, which is, Sir, That your Argument do Stink.</p>
               <p>I am not miſtaken, as will appear, if you go back to the beginning of the Paragraph that he is now upon, which runs thus, <hi>That this is an allowable Practice is plain,</hi> (faith our Antagoniſt) <hi>becauſe their can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections brought againſt it but what will lie againſt all the preventing Phyſick that is uſed in the World.</hi> Now it was Inoculating of the ſmall Pox our Author was talking of, and not the preventing of the Small Pox, which if it had, his Argument had been more even in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>many good People being ſenſible how weak their own Judgments are, will be much adviſed in a Caſe of Conſcience, by the Judgment of the moſt able Divines in the Country.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Sir, we are deterred from that for ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. We know that the ableſt Miniſters in the Country are but men, and are failable as well as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 2. They bring not their Arguments from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but from the Hiſtory of Places where it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and plead the lawfulneſs of it from the event, which we believe is no ſafe way for Chriſtians to argue; and if it ſhould be allowed of, I could give inſtances enough to fill your ears, Hoſ. 7. 11. <hi>Ephraim is like a ſilly dove without heart; they call to Egypt, they go to Aſſyria</hi> (to help them to Arguments.) 3. Becauſe God's Judgments was threatned againſt Iſrael for learning of the manners of the Heathen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>(which I cast forth before you.)</hi> 4. Becauſe the Miniſters are very generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the good old way, and have ſet up a way that their Fathers knew not of, neither entered it into their Hearts; to allude unto Jer. 5. 23. <hi>They are revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and gone.</hi> 5. It's very natural for men not to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their own weakneſs of judgment; from hence it is (as I ſuppoſe) men have ſo great an Opinion of their own Works, although there is no Beauty nor comelineſs in them: from hence ariſes a deſire to impoſe. And others think they know as much about Inoculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they deſire, and they think the Scripture is ſilent, in this matter, the rather, becauſe that is the Key which you muſt unlock Caſes of Conſcience by.</p>
               <p>Again, They ſay you have no Scripture for it, for if you had, you would have told us ſo, and directed us where to find it; but you have not done either, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have none:</p>
               <p>Therefore they could expect no advice from you; for you have no Arguments but ſuch as you fetch out of Hiſtory, and we deſire to learn none of their manners.</p>
               <p>They daily ſee what Work Men make when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with any thing they do not underſtand, or was not prentice to. Suppoſe a Taylor ſhould go into a Cobler's Shop to work; his Tools are not fit, neither hath he skill to uſe the Coblers tools, and ſo he makes but cobling work; and then his ware lies upon hand, and he derided and ſcoffed at, and that for his work;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039757_0017_1015C16FB85D8CD8"/>
when it is poſſible the man is proper and comely, and of a good genius, when imployed in what he underſtands. Hence it was that the Serene States of <hi>Holland</hi> made a Law to prevent Miniſters medling with State Affairs, becauſe their Work was not Temporal but Divine, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing of them not ſafe for the common wealth. The Law was, That if a Miniſter intermeddled to dictate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about State affairs, the Government was to provide him a pair of new Shoes and a Staff, and lead him to the outſide of the Town, and let him return to his pulpit no more. So for Miniſters to be able to anſwer this natural queſtion, we think is too hard for them; for we think that every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon, or to that which it is adapted to. Now Miniſters work is divine, and for that they are paid for, and for any thing elſe they are not thanked for, nor indeed (ſay ſome) are not for any thing elſe thank worthy.</p>
               <p>In the next Place, I ſhall take no notice of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which will be victorious you ſay, (but I think it is againſt your ſelf) <hi>That when People have their lives indangered by the Small Pox hovering about them, they may not only uſe the method of Inoculation to ſave their lives, but they even ought to do it, if they can: they keep not in good Terms with the ſixth Commandment if they do it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is the firſt time that I need anſwer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of an Argument; for having anſwered the major or minor, the Concluſion ſubmits quietly unto the Fate of the former. But Sir, here ſeems to want more Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Learning, or more honeſty, I cannot divine which. You brought in theſe words into your Concluſion which was not in your Major nor Minor, <hi>They keep not in good Terms with the ſixth Commandment if they do it not.</hi> Sir, I tell you your Argument is lame; its feet are not equal, and pray take it home again, and inoculate or graft on three pieces more to your ſophiſtical Argument, or elſe it will not be able to ſtand, and muſt fall to the Ground unavoidably. Here is ſuch ſophiſtry that none but my Antagoniſt is able to anſwer for. <hi>As we would keep in good Terms with the ſixth Commandment:</hi> He dare not ſay

                     </gap> Good Terms!</hi> Faith in what is commanded, and a Principle of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereto is it he means? This we may do without holding the Doctrine of Inoculation. Or does he mean, that except we believe the Doctrine or Inoculation to ſave our Lives, we break the Sixth Commandment? Surely he means ſomething or other: It may be he would make it a Bug-Bear to fright us into it; which ſeems moſt likely to me: For if you look upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument again, from Head to Foot, you will find it is ſo lame, it can neither go nor ſtand, it hath two Tails; it is ſo over-charged, that its Belly is monſtrous big; and his Head is ſo ſmall, for want of ſome of that which is in his two Tails, that it looks no ways hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; neither hath it Hands ſtrong enough for War.</p>
               <p>Sir, You having taken Liberty to put more into the Concluſion than was in the Premiſes, (which is very diſhonourable if not diſhoneſt) you infer ſeveral Things, which are ſo mean, that I ſhall anſwer but part of them.</p>
               <p>Inf. <hi>That when ſome deſire to ſave their Lives by Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, thoſe who have the Care over them, ſhould not hinder them, lest they ſhould have Cauſe to repent of it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I do not like this Word <hi>Leſt.</hi> I have ſeen it ſomewhere elſe before now. I take it to be in Gen. 3. 3. <hi>Leſt ye dy.</hi> I ſuppoſe our Antagoniſt learned it there.

               <p>Sir, I ſhall anſwer you by a Similitude, and yon may judge. I have known Children that have had the King's Evil, and have deſired their Governours to let them go and be touched by the King, who lays his Hand upon them and ſays, I touch, and God heals: Whether or no if Parents or Governours are ſatisfy'd that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or that there is no Phyſical Means in it, they ought not to deter them from it, leſt the Diſeaſe may not go off, and they have ſad Cauſe of Reflection. The like

Cure the Seventh Son performs, which you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p>Inf. III. <hi>That a People ſhould not be too hasty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves that would forbid their Neighbours to do what God has made their</hi> Duty, <hi>for the Preſervation of their Lives</hi> in this Method, <hi>lest they do in Effect</hi> forbid Obedience to the Sixth Commandment.</p>
               <p>Now I hope the Reader may ſee what our Gentleman aim'd at, when he put forth his Hand, as the Effect of a covetous Mind, and ſtole theſe Words into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which were not in the Major, to wit, they keep not in good Terms with the Sixth Commandment if they do it not. And now I ſuppoſe, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment he infers, that God hath made Inoculation a Duty. The Syphiſtry of this lies here: His Argument ſhould have run thus:</p>
               <p>What God hath made a Duty, and a moſt ſucceſsful and allowable Method of preventing Miſeries by the Small Pox, ought to be practis'd. <hi>But,</hi> God hath made it a Duty. <hi>Therefore,</hi> it ought to be practiſed.</p>
               <p>Now, had he put into his Major propoſition, <hi>What God hath made a Duty,</hi> we might have come at his Minor Propoſition, which muſt have run thus, <hi>But God hath made it a moſt ſucceſsful and allowable way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Death by the Small Pox.</hi> Then his Concluſion might hove run thus, <hi>Therefore it ought to be practiſed.</hi> And we might have come at his Minor by denying it; and till he had proved it, his Concluſion would have ſtood tottering, but if he had proved his Minor, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion would ſtand good: But how he would have proved it, I cannot tell, except he made a Trip to <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to many wiſe and learned Men.</p>
               <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>To call this</hi> a Work of the Devil, &amp;c. <hi>is a ſhocking Blaſphemy.</hi> Pray who told you ſo? They ſay it is of God or the Devil; but 'tis not of God, becauſe it is not contained in the Law of Phyſick, either Natural or Divine. What ſhall we do but draw the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Concluſion, ſeeing there is no <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> nor Middle, between the greateſt Good, and the greateſt Evil one. Jer. 5. 30, 31. <hi>A wonderful and horrible thing is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039757_0020_1015C179C2428D60"/>
commited in the Land. The Prophets prophecy falſly, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it ſo? And what will ye do in the end thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, Had the Diſcourſe been Verbal, and Moderators choſen, you muſt not have dared to intrude upon the Rules of Diſputation: If you had dared to have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your Caſe to the Cenſure of the People, I ſhould have indeavoured to have made you aſhamed; but I ſuppoſe you chuſe rather to ſtand by your ſelf, and keep your own Maxim, <hi>Ask not why I ſay ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have obſerved Hints from the Pulpit of new Means diſcover'd, and that we ſhould be thankful to God for his gracious Providence in diſcovering it to us. But I think it is denyed to be Means that is lawful, and till it is proved lawful, it is but begging the Queſtion, to tell me I ſhould be thankful for it: But I will tell you what came into my Mind, More Grammar, leſs So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, ſome Scripture Proof, leſs Deluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether it is not our Duty to pray, that God would bleſs the Means of Inoculation, to thoſe that are under its Operation: Phil. 4. 6. <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by Prayer and Supplication, let your Requeſts be made known unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This word <hi>Every Thing</hi> muſt be reſtrained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Things which God hath made our Duty, and ſo far as we are found in our Duty. Now for Perſons to undertake any thing without Satisfaction from God's Word, looks like <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> agreeing with <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to go up to Ramoth Gilead before they had enquired of the Lord, May we not think they were left of God to follow their own Imaginations, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.</p>
