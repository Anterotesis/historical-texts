            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Negro Chriſtianized.</head>
            <p>IT is a <hi>Golden Sentence,</hi> that has been ſometimes quoted from <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> That <hi>for a man to know the Art of Alms, is more than for a man to be Crowned with the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of Kings: But to Convert one Soul unto God, is more than to pour cut Ten Thouſand Talents into the Baskets of the Poor.</hi> Truly, to Raiſe a <hi>Soul,</hi> from a dark State of Ignorance and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the Knowledge of GOD, and the Belief of CHRIST, and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Holy and Lovely RELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GION; 'Tis the nobleſt Work, that ever was undertaken among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men. An Opportunity to Endeavour the CONVERSION of a Soul, from a Life of <hi>Sin,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a woful <hi>Death,</hi> to Fear God, and Love CHRIST, and by a Religious Life to Eſcape the <hi>Paths of the Deſtroyer;</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:001262_0003_0FB134FCE978E1E0"/>
it cannot but be Accptable to all that have themſelves had in themſelves Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſuch a <hi>Converſion.</hi> And ſuch an Opportunity there is in your Hands, O all you that have any <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> in your Houſes; an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to try, Whether you may not be the Happy <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> of Converting, the <hi>Blackeſt</hi> Inſtances of <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Baſeneſs,</hi> into admirable <hi>Candidates</hi> of Eternal Bleſſedneſs. Let not this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity be Loſt; if you have any concern for <hi>Souls,</hi> your Own or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but, make a Trial, Whether by your Means, the moſt <hi>Bruitiſh</hi> of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon Earth may not come to be diſpoſed, in ſome Degree, like the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> of Heaven; and the <hi>Vaſſals</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, become the <hi>Children</hi> of God. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Wretched <hi>Negroes,</hi> to be the Offspring of <hi>Cham</hi> (which yet is not ſo very certain,) yet let us make a Trial, Whether the CHRIST who <hi>dwelt in the Tents of Shem,</hi> have not ſome of His Choſen among them; Let us make a Trial, Whether they that have been Scorched and Blacken'd by the Sun of <hi>Africa,</hi> may not come to have

their Minds Healed by the more Benign <hi>Beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is come to paſs by the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, without which there comes nothing to paſs, that Poor <hi>Negroes</hi> are caſt under your Government and Protection. You take them into your <hi>Families;</hi> you look on them as part of your <hi>Poſſeſſions;</hi> and you Expect from their Service, a Support, and perhaps an Increaſe, of your other <hi>Poſſeſſions.</hi> How agreeable would it be, if a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Maſter or Miſtreſs thus atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, would now think with themſelves! <hi>Who can tell but that this Poor Creature may belong to the Election of God! Who can tell, but that God may have ſent this Poor Creature into my Hands, that ſo One of the Elect may by my means be Called; &amp; by my Inſtruction be made Wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! The glorious God will put an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Glory upon me, if it may be ſo!</hi> The Conſiderations that would move you, To Teach your <hi>Negroes</hi> the <hi>Truths</hi> of the Glorious Goſpel, as far as you can, and bring them, if it may be, to Live according to thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> a <hi>Sober,</hi> and a <hi>Righteous,</hi> and a <hi>Godly</hi> Life: They
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001262_0005_0FB1350025476560"/>
are <hi>Innumerable;</hi> And, if you would after a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> manner conſider, the Pleas which we have to make on the behalf of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>Souls</hi> which He has made, one would wonder that they ſhould not be <hi>Irreſiſtible. Show your ſelves Men,</hi> and let <hi>Rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> have their Force upon you, to make you treat, not as <hi>Bruits</hi> but as <hi>Men,</hi> thoſe <hi>Rational Creatures</hi> whom God has made your <hi>Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>Firſt; The Great GOD <hi>Commands</hi> it, and <hi>Requires</hi> it of you; to do what you can that <hi>Your Servants,</hi> may alſo be <hi>His.</hi> It was an Admonition once given; Eph. 5.9. <hi>Maſters, Know that your Maſter is in Heaven.</hi> You will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, That the God of Heaven is your <hi>Maſter.</hi> If your <hi>Negroes</hi> do not comply with your <hi>Commands,</hi> into what Anger, what Language, Perhaps into a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming <hi>Fury,</hi> are you tranſported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But you are now to attend unto the <hi>Commands</hi> of your more Abſolute <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and they are His <hi>Commands</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your <hi>Negroes</hi> too.

You deny your <hi>Maſter in Heaven,</hi> if you do nothing to bring your <hi>Servants</hi> unto the Knowledge and Service of that glorious <hi>Maſter.</hi> One Table of the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> has this for the Sum of it; <hi>Thou ſhalt Love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf.</hi> Man, Thy <hi>Negro</hi> is thy <hi>Neighbour.</hi> T'were an Ignorance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a <hi>Man,</hi> to imagine otherwiſe.

Canſt thou <hi>Love</hi> him, and yet refuſe to do any thing, that his miſerable Soul may be reſcued from Eternal miſeries? Oh! Let thy <hi>Love</hi> to that Poor <hi>Soul,</hi> appear in thy concern, to make it, if thou canſt, as happy as thy own!

            </p>
            <p>A CATECHISM ſhall be got ready for them; firſt a <hi>Shorter,</hi> then a <hi>Larger;</hi> Suited at to their poor Capacities.</p>
            <p>They who cannot themſelves <hi>Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> ſo well attend the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of the

               <hi>Negroes,</hi> may employ and reward thoſe that ſhall do it for them. In many <hi>Families,</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> may help the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> to Learn the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or their well-inſtructed and well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Engliſh Servants</hi> may do it: And they ſhould be <hi>Rewarded</hi> by the <hi>Maſters,</hi> when they do it.</p>
            <p>In a Plantation of many <hi>Negroes,</hi> why ſhould not a <hi>Teacher</hi> be hired on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to inſtil into them the principles of the <hi>Catechiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, if the <hi>Overſeers</hi> are once <hi>Catechiſed</hi> themſelves, they may ſoon do the Office of <hi>Catechiſers</hi> unto thoſe that are under them.</p>
            <p>However, Tis fit for the <hi>Maſter</hi> alſo <hi>Perſonally</hi> to enquire into the progreſs which his <hi>Negroes</hi> make in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and not leave it <hi>Entierly</hi> to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others.</p>
            <p>There muſt be <hi>Time</hi> allow'd for the <hi>Work.</hi> And why not <hi>The Lords-Day?</hi> The precept of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is very poſitive; <hi>Remember the SABBATH-DAY, to keep it Holy. Thou ſhalt not then do any work, thou nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001262_0031_0FB135352FF9E410"/>
thy Man-Servant, nor thy Maid-Servant.</hi> By virtue of this precept, we do even demand, <hi>The Lord-Day,</hi> for the <hi>Negroes:</hi> that they may be permitted the Freedom of <hi>The Lords-Day,</hi> and not be then unneceſſarily diverted from attending on ſuch <hi>means of Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as may be afforded unto them.</p>
            <p>To quicken them unto the learning of the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> it would be very well to propoſe unto the <hi>Negroes, Agreeable Recompences,</hi> &amp; <hi>Priviledges,</hi> to be receiv'd and enjoy'd by them, when they ſhall have made a good progreſs in it. Syrs, A <hi>Mahometan</hi> will do as much as this comes to, for any one that will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Oh, Chriſtians, will not you do more for <hi>your Generation,</hi> than the <hi>Children of this World</hi> for theirs. And it is to be deſired, that the <hi>Negroes</hi> may not learn to ſay their <hi>Catechiſm</hi> only by rote, like <hi>Parrots;</hi> but that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, may put unto them ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Queſtions</hi> relating to the points of the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> that be their <hi>Anſwers,</hi> (at leaſt of YES, or NO,) it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they Know what they Say.</p>
