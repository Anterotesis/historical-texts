            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>IT is the laudible purpoſe of our inſtitution, by the moſt agreeable means, to expand our hearts for all the offices of humanity. It does not deſtroy, nor even weaken the love of private intereſt, of kindred, nations, or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031799_0004_0FEE7291B5AA01B0"/>opinions. It is intended to aſſiſt a generous energy of mind, in riſing to the higheſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of charity. It accompliſhes its end, by creating a ſociety, in which we familiarize its ſpecial duties, by a voluntary aſſociation with all parts of the family into which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſtrongeſt prejudices are ſuch only as exiſt in every kindred, which has a duty and affection, not directed by pure character, but by an eſtabliſhed, immutable, and public relation. We embrace friends through the world. He that is firſt in ſuch a family among brethren, ſhould be ſocial in his diſpoſition, open in his temper, ſafe in his habits, firm in his character, and reputable in the world. To deſerve this preference, and to receive it, muſt be the higheſt honour. From the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion or this truth, my Brethren, I riſe with cheerfulneſs, in the ſervice you have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me, in bearing your public teſtimony to this ſentiment. We are Brethren. Duties belong to each; but different duties to all. The wiſdom of the head; the ſincerity of the heart; the benevolence of the temper; the quickneſs of the ſenſes; and the organic life, in each part, form the perfection of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031799_0005_0FEE729343E29548"/>whole. But all theſe parts have not the ſame office, nor the ſame reſources. If the head be ſound, each faculty more readily finds its full employment and uſe. The head, then, is the moſt honourable. Equal as are all friendſhips, with ſociety, we begin a neceſſary ſubordination. And as this is more perfect and happy, we flouriſh and are bleſſed. The choice of the man then, and not of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is voluntary. The man may be changed, but the Maſter is perpetual. He is created by our neceſſity, and we owe him the full obedience of our Love. In the duties of his office he is the ſoul of our inſtitution; and while he lives in our reverence of him, we live alſo. To judge of that wiſdom, we may employ in the choice, we muſt be ſure of the <hi>character, object, manners, and form</hi> of Free Maſonry.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As the whole character of man is from education, under various names, ſo there are inſtitutions to aſſiſt this education. They have various objects. They aſſiſt to devellope the faculties; to inſtruct in the arts; to form manners; to promote knowledge; to preſerve
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031799_0006_0FEE7294CC2F5E98"/>the affections; or to teach religion. They ariſe from private choice, or from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Laws. They are adapted to private, or public ends. Some are deſigned to reform mankind, others to unite them. Some to find greater reſources in human nature, and ſome to keep what we have already gotten. Some to ſeparate the wiſe and good from the reſt of mankind, and ſome to promote the general good. Our own is deſigned to bring all the ſocial affections away from the cares of life; and the partialities of private friendſhip, into the ſervice of our common nature. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no man's religion. We examine no laws of any country. We ſpeak in no language: and take names from no party. We belong to every thing ſincere and ſocial in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart. We explore the imperfection of no character, which can be tolerated by the laws of any country. All men who have the heart to be ſocial, and the power to be kind, we love. The gay we do not deſpiſe. The follies which violate no laws of life and manners, we forget. We mix our pleaſures with every innocent gaiety of the ſong; and we become cheerful at the flowing bowl, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031799_0007_0FEE729A054E94E0"/>the table. We take men as we find them, diſpoſed to live in the happineſs of each other. Such is the <hi>Character</hi> of Free Maſonry.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But to guard our inſtitution from abuſe, we have a generous object always before us. We chaſe away all envy, competition, and ſtrife. We have our brethren every where in the family of mankind: we therefore deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe no cuſtoms, inſult no laws, and hate no country. To know our brethren is our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; to aſſiſt them is our glory. Our wealth, beyond our own wants, is ſacred to their uſe. To point out the path of life, and make it happy, is our ſublime wiſdom. We cannot be friends of ſociety, if we violate any of its laws. To be honourable among maſons, we muſt have honour from every ſocial obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. We have too great a ſhare in the public happineſs, to ſeparate from it. We cannot be miſerable, becauſe every man's happineſs is our own. Cheerful, we are ſure to be content; and, as far as we are able, we provide for perpetual peace. Domeſtic life has its chief joys from our friendſhip; and induſtry its greateſt guards from our love.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031799_0008_0FEE729B91168EB8"/>We know no man, but in his capacity for happineſs; and we have no duty to him, but to enlarge it. Such is the <hi>object</hi> of our inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. We are not inſenſible of the liableneſs of our inſtitution to abuſe, and we know that the abuſes of all inſtitutions have a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from the nature of them. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable are the advantages of religion! Of living in the love of God! But how many fanatics and bigots, devotees and myſtics, are recounted in the hiſtory of every religion. We furniſh none of theſe; we ſhun them. But, while the paſſions live in our world in ſad perverſion, we dare not pretend, that our brethren have not been betrayed. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to nothing above human nature. We take propenſities as we find them, and we aim to render them uſeful. We take the man in the gay hour, when his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is cheered by the congratulations of his friends; his ſpirits elevated by mirth, and the ſong; when fancy is ſportive, and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ready; and while he is exhilirated at the feaſt of joy. Theſe are ſcenes from which the gay will not be excluded. They
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031799_0009_0FEE729E5C46DC70"/>may be rendered the innocent pleaſures of ſocial life. They are not ſought with equal delight in every place. The glaſs is never filled in the maſter's preſence in ſome places, but at the feſtivals; and the ſong is ſeldom heard among ſome brethren, but in the jocund hour, when the Lodge is ſhut. Theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are indulgences, not Laws: of choice, not of obligation. And if we ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the bounds, which decency and good manners appoint, it is not becauſe we do not profeſs an abhorrence of every thing contrary to the pureſt laws of life. We lament what we cannot correct. And in a faithful maſter, we have the ſureſt reſtraints upon our gayeſt pleaſures. Our dangers are from the activity of our ſpirits, and from the unbounded effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a cheerful hour. Profuſion waits upon the ſteps of jollity, and pleaſure often deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes intereſt. A maſter watches over his Lodge: he commands, and he is always obeyed.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. THE <hi>form</hi> of the inſtitution can be known only to the brethren. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which the moſt refined delicacy might not behold. The ſolemn addreſſes at initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031799_0010_0FEE729FE9146738"/>are before the world. We publiſh our Conſtitutions, Regulations, Inſtructions, and general Laws; and even our freeſt mirth; and from theſe we may appeal to an impartial world, whether thoſe are not good principles we profeſs. We juſtify the uſe of every rite, of every form and ceremony, which can aid the local prejudices of religion or virtue. And the diſcretion gives no offence. We truſt that the ſcene of this day will ſtrengthen the convictions, that there are no obligations unworthy of a good man, and that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the wiſe would be a deſireable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Free Maſonry.</p>
                  <p>THE Symbols we diſplay, have been vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly interpreted. We publiſh them not for curioſity, but for ceremony. They are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed not for ſuperſtition, but for uſe. All conſtructions favourable to moral life are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, rather to remove prejudices abroad, than to define their character within the Lodge. They are free for diſquiſition, while they contribute to no diſſention. To avoid the charge of obſcurity, we ſhall not enter upon any particular explanation. It is enough, that the ſcrutiny of an antiquarian may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031799_0011_0FEF288E7B8872B0"/>that they are the moſt early emblems of wiſdom, and ſuch as may be found among all antient nations. A Bryant might diſcover the ſymbols of Egypt, as an Hutcheſon has of Pythagoras, as well as of the antient myſtics. They betray to the ſcholar no proofs of modern times, for their invention is as old as ſcience itſelf. They have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the emblems in the myſteries of Greece, and conſtantly traced to geometry and philoſophy. A ſtrong reſemblance in the antient gems has forced itſelf upon the notice of the moſt curſory obſerver. It is enough, if they be faithful in communicating their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign through the world.</p>
                  <p>FROM theſe remarks upon Free Maſonry, it may be ſoon apparent, how much will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the <hi>Lectures</hi> of a Lodge, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how much upon a faithful <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Wardens.</hi> It may then be expected that every brother, who aſſumes an office, by the conſent of a Lodge, will ſacredly attend to his charge. Every officer ought to be a calm, friendly, and benevolent man. An extenſive
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031799_0012_0FEF282244802920"/>knowledge of the brethren ought to be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but he certainly ought to know the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and habits of all in his own Lodge. The difference between well governed Lodges, and all other Lodges, is the greateſt to be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nothing ſhould be ſuffered which can provoke, alarm, or excite prejudice. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Charity is to keep every ſuch thing from a Lodge. Unleſs then the maſter can riſe above the diſtinctions of ſects in religion, while he has an eſtabliſhed character in the public opinion; unleſs he is ſuperior to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the ſtate; unleſs he can freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with all the brethren, without regard to the competitions of private life; unleſs he can be indulgent to particular manners and tempers, to cuſtoms, with which he cannot comply, and to amuſements, he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; he will never diffuſe a generous joy around him. All hearts will not be united. All prejudices will be active. Cheerfulneſs will not lean on partial kindneſs; nor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip ſit with diſgrace. Brethren will not ſuffer their charity to be degraded by their opinions, nor by their names.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:031799_0013_0FEF2823CADA3A90"/>
FOR voluntary aſſociations, we require ſuch men to hold offices, as can be punctual, active, and ready in all the ſervices of their ſtation: to whom the proſperity of the Lodge is the higheſt reward, and whoſe meaſure of duty, is not from what others have done, but from a diſpoſition to do all the good in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Happy indeed will it be, if the domeſtic and ſocial character of a Maſter be lovely in the world, and inſpire confidence in his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. After ſuch a delineation of our character, our brethren in this vicinity will not doubt of the nature of our advice and charge in theſe ſolemnities.</p>
                  <p>LET me then ſay to our Brethren of WASHINGTON LODGE; In this ſocial inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you have the indulgence of all the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent paſſions, and all the incentives of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affections. You may unbend in ſocial glee, catch the ſweet ſympathy of pleaſure, and ſhare it with fullneſs of ſoul. And while you rejoice in, you ought to urge a friendly zeal, and even an enthuſiaſm to defend, a friendſhip you thus honourably enjoy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:031799_0014_0FEF284228D9F648"/>
TO ſecure a maſon's heart, he ought to have a ſincere temper, and the habits of good will. Our friendſhip is not begun in diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted love. We have an intereſt in each other. There is too little of this love in the world, not to induce doubts of the ſtrength of it, in many who profeſs it. The little to be found, which reſembles it, agrees too well with the nature of our habits, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, more eaſily, on any other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Conſtancy, then, is a virtue of a flouriſhing Lodge. It is only while we keep near the Lodge, we are Maſons.</p>
                  <p>MASONS, as brethren, ought to be careful to receive only thoſe who appear <hi>good men and true.</hi> What we gain from prejudice, is not ſure gain. To open our arms to the diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or the diſcontented of any ſociety, is to degrade ourſelves and make the injured our enemies. This will give a triumph to their zeal, and juſtify their invectives. He that is not at peace with all the world, cannot be at peace with us. He that deſpiſes and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates any profeſſion, will certainly diſhonour us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:031799_0015_0FEF2847B235D9F0"/>
MASONS ought not only to regard the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of men, but their <hi>diſpoſitions.</hi> An in-inſtitution may be adapted to preſerve virtue, which is not fit to create it. The man who profits ſo little from life, as to have no lovely virtues, will be a tax upon us. He who does not conform to the approved manners and laws of a country, wants the firſt principles of friendſhip, and muſt prove a diſgrace to us.</p>
                  <p>MASONS ought alſo to confirm their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in each other. As the ſocial principle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more ſtrong from the intereſt we have in each other, in our whole character, we muſt have the greateſt intereſt in every thing dear to the brethren. He that in common life can deſpiſe the moſt whimſical thoughts of a brother, will never enjoy his affections. A good brother muſt learn to ſee without any contempt, the moſt ſtrange opinions living in a good heart. A Lodge is not a place for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, or controverſy. Political queſtions are unknown in it. Every thing belonging to a brother enjoys our charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:031799_0016_0FEF284B297AED50"/>
MASONS ſhould determine the <hi>converſation</hi> of a Lodge. The converſation that ſeems to have no higher aim than to diffuſe general pleaſure, and ends in no ill natured reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but leaves friends at parting in perfect good humour, tends more to make men love one another, do their duty in ſociety, and love their Creator, than any we can adopt in ſuch aſſociations. Moſt of our duty lies in ſociety, and moſt of our virtue in contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make men happy in themſelves. A wiſe man will look around him, not to ſay an ill thing without danger, but to learn how to recommend the moſt uſeful thoughts he can utter. He will endeavour to pleaſe in the beſt manner with the leaſt offence.</p>
                  <p>AND for our common intereſt let me ſay, after Lodges have received their charters, and have been inſtructed, if they do not aſſert an independence, they are too apt to enjoy it. They become too negligent of their <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and of their <hi>communications in the</hi> GRAND LODGE. Excellent members, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their lovely lodges, forget that we are a band of brethren, and owe each other the
<pb facs="unknown:031799_0017_0FEF28500EA9FB88"/>moſt free communications. Every brother ought to aſpire after the honours of theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly viſits; and, next to our own buſineſs, ought to be an enquiry into the laſt quarterly communications. A maſon would then find that he belonged to a ſociety more extenſive than of his own neighbourhood. He would thus have the progreſs of the order, in his own country at leaſt, if not through the world, before him. In his private pleaſures he would not forget the general proſperity. We have our reſpective orbs; but we revolve around a common center. And from its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we have life, health and fraternity.</p>
                  <p>IT ſhould alſo be remembered, that <hi>the ſtrength of Lodges is in their members.</hi> While Lodges are open to the viſits of Brethren, great care ſhould be ſhewn, that due honours are given to members of Lodges. Generous liberty does not permit a brother to make a free uſe of his privilege, while in no place he welcomes a regular ſummons. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not finiſhed, and no brother ceaſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from labour, unleſs privileged by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſervices. To be members, is to hold the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031799_0018_0FEF285649B4D530"/>which is indiſpenſably neceſſary for the exiſtence of our order.</p>
                  <p>IN <hi>expences,</hi> that method will be moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which keeps the funds, the ſpecial cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, the current charges, and the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, moſt diſtinct. The laſt ought to fall upon thoſe who enjoy them. They are, therefore, better out of the Lodge than in it, for <hi>moral,</hi> as well as <hi>economical</hi> reaſons.</p>
                  <p>IN the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of <hi>members,</hi> regard ought to be paid to merit, in the kindeſt exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from expence when the perſons of merit cannot well ſupport it. Such men would bring a character with them, and eſtabliſh it in a Lodge. It would then be free from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and adorned with all the virtues of the beſt of men.</p>
                  <p>AND as we hold ſacred the confidence of domeſtic life, our pleaſures ſhould never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the hours devoted to retirement, and to our homes.</p>
                  <p>IN qualifying ourſelves to fill the Offices with ſuch virtues, we riſe in the public eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031799_0019_0FEF287F0B4ACEE0"/>and enjoy the benevolent end of our inſtitution. Our habits become as favourable to the beſt ſervices in our power towards our brethren, as our hearts become free for the enjoyment of our ſocial glee; and neither our intereſt in the world, nor our good habits ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from our lovely aſſociation.</p>
                  <p>LET us then cultivate the true temper of Free Maſonry, and let us adorn the character with its commendable virtues. Then in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py time we may adorn a maſter's ſtation, and we ſhall always poſſeſs the merit, which would juſtify the appointment.</p>
                  <p>BELIEVE me, when I ſay, that as I love the principles of the Order, and have ſeen their benefit, ſo I ſincerely deſire to ſee the order reſpectable.</p>

                  <p>WE have aſſembled together, at this time, to countenance an inſtitution which ſerves to extend the principles of <hi>Concord</hi> and of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and to render man amiable and friendly to man.</p>
                  <p>WHILE in other nations are heard the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring tumults of <hi>Diſcord,</hi> and the piteous groans of <hi>War,</hi> we are allowed under the mild auſpices of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thoſe arts and encourage thoſe inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which harmonize the paſſions and perfect the virtues of individuals, which embelliſh the ſtate of general ſociety, and bind together in the ſame amities and intereſts the whole
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031799_0022_0FEF288CF5EDB9A0"/>family of mankind.—To revive and expand theſe noble principles, is an object dear to every human being in whoſe heart flows cheerily "the milk of human kindneſs:" and to the venerable order of FREE and ACCEPTED MASONS has been an endeavour, ſtrenuous as their moſt active abilities,—and a deſire, warm and animated as any Philanthropy ever formed.</p>
                  <p>WHILE this day affords an opportunity of expreſſing our united attachment to the grand principles of humanity, let it prove a new motive to ſtrengthen the endearing ligature which binds congenial hearts.—To my valued Brethren of WASHINGTON LODGE, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion is replete with <hi>intereſting, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,</hi> and <hi>joyous</hi> circumſtances. It is the <hi>birth-day</hi> of their privileges; and they are now to receive the ſanction of eſtabliſhment, and the ſolemnity of conſecration. Cheerfully do I do mingle my felicitations with theirs.</p>
                  <p>IT is truly pleaſing to ſee theſe Colonies of the friends of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves around. It is a renewed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the acknowledged importance, and increaſed reputation of our excellent ſociety.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:031799_0023_0FEF2820B94F2098"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Right Worſhipful</hi> MASTER, <hi>Reſpected</hi> OFFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERS, <hi>and beloved</hi> BRETHREN of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON LODGE! with all the ſincerity of frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affection does my heart proffer you its beſt wiſhes. Nor need I extend the deſires of cordial regard, for your united and individual proſperity, farther than this comprehenſive hope, that, as you have adopted the <hi>name</hi> of our MOST RENOWNED BROTHER for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendatory title of your Lodge, you may adopt his <hi>virtues</hi> for the recommendatory or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of your lives!—May the Lodge now conſecrated, be conſpicuous for its clear <hi>light,</hi> and long honored in its enlarging ſphere of <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> and <hi>glory!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND ſurely theſe congratulations and wiſhes are reciprocated by every friend to the ſocial intereſts and happineſs of mankind. Eſpecially when they are daily more and more convinced, that the <hi>light</hi> in which we rejoice, is not the mimic blaze which glitters o'er the train of folly, but the ſteady luſtre reflected, from thoſe reſplendent luminaries of the Maſonic hemiſphere, WISDOM, TRUTH, and VIRTUE.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:031799_0024_0FEF289068691F90"/>
LET it be remembered, that on the firm baſis of general <hi>Philanthropy</hi> are erected the pillars of our inſtitution, modelled to a perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which no art can excel, no marble out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. While we admire the noble ſtructure of the edifice, we receive the moſt pleaſing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and inſtruction in peruſing thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly documents which compoſe its arcana. We are there taught the moſt ſolid truths, important and intereſting to the welfare of mankind. Directed by the grand principles there delineated, we approach nearer the divine plan of the SOVEREIGN ARCHITECT; and becoming perfect maſons, are rendered wiſer and better members of ſociety. In the calm moments of reflection, when diveſted of the impreſſions of prejudice, the world will approve the principles which animate us; ſince it is their glory to call forth into action the moſt benevolent and noble feelings of the heart. The ſalutary inſtitutes of our Craft are happily calculated to produce the greateſt comfort to individuals and to augment the happineſs of ſociety, by teaching us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come temperate, juſt, benevolent and pious; and by directing the natural propenſities of the human ſoul, the love of pleaſure and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031799_0025_0FEF2899C411F630"/>love of action, to their nobleſt ends. Thoſe qualities of the mind, which are thus excited and exerciſed, tend immediately to refine our feelings and dignify our natures. And over the ſcenes both of retired and public life, their benign influence ſheds a mild and pleaſing luſtre. The combined effect is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly conducive to the amelioration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the improvement of ſocial bliſs.</p>
                  <p>So long as our race ſhall be ſubject to infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and expoſed to misfortune, <hi>friendly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> will be deemed a virtue and a bleſſing; and ſo long as individuals can derive advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or pleaſure from reciprocal intereſt and attachment, the credit of this fraternity muſt increaſe, and Maſonry continue to deſerve univerſal approbation.</p>
                  <p>AT the ſame time that the inſtructions and operations of the Lodge aſſiſt in giving to the intellectual and moral faculties the <hi>Wiſdom, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> which accompliſh their perfection; they induſtriouſly <hi>contrive</hi> and generouſly <hi>ſupport</hi> thoſe ingenious diſcoveries and uſeful arts which correct <hi>taſte</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:031799_0026_0FEF28A0DB2BAC58"/>
GREAT are our obligations to thoſe venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters in whom firſt dawned the light of Maſonry; the united and increaſing radiance of which, diffuſing itſelf over remoteſt climes, has been continually diſpelling the noxious vapors of gloomy ſuperſtition and the gathering clouds of threatening envy. And we rejoice in thoſe energetic exertions which have ſucceſsfully contributed to form a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bring into complete operation an eſtabliſhment, whoſe only aim is that of unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the ſame ſoftened and virtuous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the whole human race.</p>
                  <p>LET no breaſt, then, harbor ſentiments incompatible with the liberal principles on which our aſſociation is founded: ſince it muſt be perverſeneſs to deny its merited honors to a Society which has riſen ſuperior, in every age, to partiality and prejudice; and, by the teſtimony of its effects, ſilenced objection and conciliated eſteem.—</p>
                  <p>THE flowers of fancy and the figures of eloquence would be vainly laviſhed in its praiſe. Sufficiently attractive to your eyes is the unadorned portrait. The pencil of <hi>Truth</hi> has ſketched the outline, and given</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:031799_0027_0FEF28A540ECA9F0"/>
IN concluſion, my Brethren will permit me to obſerve, that, as we aſpire to the praiſe of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> ſo we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ourſelves the admirers of BEAUTY, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as well as intellectual and moral. They will expect me, therefore, to notice our FAIR FRIENDS, whoſe preſence honors and whoſe ſmiles enliven us. We owe them a tribute of warmeſt thanks for gracing our public aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>IT is to be regretted that inſtitutions in general have excluded that lovely ſex from becoming members. We diſclaim the idea of their being unequal to any important truſt or inadequate to the beſt purpoſes of ſociety. Were they to mingle more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately with <hi>ſocial,</hi> or more actively with <hi>political</hi> inſtitutions, much might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their poliſhed talents and beautiful deſigns. If it be aſked why they are not permitted to join with us, in extending the intereſts of humanity, and in cultivating and improving the friendly virtues; we would reply, that, their charms and attractions, which ſo decorate the ſcenery of life, would become incompatible with the labors of the Lodge; that <hi>Love, powerful Love,</hi> might ſo
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031799_0028_0FEF28ABCCFBCAA0"/>influence and triumph, that <hi>Brotherly Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> would give way to Jealouſy, Friendſhip to Diſſimulation, and Judgment to Paſſion. In the important buſineſs of our retirement, the preſence of the Fair would ſo intermingle a train of buſy loves, as to baniſh every other ſentiment; and make us inattentive to every care and forgetful of every duty which forms the object and the recommendation of our es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment.—Admit, ye lovely partners of our hearts and hopes, our honeſt apology: and be aſſured that the <hi>fidelity</hi> which is inſcribed upon the Maſon's breaſt, will give certainty to the Lover's promiſe, and permanency to the Huſband's affection; will render us all more worthy of your regards, and more auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary to your happineſs.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BROTHERS,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>RECOLLECT that a ſtrict obſervance of the rules of our duty will ever ſecure us from cenſure and reproach. While by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct we give no latitude for malicious inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, the purity of our intentions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the uncandid may think of them, will not fail to give to our own hearts a confidence which will ſupport and cheer in every ſcene, and brighten the evening ſhades of mortal exiſtence.</p>
