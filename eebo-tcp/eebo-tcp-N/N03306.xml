            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> went with some Labourers, my two Elder Brothers and my self, to one of his Farms, which lay on the River about three Miles above <hi>Fort-Charles</hi>

Field of English Corn, except my Father, the youngest of my two Brothers and my self, who tarried near to the Farm-House in which we had Dined, till about One of the Clock, when we heard the Report of several Great Guns from the Fort. Upon the hearing of them my Father said, that he hop'd it was a Signal of good News, and that the Great Council had sent back the Soldiers, to cover the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: for on Report of the Revolution they had deserted: But to our great Surprize about Thirty or Forty Indians dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a Volley of Shot at us, from behind a rising Ground near our Barn. <note n="*" place="bottom">The Indians have a Custom of uttering a most horrid Howl, when they discharge Guns, designing thereby to terrify those whom they fight against.</note> The Yelling of the Indians, the Whistling of their Shot, and the Voice of my Father, whom I heard cry out, What now! What now! so terrified me; tho' he seem'd to be handling a Gun, that I endeavoured to make my Escape. My Brother ran one way and I ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and looking over my Shoulder, I saw a stout Fellow, painted, pursuing me with a Gun; and a Curtlass glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Hand, which I expected every Moment in my Brains: I presently fell down, and the Indian took me by the Left Hand, offered me no abuse, but seized my Arms, lift me up, and pointed to the Place where the People were at Work about the Hay; and lead me that way. As we passed, we crossed my Father, who looked very pale and bloody, and walked very slowly. When we came to the Place, I saw two Men shot down on the Flatts, and one or two more knock'd on the Head with Hatchets, crying out, O Lord, &amp;c! there the Indians brought two Captives, one Man, and my Brother <hi>James,</hi> he that endeavoured to escape by running from the House, when I did <note n="â€ " place="bottom">He was about Fourteen Years of Age.

They march'd about a quarter of a Mile and then made a Halt, and brought my Father to us: and made Proposals to him by old <hi>Moxus,</hi> who told him that

they were strange Indians who shot him, and that he was sorry for it: My Father replied, that he was a dying Man, and wanted no Favour of them, but to Pray with his Children; which being granted, he recommended us to the Protection and Blessing of GOD Almighty; then gave us the best Advice, and took his leave for this Life, hoping in GOD that we should meet in a better. He parted with a chearful Voice, but looked very pale by reason of his great loss of Blood, which boil'd out of his Shoes:â€”the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans lead him asideâ€”!â€”I heard the blows of the Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Indians lead us their Captives, <note place="margin">SECT. II. Of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Pemma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi> Town and Fort.</note> on the East side of the River, toward the Fort; and when we came within a Mile and half of the Fort and Town, and could see the Fort, we saw Firing &amp; Smoke on all sides: Here we made a short stop, and then we moved within or near the distance of three quarters of a Mile from the Fort, <note place="margin">â€”Of <hi>Mr. Gyles's</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> into a thick Swamp. There I saw my Mother and my two little Sisters, and many other Captives taken from the Town. My Mother ask'd me of my Father, I told her, that he was kill'd, but could say no more for Grief; she burst into Tears, and the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans moved me a little further off, and seiz'd me to a Tree.</p>
               <p>The Indians came to <hi>New-Harbour,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Pateshall</hi> was taken and kill'd as he lay with his Sloop near the <hi>Barbican.</hi> On the first stir about the Fort my youngest Brother was at Play near the same, and ran in, and so by God's Goodness was preserved.

               <p n="1">1. That they, the Indians should give him Mr. <hi>Poteshall's</hi> Sloop.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they should not molest him in carrying off the few People that had got into the Fort, and three Captives that they had taken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the English should carry off in their Hands what they could from the Fort.</p>
               <p>On these Conditions the Fort was Surrendred, and Capt. <hi>Weems</hi> went off. And soon after the Indians set on Fire the Fort &amp; Houses: which made a terrible Blast, and was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Sight to us poor Captives, who were sad Spectators!</p>

And when we turned out Backs on the Town my Heart was ready to break!â€”I saw my Mother; she spake to me, but I could not answer her! That Night we tarried at <hi>New-Harbour,</hi> and the next Day went in their Canoes for <hi>Penobscot.</hi> About Noon, the Canoe which my Mother, and that which I was in, came side by side; whether accidental or by my Mother's desire, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say.

When my Mother heard the talk of my being Sold to a Jesuit, she said to me, Oh! my dear Child! if it were GOD's Will, I had rather follow you to your Grave! or never see you more in this World, than you should be Sold to a Jesuit: for a Jesuit will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Indians look'd on me with a fierce Countenance, signifying that it would be my turn next. They champ'd Corn-Stalks, and threw them in my Hat, which was in my Hand: I smiled on them, tho' my Heart ak'd.

and laid down a Bag of Corn in the Ring; the little Girl took me by the Hand, making Signs for me to go out of the Circle with them: but not knowing their Custom, I supposed that they designed to kill me, and would not go out with them. Then a grave Indian came and gave me a short Pipe, and said, in English, Smoke it: then took me by the Hand and lead me out, but my Heart aked, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self near my End, but he carried me to a French Hutt about a Mile from the Indian Fort. The Frenchman was not at Home; but his Wise who was a Squaw had some Discourse with my Indian Friend, which I did not understand.

Thus we have been Hunting three hundred Miles from the Sea and knew no Man within fifty or sixty Miles of us. We were eight or ten in Number, and had but two Indian Men with Guns, on whom we wholly depended for Food: and if any disaster had hap'ned, we must all have perished.

Our two Indian Men, in Hunting, started a Moose <note n="*" place="bottom">A Moose is a fine lofty Creature about eight Feet high, with a long Head and Nose like a Horse: with Horns very large and strong [Some of them are above six Feet, from the Extremity of one Horn to that of the other] shaped and shed every Year like the Horns of a Deer: likewise their Feet are cloven like Deers Feet.

               <p>On the second Spring of my Captivity my Indian Master and his Squaw went to <hi>Canada;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">SECT. II. Of their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity to <hi>James Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> &amp;c.</note> but sent me down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with several Indians to the Fort; in order to plant Corn. The Day before we came to the Planting Field we met two Young Indian Men who seem'd to be in great haste: after they had pass'd us I understood that they were going with an Express to <hi>Canada,</hi> and that there was an English Vessel at the Mouth of the River. I not perfect in the Language, nor knowing that English Vessels traded with them in time of War, supposed a Peace was concluded on, and that the Captives would be released: and was so transported with the Fancy, that I slept but little, if at all, that Night. Early the next Morning we came to the Village, where the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy ended: For I had no sooner Landed, but three or four Indians drag'd me to the great Wigwam, where they were yelling and dancing round <hi>James Alexander,</hi> a Jersey Man, who was taken from <hi>Falmouth</hi> in <hi>Casco Bay.</hi> This was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by two Families of <hi>Cape Sable</hi> Indians, who having lost some Friends by a number of English Fishermen, came some hundred of Miles to revenge themselves on the poor Captives! They soon came to me, &amp; tossed me about till I was almost breathless, &amp; then threw me into the Ring to my fellow Captive: and took him out again, and repeated their Barbarities to him. And then I was hal'd out again by three Indians, by the Hair of my Head, and held down by it, till one beat me on the Back &amp; Shoulders so long that my Breath was almost beat out of my Body. And then others put a Tomhake into my Hand, and order'd me get up and dance and sing Indian: which I perform'd with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reluctance, and in the Act seem'd resolute to purchase my Death, by killing two or three of those Monsters of Cruelty;

thinking it impossible to survive their bloody Treatment; but it was impress'd on my Mind, <hi>'Tis not in their Power to take away your Life:</hi> so I desisted. Then those <hi>Cape Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Indians came to me again like Bears bereaved of their Whelps, saying, <hi>Shall we who have lost Relations by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, suffer an English Voice to be heard among us &amp;c.</hi> Then they beat me again with the Axe: Then I repented that I had not sent two or three of them out of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for I tho't that I had much rather die than suffer any longer.

Not one of the Indians shew'd the least Compassion: but I saw the Tears run down plentifully on the Cheeks of a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that sat behind; which did not alleviate the Tortures that poor <hi>James</hi> and I were forced to endure for the most part of this tedious Day; for they were continued till the Evening: and were the most severe that ever I met with in the whole six Years that I was Captive with the Indians.â€”After they had thus inhumanely abused us, two Indians took us up and threw us out of the Wigwam, and we crawled away on our Hands &amp; Feet, &amp; were scarce able to walk, &amp;c. for several Days. Some time after they again concluded on a merry Dance, when I was at some distance from the Wigwam dressing Leather, and an Indian was so kind as to tell me that they had got <hi>James Alexander,</hi> and were in search for me. My Indian Master and his Squaw bid me run as for my Life into a Swamp and hide, and not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my self unless they both came to me, for then I might be assured the Dance was over. I was now master of their Language, and a Word or a Wink was enough to excite me to take care of One. I ran to the Swamp, and hid in the thickest place that I could find. I heard hollowing and whooping all around me; sometimes they pass'd very near,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004021_0017_1003CCA426626E68"/>
and I could hear some threaten, and others flatter me, but I was not dispos'd to dance: and if they had come upon me, I resolv'd to show them a pair of Heels, and they must have had good luck to have catch'd me. I heard no more of them till about Evening [for I think I slept] when they came again, calling <hi>Chon, Chon,</hi> but <hi>John</hi> would not trust them. After they were gone, my Master and his Squaw came where they told me to hide, but could not find me; and when I heard them say with some concern, that they believ'd that the other Indians had frightned me into the Woods, and that I was lost; I came out, and they seem'd well pleas'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ONE Winter as we were moving from Place to Place, <note place="margin">SECT. I. Of a near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape from Death by Frost.</note> our Hunters kill'd some Moose; and one lying some Miles from our Wigwams, a Young Indian &amp; my self were ordered to fetch part of it. We set out in the Morning when the Weather was promising, but it proved a very Cold, Cloudy Day. It was late in the Evening we arrived at the Place where the Moose lay: so that we had no time to provide Materials for Fire or Shelter. At the same time a Storm came on very thick of Snow, and continued till the next Morning. We made a small Fire with what little Rubbish we could find around us, which with the heat of our Bodies melted the Snow upon us as fast as it fell, and fill'd our Cloaths with Water. Nevertheless, early in the Morning, we took our Loads of Moose-Flesh, and set out, in order to return to our Wigwams: We had not travelled far before my Moose-Skin Coat (which was the only Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I had on my Back, and the Hair was in most Places worn off) was froze stiff round my Knees like a Hoop, as likewise my Snow-shoes &amp; Shoe-clouts to my Feet! Thus I march'd the whole Day without Fire or Food! at first I was in great Pain, then my Flesh numb'd, and I felt at times extream Sick, and tho't I could not travel one foot further; but wonderfully reviv'd again. After long travelling I felt very drowsy, &amp; had thoughts of setting down; which had I done, without doubt I had fall'n on my final Sleep; as my dear Companion, <hi>Evans,</hi> had done before; for my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Companion, being better Cloath'd, had left me long before: but again my Spirits reviv'd as much as if I had receiv'd the richest Cordial! Some Hours after Sun-set I recovered the Wigwam, and crawl'd in with my Snow-shoes on. The Indians cry'd out, <hi>The Captive is froze to Death!</hi> They took off my Pack, and where that lay against my Back was the only Place that was not frozen. The Indians cut off my Shoes, and stript the Clouts from my Feet, which were as void of feeling as any frozen Flesh could be: but I had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004021_0020_1003CCD8A0E2D2C0"/>
and my Feet to my Ankles turn'd black, &amp; swelled with bloody Blisters, and were inexpressibly painful. The Indians said one to another, <hi>His Feet will rot, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> die.</hi> Nevertheless, I slept well at Night. Soon after the Skin came off my Feet from my Ankles whole like a Shoe, and left my Toes naked without a Nail, and the ends of my great Toe-Bones bare, which in a little time turn'd black, so that I was obliged to cut the first Joint off with my Knife. The Indians gave me Rags to bind up my Feet, &amp; advis'd me to apply Fir-balsom, but withal said, that they believ'd it was not worth while to use means, for I should certainly die. But by the use of my Elbows and a Stick in each Hand, I shov'd my self on my Bottom, over the Snow, from one Tree to another, till I got some Fir-balsom, then burn'd it in a Clam-shell till it was of a consistence like Salve, and apply'd it to my Feet and Ankles, and by the divine Blessing within a Week I could go about upon my Heels with my Staff. And thro' GOD's goodness, we had Provision enough, so that we did not remove under ten or fifteen Days, and then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians made two little Hoops something in Form as a Snow-shoe, and seiz'd them to my Feet: and I follow'd them in their Track on my Hee's from Place to Place; sometimes half Leg deep in Snow &amp; Water, which gave me the most acute Pain imaginable, but I was forced to walk or die. But within a Year my Feet were intirely well, &amp; the Nails came on my great Toes: so that a very critical Eye, could scarce perceive any part missing, or that they had been froze at all!</p>

I was very officious in supplying them with Wood &amp; Water, which pleased them so well, that they now &amp; then gave me a piece of Flesh half boil'd or roasted, which I did eat with eagerness: and I doubt without great Thankfulness to the divine BEING, who so extraordinarily fed me!â€”At length the Scaffold broke, and one large Piece fell and knock'd me on the Head [the Indians said that I lay stun'd a considerable time] the first

I look'd for the Indian, and he was half a Mile distant up the River. I went to him, and ask'd, Why he did not tow me to the Bank, seeing he knew that I could not Swim? He said he knew that I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Canoe, for there were no Bubbles any where to be seen, &amp; that I should drive on the Point: therefore he took care of his fine Sturgeon, which was eight or ten Feet long.</p>

But instead of diving across the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest, I was crawling on the bottom into the deepest Place: but not seeing me rise, and knowing where-abouts I was, by the bubling of the Water; a young Girl, dove into the Water, and seizing me by the Hair of my Head, drew me out: otherwise I had perished in the Water <note n="â€ " place="bottom">Tho' both Male and Female may be in the Water at a Time, they have each of them more or less of their Cloaths on, and behave with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Chastity and Modesty.</note>.</p>

I told him that he might go to War, and that would be more Manly, than to kill a poor Captive who was doing their Drudgery for them. Notwithstanding all that I could say, he began to cut &amp; stab me on my Breast. I seiz'd him by the Hair, &amp; tumbled him from off me on his Back, &amp; follow'd him with my Fist and Knee so, that he presently said he had enough; but when I saw the Blood run &amp; felt the Smart, I at him again and bid him get up and not lie there like a Dog,â€”told him of his former Abuses offered to me &amp; other poor Captives, and that if ever he offered the like to me again, I would pay him double. I sent him before me, took up my Burden of Wood, &amp; came to the Indians and told them the whole Truth; and they commended me: And I don't remember that ever he offered me the least Abuse afterward; tho' he was big enough to have dispatched two of me.

I may never be forgetful of his wonderful Goodness! and that these Instances may excite others in their Adversities to make their Addresses to the Almighty; and put their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Him in the use of proper Means.</p>

In some such manner they all died, so that not one of those two Families lived to return home. Were it not for this Remark of the Priest, I should not, perhaps, have made the Observation.</p>
               <p>There was an old Squaw who ever endeavoured to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do all others in Cruelty to Captives. <note place="margin">SECT. II.â€”Of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Old Squaw.</note> Where-ever she came into a Wigwam, where any poor naked starved Captives were sitting near the Fire; if they were grown Persons, she would privately take up a Shovel of hot Coals, &amp; throw them into their Bosom; or Young Ones, she would take by the Hand or Leg, and drag them thro' the Fire &amp;c. The Indians according to their Custom left their Village in the Fall of the Year and dispersed themselves for Hunting, and after the first or second removal, they all strangely forgot that old Squaw and her Grandson about Twelve Years of Age. They were found dead in the Place where they were left, some Months afterward, and no further notice taken of them. This was very much observed by the Priest; and seem'd strange to all that heard it, for the Indians were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally very careful not to leave their Old or Young!</p>
               <p>In the latter part of Summer, or beginning of Autumn, the Indians were frequently frighted by the Appearance of strange Indians passing up &amp; down this River in Canoes, <note place="margin">SECT. III. Of a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Priest said, that it was a sort of Plague. A Person seeming in perfect Health, would bleed at the Mouth &amp; Nose, turn blue in Spots, and die in two or three Hours [It was very tedious to me who was forced to move from Place to Place this cold Season. The Indians applied red Oker to my Sores, which by GOD's Blessing cured me.] The Indians all scattered, it being at

the worst as Winter came on; and the Blow was so great that the Indians did not Settle or Plant at the Village while I was on the River, and I know not whether they have to this Day!</p>
               <p>Before they thus deserted the Village, when they came in from Hunting, they would be drunk and fight for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Days and Nights together, till they had spent most of their Skins in Wine &amp; Brandy, which was brought to the Village by a French Man, call'd Monsieur <hi>Sige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They accordingly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many Hot-Stones, and laid them in an heap, &amp; made a small Hutt covered with Skins &amp; Matts, and then in the dark Night two of the Powaws went into this Hot-House with a large Vessel of Water, which at Times they poured on those hot Rocks, which raised a thick Steam, so that a third Indian was oblig'd to stand without, and lift up a Matt, to give it vent when they were almost suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There was an old Squaw who was kind to Captives, and never join'd with them in their Powawing, to whom I manifested an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire to see their Management: She told me, that if they knew of my being there, they would kill me, and that when she was a Girl, she had known Young Persons to be taken away by an hairy Man: and therefore she would not advise me to go, lest the hairy Man should carry me away. I told her that I was not afraid of that hairy Man, nor could he hurt me if she would not discover me to the Powaws. At length she promised that she would not, but charged me to be careful of my self.â€”I went within three or four Feet of the Hot-House, for it was very dark, and heard strange

               <p>One Afternoon as I was in a Canoe with one of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waws, the Dog bark'd, and presently a Moose pass'd by, within a few Rods of us, so that the Waves which he made by wading roll'd our Canoe; the Indian shot at him, but the Moose took very little notice of it, and went into the Woods to the Southward: the Fellow said, <hi>I'll try if I can't fetch you back, for all your haste.</hi> The Evening following, we built our two Wigwams on a Sandy Point on the upper End of an Island in the River, Northwest of the Place where the Moose went into the Woods: and the Indian powaw'd the greatest part of the Night following, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had the fair track of a Moose, round our Wigwams, tho' we did not see or taste of it.â€”I am of Opinion, that the Devil was permitted to humour those unhappy Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches sometimes, in some things.</p>

               <head>A Description of several Creatures commonly taken by the Indians on St. John's River.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Beaver</hi> has a very thick strong Neck, <note place="margin">SECT. I. Of the <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                  </note> his fore Teeth, which are two in the upper and two in the under Jaw, are concave and sharp like a Carpenter's Googe. Their side-Teeth are like a Sheep's, for they chew the Cud. Their Legs are short, the Claws something longer than in other Creatures; the Nails on the Toes of their hind Feet are flat like an Ape's, but join'd together by a Membra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> as those of Water Fowl, their Tails broad and flat like the broad End of a Paddle. Near their Tails they have four Bottles, two of which contain Oil, the other Gum, the necks of these meet in one common Orifice; the latter of these contain the proper Castorum, and not the Testicles, as some have fancied, for the Testicles are distinct &amp; seperate from these, in the Males only; but the Castorum and Oyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bottles are common to Male and Female. With this Oyl and Gum they preen themselves, so that when they come out of the Water it runs off them, as it doth off a Fowl. They have four Teats, which are on their Breasts, so that they hug up their Young, and suckle them, as Women do their Infants. They have generally two and sometimes four in a Litter. I have seen seven or five in the Matrix: but the Indians think it a strange thing to find so many in a Litter, and they assert, that when it so happens, the Dam kills all above four. They are the most laborious Creatures that I have met with. I have known them to build Damms across Rivers which were thirty or forty Perch wide, with Wood &amp; Mud, so as to flow many Acres of Land: in the deepest part of a Pond so raised, they build their Houses round in the Figure of an Indian Wigwam, eight or ten Feet in height, and six or eight Feet diameter on the Floor; which is made descending to the Water, the Parts near the Center about four, and near the Circumference between ten and twenty Inches above the Water: These Floors are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with strippings of Wood like Shavings; on these they sleep with their Tails in the Water, and if the Freshits rise
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004021_0028_1003CD1C8CF31BF8"/>
they have the advantage of rising on their Floor to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part. They feed on the Leaves and Bark of Trees and Pond-Lilly-Roots. In the Fall of the Year they lay in their Provision for the approaching Winter; cutting down Trees great and small, with one end in their Mouths they drag their Branches near to their House, and sink many Cords of it. [They will cut down Trees of a Fathom in Circumference.] They have Doors to go down to the Wood under the Ice, and in case the Freshits rise, break down and carry off their Store of Wood, they often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>. They have a Note for conversing, calling &amp; warning each other, when at Work or Feeding; &amp; while they are at Labour they keep out a Guard, who upon the first approach of an Enemy so strikes the Water with it's Tail, that he may be heard half a Mile; which so alarms the rest, that they are all silent, quit their Labour, and are to be seen no more for that Time. And if the Male or Female die, the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving seeks a Mate, and conducts him or her to their House, and carry on Affairs as above.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Wolverin</hi> is a very fierce and mischievous Creature: <note place="margin">SECT. II. Of the <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verin.</hi>
                  </note> about the bigness of a middling Dog, having short Legs, broad Feet, &amp; very sharp Claws; and in my Opinion may be reckoned a Species of Cats. They will climb Trees, and wait for Moose and other Creatures who feed below, and when an Opportunity presents jump and strike their Claws in them so fast, that they will hang on them 'till they have gnaw'd the main Nerve of the Neck asunder, &amp; the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dies. I have known many Moose kill'd thus. I was once travelling a little way behind several Indians, &amp; heard them Laughing very merrily: when I came to them, they shew'd me the Track of a Moose, and how a <hi>Wolverin</hi> had climb'd a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Indians who impute such Accidents to the cunning of the Creature, were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pleased that the Moose should thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>

                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:004021_0029_1003B14430198D88"/>These <hi>Wolverins,</hi> go into Wigwams which have been left for any Time, scatter the Things abroad, and most filthily pollute them with Ordure. I have heard the Indians say, that they have hal'd their Guns from under their Heads, while they were asleep; and left them so defil'd. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian told me, that having left his Wigwam with sundry Things on the Scaffold, among which was a Birch-Flask with several Pounds of Powder in it: At their return they were much surpriz'd and griev'd, for a light Snow had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and a <hi>Wolverin</hi> visits their Wigwam, mounts the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, andâ€”to plundering, heaves down Bag &amp; Baggage; the Powder happ'ned to fall into the Fire, which fill'd the <hi>Wolverin's</hi> Eyes, and threw him and the Wigwam some Rods. At length they found the blind Creature rambling backward and forward, had the satisfaction of kicking and beating him about, which in great measure made up their Loss: and then they could contentedly pick up their Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils, and rig out their Wigwam!</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Hedge-Hog</hi> or <hi>Urchin</hi> is about the bigness of a Hog of six Months old, <note place="margin">SECT. III. Of the <hi>Hedge-Hog or Urchin.</hi>
                  </note> his Back and Sides and Tail are full of sharp Quills, so that if any Creature approach, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themselves to a globular Form; if a Creature attack them, those Quills are so sharp and lose in their Skins that they fix in the Mouth of the Adversary and leave their own Skin. They will strike with great force, with their Tails; so that whatever falls under the lash of them, are certainly fill'd with their Prickles: But that they shoot their Quills, as some assert they do, is a great mistake as to the <hi>American,</hi> and I believe as to the <hi>African Hedge-Hog</hi> or <hi>Porcupine</hi> also; as to the former I have taken them at all Seasons of the Year. See Chap. 5. Sect. 2.</p>

                  </note> whose Form is so well-known in all Parts: but their way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating their Species is not so universally known. I have observed that sort whose Shell is about fourteen or sixteen Inches wide: in their Coition or Treading they may be heard half a Mile, making a noise like a Woman washing her Linnen with a batting Staffâ€”They lay their Eggs in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004021_0030_1003CD23C8F899B0"/>
the Sand; near some deep still Water, about a Foot beneath the surface of the Sand. They are very curious in cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the Sand, so that there is not the least mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it amongst them; nor the least rising of Sand on the Beach where they lie: I have often search'd for them with the Indians, by thursting a Stick into the Sand, about the Beech at random, and brought up some part of an Egg clinging to it: and uncovering the Place have found near an hundred &amp; fifty in one Nest. Both their Eggs &amp; Flesh are good-Eating when boil'd &amp;c. I have observed a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as to the length of Time which they are hatching, which is between twenty &amp; thirty Days, some sooner than others: Whether this difference ought to be imputed to the various Quality or Site of the Sand in which they lay (as to it's cold or heat &amp;c) I leave to the Conjecture of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi.â€”As soon as they were hatch'd, they broke thro' the Sand and betook themselves to the Water, as far as I could discover, without any further Care or Help of the Old Ones.</p>

               <p>WHEN the Indians determine for War, <note place="margin">SECT. I. Of their Feasting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go out to War.</note> or are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a particular Expedition, they kill a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Dogs, burn off their Hair, and cut them into Pieces; leaving only one Dog's Head whole; the rest of the Flesh they boil, and make a fine Feast of it: after which, the Dog's Head that was left whole is scorch'd, 'till the Nose and Lips have shrunk from the Teeth, and left them bare and grinning; this done; they fasten it on a Stick, and the Indian who is proposed to be Chief in the Expedition takes the Head into his Hand and sings a Warlike Song: in which he mentions the Town they design to Attack, and the principal Man in it, threatning that in a few Days he will carry that Man's Head and Scalp in his Hand, in the same manner. When the Chief hath Sung, he so places the Dog's Head as to grin at him whom he supposeth will go his Second: who, if he accepts, takes the Head in his Hand and sings, but if he refuse to go, he turns the Teeth to another; and thus from one to another 'till they have inlisted their Company.</p>
               <p>The Indians imagine that Dog's Flesh makes them bold and courageous! I have seen an Indian split a Dog's Head with a Hatchet, and take out the Brains hot, and eat them raw, with the Blood running down his Jaws!</p>
               <p>When a Relation dies; <note place="margin">SECT. II.

               <p>After the mourning Season is over, the Relations of the deceased make a Feast to wipe off Tears; and they may Marry freely. If the deceas'd were a Squaw, the Relations consult together and choose a Squaw (doubtless a Widow) and send her to the Widower: and if he like her he takes her to be his Wife, if not, he sends her back; and the Relations choose and send 'till they find one that he approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of.</p>

Again, Madam said to me, <q>

The next Day we spake with Indians, who (were in a Canoe and) gave us an Account that <hi>Sigenecto-Town</hi> was taken and burnt. Soon after we heard the great Guns at Governour <hi>Vielbon's</hi> Fort, which the English engag'd several Days, kill'd one Man, and drew off and went down the River; for it was so late in the Fall, that had they tarried a few Days longer, in the River; they would have been froze in for the Winter. Hearing no report of the great Guns for several Days, I with two others went down to our House, to make discoveryâ€”: where we found our young Lad who was taken by the English when they went up the River: For the General was so honourable that, on reading the Note on our Door, he ordered that the House and Barn should not be burnt, nor their Cattle or other Creatures kill'd; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one or two, and the Poultry, for their Use: and at their return, order'd the young Lad to be put ashore. Finding things in this Posture, we return'd and gave <hi>Madam</hi> an Account:â€”She acknowledged the many Favours which the English had shewn her with Gratitude; and treated me with great Civility. The next Spring, <hi>Monsieur</hi> arriv'd from <hi>France</hi> in the Man of War; who thank'd me for my Care of his Affairs, and said that he would endeavour to fulfill what Madam had promised to me.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 1699.
