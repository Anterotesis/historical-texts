            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have Call'd you together at this time to give you an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Serving the Common Intereſt of your Country, by Redreſſing the Grievances this Province lies under, and of making ſuch Laws, as may by the Bleſſing of God, Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh you in ſafety and happineſs for the time to come.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible of the great Sufferings you ſuſtained all this laſt War, by this Province's being a Frontier towards the Eaſtern Indians, a cruel and perfidious Enemy in their own nature, but taught and incouraged to be more ſo by the Jeſuits, and other Popiſh Miſſionaries from <hi>France,</hi> who were not more induſtrious during the War, to inſtigate their Indian Diſciples, and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes (as they are pleas'd to call 'em) to Kill your people trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly, than they have been ſince the Peace, to debauch thoſe Indians from their former Subjection to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>: Inſomuch as at preſent they ſeem to have departed from their Allegiance to the Crown, and Revolted to the <hi>French.</hi> I have taken ſuch meaſures as quickly to find out whether thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians will return to their Obedience to the Crown or no: if they do not, and that they Commit any Hoſtilities upon you; I doubt not but to find an eaſy way of ſubduing them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:039348_0002_10141E80969CE508"/>Upon the Report of His Majeſties Engineer, whom I ſent to view the Fort on the Great Iſland, and the Harbour of this Town, I find the Scituation is naturally well diſpos'd, but the Fort ſo very weak and untenable, that it requires the Building a new ſubſtantial one, to ſecure you in time of War. You will do well to take this matter into Conſideration as ſoon as may be. This Province is well Seated for Trade, and your Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour here on <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> River ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> good that a Fort to ſecure it would invite people to come and ſettle among you, and as you grow in number, ſo will your Trade advance and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: and you will be uſeful to <hi>England,</hi> which you ought to covet above all things, not only as it is your duty, but as it will alſo be for your Glory and Intereſt. Such a KING as GOD has bleſs'd us with at preſent, and ſuch a Nation as that of <hi>England</hi> ought to excite in us a noble ambition to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly faithful to the Firſt, and zealouſly ſubſervient to the Intereſt of the Latter.</p>
            <p>I Recommend to you Gentlemen of the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, the providing for the neceſſary Support of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, you being beſt able to judge what the Charge will be, and it belonging to you of right to provide the means to defray that Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
