            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>1 CHRONICLES xxix. 12.</bibl>
               <q>—<hi>And in thine hand it is to make great.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>GREATNESS is a relative term. It is uſed in different ſenſes, according to the object to which it is applied. When applied to material objects, it is intended to expreſs large extent, or magnitude. When uſed with reference to the human cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or in any intellectual or moral ſenſe, it has a figurative meaning, and implies diſtinguiſhed power, dignity, or excellence. In compariſon with the infinite and eternal God, no created being can be called great. In his glorious preſence the higheſt angels vail their faces, and are chargeable with comparative folly. Much leſs, with reference to him, can any appellation of this kind be applied to man—a being lower than the angelic hoſts—a worm of the duſt, who, before Jehovah, muſt confeſs himſelf to be <hi>nothing, and leſs than nothing, and vanity.</hi> But comparing one race of creatures with another; or, more particularly, comparing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of mankind with their fellow men, we
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037964_0005_100F9DB4E7BFDF70"/>
may, without impropriety, ſpeak of them as great or good, when, of the limited portion of excellence of which their nature admits, they poſſeſs an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſhare. For this uſe of terms we have the example of many paſſages of ſcripture, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of that which is now under conſideration.</p>
            <p>David, the ſervant of God, was equally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as a monarch and a ſaint. His zeal for the worſhip of God led him to conceive the plan of erecting a ſplendid temple to his name: and, although he was not permitted to execute this plan himſelf, nor to ſee it accompliſhed in his day; yet, in conformity to the divine direction, he made large preparation for it before his death, and placed the buſineſs in ſuch a train as rendered the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it a more eaſy taſk for his ſon and ſucceſſor. In making this preparation, the king contributed largely of his own property; and, after having done ſo, to the extent of his ability, he called upon the great men and princes of the land to do the ſame. They complied with his requeſt, with a degree of promptitude, willingneſs, and liberality, which evinced that they poſſeſſed a large portion of the ſame ſpirit which animated their maſter. It was on receiving this liberal contribution from the princes of the land, that David offered up to God the humble and grateful acknowledgments of which our text is a part. <hi>Thine, O Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glory, and the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the majeſty. Both riches and honours come of thee; and in thine hand is power and might; and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037964_0006_100F9DB673A417C0"/>
in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be eaſy to ſhew, in the ſpirit of our text, that every ſpecies of greatneſs, whether in the natural, moral, or political world, comes from God. But inſtead of entering on this wide field, I ſhall confine myſelf to the conſideration of that greatneſs which is ſometimes beſtowed on man. It ſhall, therefore, be my object, in the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to ſhew, THAT WHEN ANY OF THE CHIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREN OF MEN BECOME GREAT, IT IS GOD WHO MAKES THEM SO; and then to apply the ſubject to that ILLUSTRIOUS CHARACTER, for the loſs of whom our country mourns.</p>
            <p>The general truth of the propoſition contained in our text will not, I preſume, be diſputed by any who are now preſent. To a chriſtian audience it cannot be neceſſary to prove, that God is the ſource of all exiſtence, the giver of every faculty, and the author of all promotion. <hi>He made us, and not we ourſelves, and the inſpiration of the Almighty gave us underſtanding. He doth his will and pleaſure in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. Promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth; but God is the Judge; he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> Inſtead, therefore, of dwelling on theſe plain and elementary principles of religion—inſtead of going about formally to prove, that God is the ſource of all human greatneſs, which an aſſembly of believers can never, for a moment, doubt; I ſhall rather
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037964_0007_100F9DB9486F4188"/>
requeſt your attention, while I endeavour to point out ſome of the various <hi>methods</hi> in which he makes men great, and the <hi>means</hi> by which he ordinarily accompliſhes their exaltation.</p>
            <p>As human greatneſs is of different kinds, and appears under a variety of aſpects; ſo the means which infinite Wiſdom uſes to raiſe men to it are alſo different. Sometimes <hi>his path,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them, <hi>is in the deep waters, and his footſteps are not known.</hi> At other times his manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting their advancement is more perceptible and plain. Let us humbly attempt to take ſuch a view of ſome of theſe methods, as may lead us more diligently to ſtudy, and more devoutly to admire the ways of Providence.</p>
            <p>I. God ſometimes makes men great, by <hi>confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon them the advantage of diſtinguiſhed and honourable birth.</hi> This we are particularly led to notice by our context. For we there learn, that the liberality which the royal Pſalmiſt acknowledges in the paſſage before us, was diſplayed by <hi>the Chiefs of the Fathers,</hi> and by <hi>the Princes of the tribes of Iſrael.</hi> Thoſe diſtinctions of birth which are founded upon an <hi>hereditary nobility,</hi> and upon the ſyſtem of <hi>privileged orders,</hi> in general, are happily unknown in our land. I ſay happily, becauſe whatever advantages ſuch diſtinctions may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome to produce, they are generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be alſo productive of multiplied curſes, wherever they exiſt. To be deſcended from the truly great, and the really virtuous, is, indeed,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037964_0008_100F9DBAD7D84750"/>
an honour; but to be able to claim a deſcent from thoſe whoſe elevation is merely artificial and titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is an honour only in the eſtimation of frivolous minds. In fact, ſuch nominal exaltation, when conſidered alone, is ſo far from ſhedding a real glory around the character to which it belongs, that it rather ſerves to render littleneſs more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and frailty or vice more odious. Still, however, God has been pleaſed to permit, in the arrangements of human ſociety, that birth ſhould be the foundation of one ſpecies of eminence. And where this eminence is wiſely improved, like every other diſpenſation of Providence, it may be made an inſtrument of accompliſhing much good, both to the poſſeſſor and to the world.</p>
            <p>When, therefore, the Creator brings men into exiſtence with this diſtinction, and under theſe advantages, he may be ſaid to make them great, becauſe he places them in a conſpicuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible ſituation. He gives them a weight in ſociety, in addition to that ariſing from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal dignity, which they are bound to uſe for his glory and the general happineſs. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they are raiſed above their fellow men, their means of uſefulneſs become more numerous and extended; their virtues become more precious, from the force of elevated example; their vices more poiſonous, from the alluring form in which they are exhibited; and their whole character more important and operative in its relations, by means of the artificial power with which it is inveſted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037964_0009_100F9DBFA3756480"/>
It is ſcarcely neceſſary to add, that this is the loweſt kind of greatneſs with which human beings can be endowed; not only becauſe it is merely nominal; but alſo, and chiefly, becauſe it may, in general, be ſaid to be leſs connected than any other with perſonal excellence. It is an elevation of which the wiſe and the fooliſh, the righteous and the wicked are equally made to partake; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is of ſuch a nature, as that, while it lays thoſe who poſſeſs it under peculiar and ſolemn obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it takes away all pretext of glorying in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>II. God ſometimes makes men great, <hi>by giving them a large portion of this world's goods.</hi> It is an old, and a juſt maxim, that "wealth is power." It gives thoſe who poſſeſs it an importance in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and a capacity for uſefulneſs, which, when properly improved, are ineſtimably precious. When God makes men rich, he places them in a high ſtation. He gives them an influence over their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men. He furniſhes them with the means of promoting happineſs on an extenſive ſcale. It was doubtleſs this, among other ſpecies of greatneſs, which the Pſalmiſt had in view in uttering the words of our text. <hi>The chiefs of the fathers, and the princes of the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> were great by reaſon of their <hi>riches</hi> as well as their <hi>honours.</hi> It was on account of this diſtinction that their pious monarch called upon them to <hi>honour the Lord with their ſubſtance;</hi> and it was, probably, with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, that he acknowledged the hand of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037964_0010_100F9DC254913E58"/>
God in <hi>making great,</hi> and in <hi>giving ſtrength</hi> unto men.</p>
            <p>When, therefore, the Supreme Diſpoſer of all things beſtows on any of our race a large ſhare of this world's goods, he may be ſaid to make them great, provided he alſo beſtow upon them an heart to uſe his gifts with a noble generoſity. For, let it be remembered, that mere wealth, without a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to make that uſe of it which its Giver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, does not conſtitute greatneſs in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the wiſe and the good. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the rich miſer is, of all characters upon earth, and in the view both of God and man, among the moſt deſpicable and mean. There is a littleneſs in his character to which the moſt impoveriſhed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage is incapable of ſinking. It is only to thoſe who have joined to wealth, a benevolent and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit, that the true elevation reſulting from property belongs. There ſeems to be an alluſion to this principle in the prayer of David before us. It is probable, that in calling the princes and chief men of the land great, he had a reſpect, not only to the extent of their poſſeſſions, but alſo to that noble elevation of mind which had prompted them to dedicate a large portion of their wealth to the worſhip and glory of their Almighty Benefactor.</p>
            <p>III. God makes men great, in a ſtill higher ſenſe, by <hi>beſtowing upon them diſtinguiſhed intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual talents.</hi> By his powers of intelligence and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, man is raiſed above the brutal tribes. By his capacity of comparing, diſtinguiſhing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037964_0011_100F9DC41D832918"/>
ideas, and of knowing, ſerving, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, <hi>he is placed a little lower than the angels, and crowned with glory and honour.</hi> The ſmalleſt portion of this intellectual power has a degree of dignity and greatneſs annexed to it, which far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the ſplendours of material magnificence. When we compare mind with body, or mental activity with mere inert matter, the former claims a ſuperiority of the higheſt and moſt important kind.</p>
            <p>But, as our Creator has formed different orders of intelligent beings, ſo he has made beings of the ſame order to differ among themſelves. To ſome he has given ſmall talents; to others greater and more powerful. On thoſe whom he deſigns to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in conſpicuous ſtations, and to make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of extenſive good to the world, he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confers talents of a peculiar and diſtinguiſhed kind. He cauſes them to poſſeſs, in an eminent degree, acuteneſs, of perception, ingenuity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, force of reaſoning, and accuracy and ſoundneſs of judgment. Theſe exalted minds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and deſerve the name of great, becauſe their powers and their activity are extended. They have enlarged and comprehenſive views. They are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of great undertakings. They are qualified to atchieve ſublime enterprizes. To them, in general, belong the deep inveſtigations, the ſplendid diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and the wiſe improvements, which adorn and elevate the character of man. And to them pertains the high prerogative of being ſtudied and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037964_0012_100F9DC6BB148EB8"/>
admired by millions who never ſaw their faces in the fleſh; and of entertaining and enlightening, by the efforts of their genius, diſtant nations and ages.</p>
            <p>It ought, however, to be obſerved, and to be born in mind, that true greatneſs does not conſiſt ſo much in <hi>brilliancy of talents,</hi> as in <hi>ſolidity, ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>perſeverance</hi> of intellectual character. It is not the rapid and noiſy ſtream, but the deep, majeſtic, and ſolemn, which carries all before it. It is not the dazzling meteor, which aſtoniſhes by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of its movements, and affrights by the glare and the ſound of its coruſcations; but it is the ſteady, ſerene, and regularly revolving luminary, that enlightens the world. Who that reads the memoirs of a <hi>Sully</hi> will not pronounce him to have been a far greater man than <hi>Servin,</hi> that prodigy, and even monſter of talents, whoſe character he has recorded. The powers of the latter, indeed, were ſplendid to a degree little ſhort of miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; but they were perverted, proſtituted, and uſeleſs to the world. But the genius of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſublime in its views, practical in its tendency, and perſevering in its exertions, was continually planning and executing the nobleſt enterprizes; and thus was made the inſtrument of diſpenſing countleſs bleſſings to his country, and to mankind.</p>
            <p>IV. God makes men great, <hi>by producing occaſions, and diſpoſing events in ſuch a manner as to call forth and diſplay their talents.</hi> It is an old and familiar maxim, that "occaſions make men." If by this maxim be meant, that a fortuitous concourſe of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037964_0013_100F9DCA9EA4E4F8"/>
cauſes, without the interference of any deſigning agent, creates and raiſes up diſtinguiſhed charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is undoubtedly a ſentiment replete with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. But if it be underſtood to mean, that the Governor of the univerſe makes uſe of great and intereſting occaſions, to rouſe, to expand, and to exhibit the faculties which he has beſtowed, there is every reaſon to ſuppoſe, both on the principles of philoſophy and religion, that the maxim is juſt.</p>
            <p>It is certainly true, that in order to make a great figure on the political, military, or ſcientific ſtage, there muſt be preparatory circumſtances, happy occaſions, and a favourable coincidence of events. What would all the learning and wiſdom of the moſt profound civilian avail him or the world, if no opportunity were afforded him of putting them in practice, or of bringing them, by ſome means, into public view? How could the moſt ſplendid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial talents raiſe the character of their poſſeſſor, if his lot were caſt in a ſeaſon of tranquillity and peace? In ſuch a caſe they muſt terminate in abortive wiſhes, and uſeleſs deſigns. Great powers can only be diſplayed when great exigencies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a field on which they can act. Now great exigencies can happen but ſeldom; and, therefore, thoſe qualities which are moſt worthy of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and eſteemed by mankind, often lie hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, like the treaſures of the undiſcovered mine. The foot paſſes over the golden cavern, as upon common ground, until neceſſity or accident breaks it open, and diſcloſes its precious riches. Hence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037964_0014_100F9DCC29C6E2A0"/>
there can be little doubt, but that multitudes, whoſe lives have glided away in an uſeleſs tenor of ſloth and obſcurity, might have been highly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and eminently uſeful, if an opportunity had preſented for the exertion of their powers.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Full many a gem of pureſt ray ſerene,</l>
               <l>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;</l>
               <l>Full many a flow'r is born to bluſh unſeen,</l>
               <l>And waſte its ſweetneſs on the deſert air.<note n="*" place="bottom">GRAY.</note>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>When God, therefore, deſigns to raiſe up a great man, he diſpoſes occaſions and incidents in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per train for the purpoſe. He makes theſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to operate on the mind of the future hero; and the mind of the hero again, by a kind of moral re-action, to give increaſing greatneſs and intereſt to the ſcenes in which he participates. Hence both may be ſaid, at leaſt in certain ſtages of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, mutually to ſtand in the relation of cauſe and effect to each other. Thus, the age in which men are brought into the world, the circumſtances of their education, the company into which they are thrown, and the events which daily take place around them, may all contribute to form and ſtrengthen the mind. They may, and doubtleſs do, frequently operate as ſo many cauſes to generate talents, to give the taſte and views an elevated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and to impart dignity and energy to the whole character.</p>
            <p>Who that reads the hiſtory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> does not ſee that, humanly ſpeaking, he would have
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037964_0015_100F9DCDB52DA9A8"/>
lived and died unknown, beyond the bounds of a ſmall diſtrict, had not the atchievements of his father <hi>Philip,</hi> and the leſſons of his preceptor <hi>Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle,</hi> fired his ambition; and had not the diviſions and the weakneſs of Perſia preſented an eaſy road to conqueſt and glory? Who that traces the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of the emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> from the rank of a private ſoldier, till he aſcended the imperial throne, can refrain from admiring the myſterious ways of Providence, or can doubt, for a moment, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion is affected by the power of the Moſt High? Had God caſt the lot of the illuſtrious <hi>Charles</hi> of Germany in other times, or in a different ſphere; had other princes ſat upon the neighbouring thrones; or had the period of his reign been leſs diſtracted and critical, would he not, in all probability, have fallen ſilently and unnoticed down the ſtream of time? Nay, to mention a ſtill more ſtriking and familiar inſtance, had the noble enthuſiaſm in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of American Independence burſt forth but half a century earlier or later; or had our glorious emancipation from Britain been accompliſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recurring to arms; is there not every reaſon to believe, that the GREAT MAN, whoſe death we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore, and whoſe memory is embalmed in the hearts of a grateful people, would have been, to the end of his life, nothing more than a reſpectable farmer in Virginia?</p>
            <p>But God not only uſes great and ſplendid occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as means of conducting men to eminence. In his hands the ſmalleſt are ſometimes made produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037964_0016_100F9DD1EC75F928"/>
of ſimilar effects. Diſpenſations of Providence which, at firſt view, appear trifling, often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the purſuits in which men engage; and theſe purſuits are made, by the ſame infinite wiſdom, to diſcloſe the latent energies of the ſoul; to ſtimulate into action the languid powers; to awaken a genius, which, without ſuch events, might have ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever. If we trace the career of ſome of the greateſt men who have ever lived, we ſhall find, that they were raiſed by unexpected means to eminence; and that events, apparently ſmall, were made to accompliſh their exaltation. How often has an accidental interview, of which no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences were foreſeen;—a paſſing civility, by which nothing extraordinary was intended;—or a matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial alliance, from which no material advantage was expected;—how often have trivial events of this kind led to the advancement of men, from private life, to the throne of empire, and to the command of millions!—Who that calculated on the principles of human wiſdom, could have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, that a little domeſtic diſcord would prove the firſt link in a chain of cauſes, to advance <hi>Joſeph</hi> from obſcure retirement to the ſtation of chief ruler over the land of Egypt? Who that followed the ſtripling <hi>David,</hi> when ſent by his father on a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errand to the Iſraelitiſh army, would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, that this youthful ſhepherd was to be led, by ſuch a tranſient viſit, to become the deliverer of his countrymen from the proud Philiſtines, and afterwards an ornament of the Jewiſh throne?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037964_0017_100F9DD5C2C43C98"/>
And, to deſcend to more modern times, how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and unforeſeen the means by which the great <hi>William,</hi> whom Britain ſtiles her <hi>deliverer,</hi> gained the ſovereign power of that kingdom! And how ſmall, and apparently unimportant, the incidents by which the Empreſs <hi>Catharine</hi> roſe, from the loweſt poverty, to wield the ſceptre of the Ruſſias! Theſe, and a thouſand ſimilar inſtances of daily occurrence, prove, that in the hands of God, not only <hi>weak things of the world can be made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the mighty, and fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and things that are not, to bring to nought things which are;</hi> but alſo, that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the moſt feeble, and circumſtances ſcarcely thought worthy of notice, can be made to inſpire with wiſdom, to clothe with power, and to conduct to the higheſt celebrity and honour.</p>
            <p>V. God makes men great, by <hi>giving them the affections and the confidence of their fellow men.</hi> A man may be endowed with great talents—may be enriched with large poſſeſſions—and may be called to act a conſpicuous part on the ſtage of human life, and yet be conſiderably defective in ſome of the attributes of greatneſs. If he cannot obtain the reſpect and attachment of thoſe around him, he fails in an important point. <q>The perfection of glory, ſays a great and admired heathen,<note n="*" place="bottom">CICERO.</note> conſiſts in theſe three particulars, that the people love us, that they have confidence in us, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037964_0018_100F7A86B30A19E0"/>
that being affected with a certain admiration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, they think we deſerve to be honoured.</q> Though this ſentiment proceeds upon principles in ſome degree erroneous, and, therefore, cannot be adopted, in all its extent, by a chriſtian, yet it doubtleſs contains a mixture of truth. To attain the veneration and love of our fellow men, is an important ingredient in earthly greatneſs. It is true, indeed, that ſome of the greateſt and beſt men who have ever lived, were, almoſt wholly, deſtitute of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but would they not, probably, have been greater and more uſeful had they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed this hold on ſurrounding minds? Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in a ſtill higher ſenſe than wealth, is power; and a kind of power highly deſirable, whether we have a reſpect to our own happineſs, or to the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of our ſervices to others. <hi>A good name,</hi> ſays Solomon, <hi>is rather to be choſen than great riches, and loving favour rather than ſilver or gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, when it is the will of God to make a man great, or an inſtrument of doing extenſive good to the world, he uſually gives him the hearts and the confidence of thoſe around him. He ſo orders events, that his actions ſhall appear in a wiſe and dignified point of light, and ſo controuls the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, that they ſhall view all his conduct through a favourable medium. This popularity, when duly improved, has the beſt effects. It is uſeful to thoſe who poſſeſs it. It is, at once, a guard to virtue, and an excitement to duty. A conſciouſneſs that the eyes of the world were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ected
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037964_0019_100F9DDB07A20A60"/>
toward them, and the confidence of the world repoſed in them, has animated the patriot—has fired the hero—and has given riſe to ſome of the moſt ſplendid and uſeful enterprizes that were ever atchieved. But public confidence, while it frequently produces happy effects on thoſe who poſſeſs it, is ſtill more important with reference to their uſefulneſs in the world. The ſphere of their influence is enlarged, in proportion to the degree in which they enjoy the good opinion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in which they reſide. Men liſten with a willing ear, and with favourable prepoſſeſſions, to a teacher whom they honour. Their affectionate attachment adds weight to his example, and gives authority to his counſel. Hence his exertions to do them good are more effectual than thoſe of others, becauſe they enter with readineſs into the ſpirit of his plans, and cheerfully co-operate with him in his benevolent labours.—Seldom has any people ſeen a more illuſtrious inſtance than we have witneſſed, of the influence of a BELOVED NAME on the public mind. We have ſeen it unite the affections and the counſels of thoſe who would, in all probability, have been otherwiſe divided. We have ſeen it, more efficacious than the exertions of official power, repreſs the murmurings, calm the fears, and conciliate the confidence of the diſcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and deſponding in the moſt trying times.</p>
            <p>VI. Laſtly, God makes men great, <hi>by adorning their hearts with virtue and holineſs.</hi> This is the topſtone of the edifice of human promotion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037964_0020_100F9DDDA4F65760"/>
which the whole ſtructure is imperfect. Let a man poſſeſs all the talents, the wealth, and the honours which a human being can enjoy, or which a grateful people can beſtow; yet if his boſom do not expand with benevolence, and his heart do not reflect the moral image of his Creator, <hi>Tekel</hi> muſt be written upon all his greatneſs. What the light and the genial warmth of the ſun are to the natural world, <hi>the beauty of holineſs</hi> is to the ſoul. It ſheds a glory over all the faculties of man. It forms that <hi>divinity of nature</hi> which renders rational beings like God; and which conſtitutes their fitneſs for the pure joys of his preſence.</p>
            <p>It muſt be allowed, indeed, that many of thoſe whom the world has called great, and who, in ſome reſpects, deſerved the name, have been deſtitute of this moſt noble of all diſtinctions. Their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was wholly ſelfiſh. Their views, though comprehenſive, were terminated by the preſent ſtate. Their activity was rather a curſe than a bleſſing to mankind. The characters of the moſt mighty conquerors, when viewed through a proper medium, exhibit a degree of moral debaſement, from which humanity, to ſay nothing of religion, turns away with abhorrence and ſhame. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wiſh of that great heart, for which the whole earth did not afford ſufficient objects of conqueſt, was, after all, to be praiſed by the Athenians. And the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and <hi>Pompeys</hi> of our race have waded to glory through the tears and the blood of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:037964_0021_100F9DDF36A107F8"/>
But when the Supreme Diſpoſer of all things deſigns to raiſe men to the higheſt pinnacle of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he adds to every other ſpecies of elevation that ſublimity of virtue which ſanctifies talents; that diſintereſted benevolence which gives a dignity to the character; and that transformation of the whole man into the image of God, which raiſes the ſoul from earth to heaven. Man never appears in ſo truly noble and honourable a point of view, as when his faculties are directed to their proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and all his powers conſecrated to the divine work of <hi>doing good.</hi> The hero in virtue is as much ſuperior to the hero in conqueſt as the heavens are higher than the earth, or as light excelleth darkneſs. How little did a <hi>Darius,</hi> an <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and a <hi>Nero,</hi> appear in compariſon with a DANIEL and a PAUL, even when theſe holy men were ſtanding in bonds before them! How much does the character of an HOWARD riſe above the moſt powerful monarch, or the moſt renowned deſtroyer of his ſpecies, in all his glory! To deviſe and execute plans for leſſening the miſeries, and promoting the happineſs of man, was <hi>his meat and his drink.</hi> For him no tears ſlowed but the tears of gratitude and love. For him the lips of the widow, the fatherleſs, and the priſoner, were opened in ſecret benediction. And future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall riſe up and call him bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Such is the greatneſs of him whoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is enlightened with divine knowledge, and whoſe heart is warmed with holy love. His ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents are no longer devoted to the narrow plans of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037964_0022_100F9DE1E81E9588"/>
ſelfiſhneſs, but move in a wider ſphere, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a more extenſive horizon. His ambition, lately confined to temporal aggrandiſement, now takes an higher aim. Inſtead of temporal wealth and honours, he ſeeks heavenly treaſures, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of God, and the honour of advancing his glory. Inſtead of thirſting after conqueſt and deſtruction, his boſom is animated with the noble deſire of promoting univerſal happineſs. His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, no longer bounded by names or terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, embraces the whole family of God. His hopes, inſtead of terminating in the purſuits of earth, riſe to the moſt noble, ſublime, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent objects in the univerſe. And his enlarged ſoul can now be ſatisfied with nothing, as his ſupreme good, but infinite excellence, and <hi>an eternal weight of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have thus attempted, brethren, to lay before you a brief ſketch of ſome of the various means by which God raiſes men to diſtinction and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs To fill up the outline which has been given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a more particular recurrence to details and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, muſt be left to your own meditations. In the mean time, I would requeſt your attention to a few of the numerous practical leſſons which this ſubject ſuggeſts to the ſerious mind. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are obvious and important:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the doctrine which has been delivered be juſt, then great men have no reaſon to glory in themſelves; nor are others at liberty to ſet them up as idols. <hi>Who made them to differ from others?
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037964_0023_100F9DE37421DEF8"/>
and what have they that they did not receive? If, therefore, they have received all they poſſeſs, why ſhould they glory as if they had not received it?</hi> The truth is, the doctrine of our total dependence on God, for our exiſtence, and for every power and enjoyment connected with it, removes, at one ſtroke, all ground of pride and ſelf-confidence in man. The moſt ingenious, honourable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, are nothing more than JEHOVAH'S inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and, therefore, to HIM is ultimately due all the honour of their great and good actions. In contemplating, then, the virtues and ſervices of diſtinguiſhed men, it becomes us to adopt the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the inſpired Pſalmiſt: <hi>From thee, O Lord, both riches and honours come; and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all. Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it true that it belongs to God to make great? Then when thoſe who have been raiſed to high diſtinction, and made eminently uſeful in the world, are taken away, we are taught, by this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, not to indulge in anxiety or deſpair. The ſame God who raiſed them up, who girded them with ſtrength, who inſpired them with wiſdom, and who fitted them for the ſphere in which they moved, ſtill lives, and will forever live. He can qualify others, at his pleaſure, to take their places, and to act in the various exigencies which may ariſe. For every criſis which occurs in human affairs, he has his infinitely wiſe plan laid, and his inſtruments
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037964_0024_100F9DE614144240"/>
prepared, to do his will, in every part of the ſcene. And from even ſtocks and ſtones he can raiſe up agents to accompliſh his purpoſes. Brethren, how conſoling the thought that we live under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch a God! What though the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our admiration and love be taken away? What though inſtruments on which our hopes were placed, be unexpectedly removed from the ſtage? <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice, let the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the iſles be glad thereof!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If the view which has been given of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be juſt, then how awfully reſponſible is the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of thoſe whom God has made great!<note n="*" place="bottom">This inference, though in the original copy, was omitted in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the diſcourſe, as were ſeveral preceding and ſubſequent para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, for want of time.</note> 
               <hi>Unto whomſoever much is given, of them will much be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and to whom God has committed much, of them will he aſk the more.</hi> I ſpeak to all ſuch within my hearing—to the rich, the ingenious, the learned, and the honourable. Ye great ones of the earth! your Creator has made you eminent among men. He has put into your hands many talents. He has given you a weight in ſociety, and an influence over thoſe around you, which enable you to do extenſive good, and to bring a large ſum of glory to his name. And let me remind you, that for the uſe which you make of all theſe advantages, <hi>he will bring you into judgment.</hi> What improvement, then, are you making of your diſtinctions and your talents? Dreadful, indeed, will be your reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037964_0025_100F9DEAF9D7E068"/>
if you be found, either to have buried them in ſloth and inaction, or to have perverted them to the unhallowed purpoſes of ſin. In ſuch a caſe, better had it been for you to creep through life with the moſt obſcure and mean of your ſpecies; or rather that <hi>you had never been born.</hi> Be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then, to conſider the deſign for which you were raiſed to eminence, and the obligations which it lays upon you. Study to be great in virtue, in holineſs, in zeal for the glory of God and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, as well as in the objects of temporal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. Thus will your elevation prove a bleſſing to yourſelves and to mankind. Thus will the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient honours of earth be but introductory to higher honours—to the ſceptres and thrones of glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the juſt, in <hi>a better country, that is, on heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This ſubject teaches us to honour thoſe whom God makes the inſtruments of great good to the world: When he honours them, it is our duty to do the ſame: and if, in doing this, we act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the impreſſion, and upon the principle, that they are his inſtruments, we ultimately glorify him thereby.</p>
            <p>And here permit me to apply the ſubject on which we have been meditating, to the character of that ILLUSTRIOUS MAN, on account of whoſe death the emblem of ſorrow ſhrouds this ſacred deſk, and for the loſs of whom we behold the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſpectacle of a nation mourning.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention, brethren, to ſubject you
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037964_0026_100F9DEC87CB3958"/>
to the pain of hearing the language of ſervility and adulation with reſpect to this venerable Perſonage. To ſay nothing of other conſiderations, ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage would be peculiarly inconſiſtent and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable after the doctrine which has been delivered. But I truſt it will be unneceſſary to prove, before this audience, that we are called, in duty, to take a particular notice of this ſolemn diſpenſation of Providence. It is our happineſs, and our boaſt, that we live under a government in which the voice of the people is the ſupreme law; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the approbation and applauſe of this voice, ſhould be offered as the reward of long and faithful ſervices to the people. Let it never be ſaid that republicans are ungrateful. Let us teſtify, by our conduct, that we perceive the difference between the oſtentatious pomp and mockery of grief, which attend the demiſe of tyrants; and the ardent ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous affection with which a grateful people can cheriſh and honour the memory of a patriot and benefactor.</p>
            <p>You will not conſider me, in the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as attempting to draw, at full length, the character of this diſtinguiſhed Man. This is a taſk which, as it would be too arduous, is alſo, happily, unneceſſary. The record of his virtues and his ſervices, is ſo deeply impreſſed on your hearts; his great actions form ſo ſplendid an object in our hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and the bleſſings flowing from them to his country are ſo numerous and extenſive, that I am perſuaded the feelings of your hearts, this day,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037964_0027_100F9DEF5C6CEAA0"/>
form his beſt eulogium. But you will indulge me while I endeavour, in a few ſentences, to recal to your view ſome of thoſe conſiderations, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a tribute of gratitude and reſpect to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory from the American people.</p>
            <p>Our beloved and deplored WASHINGTON was, emphatically, A MAN WHOM GOD HAD MADE GREAT. Without the tinſel ornament of titled nobility—without the advantage of what is called diſtinguiſhed and honourable birth, he was raiſed by the Governor of the world to a degree of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which the hiſtory of man has furniſhed but few examples. He was not, indeed, endowed with thoſe brilliant and dazzling talents, which many erroneouſly imagine to be alone eſtimable. His mind was of an higher order. Providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him to move in a ſphere in which a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied prudence, ſoundneſs of judgment, firmneſs, ſelf command, and uniformity, were eſpecially need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and, therefore, theſe were the leading features of his character. With theſe reſpectable powers he entered, at an early period of life, on the career of military glory, againſt ſavage invaders; and, even then, gave the moſt deciſive and honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his future greatneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the year 1755 he ſuſtained the rank of Colonel in the Virginia forces, being then only twenty-three years of age. In this rank he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied Gen. Braddock in the celebrated expedition in which that officer was defeated and loſt his life. On this occaſion he was expoſed to imminent danger, and diſplayed great bravery and military ſkill. It is ſaid to have been owing, humanly ſpeaking, to his advice not being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the dreadful cataſtrophe took place. And when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief had fallen, it was chiefly by his addreſs and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that the broken remains of the army were brought off the field.</p>
                  <p>A few weeks ſubſequent to the above-mentioned event, the Rev <hi>Samuel Davies,</hi> afterwards Preſident of the College of New-Jerſey, and then ſettled in Virginia, was called upon to preach before an indepen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent company of volunteers, which had juſt been raiſed, and which was about to march againſt the ſame foe. In the courſe of his ſermon he took notice, with approbation, of the martial ardour which his hearers diſcovered; and, afterward, when the diſcourſe was printed, he added, in a note, the following remarkable words: "As an inſtance of this, I may point out to the public that heroic youth Col. WASHINGTON, whom I cannot but hope Providence has hitherto preſerved in ſo ſignal a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for ſome important ſervice to his country."</p>

When the encroachments and oppreſſions of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prompted our countrymen to throw off her yoke—when a few infant colonies roſe up to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with a gigantic, rapacious, and haughty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, you ſaw him ſtep forth, their patriotic leader, in aſſerting their precious rights, and in braving all the ills of a perilous and doubtful conflict. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though little verſed in the art of war; though placed at the head of a raw and undiſciplined army; though contending with ſkilled, veteran, and more powerful foes, you ſaw his wiſdom, his perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and his valour, riſe ſuperior to the moſt formidable difficulties. You ſaw him lead on his fellow-citizens, from time to time, to conqueſt and triumph; until the fair fabric of Independence was completely reared over the tomb of tyranny.</p>
            <p>To preſent an adequate view of the ſervices which he rendered his country during this arduous ſtruggle, would be to give, in detail, a principal part of the hiſtory of the revolution. His talents, as a military commander, were not ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037964_0029_100F9DF5A1780610"/>
by the number or the magnitude of the battles which he won, nor by "marching over thouſands and tens of thouſands who had fallen by his victorious ſword;" as by his addreſs, in making the moſt of the feeble force which he led; by preventing the effuſion of blood; by ſkilful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions and movements; by exhauſting the ſtrength of his foes; by wiſe delay, and avoiding deciſive actions, where they could only be hurtful; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the weakneſs of his army, not only from his opponents, but from his own ſoldiery them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and, finally, by availing himſelf, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable diſcernment, of ſeaſons and opportunities to make an effectual impreſſion on the enemy. The raſh and unthinking, who eſtimate the talents of a general only by the multitudes he has deſtroyed, the cities he has ſacked, and the extent of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation which he has produced, may be ready to imagine that ſuch a picture affords little evidence of a high military character. But the ſober and reflecting, who conſider his peculiar ſituation, the ſmall extent of his reſources, and the formidable difficulties with which he had to contend, will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation, pronounce the Leader of our revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary army one of the moſt reſpectable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of ancient or modern times.</p>
            <p>You will not underſtand me as intending to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to this favourite Hero all the honour of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our deliverance from a foreign yoke. Many illuſtrious men, no doubt, ſhared largely with him in the burdens and the honours of thoſe trying
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037964_0030_100F9DF72CF46470"/>
But his pre-eminent ſervices in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our glorious revolution, have been univerſally acknowledged, and have long been the theme of wonder and eulogium in both hemiſpheres. Who was it that, under God, encouraged our ſuffering army, raiſed their drooping ſpirits, and cemented their affections and their ſtrength, in the moſt gloomy criſes? Who was it that, by his prudence and his fortitude, eluded the ſnares which were laid for his feeble bands, and conducted them, by unexpected means, to victory and glory? Ye pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots of ſeventy-ſix and ſeventy-ſeven! Ye who witneſſed the hardſhips, the dangers, and the diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that memorable period, do not your hearts, big with mighty emotions, reſponſive ſay, It was HE? Yes; under the direction of the GOD OF ARMIES, it was, indeed, HE. There was a majeſty, and, I will add, if the expreſſion may be allowed, a magic in his preſence, which diſpelled fear, which inſpired confidence, and which commanded the veneration of enemies themſelves.</p>
            <p>When the independence of his country was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, you ſaw him, like Cincinnatus, retiring to his farm, and, with a magnanimity even greater than he had diſplayed in military atchievements, exchanging the character of the ſoldier for that of the citizen. When the voice of his fellow-citizens again called him into public view, you ſaw him, obedient to their command, quitting, a ſecond time, his beloved retirement, and putting his ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and untarniſhed reputation to hazard on the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037964_0031_100F9DF9D8484730"/>
field of political conflict. It is probable that, on the day when he accepted the chair of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States, no mortal ever had the applauſe and the admiration of ſo large a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind ſo unanimouſly enliſted in his favour.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the adminiſtration of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Friend and Father, as a civil magiſtrate, it is, perhaps, impoſſible, at preſent, to make up an impartial opinion. The tendencies and effects of ſome of his meaſures, poſterity only can fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate. That there is leſs unanimity among his countrymen with reſpect to theſe, than with reſpect to his military ſervices, you need not to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It ſhould always, however, be remembered, that he was called to the helm of ſtate only a ſhort time before the gathering of a ſtorm in the political world, which has ſubverted the works of ages, which ſtill ſhakes Europe to its centre, and of which no one can eſtimate the conſequences, or ſee the end. Many of the conjunctures in which it became his duty to decide, and to act, were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently critical, arduous, and embarraſſing. To explore the untried intereſts of an infant empire, and to ſelect the ſafeſt connexions abroad, when the civilized world had, almoſt univerſally, riſen in arms, was ſurely a taſk of magnitude, of peril, and of doubt. Nor is it wonderful that, at ſuch a period, the feelings and paſſions of his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſhould be tremblingly alive to the impreſſion of public meaſures; or that the human mind, weak
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037964_0032_100F9DFCAE67F970"/>
fallible, and variouſly modified as it is, ſhould ruſh to oppoſite concluſions. Recollections of this kind cannot fail to ſoften the aſperities of party, and to ſuggeſt an apology, both for the miſtakes which have been imputed to the illuſtrious Deceaſed, and for the warmth of many who differed from him in opinion. And it is pleaſing, and, in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, honourable to his memory, to obſerve, that, amidſt all the diverſity of ſentiment, and the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion of parties; amidſt all the mutual accuſations of foreign influence and domeſtic corruption, which have, unhappily, agitated our country, his integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity has remained unimpeached and unſuſpected. Even thoſe who believe his political errors to have been moſt numerous, have yet acknowledged, that they were the errors of a mind actuated by the pureſt motives, and purſuing, with undeviating rectitude of intention, the public good.</p>
            <p>Many of thoſe great men who have dazzled the world with the ſplendour of their actions, and who commenced their courſe with profeſſions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded attachment to liberty, have ſeized the firſt opportunity to uſurp power, and have proved the worſt of tyrants. The hiſtory of a <hi>Cromwell</hi> is the hiſtory of many deceivers and falſe patriots. But the MAN whoſe memory we delight to honour was never liable to this charge. You never ſaw him thruſt himſelf forward unſolicited to public view, nor court an admiſſion to places of truſt and authority. On the contrary, he was always brought forward by the unanimous and importunate voice
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037964_0033_100F9E009053BFA0"/>
of a grateful people. He availed himſelf of no opportunity that was preſented to gratify ambition, or to promote his perſonal aggrandizement. He ſeemed to hold the commiſſions of his country for no other end than to do it good; and inſtantly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered them, when the object for which they were conferred was accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Singular ſucceſs, and extended fame, have been too often found to make even ſtrong minds ſelf-confident and vain-glorious. A ſucceſsful general of antiquity, in recounting his numerous victories, when he came to ſpeak of one diſtinguiſhed above all the reſt, boaſted, "In <hi>this,</hi> Fortune" (the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary deity to whom he had conceded ſome agency in the former inſtances) "had no ſhare." The Hero of America furniſhed an example ſo remarkably of an oppoſite kind, that his magnanimity was not leſs diſplayed in his manner of bearing proſperity, and receiving applauſe, than in accompliſhing the moſt important enterprizes of his public life. Neither the ſucceſs of his great undertakings, nor the voice of univerſal praiſe, were found to diminiſh his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, retiring modeſty, or to ſeduce him from the remembrance of human weakneſs. On the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God he took every opportunity of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a firm reliance; and to Divine goodneſs and aid he never failed of aſcribing the glory of every favourable event.</p>
            <p>Of the various kinds of greatneſs to which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings aſpire, you have heard that moral he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm is the moſt worthy of our ambition. The
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037964_0034_100F9E0219FB0810"/>
laurels which virtue beſtows are more precious than crowns and ſceptres. <hi>He that is ſlow to anger,</hi> ſays the wiſe man, <hi>is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city.</hi> But how ſeldom have the proud favourites of fame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to recognize or regard this truth! How often, perhaps it may be ſaid, how generally, have the ſplendid and commanding talents of great men been joined with degrading paſſions, and the meaneſt vices! The ties of juſtice, of benevolence, and of gratitude have been violated, for the ſake of accompliſhing their magnificent but ſelfiſh plans. A decided exception to this general character is a rare phaenomenon in hiſtory. You have, doubtleſs, gone before me in making an application of theſe remarks. The patriotic citizen, to whoſe memory we are paying this tribute of reſpect, furniſhed ſuch an exception. His private deportment correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſplendour of his public reputation. Amidſt the din of arms, and the weighty cares of office, he was not unmindful of the virtues which became him as a man. His ear was ever open to the voice of humanity; and his attention to the various duties of ſocial and relative life was digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and exemplary.</p>
            <p>It is not uncommon for the moſt diſtinguiſhed heroes to end their lives in neglect and obſcurity, after a high career of celebrity and honour. To the long and humiliating catalogue of the evils at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on old age, which moral and ſatirical writers have given, we may generally add the diminution,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037964_0035_100F9E04B26A4BB8"/>
if not the total loſs of fame.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> But from this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral law our beloved and admired Hero was in a great meaſure exempted. He retained the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his countrymen, and the admiration of the world, to the end of life. He deſcended to the grave full of years, loaded with honours, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with glory. And though his mortal part is conſigned to the tomb, yet we have every day freſh reaſon to believe that his reputation will live, and his name be pronounced with enthuſiaſtic ardour among diſtant generations.</p>
            <p>Such was the MAN whoſe death we this day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore. Citizens of America! let his memory be ever dear, and ever honoured among you. Tell to your children, and to your children's children, what great things God has accompliſhed, through him, for your country. Tell them of his love of liberty. Tell them of his long, faithful, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant exertions to eſtabliſh her ſtandard in our land. Tell them how he lived, and how he died; that, like him, ſhould the voice of national danger again call, they may be ready to ſtep forth in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their rights, and prove themſelves worthy of the deſcent which they boaſt.</p>
            <p>And you, ye youths of America! behold the example which has been this day ſet before you; and let a generous ambition fire your boſoms. It
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037964_0036_100F9E0757F7F0C8"/>
would be extravagant encomium to hold up our departed CHIEF to your view as an example abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect, or to repreſent him as concentrating all poſſible excellence in his character. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminate and exceſſive praiſe, when applied to any mortal, however it may be intended, muſt have the effect of ſatire in diſguiſe. But he, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, left an example, ſo unuſually illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, as to furniſh a fit object for your aſpiring imitation. Go then, beloved youths! learn of him to conſecrate your talents to the public good. Learn of him to love freedom, the birthright of man, and to be always ready to ſacrifice your lives in defence of your country's rights. Learn of him to maintain that ſelf-command, dignity, and order of conduct, which are ſo eſſential to ſocial welfare. And, finally, learn of him to carry to the end of life, that conſiſtent and uniform attachment to principle, for which he was ſo eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
            <p>And thou, ILLUSTRIOUS SHADE! father, friend, and benefactor, farewell! Ever will we cheriſh and honour thy memory. Thy virtues and thy ſervices ſhall be remembered while gratitude has a place in our boſoms, and while this land continues to be the abode of freemen, who know how to eſtimate the value of that liberty, which has been purchaſed and ſealed with blood. Over thy grave we promiſe, in dependence on the aid of Him who alone can give ſtrength, that we will never forſake the principles for which thou haſt fought, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037964_0037_100F9E0A1771F018"/>
which animated thee to thy lateſt hour. While we watch, with filial affection, around thy ſleeping duſt, we will guard, with ever growing zeal, that fair political inheritance which was thy glory and thy joy.</p>
            <p>Finally, my brethren, we learn from this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and from the ſolemn diſpenſation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which we have been contemplating, what is the end of all earthly greatneſs.
