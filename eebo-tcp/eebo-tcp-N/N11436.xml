            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PART I.</head>
            <p>MY regard for the good of my country is ſuch, that I cannot be ſilent at this alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing criſis, when party prejudices are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to an extreme: And as when our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical debates have enſnared and confounded the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, rather than informed and enlightened them; and have engaged them in a dangerous political en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm; when by fraud or otherwiſe, many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the utmoſt concern were omitted. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſk your calm and diſpaſionate enquiry and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſome intereſting conſiderations and ſpecial remarks; which if read and examined with candor, may ſerve to calm unruly paſſions, and lead you to form ſome juſt ſentiments on the controverſy. I hope for your approbation, and that I ſhall ever be eſteemed as a ſincere friend to our liberties, and the good of my country; and as one who has ever been againſt all unjuſt incroachments on our rights and privileges, or a tame ſubmiſſion to acts of parliament that might ſubject us to an unlimited power of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as one who would gladly ſee a juſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014462_0003_0F92B1055C5CF0C8"/>
of what is due to the king as our ſovereign, and to us as his loyal and free ſubjects. It is to be lamented that the populace have been ſo ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the moſt fatal and daring enterprizes; and that a good cauſe had ſuffered ſo much by the imprudence of our advocates. There are ſome who indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately condemn all the whigs, for the fault of ſome popular zealo's, who, from the beginning have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and miſled the populace; and with the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhew of patriotiſm have retained the lead in our public affairs, (which was the ſource and origin of our preſent diſtreſſes) and have in our late times of general diſcontent and confuſion, increaſed their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by ſhewing contempt to government, and by invectives againſt thoſe who were for moderate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; repreſenting them as enemies to their country. But ſuch proceedings can never be of any real bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to us. We have indeed good reaſon to diſpiſe them, who, for their own private emolument, would give up the rights and liberties of their country; and to reſpect and revere thoſe, who, from a regard for the ſafety of it, and juſt ſentiments of government, have endeavored to convince us of our danger, and ſubmitted to become unpopular and loſe their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſociety by it: And have not the moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and judicious of our ſons of liberty, diſallowed all ſuch proceedings, and hoped to ſee ſome juſt and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate propoſals originate in our aſſemblies or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, for an accommodation? But what may we now expect from a view of our affairs? We find that his majeſty, who has been our kind protector, conſiders us as guilty of acts of violence of a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nature. And can we ſuppoſe that the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the continental congreſs, will afford us relief, or that they duly conſidered what was recommended to them by the grand committee, met at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014462_0004_0F92B105985D8C80"/>
in July laſt, "which was for the Colonies to propoſe the payment of a certain annual revenue to his majeſty; and damages for the tea deſtroyed, in order to procure his majeſty's favor." And now pray conſider whether their aſſociation and reſolves will have ſuch influence in our favor as to excite in the houſe of commons, ſuch ſpirited exertions, as may procure a repeal of their late acts; or whether our late violent proceedings will not rather unite them more firmly againſt us, and cauſe the miniſterial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, to terminate in a national one? And have we not reaſon to fear that the late addreſs of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental congreſs and their ſpirited meaſures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, will induce the king and parliament to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as founded on republican principles; and that their deſigns were to become independent or ſomething more, as they have aſſmed to be arbiters for Quebec? And has what our delegates called an humble petition from faithful ſubjects, propoſed any one conciliating meaſure, or addreſſed his majeſty with thoſe tender and dutiful regards which might be expected from dependent and loyal ſubjects; or offered to palliate for our public offences, or for the deſtroying of private property, that occaſioned the king and parliament to go into ſome ſpirited mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; or have they propoſed a ſubmiſſion to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any one inſtance? And does not the ſame ſpirit appear in their addreſs, that prevailed in their approving the precipitate reſolves of the county of Suffolk? Therefore I think that you cannot be at a loſs, but may juſtly conclude, that their deſigns were, (as one of their delegates ſaid) to excite fear rather than other regards. And did they not in faithfulneſs to his majeſty lay many grievous things to his charge, exculpating the Colonies from all offences, except it was one to be ſenſible of injuries? And ſuch was the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014462_0005_0F92B1061851BD10"/>
abſurd credulity of the people in the Colonies that they generally approved their proceedings before they knew what they were. And can you ſuppoſe that their addreſs, with formal profeſſions of duty, loyalty, humility and affection to his majeſty, and the moſt ſolemn appeal in reſpect to their purity of intention, integrity of conduct and dread of deſtruction; with their propoſals for harmony and free intercourſe (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly); and their alarm of danger to his majeſty's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms (by their aſſociation) will ſo awaken his fears, or excite his compaſſion, as to procure the abolition of theſe acts, and his royal favor? Or, that our da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reſiſtance to law, and violence of a criminal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with our unlawful combinations, will be paſſed over with impunity?</p>
            <p>Our affairs begin to wear a dangerous aſpect; the weapons of deſtruction are prepared for action: And what horrors and diſtreſs muſt attend a civil war; where friends and relations are oppoſed to each other. And it may not be amiſs for you to look back and conſider how little regard has been paid to what our beſt advocates have ſaid, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Farmer, Mr. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, Lord Chatham, and others, with reſpect to our ſubordination to the parliament. "That the greater muſt rule the latter, that we are but parts of the whole; and that the power of parliament may be juſtly exerciſed to preſerve a ſubordination, and to reſtrain our trade and manufactures; and that the king, lords and commons, have power to paſs a bill of attainder and take away our charter; and that their power is abſolute and unaccountable. And that it is juſt that every part of an empire, defended by its power, ſhould bear a proportion of the charges according to their ability." Have we not diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and all advice for moderate meaſures, and acted in oppoſition to the laws of our province, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014462_0006_0F92B106D29DB388"/>
private property, aſſaulted and abuſed his majeſty's liege ſubjects, ſuppreſſed his courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and new formed his militia? And all on account of taxes laid upon us by the king and parliament, (for our proportion of the charges for national de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) and to keep up an oppoſition to other acts of parliament, for ſhutting up Boſton harbour, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that there can be no taxation without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and that the demands for it were unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſince 1763; which occaſioned many polemical debates; not ſo much with reſpect to the juſtice of the demand, as about the legality of it. For Mr. Dulany ſaid, that at the planting of the Colonies, protection and obedience were conſidered as reciprocal duties. I ſhall further obſerve, that the colony charters, granted under different kings, were of various forms. And that one large colony is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt only from taxes, other than what are raiſed by their own legiſlators, <hi>or by the parliament,</hi> but the times are ſuch, that they alſo zealouſly oppoſe all taxes by parliament. And of another colony it is ſaid, that they are by charter exempt from all taxes, other than by their own legiſlators, and that by our province charter we have no exemption from taxes though ſpecially apply'd for by our agents before it was granted; and that ſenſible of the omiſſion, it was the earlieſt care of the province, to form and paſs a bill of rights or proteſt againſt all taxes, other than what ſhould be raiſed by our legiſlators, which was not ſo fortunate as to meet with their majeſties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and left room for after debates. And there are thoſe who ſay, that as the king cannot tax his ſubjects but by conſent of parliament, ſo neither can he emancipate them at his pleaſure from their proportion of the general charges of the nation. Whence you may obſerve that the claim or right of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014462_0007_0F92B10795B66920"/>
taxation, is not novel or of ſo late a date as ſome have ſuggeſted. But the ſcene is now ſo far chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the legality or juſtice of the demand, are not the only points under conſideration; but whether, we ſhall be ſubordinate to the parliament or not? I preſume that it is not yet too late for us who are to be actors in the conteſt, to ſeriouſly conſider and determine with reſpect to a change of meaſures; and the ſeveral duties of obedience, protection and gratitude for paſt favors; and of benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fellow-ſubjects. And I hope the time will ſoon come when our Revd. patriots will as aſſiduouſly uſe the drum eccleſiaſtic, to enforce thoſe duties, as it has been for oppoſition to government. And in order for your forming juſt ideas of the ſtate of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, I deſire that you will from the following ſtate of facts, duly conſider, how far they lay us under an obligation to the performance of theſe duties.</p>

            <p>THE Colonies long groaned under wars occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the French in Canada, which have been very expenſive and diſtreſſing. It has been computed that in New-England only, more than ten thouſand of our beſt youths died in theſe wars; by the enemy, ſickneſs, &amp;c. And it alſo hinder'd our population, which at a common rate, might have doubled every twenty five years. For it is ſaid that in 1762, our numbers had not doubled in forty years; and that in 1722, they had not in fifty years. And let us alſo look back and conſider our fears and dangers about twenty one years ago, when we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pray'd for his Majeſty's aſſiſtance, as appears by repeated reſolves and addreſſes, ſome of which are as follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr> one formed by the congreſs at Albany, July 9th 1754, when the commiſſioners ſaid, "That it was the evident deſign of the French to ſurround the Britiſh Colonies; and with a ſtrong naval force to make a general attack; and that there was the utmoſt danger that the whole continent would be ſubjected to the crown of France." And of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of our general aſſembly, and of our council, to Gov. Shirley, in 1754, when they with other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the like effect, ſaid, "The French have made ſuch incroachments and taken ſuch meaſures as threaten great danger, and perhaps in time, even the deſtruction of this province. And we apprehend it is impoſſible in the preſent diſtreſſed circumſtances of the province, to maintain a force neceſſary for our defence; and therefore we humbly rely on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's paternal goodneſs, through the interpoſition of you excellency's good offices for aſſiſtance." And what Virginia in the addreſs of their aſſembly to his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014462_0009_0F92B10E0D583E98"/>
Majeſty ſaid, "The deſigns of the French upon our frontiers, if not timely oppoſed, muſt be attended with the moſt fatal conſequences; we have granted 10,000l for our defence, which though not ſufficient, is the utmoſt that out people are able to bear. We therefore moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your royal beneficence to us your loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects." Which ſhews the language of poor diſtreſſed Colonies, <hi>(though not of high and mighty ſtates)</hi> and that we were then dependent on his Majeſty's favor for protection. And ſince we are by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's gracious interpoſition, made free from thoſe, or the like dangers or diſtreſſes, let us under a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of his favors and protection, and of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the ſlaviſh yoke of Canada, but duly requite him for them; and further, conſider that ſince Canada wars are ended, we may enjoy peace and quiet; and that our labourers may be better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by three days labour in a week, than the like labourers in England, by ſix days labour. And that we have already paid off our public debts; and that England has not been able to pay one tenth part of their's in the like term; and that their army and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, do coſt annually, more than twice ſo much as the land tax of England, at three ſhilling on the pound; and that beſides the vaſt charges for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and army, and for embaſſadors, conſuls, &amp;c. (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral charges) and of penſioners, &amp;c. England pays intereſt for ſeventy millions that was due before the laſt war, and for more than ſixty millions expended by it: And that the laſt war was begun and the charges greatly increaſed for our protection, and to ſettle the diſpute between our Colonies and Canada: Which may further lead us to conſider, whether we have not been miſled even to the brink of ruin; and whether we ſhall yet ſuffer thoſe who have ſought
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014462_0010_0F92B10F2A735EE0"/>
popularity more than the good of their country (whoſe cauſe is deſperate) to engage us, by deluſive dreams and idle ſuggeſtions to follow them down the precipice: And whether what our delegates in the continental congreſs called humble and reaſonable petitions from the Colonies, were not conceived in ſuch terms as were affrontive to the King and parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a denial of their power, rather than ſuch as were likely to promote an accommodation. War and bloodſhed ſeems now to be the unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of what are called violent proceedings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will not conſcious guilt ſtare us in the face, if we ſhall engage in oppoſition to government before ſatisfaction is made for the tea deſtroyed, and for our protection. And let us uſe our influence every one in his ſtation, to ſuppreſs all violent meaſures, and for promoting peace and good order, and a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with our mother ſtate of which we ought not to deſpair; for Mr. Burke, in his late addreſs to the city of Briſtol, ſaid, "That to reconcile Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional <hi>ſuperiority</hi> with American <hi>liberty</hi> ſhould be his endeavor to the utmoſt of his power in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in his opinion might be preſerved even yet: And that it was neceſſary for both.</p>
            <p>And let us conſider, whether our honor in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with that of Great-Britain, ought to take place; and whether it would have been an indignity to the Colonies, to have offered terms for adjuſting the diſpute.—I am not able to determine, how far we can ſupport an oppoſition to the King and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; but thus much I may aſſert, that if violent meaſures ſhall take place, our mighty ſtates will ſoon be ruined, by their power: Or can it be ſuppoſed, that people in general will be ſo infatuated as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the extraordinary interpoſitions of divine providence in our favor. Let us rely on his Majeſty's

The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies have lately given a pompous account of their numbers, but are they able to pay one thirtieth part of the general charges of the nation? if they are, it is more then what was expected by the requiſition.</p>
            <p>I fear that it is now too late, for us to form pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to his Majeſty and the parliament, ſoon enough to prevent the ſpirited exertions of their power over us: And from the violent temper and ungoverned paſſions of our people, we may juſtly fear the moſt dangerous conſequences.—However, I think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable, as our all is at ſtake; for thoſe who are of true patriotic principles, to ſtand forth for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their country; and freely declare their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before it is too late; without any regard to the deluded populate. Our preſent dangers ought to obliterate all party prejudices and diſtinctions, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014462_0012_0F92B1109AD5C810"/>
unite in meaſures that are moſt for our common: ſafety; which may be, by an application to his Excellency General Gage, our commander in chief, for his favour, by moderate meaſures; and for his kind interpoſition, with the King and parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in our behalf. And as by the laſt accounts from Great-Britain, we are informed that the affairs of the Colonies, were to come before the King and parliament ſoon; whereby they may as is ſuppoſed, form a conſtitutional plan for the Colonies; which may require our utmoſt moderation and prudence; therefore let us exert our ſeveral powers and faculties, in order to form favorable and juſt ſentiments of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and for promoting a decent acquieſcence with any tolerable requiſitions; hoping in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's favor for a redreſs of all grievances afterward, when we can act in a conſtitutional way, by proper addreſſes: And as our ſea-port towns are expoſed to the King's naval forces, and in danger of deſtruction by fire and ſword; and that it is expected, that a neutrality will be demanded of them: They may therefore conſider, whether it would not (if required) be beſt for them to ſubmit to it, for their preſervation.</p>
            <p>And is it not to be expected, that there are great numbers in other parts of the province, who have conformed to popular meaſures, that will not be active in an oppoſition to government, who will readily embrace the firſt favorable opportunity to ſecure themſelves by a neutrality or ſubmiſſion, and leave the conteſt to thoſe, who will not ſubmit; and I deſire that it may be further conſidered, whether the controverſy, and duties for ten years paſt, has not been more expenſive to us, then it would have been, if we had attended to the requiſition, and offered to grant a certain annual revenue to his Majeſty, when they were inclined to ſtipulate, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014462_0013_0F92B11153879A70"/>
accept a moderate allowance. We have imprudently rejected the propoſals, and relied on the influence and exertions of the manufacturing party in England for ſafety; but can we now depend upon them to ſecure or preſerve us from ruin; I hope you will conſider the importance of the ſubject, and excuſe my officious endeavors, that were excited by a view of ſuch intereſting concerns: I have engaged in it, not from private views, or with perſonal prejudice to any one; but with a ſincere deſire to promote the good of the public. It is the undue practices only, of a party, that I mean to expoſe—I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to promote a juſt regard for ſome neceſſary duties of ſocial life; and ſhould have given it ſooner with my ſtate of facts and remarks, had I not feared that it would appear unpopular, and be treated with ſneers and ridicule. But ſenſible of our extreme danger, I have under a conſcious regard to my duty, overcome ſuch fears, and do conſider tar and feathers, and the favors of the populace, to be of little avail, if compared to the preſervation of my country, and the lives of my dear countrymen; of which there are many thouſands (as I doubt not) who are juſt and honeſt in their intentions, that would have acted a different part, if they had known the true ſtate of the caſe.—And I fear that my relation of facts and plain-dealing may occaſion ſome ſcrupulous perſons, to miſapprehend my deſigns, and conclude that I am a tory. But I hereby declare, that I am in no wiſe ſenſible, that I have offered any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, with true and genuine whig principles: And I ſhall therefore take the liberty to ſubſcribe myſelf.</p>
