            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION to the friendly READER.</head>
            <p>IT was the language formerly to the choſen people of God, that my people have committed two great evils; they have forſaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns, that can hold no water. This was ever and anon the complaint of the Lord concerning Iſrael, from the beginning to the end. The Lord did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to beget, nouriſh, and bring up that people for himſelf; but they were almoſt continually revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, and rebelling againſt him. He did mighty things for them; but they ſtill forgot him. He redeemed them by his outſtretched arm; he fed them, he defended them; but they knew him not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 3, but decked themſelves with the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they had from him, and then lift up the heel againſt him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 7, and <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 15. In plain terms, they got what knowledge they could from him into their own veſſels, and then they would ſet up for themſelves, without freſh bubblings up of life from the ſpring from whence their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge came. The prieſts ſaid not, where is the Lord? but could handle the law, and teach the knowledge of it, without him; and the prophets could propheſy by another ſpirit, <hi>Jer.</hi> ii. 8. And thus the Lord God of life lived not in them; but they lived upon ſuch things as once came from the life; but, being ſeparated from the ſpring, were dead, and nouriſhed but the dead part in them, the eſtranged from God. And thus, though their profeſſions were great, and they multiplied prayers, ſacrifices, and faſts, and drew nigh to God with their lips, yet their hearts were far from him. They had forſaken the fountain; they drank not of the waters of the ſpring, of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019435_0003_0FABAC459586AA78"/>
rock that followed them; but they drank of the waters of their own ciſterns. They ſet up that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law for their light which they had hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by their own underſtanding, without the ſpirit that wrote it. This was Iſrael's error of old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They drank very zealouſly of the waters of the law; but they drank it not from the ſpring, but out of the ciſterns which themſelves had hewed.</p>
            <p>And as it was thus with Iſrael of old, ſo hath it been with Iſrael ſince. The Chriſtian Iſrael hath been always backſliding, always forgetting the Lord! Still getting what they could to live of themſelves, but refuſing to live on him: Getting what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they could from the ſcriptures without him; getting what they could from their exerciſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences; but neglecting the ſpring of their life. And this Iſrael alſo dies; this Iſrael likewiſe withers, and becomes a ſcorn to the heathen; for though they ſpeak great words of their God, yet they themſelves are but as the heathen; uncircumciſed like them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the virtue and power of life like them; always ſtriving againſt ſin, in that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conquer, and ſo they alſo are ſlaves under their luſts and corruptions, like the heathen; and know not the truth, which makes free indeed.</p>
            <p>Exceeding great hath been the apoſtacy of this age! Mighty was the appearance of God inwardly in his people's ſpirits! Mighty was the appearance of God outwardly in the nation! Many ways and great hopes were there of a thorough reformation. But how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly was the pure ſpirit of the Lord forgotten, and departed from, and his work overturned both within and without? Inwardly in his people's ſpirits, and outwardly in the nation, whoſe revolting was but a type of the inward! And how hath the ſpirit of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019435_0004_0FABAC45F6640AB0"/>
Lord mourned after his people, often reproving them for their backſlidings? But they have been (as Iſrael of old) like the deaf adder, juſtifying themſelves, and complaining againſt the witneſſes of God (as Iſrael did againſt his prophets) who from the Lord teſtify againſt them. And it cannot be otherwiſe; for the dead waters in Iſrael's hewn ciſterns will never agree with the waters of the living fountain, but will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their teſtimony.</p>
            <p>How ſhall the charmer charm wiſely enough to make apoſtate Iſrael hearken to his voice? I have not backſlidden, ſaith one in one form; I have not backſlidden, ſaith another in another form: I have not backſlidden, ſaith one in one notion; I am not backſlidden, ſaith another in another potion: I am believing, hoping, and waiting in what the Lord hath already revealed, and following on to know him. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedſt not my word; but ſtill have been juſtifying thyſelf, as if thou hadſt obeyed. And yet your backſlidings are written upon your foreheads, as with the point of a diamond. For who among you retains his freſhneſs? An evident demonſtration that ye are departed from the ſpring, and hold your knowledge, experiences and hopes, in the dead part; and your choiceſt prop of comfort is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what you once had. Ah! poor, barren, dead ſouls, is this your beſt ſupport? Return, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; enter into the houſe of mourning, and let the living lay it to heart.</p>
            <p>Now let not men run on in heats againſt us; but let them ſeriouſly conſider, whether we be of God or no: And let them conſider not with the reaſon and underſtanding which is alienated from God; but with the witneſs which lies hid in the heart. There is
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019435_0005_0FABAC469C411010"/>
one great palpable argument that we are of God, which is this, all the world is againſt us: The worldly part everywhere fights againſt us; the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part, in every ſort and ſect of men, oppoſeth us; the rage of men everywhere riſeth up againſt us: But thoſe that are ſo hot againſt us, if at any time they become but meek and calm, patiently conſidering our cauſe, and conſulting thereupon with the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they find in their own hearts concerning us, they ſoon become pacified, and ſee that we are no man's enemies, againſt no righteous law, not againſt relations, not againſt governments, not againſt any thing in the world that is good, but only againſt that which is evil and corrupt. And of a truth, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things God hath ſhewn unto us, and daily calls us forth after an immediate manner to witneſs againſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore let men be ſober, and take heed what they do, leſt they be found fighters againſt God; for the reproaches, the ſcoffs, with other perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſeem to be caſt at us, light on him. (Inaſmuch as it is done unto one of the leaſt of the brethren, Chriſt ſaid it was done unto him.) It is not as we are men, but as we are obedient to him, as we ſtand witneſſes for him, that we meet with theſe things. Now as it is not we ourſelves that do theſe things, but the life and power of God in us, ſo it is not we that are ſtruck at, but that life and power. If it were not for that, we might be as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable as other men. It is becauſe we are not of the world, but God hath called us out of the word, that we are ſo hated of the world. This is the true cauſe, though the world will no more now acknowledge it than it would in former ages. Yet I do not ſpeak this for my own ſake, to avoid my ſhare in the croſs: For the reproach of Chriſt is greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt, to all thoſe who
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019435_0006_0FABAC48F40D41A0"/>
have reſpect unto the recompence of the reward. Yea, the preſence of God, the ſweet power of life, makes up all our loſſes; ſo that we have no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. It is very ſweet, pleaſant and profitable, for us to be found ſufferers for God; but we know it will not be profitable for you to be found perſecutors: And this is told you in true love and good-will, by one who wiſhes no evil to you, for all that evil that you are endeavouring to exerciſe toward us. O that God would open your eyes, that ye might ſee whom ye have oppoſed, and againſt whom ye have hardened and ſtrengthened yourſelves, that ye might bow to him, and receive life from him, and not periſh in your gainſaying and oppoſition.</p>
            <p>What the envious may judge of theſe lines, I little care for, well knowing that the moſt eminent authors have been expoſed to envy, and been obnoxious to the cenſures of pedantic critics. Whatever any may think, this I am well aſſured of, that my chief ſcope hath been for the promotion of the goſpel of peace and purity, and for the good of all mankind, not only to delight my reader, but alſo to lead him to virtue. If I may be ſo happy as to have contributed thereto, I ſhall think my pains well rewarded; and if not, I ſhall have at leaſt this ſatisfaction, that, according to my ability, I have endeavoured to be beneficial to others, and to edify my fellow mortals in that which is good; which I cannot but think to be well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God. And if I have performed any thing that is good, the honor and glory thereof belong to him who is the giver of all good gifts: And it is from him alone I have received all my ability to do any good thing, unto whom belong praiſes; ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting praiſes are due unto God that is holy. Amen. Thus concluding, I wiſh the reader diſcretion, and an impartial judgment.</p>

               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p>THE Lord God, of infinite goodneſs, hath ever dearly loved mankind, yet could never ſo appear to them ſince the tranſgreſſion, as to be owned by them, till the veil was taken from before their hearts. Iſrael in Egypt hearkened not to Moſes, becauſe of their anguiſh and bondage. When they were led out, they were ever and anon murmuring and picking quarrels againſt him. Samuel they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected (as the Lord lays to their charge) though they might excuſe themſelves, and ſay they had juſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019435_0008_0FABAC4B8A89BD18"/>
exceptions againſt his ſons. Elijah, that mighty man of God, the great reſtorer of Iſrael, and pleader againſt Baal by fire, his life was ſought for: And though there be not a particular record of their uſage of the prophets about thoſe days, yet in general he complains that they were all ſlain but himſelf, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> xix. 10. Micaiah was ſmitten on the cheek, and jeered by the falſe prophet who ſmote him, and ſaid, "Which way went the ſpirit of the Lord from me to ſpeak unto thee?" And he was commanded to be put in priſon, and fed with bread of affliction and water of affliction. Jeremiah was put into the dungeon, even to the danger of his life; and by thoſe few that were left that ſeemed ſingly to enquire by him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> xlii. 2, 3, diſdainfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, chap. xliii. 2. Why ſhould I ſpend time in particular inſtances? What profit can I expect? For though all their bad dealings with them are not relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcripture, yet Chriſt teſtifies that they did deal badly with them all; ſome of them they ſtoned, ſome of them they ſcourged in their ſynagogues, ſome of them they killed and crucified, and others they perſecuted from city to city: Yea, ſaith Stephen, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers perſecuted?" And they have ſlain them which ſhewed before of the coming of the Juſt One; ye make it ſuch a ſtrange thing that if Chriſt had been a prophet, that they ſhould have owned him: Why, which of the prophets was owned? And ye have ſtill ſome exception or other now againſt the ſame ſpirit that was in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in former ages, even againſt the meſſenger whom God hath ſent in this age, that it is not from God; ye take arguments from one prophet's words to oppoſe another prophet with; and from one prophet's manner of coming to oppoſe another
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019435_0009_0FABAC4BDB5C93E0"/>
prophet's coming: If John come neither eating nor drinking, ye reject him for his auſtereneſs: If Chriſt come both eating and drinking, ye reject him for his liberty and freedom in the life. Now what was the reaſon of this? Chriſt himſelf gives the reaſon, <hi>Matt.</hi> xi. 19. Wiſdom is juſtified of her children; ye are not the children of wiſdom, ye are not begotten of the life, of the ſpirit of the prophets, and ſo cannot juſtify that ſpirit. Ye have gotten the letter of the prophets; ye are born of that, but ye are not born of the life, ye are not born of the wiſdom: And ſo whoever comes forth in the ſame birth from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with you, that is, being one of your church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, him ye can own; but if any prophet come forth with that ſame ſpirit, him ye cannot own. He that is born after the fleſh, cannot but perſecute him that is born after the ſpirit. Jeruſalem was all along the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the prophets, from the beginning to the end.</p>
               <p>And is this nothing to you, O ye profeſſors of this age! Search and ſee, who have been the perſecutors among you, but they who have had the name of the church and her prophets? Who have ſlain the witneſſes? The church of Rome hath ſlain the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt her, and the Proteſtants have ſlain the witneſſes againſt them. If a man were never ſo truly zealous, yet if he could not conform to the common prayer-book and ceremonies, how was he perſecuted, though owning the ſame Chriſt in his very heart and ſoul; yet, becauſe his practice was a teſtimony againſt the falſe church-worſhip, muſt be hunted up and down to courts, impriſoned, fined, baniſhed. And to this day the Lord can bring forth no birth of his ſpirit, but the zealous profeſſor hates, reviles, and ſeeks to deſtroy it. If the Lord lay any law upon the conſcience, if it be not ſuitable to their
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019435_0010_0FABAC4E472719B8"/>
apprehenſions from the letter, how do they reproach, diſdain, revile and endeavour to render ſuch odious to the magiſtrates, to the churches, and to the people of the world?</p>
               <p>Now this I have to ſay to you all: All you who reſt in any form whatſoever, ſhort of the life itſelf, ye had even as good have ſtayed in Egypt, as to fix by the way, and to take up a reſt in the wilderneſs, ſhort of Canaan. In plain terms, ye had as good have abode in popery or epiſcopacy; ye had been as acceptable to God there as here, not that I ſay your forms of Independency, Anabaptiſm, or Quakeriſm, are as bad as Popery, &amp;c. nay, they are all ſomewhat nearer, and the laſt of them very much nearer: But your fixing there, and the dead ſpirit feeding there on the dead thing, is as remote from life as if it had gone quite back again. And this dead ſpirit is as hateful to God here, as it is among the Papiſts; yea, and in one ſenſe more, becauſe it makes a pretence beyond them.</p>
               <p>Look about ye, look about ye, all ſorts of devout profeſſors; ſee where ye are. Are you not dead in your forms? Is not the good old puritan principle (wherein once was true life in its meaſure) dead and buried there? Conſider with yourſelves; hath that grown in your forms? Or hath it been ſlain there? Speak the truth in your own hearts; can you truly ſay, from a ſenſible feeling in the life, that that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is ſtill alive in you? While Abel lived in you, Cain could not riſe up in his dominions; but now the right ſeed is ſlain, the murdering nature appears.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould we wonder at theſe things? There is no new thing under the ſun. The ſtate of the world is juſt as it always was; the power of truth in every age hath been ſtill oppoſed by thoſe who cried
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019435_0011_0FABAC4FEB05DAE0"/>
up the form. It were a wonder if it ſhould be otherwiſe. I ſhould much more wonder, if the teachers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of this age ſhould own truth, than that they fight againſt it and perſecute it. Well, friends and brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and faithful to his truth, in the power of his might; bear the reproach, the afflictions of this age, the perſecutions of this your day. Verily your eyes ſhall ſee that there is a reward for the righteous, and your hearts ſhall be ſatisfied with it, when the children of the kingdom (of this age as well as of all former ages) ſhall be ſhut out in utter darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping, wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>

               <head>The JEW OUTWARD. Some Exceptions and Arguments of the Jews againſt Chriſt's Appearance, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE Jews were once the only outward viſible people of God, who were choſen by God for a peculiar people, who had the promiſe of and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Meſſiah; whoſe faith and hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in him, yea, and at that very time they were looking for him, yet, when he came he was a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to them, and they could by no means receive him. They were full of reaſonings, doubts and contendings about it; but could never, with all their wiſdom from the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019435_0012_0FABAC516B974958"/>
letter, determine that was he. Though he lived as never man lived; though he ſpake as never man ſpake; though he did what never man did; yet ſtill ſome exception or other they had from the letter of the ſcriptures, to which his manner of appearance, his converſation and his doctrine, did not ſuit in their judgment; and ſo, after many diſputes and debates, they at length delivered him up to death, as a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a deceiver, a ſeducer of the people.</p>
               <p>Many exceptions and arguments they had againſt him, againſt his deſcent, his doctrine, his practices, his miracles, his followers, &amp;c. which I ſhall refer to heads, to make them more obvious.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They excepted at his deſcent and kindred. Is not this the carpenter's ſon? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James and Joſes, and Simon and Judas, and his ſiſters, are they not all with us? <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. 55, 56. What! this that glorious Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah! the great King of Glory, of whom all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets propheſied and ſpoke great things! ſurely it cannot be. And they were offended in him, ver. 57. It was this made them they could not receive that heavenly doctrine of his which otherwiſe might have been life to them, when he taught them that he was the bread of life that came down from heaven; but they murmured becauſe of it, and ſaid, "Is not this Jeſus, the ſon of Joſeph, whoſe father and mother we know? How is it then that he ſaith, I came down from heaven? <hi>John</hi> vi. 41, 42. So again, <hi>John</hi> vii. 27. We know this man whence he is; but when Chriſt cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. This was a cloſe argument, and was raiſed up to eat out a deep impreſſion of his being the Chriſt, as may appear from the foregoing verſe. "He ſpeaketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019435_0013_0FABAC5323463660"/>
boldly, and deep things, &amp;c. as if he were the Chriſt, but how can he be he, ſeeing it is known from whence he comes?"</p>
               <p n="2">2. At his country or place of his education and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, which was Nazareth of Galilee. Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? <hi>John</hi> i. 46. Shall Chriſt come out of Galilee? <hi>John</hi> vii. 41. Search and look; for out of Galilee ariſeth no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ver. 52.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At the time and ſeaſon of his coming; he came (as to their ſenſe) before Elias. With this argument they pinched the diſciples, as is ſignified in that query of theirs to Chriſt; "Why then ſay the ſcribes that Elias muſt firſt come?" <hi>Matt.</hi> xvii. 10. This could not but be a ſore argument in the mouth of the ſcribes, who might reaſon with the diſciples on this wiſe: What poor, ignorant, ſottiſh, deluded people are you, to own this man for your maſter, and take him for the Meſſiah? Elias muſt firſt come, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all things. If this man preached ever ſo heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine, and did ever ſo many miracles, yet, if he pretend to be the Meſſiah, he can be but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver: For the true Meſſiah comes not before Elias; and every one knows that Elias is not yet come, nor his work of reſtoring all things ſo much as begun.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His doctrine adminiſtered abundance of offence to them, and they were continually ſtumbling at it. That heavenly doctrine mentioned a little before, that he was the bread of life, they murmured at, <hi>John</hi> vi. 41. When he did but ſay God was his father, they preſently flew out upon him and ſaid, he made himſelf equal with God, <hi>John</hi> v. 18. When he ſaid deſtroy this temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up, they miſunderſtood him, and brought it forth as an argument againſt him at the time of his ſuffering,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019435_0014_0FABAC536F298C20"/>
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvi. 61, and caſt it as a jeer in his teeth, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvii. 40. When he did but ſay to the man ſick of the palſey, ſon, thy ſins are forgiven thee, the ſcribes and Phariſees preſently exclaimed againſt him, who is this that ſpeaketh blaſphemy? Who can forgive ſins but God alone? <hi>Luke</hi> v. 21, and chap. vii. 19. When he preached very powerfully againſt covetouſneſs, the Phariſees derided him, <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 14. Yea, when he did but preach a parable or two about the widow of Sarepta, and Naaman, the Syrian (it coming a little cloſe to their ſtate) all they in the ſynagogue were ſo filled with wrath, that they roſe up and thruſt him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill, to caſt him down headlong, <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 28, 29. At his ſaying that Abraham rejoiced to ſee his day, and he ſaw it, and was glad; the Jews replied, thou art not yet fifty years old, and haſt thou ſeen Abraham? <hi>John</hi> viii. 57. How abſurd and impoſſible was this to them, that a man of not fifty years ſhould ſay, that Abraham (who lived ſo many ages before) ſaw his day? And inſtead of giving them an argument to demonſtrate it to them, he only returns them a more confident affirmation, verily verily I ſay unto you, before Abraham was I am, ver. 58. Which ſo enraged them that they took up ſtones to caſt at him, ver. 59. Now mark, the life ſpeaks what it ſees and knows, and ſo it gives forth its teſtimony. The wiſe profeſſor, not being in the life, cannot know or receive the teſtimony; but calls for arguments and demonſtrations to his wiſe eye. The life refuſeth to anſwer him; but inſtead thereof, only affirmeth the thing more ſtrongly and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This (being ſo far from what he looks for, and requires to ſatisfy him) kindles diſdain and rage in him: And he looks upon the life, for this way of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019435_0015_0FABAC54264DBD88"/>
proceeding, as worthy to be ſtoned. What, when they ſhould lay before Chriſt a fair argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might plainly convince him by evident reaſon that he could not ſee Abraham's day, and he inſtead of anſwering it ſhould only bring forth a more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affirmation, would not men's wiſdom, in this age, even hiſs at ſuch a thing? Yet this was the way of the life then in that day, and the life may, at his pleaſure, take the ſame way again now, to offend the wiſe and knowing.</p>
               <p>When he ſpake of his being the good ſhepherd, and of his laying down his life for his ſheep (and of the hireling's flying, in time of danger, to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) <hi>John</hi> x. 11, 12, many of the Jews ſaid he hath a devil, and is mad, why hear ye him? ver. 20. Many of them that were then the people of God (the ſeparated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ple, for the Jews were a ſeparated peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the world, and ſtudied the law, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ordinances of Moſes) looked upon Chriſt as a man not fit to be heard ſpeak, but as a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as one that had a devil, as one that might have great power of deceit from the devil, to bewitch men from truth; why hear ye him? What good can ye expect from him? He hath a devil and is mad. O how deſperately will bold fleſh venture to judge of the life and power of God, when it hath got a little knowledge from the ſcriptures, and a way of worſhip, duties and ordinances! When he ſaid, I and my father are one, <hi>John</hi> x. 30, they took up ſtones again to ſtone him, ver. 31, and made no queſtion but they did well in doing of it, as appears by their anſwer to his demand, for which of his good works they ſtoned him, they replied very confidently, for a good work we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy, and becauſe thou being a man, makeſt thyſelf God, ver. 32, 33.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019435_0016_0FABAC54F56772A0"/>
And when he ſaid, if a man keep my ſaying he ſhall never ſee death, <hi>John</hi> viii. 51, then ſaid the Jews unto him, now we know thou haſt a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead; who makeſt thou thyſelf? ver. 53. Were not Abraham and the prophets holy men? had not they the ſayings of God, and did they not keep the ſayings of God? yet they are dead. Such a kind of ſpeech as this muſt needs be from the devil; now thou makeſt manifeſt from what ſpirit thou ſpeakeſt; now we know thou haſt a devil. And indeed how could the profeſſors of that age digeſt ſuch things, being ſo contrary to what appeared to them to be certain truth in the ſcriptures?</p>
               <p>And there were many other things as hard to them, though the exceptions which might or did ariſe in their minds are not particularly mentioned; as when he ſaith, I am the door of the ſheep, all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the ſheep did not hear them, <hi>John</hi> x. 7, 8. How offenſive muſt this doctrine needs have been to them, going carnally to underſtand and reaſon about it? What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were all the prophets and holy men before thee thieves and robbers? Did the truth never come till thou broughteſt it? What became of our forefathers in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages? Were they none of them God's ſheep? Did none of them find the door? For thou ſayeſt thou art the door, and thou haſt been but of late: And whereas thou ſayeſt the ſheep did not hear them, that is utterly falſe; for they did hear Moſes, and they did hear the prophets, and we have their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and will keep to them, for all thee, let who will be thy ſheep. When he ſaid that he came not to ſend peace, but diviſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> x. 25, how readily might they reply, that his own mouth diſcovered him
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019435_0017_0FABAC55DA018438"/>
not to be the Meſſiah, the ſaviour, the peace-maker; but the worker of diviſions, the cauſe of breaches in families, ſetting three againſt two, and two againſt three? <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 51. When he ſaid, whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin, <hi>John</hi> viii. 34, might they not well except againſt this, as condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole generation of the righteous, and making null the way of ſacrifices, which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſins committed at any time by his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which could not but preſuppoſe their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin? Did not Abraham, Iſaac, David, Moſes, and the reſt of the prophets, all commit ſin, and were they the ſervants of ſin? He taught alſo that the children of the kingdom ſhould be caſt into utter darkneſs, <hi>Matt.</hi> viii. 12. O how harſh would this ſound in the ears of the zealous profeſſing Jews, who were waiting and hoping for the kingdom? So in his doctrine there ſeemed many contradictions to the fleſhly underſtanding: For one while he ſaid, I judge no man, for I came not to condemn the world, and yet was not he continually judging and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcribes, the Phariſees, the prieſts, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and that whole generation of profeſſors? So again he came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; to preach the goſpel of peace; and yet another while he ſaith, he came not to ſend peace, but a ſword, and to kindle a fire, and to ſet men at variance, &amp;c. Again, one while he ſaid, I and my Father are one; another time, my Father is greater than me; one while he bid men do as the ſcribes and Phariſees taught; another while he bid men beware of the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or doctrine of the Phariſees and Sadducees, <hi>Matt.</hi> xvi. 12.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe ſhould I heap up any more inſtances? O thou that readeſt this, wait, to know in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019435_0018_0FABAC5663F27420"/>
thyſelf the ear that cannot hear Chriſt's doctrine While thou condemneſt the Jews, do not run into the ſame error of unbelief and gainſaying; but wait to know the voice of Chriſt in this day, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ear that can hear it; for though thou ſhouldeſt be willing to hear, yet thou canſt not till thy ear be opened: Nicodemus, who could acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt a teacher come from God, yet could not receive the doctrine of the new birth from him, <hi>John</hi> iii. 4. And there were many things the diſciples themſelves were not able to bear: For when at a certain time he ſpake of giving his fleſh to eat, not only the Jews, <hi>John</hi> vi. 52, but they alſo ſtumbled, ver. 61. And who is there among profeſſors that can now bear it, or receive Chriſt's own interpretation of it? who ſaith, that the fleſh which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood profiteth nothing; but the fleſh which he meant was ſpirit and life, ver. 63.</p>
               <p>At his practices and converſation. How is it that he eateth with publicans and ſinners? <hi>Mark</hi> ii. 16, Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and ſinners, <hi>Luke</hi> vii. 14. This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, for ſhe is a ſinner, <hi>Luke</hi> vii. 39. At the publicans and ſinners drawing nigh to hear him, the Phariſees and ſcribes were offended, and murmured, ſaying this man receiveth ſinners, and eateth with them, <hi>Luke</hi> xv. 1, 2. And when he went to Zaccheus's houſe they all murmured, ſaying that he was gone to be a gueſt with a man that is a ſinner, <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 7.</p>
               <p>Again, becauſe he healed on the ſabbath, and juſtified his diſciples in plucking ears of corn on the ſabbath, they were filled with madneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned what they might do to him, <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 3, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019435_0019_0FABAC571DA42668"/>
took counſel how they might deſtroy him, <hi>Mark</hi> iii. 5, 6. Another time, the ruler of the ſynagogue ſpake with indignation about it, <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 14, yea, the Jews did perſecute Jeſus, and ſought to ſlay him, becauſe he had healed a man, and bid him take up his bed and walk, on the ſabbath day, <hi>John</hi> v. 8, 16. And ſome of them made it a ſtrong argument againſt him, this man is not of God, becauſe he keepeth not the ſabbath day, <hi>John</hi> ix. 16. What! come from God and be a breaker of ordinances! Can theſe two ſtand together? Read and conſider what more ſtrict ordinance of God under the law than the ſabbath? What one ordinance more conducing to the honor and worſhip of God? Did not their whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and worſhip much depend upon it? How could this poſſibly but be a great offence to them, in that ſpirit and literal wiſdom from the ſcriptures wherein they ſtood? Yet Chriſt, in his ſpiritual appearance, was lord of the ſabbath, and in his fleſhly appearance he doth not loſe his dominion. Again, they except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him, that he did not teach his diſciples to faſt and pray, as John did, <hi>Luke</hi> v. 33, but could ſuffer them to tranſgreſs the traditions of the elders, <hi>Matt.</hi> xv. 2. He was not ſtrict after the Jewiſh way of devotion, nor ſtrict after John's way neither; but againſt the traditions of the godly elders of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church; againſt ſanctifying of the Lord's ſabbath, (juſtifying his diſciples in plucking ears of corn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas their forefathers, the Jews, were not ſo much as to gather manna on that day) againſt faſting and prayer, for he juſtified his diſciples in that they did not faſt and pray as John did, ſaying, how could they mourn while the bridegroom was with them? <hi>Matt.</hi> ix. 15. And conſider which way the Jews (in the ſtate they ſtood) could underſtand ſuch an anſwer as this, to reſt ſatisfied therewith.</p>

They excepted againſt his miracles, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did them on the ſabbath day, <hi>John</hi> ix. 16. Whereupon they concluded he could not be of God (for if he had been of God, he would have obſerved the day which God commanded) and if he wrought them not by the power of God, by whoſe power then muſt he work them? So they concluded, he caſteth out devils by the prince of devils, <hi>Matt.</hi> ix. 34. He hath Belzebub, and by the prince of devils caſteth he out devils, <hi>Mark</hi> iii. 34. And having thus conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelves, there was no ear open in them to hear any thing that might be ſaid to the contrary. And again, partly becauſe he did not anſwer their wills, in giving them ſuch a ſign as they required: For this was ſtill their tone, maſter we would ſee a ſign from thee, <hi>Matt.</hi> xii. 38. What ſign ſheweſt thou to us, ſeeing that thou doſt theſe things? <hi>John</hi> ii. 18. And they more particularly expreſs what ſign they would have, a ſign from heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 18. What ſign ſheweſt thou, that we may ſee and believe thee? <hi>John</hi> vi. 30. We are ready to be convinced, we are ready to believe, if thou wouldeſt give us ſufficient ground of believing in thee. As for all thy healing people, and caſting out devils, Belzebub, the prince of devils, may furniſh thee with power wherewith to deceive and bewitch us from the law and ordinances of Moſes, which we are ſure are of God; but ſhew ſhew us a ſign from heaven, or elſe blame not us for not leaving Moſes to run after thee.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They excepted at the teſtimony which the ſpirit of God in him gave concerning him. When he ſpake the inward teſtimony, which the ſpirit of God gave from within, ſaying I am the light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life, <hi>John</hi> viii. 13, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

Mark his anſwer, it is written in your law that the teſtimony of two men is true; I am one that bear witneſs of myſelf, and the father that ſent me beareth witneſs of me, ver. 17, 18. How would ſuch an anſwer paſs now in theſe days, though the ſame life ſhould ſpeak it? Would not the wiſe profeſſors of this age think ſtrange at it? Yet the thing is known at this day, even the life which the Father begets, and the Father's teſtifying of it, and with it, and thou that readeſt this, mighteſt know it, couldeſt thou wait in the loſs of thy own life, wiſdom and knowledge, for it.</p>

Are ye alſo deceived? Have any of the rulers, or of the Phariſees, believed on him? But this people who know not the law are accurſed, <hi>John</hi> vi. 47—49. The common people, the ignorant people, the unſettled people, ſuch as know not the law, ſuch as underſtand not the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they run after him and cry him up, but which of the ſettled ones, which of the truly zealous ones, which of the wiſe men in the knowledge of the law and prophets, which of the orthodox ſcribes and Phariſees, who keep cloſe to Moſes, which of theſe believe in him? Whom of them can he deceive? As for the heady people, who (for want of knowledge from the ſcriptures) are ready to run after every new fangle, they are not worth minding, they are accurſed; and therefore no marvel though God give them up to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this deceiver, and to cry up his new light, and forſake the good old light of Moſes and the prophets.</p>

Nay, the very diſciples themſelves could not ſwallow it, but were ſtartled at it, and Chriſt was fain to hide it a long time from them. And yet if there be any thing held forth now in theſe days by the ſame ſpirit (as concerning light and perfection, or other truths which are ſeen in the ſpirit) becauſe men cannot apprehend them with their carnal underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make them agree with their carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſcriptures, what liberty do they take to themſelves to ſpeak both againſt the truth itſelf, and

alſo againſt them who have ſeen theſe things in the ſpirit, and ſpeak them from the ſpirit? Now whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes a diſciple, muſt wait in obedience to know the doctrine, and not think to enter with that wiſdom and carnal reaſoning from the ſcriptures, which the ſcribes and Phariſees and the profeſſors of that age were ſhut out with.</p>
               <p>There were many other things which they could not but except againſt: As at his anſwers to their queſtions, to which ſometimes he was ſilent, and gave no anſwer at all; at other times, he anſwered not directly, but in parables: (And how offenſive is this to man's wiſdom? who requires a poſitive and direct anſwer.) And ſometimes his anſwer might ſeem quite from the thing, as <hi>John</hi> xii. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>His not giving reſpect to perſons (for it was a known thing of him that he regarded not men's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Matt.</hi> xvii. 16) could not be very pleaſing to them who loved greetings, and ſought honor one of another; he ſhewed not reſpect to Herod, but ſpake contemptuouſly of him, as men would account it: Go, ſaith he, and tell that fox, he did not ſhew reſpect to the reverend and grave doctors of the law; nay, nor to the high prieſt himſelf. Nay he did not ſhew reſpect to his own diſciples, but ſaid to Peter (when he mildly and affectionately deſired his death might be avoided) get thee behind me, Satan; how harſh and rough a reply might this ſeem? If Peter had erred, through his affection and tenderneſs to his maſter, a meek ſpirit would gently have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him; but to call him devil, and ſay, get thee behind me, what kind of ſpirit doth this ſavour of? Would that profeſſing Jew ſay, who knoweth not the true meekneſs, but ſeeks after a fleſhly meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is a ſervant to the fleſhly wiſdom and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019435_0024_0FABAC5BA66694E8"/>
prudence, but not true born. Nay, he did not ſpeak reſpectfully to his own mother (as man's ſpirit, by its rule of reſpect, would judge and condemn him) for, at the marriage at Cana, when they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wine, "ſhe ſaith unto him they have no wine;" he ſaith unto her, woman, what have I to do with thee? <hi>John</hi> xi. 3, 4, and in a manner denied all his relations, <hi>Matt.</hi> xii. 48.</p>
               <p>Laſtly (to inſtance no more) at his harſh cenſures of all the profeſſors of that age (who obſerved the law of Moſes, and Iſrael's ſtatutes) with all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and godly teachers; juſtifying none but himſelf, and what he taught, and a few of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. He told them, that they had not the love of God in them, <hi>John</hi> v. 42. Did this not, think ye, ſeem to them a very harſh charge? And why not the love of God? becauſe they did not follow him and his new doctrine; yea, would they be ready to ſay, they did love God, and kept his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſabbaths and ordinances, which he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.</p>
               <p>He laid this alſo to their charge, that they did not believe Moſes, <hi>John</hi> v. 46. What an unjuſt charge might this ſeem? when they were ſo zealous for Moſes; and their very diſlike of him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy againſt him, was for the ſake of the law and ordinances of Moſes.</p>
               <p>Another charge he laid to them was, that they were not the children of Abraham, or of God; but of the devil, <hi>John</hi> viii. 39, 42, 44. What a raſh, cenſorious man might they account him? thus to ſpeak of them who were the human ſeed of Abraham, who were ſuch ſtrict obſervers of God's laws and ordinances (which is the property of his children) and ſuch enemies to the devil, that they would not
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019435_0025_0FABAC5C6759B718"/>
be drawn from the truths and way of worſhip, taught by Moſes and the prophets; no, not by all the miracles he could work.</p>
               <p>He called them a faithleſs and perverſe generation, <hi>Matt.</hi> i. 17, 18. He told them that they did not know God; though they ſaid with confidence that he was their God, <hi>John</hi> xii. 54, 55. How could they bear this? They had been ſtudying the law and the prophets, and had a great ſtock of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from thence, and were ſtrict and exact in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (ſome of them, as well as Paul, might be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, blameleſs) and now to be told they did not know God: Nay, he that abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in knowledge, devotion and worſhip, yet not being in the life and pure power of the ſpirit, hath not one draught of the true knowledge.</p>
               <p>He told them that they ſhould die in their ſins, <hi>John</hi> viii. 21. (O hard word, and ſevere judgment!) and yet he had told them a little before, he judged no man, ver. 15. Yea they did think themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wronged by him; and thought that no man that had any thing of God in him could ſpeak ſuch things, but only one that was an enemy to the people of God, and led by the ſpirit of Satan. To this effect they expreſs themſelves, ver. 48 of that chapter, ſay we not well thou art a Samaritan, and haſt a devil? Yea, when Chriſt charged them with going about to kill him, they ſeemed to themſelves ſo clear in their own conſciences, that they anſwered, thou haſt a devil, who goes about to kill thee? <hi>John</hi> vii. 29. How eaſily might they cloſe up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and by this very thing conclude him to be a falſe prophet? He ſays, we went about to kill him; when, God knows, there was not ſuch a thing in our hearts: Can this man be a true prophet?
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019435_0026_0FABAC5D2F2876C8"/>
Yet Chriſt knew the profeſſing Jew to be the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and in and for his religion's ſake ſtill ſeeking to ſlay him. And there is no ſuch murderer of Chriſt, the life, upon the earth, as the zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor and worſhipper out of the life. He that is in the life cannot perſecute any man; he that is out of the life cannot but perſecute him that is in the life. Hereby the true and falſe Chriſtian may be diſcerned, by the weakeſt, ſimple and ſingle eye.</p>
               <p>And for their teachers and expounders of the law, how exceedingly bitter did he ſeem againſt? And how heavy things was he continually laying to their charge? He called them blind guides, hypocrites, painted ſepulchres, graves which appear not, and pronounced woe upon woe againſt them; read that one place, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiii. 33, ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell? What! ſpeak thus of our zealous teachers, who ſtudy the law, are ſtrict in practiſing of the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and take ſuch pains to inſtruct us in the mind of God, from Moſes and the prophets! Was ſuch a man as this fit to live? nay, and he does not ſhow a goſpel ſpirit. Mark how ſharp and bitter his words come from him, for indeed a ſharper ſpeech, with greater vehemency and indignation of ſpirit, can hardly be ſpoken; and they might ſeem to aggravate this ſharp condemnation of his, from his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; he himſelf had confeſſed, that they ſat in Moſes's chair. Now he might have ſhewn ſome honor to Moſes's chair, and to their office, which was of God, and doubtleſs good, and not have gone about to make them thus odious in the eyes of the people. Nay, he himſelf had bid men do as they ſaid, but in ver. 3 of that chapter. Now was it likely that ever men ſhould mind what they ſaid, or obſerve their
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019435_0027_0FABAC5DE5CC1238"/>
doctrine, when he had thus repreſented them as oppreſſors of the conſcience, ver. 4, as devourers of widows houſes, and making long prayers in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy ver. 15, as making their proſelytes more the children of hell than themſelves, as neglecters of the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith, ver. 23, as appearing righteous to men, but full of hypocriſy and iniquity, ver. 28, as of the ſame generation that killed the prophets, ver. 31, 32, as deceivers; as ſuch as led into the ditch, and bid men beware of their leaven? Were theſe good kind of encouragements for people to hear them? Yea, he charged them with ſhutting up the kingdom of heaven againſt men, and not going in themſelves, nor ſuffering men to enter that were going in, ver. 13. How could they obſerve what they taught without hearing them? and would Chriſt wiſh any to hear ſuch men as theſe? Yet for all this, without doubt they were not without their juſtifications againſt Chriſt in theſe reſpects; and alſo had their charges, on the other hand, ready againſt him. Now how did they ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt men? Did not they teach the law, and direct men to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, and open the prophets words to them? Was this ſhutting up the kingdom of heaven? and would not they ſuffer men to enter?

                  </gap> might the Jews have pleaded againſt Chriſt, that he did ſlander their godly miniſters, who were very painful and zealous in opening the ſcriptures, and teaching the way of God? Nay, he himſelf could not deny but they taught well; for he himſelf ſaith, whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve, and do, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiii. 3. But mark now, that ye may
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019435_0028_0FABAC5E9CC74F40"/>
underſtand the thing: It is thus, any teaching or expounding of ſcriptures out of the life, ſhuts up the kingdom, for the life is the kingdom, and words from the life yield the ſavour of the kingdom; but words out of it, though ever ſo good and true, reach not to the life in another, but only build up a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the contrary wiſdom, and teach to hold the truth in the unrighteouſneſs, where Satan's kingdom ſtands, and where he hath the dominion of all that is brought thither. And ſo this kind of teaching and knowledge ſhuts up the door and way of life, and muſt be loſt, before the kingdom can be found. They ſhut up the true kingdom, but they opened ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdom, they opened the kingdom another way, which was in truth ſhutting of it; and they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and children of the kingdom, whom they pleaſed with the hope of life, and fed with promiſes and comforts; but theſe the Lord would ſhut out. Many ſhall come from the eaſt and weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſs, <hi>Matt.</hi> viii. 11, 12. This is true at this day in the preſent diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it was then in that diſpenſation; though men make it a great accuſation againſt us, charging us that we ſay none are the people of God but ourſelves, and as if all were damned but we. Theſe are mens harſh and unſavoury expreſſions; we uſe not to ſpeak after this manner, but ſoberly open the ſtate of the thing as it ſtands in the truth, and as it hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us by him who is true, and cannot lie; which is thus:</p>
               <p>That through which men are ſaved, is the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of truth in their age. The meaſure of light which God gives forth in every age, that is the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019435_0029_0FABAC6036A35DA0"/>
means and proper way of ſalvation in that age; and where-ever men get or profeſs of the knowledge of truth declared in former ages, yet making uſe of that to withſtand the preſent diſpenſation of truth in their age, they cannot thereby be ſaved; but may thereby be hardened againſt that which ſhould ſave them. And this we are aſſured of from the Lord, that as the Jews could not be ſaved by the law of Moſes (making uſe of it in oppoſition to the ſhining of the light of God in the prophets in their ſeveral ages) nor afterwards could be ſaved by magnifying and obſerving both the words of Moſes and the prophets, and their belief from thence of a Meſſiah to come, making uſe of thoſe things to oppoſe that appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh, which was the diſpenſation of their day then; no more can any profeſſors be ſaved now by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Chriſt come, or any thing which they can learn or practiſe from the ſcriptures, making uſe thereof to oppoſe the diſpenſation of this day; which diſpenſation is the immediate and powerful breaking forth of the light of the ſpirit in the hearts of God's people, who have earneſtly ſought, and in much ſorrow and perplexity of ſpirit longed and waited for him, after this long dark night of the antichriſtian apoſtacy.</p>
               <p>There remain yet ſome other exceptions againſt him, about the time of his ſuffering death, with his hard uſage, which ſhould not wholly be paſſed over: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His diſreſpectful or irreverent anſwering of the high prieſt, as it ſeemed to them, when he aſked him of his doctrine, <hi>John</hi> xviii. 19.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019435_0030_0FABAC60DAC4D438"/>
and ſimplicity of the life, which bows to God, and cannot regard man in the tranſgreſſion, ſeems rude and unmannerly to the lofty ſpirit of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſilence at the teſtimonies brought againſt him, and to the high prieſt when he queſtioned him, <hi>Mark</hi> xiv. 60, 61. Indeed either the ſpeaking or ſilence in the life, is offenſive to the carnal profeſſor, who knoweth not the law of the life in this particular; but can either ſpeak or be ſilent, according to his own will. This is the difference between the true and falſe Chriſtian; the falſe Chriſtian's knowledge and religion ſtand in his own will, in his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he ſpeaks in his own time; both which are crucified in him that is born of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When he did ſpeak the truth himſelf, the high prieſt rent his cloaths, and charged him with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvi. 64. And thoſe that were by fell in with the high prieſt, and ſaid, he was worthy of death, ver. 66. Then they ſpit in his face, and buffeted him, and ſmote him, and mocked him, and blindfolded him, and ſtruck him on the face, bidding him propheſy who ſmote him, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvi. 67, 68, and <hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 63, 64. When they brought him to Pilate, they would have Pilate take it for granted that he was an evil-doer, and worthy of death: For when Pilate aſked for their accuſation againſt him, they anſwer, if he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee, <hi>John</hi> xviii. 29, 30. Pilate refuſing ſo to proceed in judgment, ver. 31, they begin to bring in their charges: We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caeſar, ſaying that he himſelf is Chriſt, a king <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 2. Pilate examines him herein; but profeſſes he can find no fault in him at all, <hi>John</hi> xviii. 38. Then the chief prieſts accuſed

him of many other things, <hi>Mark</hi> xv. 3, and were more fierce; ſaying, he ſtirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee to this place; this indeed was his great offence, he taught with the authority of the ſpirit, and not as the ſcribes. Then Pilate ſent him to Herod, where the chief prieſts and ſcribes ſtood vehemently accuſing him, who queſtioned him much, but he anſwered him nothing. And Herod, with his men of war, ſet him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and ſent him back to Pilate, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 9—11. Pilate profeſſed that he could not find him guilty of this ſecond charge, neither of perverting the people, ver. 14, therefore chaſtiſing him, he would releaſe him, ver. 18, but the people, by the perſuaſion of the chief prieſts and elders, cried all at once away with this man, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe unto us Barabbas, ver. 11, but let him be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, crucify him, crucify him! ver. 21, &amp;c. Now when Pilate had ſcourged him, and the ſoldiers had ſtripped him, and put on him a ſcarlet robe, and had put a crown of plaited thorns on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and had bowed the knee to him, in mockery, and ſpit on him, and ſmote him with a reed, he brings him forth to them again, hoping this might appeaſe their malice, and they might be content to ſpare his being crucified; they tell him they have a law, and by their law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God, <hi>John</hi> xix. 4, 8. See how they turn and wind every way to make the innocent an offender, and to make ſome law, of one kind or other, take hold of him; but when all their accuſations would not prevail with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but ſtill, from the ſenſe of his innocency, he had a mind to releaſe him, they uſe another ſubtle

artifice, telling him, if he let this man go, he was not Caeſar's friend, <hi>John</hi> xix. 12. This carries it with Pilate; now he diſputes no farther, but delivers him up to their will, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 5. Now thou who readeſt this, take heed of judging the Jews for all this wickedneſs, while the ſame nature is alive in thee which did all this in them; for aſſuredly thou, in whom that nature which did it in them is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, wouldeſt have done the ſame thing, hadſt thou lived in thoſe days. Thou that diſdaineſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt the appearance of Chriſt in this age, wouldeſt have diſdained and have perſecuted his appearance in that age. Do not deceive thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>The Jews did as little think that ever they ſhould have put a prophet, or any good man, to death, much leſs the Meſſiah, as thou canſt: Yea, they could blame their fathers for killing the prophets, and ſay, if they had lived in thoſe days, they would not have done it; and yet doſt thou not read what they did? The perſecuting ſpirit was ever blind, and could in no age read its evil and bitter nature, and its enmity againſt the life and power. Be not thou blind in thy day, as they were in theirs; and an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, under pretence of being a friend.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another exception or argument againſt him, about the time of his ſuffering death, was, that he did not put forth his power to ſave himſelf from the croſs: He ſaved others, let him ſave himſelf, if he be the Chriſt, the choſen of God, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 35. Is it likely that this is the Son of God, and that he did ſo many miracles by the power of God, and cannot now ſave himſelf from the croſs? This, his ſuffering death on the croſs, did a little ſtumble ſome of the diſciples, as may appear, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 20, 21, and was enough to have overturned the faith of any
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019435_0033_0FABAC6564D48EF0"/>
which ſtood not in the ſpirit and in the power. The ſoldiers alſo could mock, and manage their argument againſt him, ſaying, if thou be the King of the Jews, ſave thyſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 37. And they that paſſed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, thou that deſtroyeſt the temple, and buildeſt it in three days, ſave thyſelf. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvii. 39, 40. Likewiſe the chief prieſts, with the ſcribes and elders, mocked among themſelves, ſaying, he ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave. Let Chriſt, the King of Iſrael, deſcend now from the croſs, that we may ſee, and believe, <hi>Mark</hi> xv. 31, 32. One of the thieves alſo railed on him, ſaying, if thou be the Chriſt, ſave thyſelf and us, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 39. And when he cried out to his God, Eli, Eli, &amp;c. they derided him: This man calleth for Elias; let us ſee whether Elias will come and ſave him, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvii. 47, 49. And after he was dead, the chief prieſts and Phariſees ſpake of him as of a known deceiver, ver. 63, and ſeem, in a pious zeal for the church, to take care that there be no further occaſion, after his death, for the reviving and ſpreading of his deceit, and error, ver. 64. Thus the holy one, the pure one, the juſt and true one, in whoſe heart and mouth was no guile found, was numbered among tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, accounted a deceiver, and put to death as a blaſphemer, by the zealous prieſts and profeſſors of that age, who were ſo confident of the righteouſneſs of their cauſe, on the behalf of the law of Moſes, and their ſabbaths, temple, &amp;c. againſt him, that when Pilate waſhed his hands, as clear of his blood, all the people anſwered, and ſaid, his blood be on us, and on our children, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvii. 25.</p>

                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:019435_0034_0FABAC6704A64308"/>Now let men conſider what the great exceptions are, which they have againſt the living appearance of Chriſt in his ſpirit (now towards the cloſe of the apoſtacy) and againſt us his witneſſes, whom the Lord hath called forth to teſtify his name. Many exceptions men have againſt our perſons, our doctrine, our practices, for want of miracles, &amp;c. Is this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration more wiſe or juſt in their exceptions than the former was? Conſider the main ones a little.</p>
               <p>Their great exceptions againſt our doctrine are: 1. That we preach up a light within, and that he that receiveth that light, receiveth a perfect gift; and growing up in it, groweth up to perfection, which in this life, through faith and obedience to this light or perfect gift, may be attained, and the body of ſin put off, and the new man Chriſt put on.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Indeed we cannot but preach up the light within, and declare unto men how great things it hath done for us; even that which we could never by any means meet with from any light without. And this is perfect, and tends to make perfect, carrying on its work daily. Now he that feels its virtue, cannot doubt of its power; he that ſeeth the body of ſin daily going off, cannot doubt but he may be ſtripped. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if a man ſtrive againſt ſin in his own will, and by his own gathered knowledge, he cannot get much ground, and ſo it is hard for him to believe perfection. But he that feels unity with that which is perfect, cannot but acknowledge that it is able to perfect him, and in faith and patience is encouraged to hope and wait for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we deny that Chriſt that died at Jeruſalem, and his imputed righteouſneſs, and ſet up an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:019435_0035_0FABAC67AAF9ADB0"/>Anſwer. We know no other Chriſt than that which died at Jeruſalem, only we confeſs our chief know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him is in ſpirit. And as Chriſt ſaid in the days of his fleſh, that the way to know his father was to know him; and he that knew him knew the father alſo; ſo we now witneſs, that the way to know Chriſt is to know the ſpirit; and he that knoweth the ſpirit, knoweth Chriſt alſo; with whom Chriſt is one, and from whom he cannot be ſeparated. And as for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs, it is too precious a thing to us to be denied by us; that which we deny, is mens putting it out of its place, applying it to them who are nor in the true ſaith, and walk not in the true light: For in the true light, where the fellowſhip is with the father and the ſon, there alone the blood cleanſeth, 1 <hi>John</hi> i. 7. And there alone the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is imputed to him, who is cleanſed by the blood in the light, and not to him who knows it not. And as for inherent righteouſneſs, we meddle not with that word, but this we ſay, that our life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly lies in feeling the righteouſneſs of Chriſt wrought and revealed in us; and we wiſh men could come out of the reaſoning about it, into the feeling of the ſame thing with us: For then we are ſure they would not ſo ſharply, nor ſo long contend.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we deny the ordinances and means of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. We deny nothing that the apoſtles and Chriſtians formerly practiſed; nor do we deny any thing that any now practiſe in the light, and in the faith; but the ſetting up ſuch things in the will, that we deny; or the imitating theſe without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſpirit, that we deny alſo. And this we teſtify, that Antichriſt crept in here, and that they are his great cover to keep men from the life; and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:019435_0036_0FABAC6873222238"/>
therefore warn men to mind the life, and to take heed they be not kept from the ſubſtance by the ſhadows, where Antichriſt lies lurking to bewitch from the ſubſtance. And we are ſure that theſe, in Antichriſt's hands, are not the means of ſalvation; but keep from the ſight of the holy city, where the life and ſalvation is. And we read that the outward count was given to the Gentiles; who trod under foot the holy city, <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 2. And we have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that while we ourſelves were crying up the outward court, we did trample under foot the city, though we then knew it not.</p>
               <p>Their exceptions againſt our perſons are, that we are ignorant, illiterate, and alſo unſettled perſons, who have ſtill been ſeeking up and down, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. What perſons are fitteſt for God to make uſe of, towards the recovery of his people out of the apoſtacy? Doth not God chuſe that which is weak, and mean, and contemptible, that his glory might the more appear? Is not this a more likely way for him to ſteal upon the world, than if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the wiſe and learned ones? And among whom is his appearance to be expected? Among thoſe that are ſettled upon their lees in the apoſtacy? Or among thoſe who have mourned, panted, and ſought to come out of it, and could not be ſettled without his appearing to them, and fixing of their feet upon the rock. But have we been unſettled, ſince God hath faſtened us on the living foundation? Nay, here is no more going out; but he that abides faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, remains a pillar in the houſe of God. Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept likewiſe againſt our practices, as that we ſhew not reſpect to perſons, and that we are not ſtrict, after their manner, in duties, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:019435_0037_0FABAC6969743690"/>Anſwer. We have heard that voice, fear God and give glory to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiv. 7. (not only as it is written there, but in ſpirit) and where the Lord is exalted, the glory of the creature falls: Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> ii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And we cannot, in this mighty day of the Lord, any longer give to man that honor which he hath gathered in the fall, and which pleaſeth the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en nature, and not that which is born of God. And or duties, we have bewailed, in the ſight of the Lord, our former running into duties without his ſpirit: And we muſt confeſs, we can only pray in the ſpirit; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igion conſiſts neither in willing nor running, but in waiting on the ſpirit and power of the Lord, to work all in us and for us. All theſe things we look upon to be our duty, and practiſe them.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe excepted againſt us, that we do not work miracles.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. We point to that which wrought all the outward miracles formerly, and which now worketh great inward miracles in ſpirit; and we are ſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, though Paul had the gift of healing, yet he left Trophimus, at Miletum, ſick, 2d <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 20. Neither was the will or wiſdom of man ſatisfied in all thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that Chriſt and the apoſtles wrought. It is enough for us to feel and live in the moving of the power; in which we rejoice, and are more ſatisfied,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:019435_0038_0FABAC69DDA81638"/>
that by it our names are written in the book of life, than we could by any ſuch outward and viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and manifeſtation of it. But if we did work outward miracles, yet if thou hadſt not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye to ſee them with, thou wouldeſt not be able to diſtinguiſh by what power they were wrought.</p>
               <p>To what purpoſe ſhould I mention any more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars? Is it not enough? Oh! fear before the Lord! and do not loſe the preſent diſpenſation of life through miſtake, or becauſe ye cannot have things ſuited to your corrupt wills; but know the goſpel, which is an inward diſpenſation, and doth not conſiſt in outward ſhadows, but in inward virtue, life and power. For the kingdom of God is righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the holy ſpirit. Come to wait for that, to feel that, to unite there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then we ſhall not differ about that which is outward. But it is Antichriſt's way, by the magiſtrate's power, to force an agreement about the outward, which deſtroys that tenderneſs of conſcience which preſerves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>And now let me put one queſtion to you; where is the deceit of the ages after Chriſt to be expected? Did the Jews deny Moſes and the prophets writings, or ordinances? Nay, were they not very zealous for theſe? And were not theſe their cover under which they perſecuted Chriſt, and vented all their malice againſt him? So can it be expected now, that the deceivers of this age ſhould deny the apoſtle's writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the practices therein mentioned? Of is it not rather to be expected, that under their crying up of theſe, they ſhould hide their enmity againſt the life? Search and ſee, hath not every after-age of profeſſors took up the words and practices of them who were perſecuted in the foregoing age; and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:019435_0039_0FABAC6AA8589918"/>
under the profeſſion of thoſe words and practices, have hid their ſpirit of perſecution? There is a remnant only among profeſſors to be ſaved; the generality of them have ſtill been perſecutors, creeping into the form, getting that for a cover upon their backs, and then fighting againſt the life and power. Oh! wait on the Lord in his fear, that ye may be found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to know the perſecuted truth on the one hand, and the perſecuting ſpirit on the other hand, in this day of large profeſſion, and alſo of bitter perſecution!</p>
               <p>Now what might be the cauſe, or how could it come to paſs, that the zealous worſhippers of that age ſhould thus err in their zeal, and be thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eady and raſh againſt him, whom they looked for to be their Saviour? How came they thus to err in viſion, and ſtumble in judgment, in ſo weighty a matter? Shew unto us the cauſe, that we may ſee whether the ſame cauſe be not in us: For undoubtedly if it be, it will produce the ſame effect; and ſo we may ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly draw upon our heads the ſame heavy wrath in our day, that they did in their day.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. The cauſes were many; I may mention ſome few of the principal ones; which if they be ſeen into and removed, by that power which is able to do it, ſuch as are of a more inferior influence, will not be able to ſtand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One cauſe of their blind zeal, and bitterneſs againſt Chriſt, was their ignorance of the ſcriptures, and of the power of God. If they had known the ſcriptures in the true light, they could not but have known Chriſt, from whom the ſcriptures were given forth; and if they had known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he power of God, they could not but have known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> who came in the power. Yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>

                  </gap>hey had knowledge enough of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the letter:
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:019435_0040_0FABAC6D31B2ABE8"/>
They knew the words of ſcripture, they could make large expoſitions of them. They knew what was ſaid in ſcripture concerning the power of God, but they knew not the thing itſelf; and ſo turned againſt it, and made uſe of the words which came from it, and teſtified of it, againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond cauſe of this their ſad miſcarriage in their zeal was, their putting the law and ordinances, and writings of the prophets, out of their proper places. They exceedingly magnified and cried them up, in that carnal way wherein they apprehended and practiſed them, but underſtood not the right end and uſe of them. And by theſe means, practiſing the ſhadows in the carnal mind, they loſt the ſubſtance, which the proper uſe of the ſhadows was to have pointed them unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their high conceits of the goodneſs of their ſtate in relation to God, and of their certainty of their knowledge of the truths of God, from Moſes and the prophets. They were confident they knew God aright, and that he was their father, and that they were his children and people. And ſo Chriſt's appearing in a ſeeming contrariety to theſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his powerful preaching and miracles, they made no queſtion but they might boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him not to be of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt coming in a way that they looked not for him. They had concluded from the ſcriptures how Chriſt muſt appear; and he coming in a far different manner, they could not own him, but looked upon him as a deceiver, one that pretended to be Chriſt, but was not like to what the ſcriptures ſaid of Chriſt. So what the ſcriptures ſaith of Chriſt's ſecond coming, is hid as much from the carnal eye of profeſſors in this age, as what was ſaid concerning his firſt coming,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019435_0041_0FABAC705CDAA860"/>
was hid from them in their age; and he will ſteal upon them as a thief, at a time, and in a way, and after a manner, that they expect not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. (Which is the main-one, and the cauſe of all the former) becauſe they were from the light within, from the true light in their own hearts and conſciences. The light within is the great ordinance of God, and the proper means to give the knowledge of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 6, without which it was never received under any diſpenſation: For the light that ſhines abroad, or from without, can alone be known and received by the light that ſhines within. Chriſt himſelf opens this in a parable; the light of the body, ſaith he, is the eye; if therefore thine eye be ſingle, clear, without beams or motes, thy whole body ſhall be full of light, <hi>Matt.</hi> vi. 22. But if that be evil, if that be dark, if that be cloſed by the God of this world, all Moſes's words, all the prophets words, yea, all Chriſt and the apoſtles words, cannot give thee light. Can I ſee the light of the ſun, moon, or ſtars, or of any fire or candle, if I have not a natural eye, and if that natural eye be not open? So neither can I ſee the light of any diſpenſation of life, if I have not an eye within me open, wherewith to ſee it. So that which gives me the ſight of the things of God, is the eye which God hath given me; by that may be read the eternal power and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in the creatures, in the books of Moſes and the prophets, in the writings of the evangeliſts and the apoſtles; as the ſpirit leads and opens, yea, the ſame ſpirit that opened to theſe without books, may again open to any of us without books at his pleaſure, and will not be limited to books; and we then may read alſo as they did, even within in the ſpirit, and in the immediate life; but without this, can none of the things of God be read aright. Now the God of this
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:019435_0042_0FABAC7159E39428"/>
world had blinded this eye in the Jews; yea, they themſelves had ſtopped their ears and cloſed their eyes, &amp;c. they would not ſee this way, they would not be converted and healed this way. They would keep up the knowledge which they had gathered from Moſes and the prophets, without this eye; and with that they would ſee, or not at all.</p>
               <p>Thus being from the light within, they could not ſee the place of life within, where life is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: They could not ſee the womb of wiſdom which is within, and ſo could not enter into it, and be born again; and being not born of the wiſdom, how could they juſtify the wiſdom? Being not born of the light, how could they know or own Chriſt, whoſe coming and appearance was in the light? For that appearance of Chriſt the life, in that body of fleſh, could not be diſcerned by all mens wiſdom in the letter; the diſciples themſelves came not ſo to know it, but my father which is in heaven hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it to you. And mark it: The diſciples who were illiterate, and not ſo knowing of the ſcriptures that were written of Chriſt, yet they knew Chriſt: But the ſcribes and Phariſees, who were very ſkilful in the letter, could not know him. What was the reaſon? The reaſon lay in the difference of the eye, or light, wherewith they looked; the one looked with an outward eye, the other with an inward eye. And a little inward light will do that, which a great deal of outward light will not do. And this I can certainly affirm, that all the light that men can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the ſcriptures, cannot give them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt as he hath appeared in this age; nay, nor as he hath appeared in any age, ſince the days of the apoſtles; but a little true inward light will give the knowledge of this thing, and open thoſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019435_0043_0FABAC7165B4C560"/>
infallibly, in its ſeaſon, which all the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of wife and learned men have been controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſputing about, in that wiſdom and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit which is never to underſtand them. This then is the main and full reaſon of this deep error of the Jews, and their deſperate ſplitting upon the rock, which would have ſaved them. They were begotten of the letter, which was given forth in former ages; but not of the life, which was raiſed up in their age; and ſo they knew not how to turn to the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which alone was able to give them the true and certain knowledge of the things of God.</p>
               <p>Now conſider theſe things well, O ye profeſſors of this age! and take heed that ye do not fall after the ſame example of unblief. Be not high-minded, but fear. Be not ſo confident of what you have gathered by your wiſdom for truth from the ſcriptures, after the manner that they were, of what they had gathered by their wiſdom; but fear leſt ye ſhould be miſtaken as they were; and wait for the opening of that light in you, which was ſhut in them; even the true eye, in the true light, by the holy anointing; where there never was nor can be any miſtake. The Jews fell by unbelief. Unbelief of what? They believed the ſcriptures, they believed according to that knowledge they had gathered from the ſcriptures; but they did not believe in the living word. They had a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge abiding in them, which they had gathered from the ſcriptures, but they had not the living word abiding in them; and ſo their faith was but unbelief, for the living faith ſtands in the belief of the living word in the heart, which the ſcriptures direct to; without the knowledge of which, all knowledge of words is vain; and without faith in which, all faith is vain alſo. Now ſaith the apoſtle to the Gentile,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019435_0044_0FABAC721E532F00"/>
Chriſtian, thou ſtandeſt by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 20. By what faith? By faith in that word in the heart, which they neglected and turned from, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 8. For Moſes had taught them, after the laws and ordinances about worſhip and ſacrifices, that the word that they were to obey and do, the word that could give them life, and make them obedient to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments without, was in their heart and mouth, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxx. 14. And ſo the prophet Micah, when they propoſed ſacrifices and oil to pleaſe God with, brings them to this, which was given to them in common with mankind, <hi>Micah</hi> vi. 8. For all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and laws, and obſervations, and practices without, are but to bring the life within, which is to be found again there, where it was loſt, and ſtill lies ſlain and hid, even in the field or houſe where it was loſt. And he that ſeeks abroad, never finds it, but when the candle is lighted in his own houſe, and he ſearches narrowly in the field, in his own heart, and the eternal eye begins to open in him; then he cries God was in this place, and I was not aware of it. Ah! how the enemy bewitched me, to run from mountain to mountain! and from hill to hill! and hath hereby covered my eye from beholding the mountain of the Lord's houſe, and from feeling the ſpring of my life, which I further and further ran from, all the while I was ſeeking abroad. Therefore, O ye profeſſors, be not ſo conceited like the Jews, and running after them into their deſolation and miſery, but learn wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by their fall! Do not you ſet up their ordinances and ſcriptures, after the manner they ſet up theirs; for this is your danger, for this I clearly, in the light of the Lord, teſtify to you, that if ye gather a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſdom from the letter of the ſcriptures, after the manner that they did, without knowledge
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019435_0045_0FABAC72E2587330"/>
from the word within, and without a light within from that word, ye loſe the living faith; ye are but dead branches, and your knowledge of ſcriptures, and practices, and faith, and duties, &amp;c. that ye here hold and obſerve, are but for the fire; and the flames of eternal wrath ſhall kindle more fiercely upon you becauſe of them, than upon the Jews; for ye ſtumble at the ſame ſtumbling-ſtone at which they ſtumbled and fell, and it will fall upon you alſo. And as you have more ſcriptures than they had, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e experience of their fall to warn you, ſo your deſtruction will be exceeding dreadful if you neglect ſo great ſalvation; whereof at this day there are ſo many living and powerful witneſſes, as they are known and owned to be in the light of the Lord, though deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your exalted and conceited wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Now to help any honeſt and ſingle hearts among you over this great ſtumbling-block of a light within, conſider theſe few things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the knowledge, all the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ever ye had of God, was from a light within. I do not deny that ye might receive your knowledge through the ſcriptures, and ſome warmth formerly in thoſe things which ye call ordinances and duties; but that whereby ye received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was the light within, the eye that God ſecretly opened in your ſpirits. This was the way ye then came by it, though ye perhaps might feel the thing, but not know how ye came by it; even as a babe may ſee truly, but doth not underſtand its own eye, or know how it ſees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. While this eye was kept open in you, your knowledge was true in its meaſure, and ſerviceable to you, and did draw you nearer to God, making you truly tender, meek, ſweet, humble, patient,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019435_0046_0FABAC739C2932B0"/>
loving, gentle, and of precious breathing towards God, and after righteouſneſs. Oh! how lovely were you to God in this ſtate? When Iſrael was a child, I loved him. God remembereth at this day the kindneſs of your youth, and is ſeeking after you. Oh! why do you ſo harden your hearts againſt him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. That where-ever this eye is ſhut, the virtue of the true knowledge is loſt, and the ſweet fruits thereof wither. The outward part of the knowledge may be retained; yea, perhaps much increaſed, but the life is gone, and the pure ſweet ſavourineſs, to God, vaniſhed. And if this eye were but a little opened againſt you, your death and unſavourineſs might ſoon be ſeen and felt in you, in all your knowledge, duties, ordinances; yea, in your very graces and experiences. You have a faith ſtill; yea, but it wants the ſavour of your former faith: Ye have ſome kind of love, gentleneſs, and meekneſs; yea, but it is only a thing formed by the fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and reaſoning, but not natural from the living ſpring, not ſuch as ye once felt, &amp;c. for the true and living eye being ſhut, that which is then beſt, or afterwards attained, is held but in the dead part, and ſerves but to feed death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The great work and deſign of the enemy of your ſouls, is not to ſteal away the bulk of your knowledge, or to draw you from ordinances or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but to ſteal the life out of your ſpirits. This I have experienced from my childhood: I might ſtill have knowledge enough of any kind; but that which I wanted was life, and I was ſtill ſick under all the ſorts of knowledge that ever I met with, and under all ordinances and duties, for want of life. The Lord had given my ſoul a taſte of true life, whereby I became unſatisfied without it, and no
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:019435_0047_0FABAC75C8DEF730"/>
manner of knowledge or enjoyment could take me up by the way: Yea, when through extremity I ſeemed willing to be content with any thing; yet ſtill my heart was ſick after that one thing, which alone could truly eaſe and ſatisfy it. Now if the enemy can prevail herein, to blind the inward eye, and ſteal away the life within, he hath enough. Then abound as much as thou wilt in knowledge, in zeal, in duties, in ordinances, in reading ſcriptures, praying, meditating, &amp;c. thou art the ſurer his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and ſo much the better ſervant to him; for how much the richer thou art in knowledge, experiences, hopes, and aſſurance, without the life or power, ſo much the more acceptable, and honorable, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, art thou in his kingdom.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſee where ye are; is the inward eye open in you? Do you know the light within? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that ſees by a light within, can hardly ſpeak evil of it. Or hath the enemy, by ſome of his arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, drawn a veil over that eye wherewith once ye ſaw in ſome meaſure? Oh! be not ſlight in a matter of ſo great weight! Oh! pleaſe not yourſelves with the eye of the periſhing wiſdom, with death's eye, and with death's knowledge of ſcriptures, and the Son of God; which ſpeaks great words of the ſame of true wiſdom, but is a ſtranger and enemy to the thing! Oh! life is precious! eternal life is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious! To have the word of God abiding in the heart, and to feel the true light give the true life, who can ſet a value on this? Ah! do not loſe your ſouls for a trifle, for a little ſuch knowledge of the ſcriptures, as the earthly part can gather!</p>
               <p>This I cannot but exceedingly deſpiſe, although the ſcriptures I truly honor, for their teſtimony of that whereby I live. If ye ſee not the way of life
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:019435_0048_0FABAC790EA782B8"/>
by the inward light, which alone can ſhew it, ye loſe your ſouls. If the god of the world hath blinded that eye in you, what are all your treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge? What are all your hopes? And what will become of you? All theſe ſparks of your own kindling from ſcripture, will not ſecure you from the bed of ſorrow. O ye ſeveral ſorts of profeſſors, why will ye die with the uncircumciſed? Why will ye go down into the pit, among them that know not the Lord?</p>
               <p>But what ſhall I ſay to this generation? The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually-wiſe foreſeeth the ſtorm and hideth himſelf; but the ſpiritually-fooliſh run on headily, and are puniſhed. The clouds have long been gathering; but the ſick eye cannot diſcern the ſigns of the times and ſeaſons; and ſo becauſe judgment comes not as men expected, they grow hard, and wear off the ſenſe wherewith they were ſomewhat affected at the firſt threatening of it, but aſſuredly both judgment and mercy haſten, and they will come, and will not tarry.</p>
               <p>For the ſame Lord God Almighty, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the heathen Babel, when their ſins and vain confidence were ripe, which they built to prevent any future flood, for though they once had the true knowledge of God from an inward light, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 21, yet they ſoon left that, not liking to retain God in their knowledge, ver. 28, but running out into ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and ſo building a Babel, whereby their fooliſh hearts became darkened to the light which God had made to ſhine in them; which ſhewed what might be known of God unto them, ver. 19. Yea, the Lord God which overthrew the Jews Babel, which they had built from their knowledge of the laws and ordinances of Moſes, and the ſcriptures written to them, they running out into imaginations
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:019435_0049_0FABAC79F6D235D0"/>
alſo, whereby they likewiſe thought to prevent the overflowing ſcourge from coming near them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxviii. 15, the ſame God will overthrow the Chriſtians Babel, which they have built from the prophets and apoſtles words, by their own imaginations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings in the high-mindedneſs, out of the fear, whereby they think to eſcape the deluge of eternal wrath. For their city alſo ſhall be thrown down with violence, and ſhall be found no more at all, <hi>Rev.</hi> xviii. 21. And the great work of this day is to diſcover the rottenneſs of their wall, and the untempered<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the mortar wherewith they have daubed it. He that readeth, let him underſtand; but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in heart and ears cannot.</p>
               <p>"But the Lord will manifeſt all things in his time, and give his truth a paſſage in the earth, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a quiet habitation therein, how black ſoever the face of things now appear, as relating to them. Oh! how happy will the day be, when the Lord ſhall have wrought down the ſelfiſh ſpirit in man, and ſhall have raiſed up his own noble and equal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>THESE have always been the enemies and oppoſers of truth, and ſetters up of falſe images thereof in all ages; the wiſe, the learned, the great diſputants. To theſe truth has ſtill been mean and contemptible, their eye hath ſtill over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked it, and their imaginations have ſtill outrun it, finding out ſomewhat elſe in the ſtead thereof; for which they have been ſtill able and vigorous to contend, and againſt the truth itſelf. And indeed how can the wiſe eye ſee that, how can the learned eye acknowledge that, which comes quite out of the way of its knowledge and learning, even in a path that it is not at all acquainted with? Wiſdom is juſtified of her children. Thoſe that are wiſe to ſalvation, thoſe that are learned in the ſpirit, thoſe that can diſpute in the power of the life and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit, theſe know her habitation, and her out-goings, and can own her in every age, and in every diſpenſation and coming forth: But the wiſe and learned of this world are ſhut out of this wiſdom, and in all the ſearches after truth cannot find her; and if at any time they do find and taſte ſomewhat of her, yet they cannot keep her; but the wiſdom, and learning, and ſtrength of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

part in them, ſoon betrays and makes a prey of the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, and of his pure goſpel; which cannot be comprehended, nor will take up a dwelling-place with this wiſdom, but brings it to nothing, tramples upon it, and keeps it down for ever, where it abides.</p>
               <p>Three ſorts of enemies, of the wiſe, the learned, the great diſputants, truth always had. Firſt, of ſuch as have denied the true form of knowledge and worſhip. Secondly, of ſuch as have owned the form, but denied the power. Thirdly, of ſuch as have had a taſte of the power, but afterwards erred from it; and ſo held that, which they had once a true taſte of, in the unrighteous part, and likewiſe added to it by their own imaginations.</p>
               <p>When Iſrael was in Egypt, that poor illiterate company of brick-makers, in bondage under that wiſe people, the Egyptians, with all their wiſdom, could not own their God, or their worſhip; but their God was an unknown being to all that wiſdom, <hi>Ex.</hi> v. 2, and his worſhip and ſacrifice the abomination of their eyes, <hi>Ex.</hi> viii. 26. And Jannes and Jambres, with other wiſe magicians, withſtood the appearance of God; and Pharaoh and his people, with their wiſdom, thought to have kept God's Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael from multiplying, <hi>Ex.</hi> i. 10, and to have held Iſrael ſtill under their ſervitude, after the Lord was riſen to ſtretch out his arm for their deliverance, <hi>Ex.</hi> v. 8, 9. And how did all the wiſe nations ſtill watch to make a prey of God's Jeruſalem? How did they count the towers? How often did they think to divide the ſpoil? <hi>Judg,</hi> v. 28 <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxxiii. 18. How did Senacherib and Rabſheka make her their own? And when the Lord did at any time give Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the robbers, how did they think
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:019435_0053_0FABAC7CB566B338"/>
to keep her under for ever? The wiſe Aſſyrian, the Moabite, the Ammonite, the Edomite, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine, the Amalekite, the wiſe Babylonian, or Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, thought to keep her under, as Pharaoh had done, even till their wiſdom and knowledge pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlvii. 18; and the prince of Tyre, who was wiſer than Daniel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxviii. 3, he alſo could inſult over Jeruſalem, and rejoice at her down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall and captivity, chap. xxvi. 2.</p>
               <p>But to come cloſer; come to Iſrael itſelf. That people, by all the wiſdom it could gather from the law, by all the experiences it had had of God's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by all the faith that was wrought in them upon deliverances, yet had not eyes to ſee, nor ears to hear, nor hearts to perceive; but were a people that did always err in their hearts, and did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the way of truth and peace. The prophets among them ſtill fools; yea, the ſpiritual man mad, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> ix. 7. The prieſts were generally ignorant of the Lord, for though they had the ark of his preſence, his tabernacle, his temple, altar, ſacrifices, worſhip, &amp;c. yet they did not know where he was, nor did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after him, but contented themſelves with a form of knowledge and worſhip. And they that handled the law, knew not him that gave the law, and was the ſole true interpreter of the law; but the paſtors tranſgreſſed againſt him, and the prophets propheſied by another ſpirit, <hi>Jer.</hi> ii. 8. They were wiſe, and did abound in their own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, gueſſings, and gathered knowledge; but they knew not the truth, no not of the letter according to the law, and according to that light which God ſometimes cauſed to ſhine among them from his prophets. Hence it was that that people, with their rulers, their teachers, their prieſts, their prophets, were generally enemies to the prophets whom God

raiſed up, hating, perſecuting, impriſoning, ſtoning them, &amp;c. The prophets of God, that ſpake his truth in his wiſdom, in his life and power, in the demonſtration of his ſpirit, they could not away with; theſe were fools with them, theſe were mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with them, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> ix. 11, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxix. 26.

It preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hangs down its head: Nay, if he do but ſo much as hide his face, it is troubled; and all the fullneſs, which it immediately before had from God, is not able to keep up its life one moment; but it pants, and fails, and withers, until a new ſupply of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be adminiſtered to it. And he that knows this in any meaſure will not wonder at the diſtreſs and miſery of ſuch, for want of God's preſence; and at their cryings out after the ſpring of their life, even as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, though
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:019435_0055_0FABAC81AEAEB2E8"/>
they ſhould have fullneſs of all outward things, yea, and alſo fullneſs of knowledge in things of religion, even concerning all conditions and eſtates. The thing that I wanted in my great miſery, it was not outward knowledge, it was not experience of God's mercy and goodneſs; but this I wanted, the iſſuings forth of his freſh life, and livingly to know where to wait for it, and livingly to know it when it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For it was ſtill near me all the time of my darkneſs, and did preſerve me, and appear unto me; but I livingly knew it not, but thought I would be wiſer than others: For I ſaw many deceived, and ſo I would not own it in ſuch a way as it then appeared in me, leſt I alſo ſhould be deceived like others; but waited for ſuch an appearance as could not be queſtioned by the fleſhly wiſdom. And he that waits for that, and ſo deſpiſes the day of ſmall things, cannot but refuſe the little ſeed; and ſo, not being received into his earth, it can never grow up in him into a great tree; whereby the glory of the kingdom will be hid from him, and he ſhut out of it, when others enter into and ſit down in it. Therefore, he that will be wiſe, let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe; let him receive that for his light, his king, his guide, which man's wiſdom never did, nor never will own. He that ever looks to enjoy the comforter, let him receive the reprover, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincer of ſin, and wait for his law of judging him through the whole courſe of his ſinful ſtate and nature, paſſing along with him through the whole condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until he arrive with him at the juſtification of the life, which the fleſhly wiſdom, nor any of his knowledge of the things of God, as they are held in the fleſhly part, muſt never arrive with him at.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:019435_0056_0FABAC82C8D8ADD0"/>Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world?</p>
               <p>The wiſdom of this world is precious in the eye of the world; and the wiſdom of God, in his poor, weak, deſpiſed earthen veſſels, is ſtill fooliſhneſs with them; but the Lord ſo orders it, that he ſtill juſtifies his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed wiſdom in his deſpiſed veſſels, and makes the wiſdom of the world appear fooliſh to all the ſingle and upright-hearted who thirſt after, and wait for the revelation of his truth. Now two ways eſpecially the Lord makes the folly of this world's wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:</p>
               <p>Firſt, in that by all their wiſdom they cannot find out the true knowledge of God, ver. 21. The world by wiſdom knew not God. Though there be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding deſire kindled in them to know God; though they take all the ways that heart can imagine to attain their deſires; though they ſtudy and meditate ever ſo hard; though they get ever ſo many arts and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; nay, though they read the very ſcriptures ever ſo diligently; though they keep ever ſo ſtrict to the forms of church orders and diſciplines; even though they labour in the very fire; yet what they get, what they gather, what they underſtand, what they comprehend by this wiſdom, it is all but very vanity, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 13. It reaches not the immortal, it nouriſhes not the immortal, it ſatisfies not the ſoul, it refreſhes not the ſeed; but only feeds and pleaſes the earthly part, the earthly underſtanding, the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind, the earthly deſires and affections; even the man's part, the man's ſpirit, the man's nature; which though elevated and raiſed ever ſo high, is ſtill but earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that all their wiſdom cannot teach them to come down to, to ſubmit to, to come
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:019435_0057_0FABAC8367A8E0B8"/>
into God's way of having their wiſdom crucified, and that raiſed up in them which might receive the truth. This they can never learn in the fleſhly wiſdom. They may indeed come thus far, even to ſee that there is no way of entrance but by death; and to ſeek death, that they may enter into the life, but they cannot find it. The ſeed of Jacob, in his ſeeking, miſſes not; but this ſeeker never finds; to this aſker it is never given, and to this knocker it is never opened: And that is it which makes this wiſdom in every appearance, in every ſort of profeſſion and ſect of profeſſors, ſo rage at the ſeed of Jacob, even becauſe it finds itſelf ſtill ſhut out of the life into which an entrance is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to the ſeed. And how can that which would fain have the kingdom, but rage againſt that which takes the inheritance from it? How can every ſort of profeſſors but ſtrive to ſlay the heir, that the inheritance may be theirs? Were it not for the living ſeed, and the living power and virtue, which break forth in them and among them, the religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the firſt birth might paſs for current; but this is it which darkens the glory of all profeſſions and profeſſors upon the earth, even that living thing which God hath begotten in his people, and his living preſence with it, and bleſſing upon it. At this all the zealous ſacrificers, teachers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, out of the life, rage and are mad, and would break the cords and bands wherewith this ſtrives to bind them unto God's altar.</p>
               <p>Now look over all ages; could the wiſe heathen ſtoop to God's diſpenſation to the Jews? Was it not fooliſhneſs and abomination to them? Or could the wiſe Jews ſtoop to the law within, to the word in the heart, although directed thereto by Moſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxx. 14, to learn there to do juſtly, to love mercy,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:019435_0058_0FABAC84229A42D8"/>
and to walk humbly with their God? <hi>Micah</hi> vi. 8. Could they wait there to have their hearts circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by that word of power, and ſo to be waſhed and made clean? Nay, were they not drowned in the outward ſacrifices, temple, incenſe, new-moons and ſabbaths, and ſuch kind of obſervations, and could not hear the truth of the Lord as it was delivered by Moſes, nor as it was opened by the prophets? <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 2. So that this people, ſeeking to know the Lord from the letter, by this wiſdom, could never come to the knowledge of him, but the place of his light and wiſdom was hid from them.</p>
               <p>Again, when Chriſt came (in the days that are paſt) and the kingdom was preached, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting way of redemption and ſalvation made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, could the wiſe eye in the Greeks, or the wiſe eye in the Jews, ſee it? Did not the Greeks ſhut themſelves out by a wiſdom above the letter (as they thought) and the Jews by a knowledge and wiſdom which they had gathered out of the letter? How wiſe were they from the letter to reaſon againſt the king of life? This man cannot be of God, for he is a breaker of his ſabbath. He is a Nazarite, and can any good thing come out of Nazareth? He ſaith the ſon of man muſt be lifted up, but we read that Chriſt abideth for ever.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle Jude compares ſuch to the angels that kept not their firſt eſtate; the angels that fell had a place and ſtanding once in the truth, but they kept it not, they abode not in the truth, but fell from it, and ſo became devils, enemies to the truth from which they fell: So thoſe that fall from the truth, from the power, from the living virtue whereof they once taſted, from the true wiſdom which once appeared to them, and begun to ſeaſon and ſavour them, in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:019435_0059_0FABAC84E6E32788"/>
their fallen wiſdom they become the greateſt enemies, the greateſt accuſers, the greateſt oppoſers, and the ſtiffeſt maintainers of a falſe image of that truth which they once had ſome knowledge of, and ſome unity with. Thus it was in the Jewiſh ſtate: Now come to the apoſtles days. Firſt, they had all the wiſe men of that age againſt them; all the wiſe Greeks, all the wiſe Jews, the learned men, the able diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of all ſorts. The Greeks could not find wiſdom in that knowledge of Chriſt which they held forth, nor the Jews could not find power in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 22; and ſo one accounted it fooliſhneſs, the other ſtumbled at it, ver. 23. There were many ſorts and ſects of wiſe men among the Jews, but not one ſort could own the truth, though they were looking for it, ſearching the ſcriptures about it, and diſputing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. The very thing then in agitation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry among them was, when the kingdom of God ſhould come. The king himſelf directs them where it was, that they might know where to expect and wait for it, <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 21, and in many parables opens it to them; but it was ſtill hid from the eye of that wiſdom wherewith they did ſtrive to ſee, underſtand and comprehend it. So that all the ſeveral ſorts of wiſe men of that age, even thoſe who were admirers of the law and prophets, yet were ſtrangers and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the truth, becauſe they joined to that wiſdom, and to that learning and comprehenſion of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, out of the ſight whereof it came.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for ſuch as did own Chriſt after the fleſh, ſuch as were convinced by his miracles, as Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus and many of the more honeſt ſort of the Jews were; yet Chriſt did not commit himſelf to them, <hi>John</hi> ii. 24. He knew this faith, and this owning of him, which was founded upon the wiſdom and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:019435_0060_0FABAC859E05F190"/>
of the creature, would fail; and ſo he would not own it in Nicodemus, but bids him look after the new birth, <hi>John</hi> iii. 2, 3; nor in ſuch as followed him up and down, upon this or any other fleſhly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but ſometimes withdrew, and hid himſelf from them, <hi>Luke</hi> v. 16, <hi>John</hi> vi. 14, 15; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preached doctrines which ſtumbled them, and made them withdraw from him, <hi>John</hi> vi. 66. And ſo in the apoſtles days there were many that could get the form, and gain advantage thereby to the fleſhly wiſdom, to withſtand the power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there were ſuch as had taſted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and of the powers of the world to come, and yet fell away, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4—6. There were ſuch as denied the Lord who bought them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 1, ſuch as fell from the love of the truth, to the love of the world again, ver. 22, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 10.</p>
               <p>Such as had a ſtanding in the church's heaven (like the angels which fell) but kept not their habitation, but were ſwept down from thence to the earth by the dragon's tail, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. iv. theſe are the nobleſt cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions (in the earthly wiſdom, and for a corrupt eſtate and falſe image) of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now as the prophets of God among the Jews had theſe enemies, and as the apoſtles alſo had theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo all along the apoſtaſy theſe enemies have been rife. The witneſſes have had a wiſe ſort of direct oppoſers among the Papiſts, a wiſe ſort of ſecret underminers among the Proteſtants, and alſo another wiſe ſort of them among themſelves, as had ſome taſte of the truth, but departed from the power of it into the earthly wiſdom, and underſtanding; and this laſt ſort fight more furiouſly and more vehemently againſt the truth, and are more ſubtle to aſſault it,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:019435_0061_0FABAC86807ED8A8"/>
than the other two. Oh! there is no ſuch bitter, deadly enemy to Chriſt and his truth, as he who once had ſome taſte of the virtue of it, and is now turned from it into the earth, into the wiſdom and love of the world, and yet ſtill holds ſome of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that truth, whereof he once felt the power, in the earthly part.</p>
               <p>To come yet cloſer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is in every man, not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſanctified, that wiſdom which is not of God; that wiſdom from which God hides his precious truths; which wiſdom lies ready to catch every diſcovery and revelation of truth to him, that it might improve it, and grow rich and wiſe by it. Now this wiſdom cannot attain to the knowledge of any of the things of God; neither can this wiſdom keep the true knowledge; but whatever this wiſdom catcheth, it preſently corrupts. The true wiſdom, the true light, the true knowledge of Chriſt, is like the manna in the wilderneſs; it daily comes down from heaven, and muſt daily be gathered freſh. The true light ſprings from the life, and muſt be held in the life, in the veſſel which the life forms, in the new bottle, in the new underſtanding; not in the fleſhly part, nay, not in the natural part; for as the natural man cannot receive the things of the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14, ſo neither can he retain them. The old ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, into which earthly things were gathered, muſt be burnt up, and not made a treaſury for the things of God; but the new underſtanding, which is given by him that is true, 1 <hi>John,</hi> v. 20, which new forms and preſerves, and is all in the natural. Sink out of the earthly part, and read, that thou mayeſt be able to ſay within thyſelf, and concerning thyſelf, where is the wiſe? Where is the ſcribe? Where is the diſputer?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:019435_0062_0FABAC8822CB5D28"/>The wiſe part, the knowing part, the reaching part, in every man, will be putting forth its hand to gather of the tree of life; but what hath it ever been able to gather? I know men may gather notions of any kind, of any ſect, of any ſort of profeſſors, of any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or diſpenſation; but who is able to come near the life, to touch the power, the truth, the everlaſting ſpring, or any ſtream or drop of water that iſſues from it? And he who hath a true touch or taſte thereof given him, can his wiſdom add to it? Nay, can he ſo much as retain it? David had a true ſenſe and experience of this, who cried out, O continue thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart. Indeed if he like not to retain the thing itſelf in his knowledge, he may improve the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bend that to the diſpoſition of the earthly part in himſelf and others; but this is not the truth, but a dead image, or a dead remembrance of what once was truly living. Oh! how doth the ſoul that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the divine breath, that is born of the living power and virtue, depend upon God for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual breathing? There is nothing that hath ſo much from God, and yet nothing is ſo little able to live without him. If he withdraws from it, he is againſt God's temple, againſt God's day of worſhip, gives his diſciples ſuch ſcope and liberty, as neither the Phariſees nor John gave their diſciples; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles our ſtrict and godly teachers and expounders of the law, calling them hypocrites, blind guides, &amp;c. And mark with what a rough ſevere ſpirit he reproves them; whereas they call him maſter, and ſpeak mildly and gently to him. Oh! what Jew in that nature, in that wiſdom, in that ſpirit, could but find matter and occaſion of ſtumbling at Chriſt, even from the law and the prophets?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:019435_0063_0FABAC889ABA25D8"/>And as they have ſtumbled at the diſpenſation and appearance of God's ſpirit in all former ages, ſo have all the generations of wiſe men ſince the apoſtaſy, all the learned men generally, their councils, ſynods, convocations, and aſſemblies, been ſtumbling at the appearance of his ſpirit in this age, looking for ſome ſuch like building as had been in the apoſtles days, and not underſtanding or obſerving how the Lord hath took down that building, as it had been ſet up in the world, and how he prepared a place in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his true church, of which Chriſt is the head, unto which he gave her wings to fly. <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. And how afterwards the falſe woman, or falſe church, got up in her ſtead, who with a golden cup of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication bewitched the kings and inhabitants of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 2, even peoples, multitudes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tongues, ver. 15. So that they miſtook her for the true church, and went into her bed of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Which of all the learned men, which of all the councils of the Papiſts, have ſeen this, nay which of the Proteſtant councils, or convocations, or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, have beheld the ſtate of the true church? Nay, have not every ſort and ſect of the Proteſtants endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to build up ſome image or likeneſs of the true church; not ſo much as ſuſpecting that ſhe was fled into, and was to abide in the wilderneſs for a time, times, and half a time? Oh! what darkneſs hath covered the earth, and groſs darkneſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Oh! how hath God befooled the wiſe men of every ſort! the wiſe men of every age! the wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as well as the wiſe Papiſts! the wiſe Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Baptiſts, and Quakers, as well the wiſe Epiſcopalians and Preſbyterians! And how blind and ſottiſh are nations and people, that ſtill they think to find out the truth by having a ſynod, aſſembly or

convocation of the wiſe men gathered together! to keep up ſtrict their forms of church orders, and rules of diſcipline; indeed they are fitteſt to rear up an image, like Babel, to pleaſe the earthly part of man, and the earthly powers and intereſts, but truth never came in by that way, but the wiſe and learned have ſtill been ſhut out from it, and have proved enemies to it. And whoſoever comes out of the apoſtaſy from the ſpirit and from the truth, to the truth and ſpirit again, ſhall find nothing ſo great an enemy as the wiſdom in himſelf, and directions from the wiſdom in others: For that which God leads is a ſimple, a weak babe, a child to the wiſdom of this world, and he leads it in a path which is wholly out of the line of this world's wiſdom and knowledge of the ſcriptures, as the path God choſe in Chriſt, and the apoſtles days, that are paſt, was out of the line of the Jews knowledge or the ſcriptures. Such is the recovery out of the apoſtaſy: It is hid from all the fleſhly-wiſe men of this age, even as the entrance into the truths of the kingdom was hid from all the fleſhly-wiſe men of that age. Happy is he who ceaſeth from ſtriving after the knowledge and comprehending of the things of God in this world's ſpirit and wiſdom, and waiteth in the hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <head>A <hi>WARNING,</hi> in the Bonds of Love, to the Rulers, Teachers, and People of this Nation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Church and Miniſtry.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>THAT there was a fight between the dragon and his angels, and Michael and his angels, concerning the new-teſtament church and miniſtry, is manifeſt even from the letter of the ſcriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>That the dragon and his angels, though they could not get the better, as relating to the power, yet they did get the better as relating to the form, inſomuch as that they overcame the third part of the true miniſters, and drew them from their ſtanding in the firmament of God's power, off to their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtry; and that the true church herſelf alſo was fain to fly into the wilderneſs, from the face of the dragon, for her ſafety and preſervation, where ſhe was to be nouriſhed and fed by God, all the time of Antichriſt's reign; this likewiſe is not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the ſpirit, but is alſo manifeſt from the letter, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii.</p>
            <p>That after this flight of the true church, and overcoming of the true miniſtry, the dragon erected his falſe church and miniſtry, which had but at beſt the form without the power, over all nations, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, multitudes and tongues; this is alſo as evident, to them that read the prophecies of the revelations, in the light of that ſpirit in which they were wrote. Is not the falſe woman, after the true woman was fled, manifeſtly deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. which hath a bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fornications? ver. 2, 4. Mark ſhe has not the true cup of, her cup is not filled with the wine of the kingdom, it is not the cup of the true ſpouſe, who keeps chaſte and loyal to her huſband, but the cup of fornication, wherein is a form of doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:019435_0066_0FABAC8D14F4DE40"/>
and diſcipline, and order, and church government, which leads from the life, which bewitches from the power, which lulls aſleep in a form of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and worſhip of Chriſt, without knowledge of, guidance by, and ſubjection to his ſpirit. And this is the government, miniſtry, and way of Antichriſt, wherever it is found; how curiouſly ſoever the cup be gilded, yet it is but the cup of fornication, which bewitcheth the heart with its golden appearance, and then leads it into adultery from the life.</p>
            <p>And the dragon doth not only ſet up a falſe church over the nations, in many parts whereof the truth had before appeared, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 15, but a falſe miniſtry alſo.</p>
            <p>There is a falſe prophet, which deceiveth with miracles and falſe appearances of truth, advanced in this corrupt ſtate; which falſe prophet continues and upholds his deceit over the nations, till the mighty appearance of Chriſt, in ſpirit and power, doth judge him, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 20, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 8. There is a beaſt, with horns like a lamb, who doth great wonders, ſo that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth, in the ſight of men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth them that dwell on the earth, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 13, 14. Inſomuch that he draws the kings and inhabiters of the earth, in a myſtery of deceit, into the bed of whoredom and falſe worſhip, inſtead of the pure way of life, and pure worſhip of the living God, in his ſpirit, and in his truth, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 2.</p>
            <p>Is it not further manifeſt, that this falſe church and falſe miniſtry, ſet up in the world by the power of the dragon, perſecuted God's witneſſes to the truth in all the ages of Antichriſt's reign? So ſoon as the church was fled into the wilderneſs, the dragon forthwith went to make war with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:019435_0067_0FABAC8D206964D0"/>
of her ſeed which keep the commandments of God, and had the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 17. And it was given unto him to make war with the ſaints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, tongues and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names are not written in the book of life, of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world; if any man have an ear, let him hear, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 7, 8, 9. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beaſt, that the image of the beaſt ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the image of the beaſt ſhould be killed. And he cauſeth all both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their forehead; and that no man might buy or ſell, ſave he that had the mark, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 15, 16, 17. Yea, the woman, the falſe church, which the dragon had ſet up, by his power in the nations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the true, was drunken with the blood of the ſaints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 6. Oh! the miſery, and lamentable hard uſage of the witneſſes of Jeſus, who have been true lambs born of the power, faithful to the power, witneſſing againſt every form and appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, doctrine, and worſhip, which hath appeared without the power, even in the days of greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and higheſt devotion under the apoſtaſy from the power; how have theſe been reviled, and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and devoured, by the wolves in the ſheep cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who had got the outſide, the garment, the name of Chriſt and Chriſtianity, the profeſſion of church, miniſtry, and ordinances, but have wanted the life, the virtue, the thing itſelf; and ſo have turned againſt

it, and kept it down, that they might keep up their form! O! ye profeſſors, conſider, hath it not been ſo in all former ages, and is it not ſo in this preſent age? For let but the ſpirit and power appear, the form with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power is ſoon detected to be what it is. And this properly Antichriſt, and Antichriſtianiſm, viz. not openly to appear in a direct denial of Chriſt, his truths, and worſhip, but to ſet a way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worſhip without his ſpirit. Another ſpirit creeping into the form, that is Antichriſt, and the ſetting up obſervation and practice of the form out of the life and power, that is Antichriſtianiſm, and this is the perſecutor, deſtroyer, and devourer, about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Now though the Lord hath ſuffered this falſe church and falſe prophet to reign long in the dragon's power, and to revile and perſecute his poor lambs, in every age of Antichriſt's reign; yet the Lord hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſeaſon to judge this falſe church, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 1, to caſt the falſe prophet into the lake, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 20. Yea, and to torment with fire and brimſtone all the falſe worſhippers, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiv. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Oh! how deeply doth it concern this land! her rulers, her teachers, yea the whole people thereof, to conſider their ways, to conſider their worſhip, to conſider their church-ſtate, to conſider their miniſtry, that they be not overwhelmed at unawares in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wrath of the Almighty, before which there is no ſtanding? Oh! that they could mourn, and pray, and wait for the eye of God's ſpirit; for his pure light, which ſearcheth and diſcovereth all the deceits of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; that they might not be bewitched, with any of the wine of the fornication of the falſe woman, whoſe heart is ſnares and nets, and her hands as bands, to entangle her lovers in, and keep them from the

            <p>If men conſult concerning theſe things in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the fleſh, they will be entangled, and err; for that eye cannot ſee the myſteries of the kingdom, or the courſe either of truth or deceit. The goſpel, the eternal truth, the true church, the true miniſtry, are all ſpiritual, not new ſhadows, as the things under the miniſtration of the law were, but the ſpirit and ſubſtance, and they can only be ſeen by the ſpiritual eye of the children of wiſdom. The wiſe and diligent enquirers into the comprehending part, cannot find the womb or the way of life, or the way of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that which is begotten in the life, or God's way of miniſtry, which he hath appointed for the feeding and preſerving of the life. The prophets of old could not be known, diſcerned, or owned, by the fleſhly eye of obſervation in Iſrael after the fleſh, but they ſtill rejected them, eſteeming and magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the falſe prophets above them; how much leſs can the prophets and miniſters of the new-teſtament be ſeen by man's eye? Are they the prophets and miniſters of Chriſt, which a nation cries up for ſuch, and which the eye of wiſe men therein admires, and pitches upon? Or, are thoſe they which the renewed eye, in the light of the Lord, ſees to be fitted, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and called forth by Chriſt unto that ſervice? Ah! poor inhabitants of this land! muſt ye fall into the pit before your eyes be opened!</p>
            <p>The great controverſy of this age is about church and miniſtry, which muſt carry it, the form or the power?

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:019435_0070_0FABAC90761B3A10"/>
which is the true church and its true miniſtry, or whether the ſpirit of God ſhall determine it? Whether a nation, with the miniſters it ſets up, ſhall be the church and miniſtry, or whether God's holy nation, which he calleth and ſanctifieth by his ſpirit, and the miniſters which he chuſeth and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to gather and build up in the holy faith, and pure power of life, ſhall be the church and miniſtry? Our eyes wait on the Lord, to ſee this controverſy determined, and our hope of help is in his arm; nor are we at all afrighted at the riſing of any ſtrength againſt us, our hearts being given up to God's truth, and to ſuffer for its teſtimony, according to God's will, meekly and patiently in his ſtrength; but we pity this poor land, yea, in the bonds of love we pity the rulers, the teachers, and people therein. Oh! that they might be humbled, and in fear of the great God ſurrender to him his due, before he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his ſtrength to force it from them.</p>

            <head>An <hi>ADVERTISEMENT</hi> to the Powers and People of this Nation.</head>
            <p>BECAUSE of my dear love to my native country, and becauſe of the dregs of that cup which the Lord hath already cauſed it to drink of, which cannot be ſpared unleſs the Lord's will be effected without it, which dregs are ſo bitter, terrible and dreadful, as will make the ſtouteſt hearts to faint, and the moſt confident countenance wax pale: I ſay for this cauſe, in love am I conſtrained to add theſe few lines,—that if it be poſſible this nation may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply itſelf, in the fear and dread of the eternal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and power, to make its peace with him againſt whom it hath long warred, not only by much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wickedneſs, looſeneſs, vanity, and profaneneſs,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:019435_0071_0FABAC9124452800"/>
but more eſpecially by ſetting up an invented form of godlineſs, and perſecuting the power, and to whom it is not yet reconciled in this matter, nor found ſo much as willing to be reconciled.</p>
            <p>The Lord God of heaven and earth, of glory, of majeſty, of everlaſting power, victory and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all, who made both heaven and earth, and hath the command of all things therein, he diſpoſeth of nations, of governments, of earthly powers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure, and who may ſay unto him, what doeſt thou? Who may implead him for making a rich nation poor? A ſtrong nation weak? Or for bringing down the high and mighty, the ſtrong, ſtout, honorable, and noble in a nation, and exalting the poor, the mean, the perſecuted? And if he turn his hand again, and lay them flat whom he had lifted up, and exalt the other even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for, who can withſtand him, or who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him? Now what is in the Lord's heart, who is thus mighty and abſolute, he will certainly bring to paſs, how unlikely, how contrary, how impoſſible ſoever it ſeem to the eye of man; if he will exalt his deſpiſed truth, which always was ſo to the eye of the great and wiſe ones of this world, or give his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple liberty to fear, worſhip and obey him; if he will have truth and righteouſneſs have the dominion in men's hearts, and in the nations, and not in the wills and luſts of men, how great and powerful ſoever; I ſay, if this be his intent, though generation ſhould riſe up after generation to oppoſe him herein, yet will he be too hard for them all, and they will all fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and his truth, his people, his holy eternal counſel, will he raiſe up, and cauſe to triumph over them all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:019435_0072_0FABAC91C08FA958"/>It is man's way to ſettle himſelf by outward ſtrength againſt outward ſtrength, and then he thinks he is ſafe; not eyeing the inviſible hand which turns the wheels, and delights to overturn that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſtrong, and ſeemeth unremoveable, when it forgetteth him, and oppoſeth itſelf againſt him. The Lord God loves to take his enemies at the ſtrongeſt, when they are moſt wiſe, moſt mighty, even when nothing ſeems able to deal with them but himſelf. This was it overthrew the foregoing powers one after another; they were courting worldly intereſt, and ſtrengthening themſelves that way; but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked God who raiſed them, and the work which he had raiſed them to accompliſh. This turned the head againſt them which had been for them; and how then could they maintain their ſtanding?</p>
            <p>Oh! that the preſent generation could ſee the tickliſhneſs of their ſtanding, and conſider that this is their day of trial, and that the Lord's eye is upon them, to obſerve their ways, to ſee whether they will now mind righteouſneſs and the liberty of his people, better than formerly they did; and that his truth may in its life and power, and not in ſuch a form or way of worſhip as they may think good to preſcribe, have its ſcope in the nation. The Lord's eye and heart are upon his truth and upon his people; and as nations or powers deal with that, ſo will he deal with them. Oh! therefore be not deceived; for though the Lord hath oftentimes long ſuffered his people to lie under reproach and perſecution, as he did Iſrael in Egypt for divers ages, yet at length he hath ſtill heard their groans, and hath ariſen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver: And though Pharaoh afterwards with all his ſtrength went after them, and made no queſtion but
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:019435_0073_0FABAC95AA73F350"/>
to bring them back again under his ſubjection, and there was nothing in appearance able to deliver them from him, yet he could not, but overthrew himſelf and his ſtrength utterly. Ye know not what ſtrong cries and tears were put up to the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe late changes; that righteouſneſs might be eſtabliſhed in the nation, and that his people might have liberty to worſhip him in his fear, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the leadings of his ſpirit, without being yoked under any form of worſhip which their hearts could not own to be of God.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore my true love to the nation, and to the preſent powers thereof, be deſpiſed by them; but let them fear before the mighty God of heaven and earth, and in their hearts bow to him, that they may be humbled, and made fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his hand for his ſervice, and not be found enemies againſt him. If they will be fit inſtruments for God to work by, they muſt be meek, lowly, poor in ſpirit, waiting in God's fear for his counſel, and not hearken to the fleſhly wiſdom of man, which is his utter enemy, and will perſuade, adviſe, and inſtruct them to ſettle the nation and church, as they call it, in a way contrary to him. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this word: Be ſure you ſmite none for obedience to God. Limit not his holy ſpirit in his people; but limit the unclean and evil ſpirit in thoſe who manifeſt themſelves not to be his people. This is the true intent of government. How can he who governs aright under God, hurt that which is of God, and for God? Or how can he ſpare that which his ſword is given him to cut down? Oh! how happy were it for the nation if they would let truth have its ſcope, and let righteouſneſs overcome them! and not contend for ſhadows againſt the ſubſtance;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019435_0074_0FABAC9764C61000"/>
but let the ſubſtance overcome all thoſe ſhadows which have held it in bondage, and upheld its enemy.</p>
            <p>The great enemy of God, all this night of the apoſtaſy, hath been Antichriſt; who hath not been an open enemy only, but hath appeared as if he had been for Chriſt, commanding the worſhipping and honoring of Chriſt, yea, and with a great zeal taking upon him to cauſe people to worſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he determined to be right: And thus he getteth into the temple, erecting an uſurping authority over the conſcience, ſetting up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling to an invented worſhip.</p>
            <p>Againſt this kind of worſhip God hath ſtill been raiſing witneſſes: But he having the powers of the earth on his ſide, as was propheſied he ſhould, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 13, hath often prevailed over them, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 7. And ſo the truth hath been ſuppreſſed, and falſe worſhips ſet up by the powers of the earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion they have drank of the golden cup of fornication; which doth not only deceive in one way of manifeſt and groſs falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but hath many mixtures and myſteries of deceit in it, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 2, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now God hath a time to call for an account of the ſufferings and blood of his ſaints, <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. 10, 11. He hath a time to judge the great whore, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 1. And when the time of God's judgment comes upon the earth, God begins with his own houſe firſt, and ſo with that which hath taken upon it to ſeparate from Babylon, to ſee what he can find of Babylon therein, and he will judge that before he fall upon the great body of the myſtery of iniquity, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 17, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 30.</p>

               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:019435_0075_0FABAC9897505A70"/>Now therefore it behoves this nation to conſider what of Babylon may be found in fit, and to part with it, that it may eſcape the plagues of Babylon; <hi>Rev.</hi> xviii. 4, which are very bitter, as ver. 7, 8, &amp;c. Theſe are the two main things whereof Babylon is guilty:</p>
            <p n="1">1. An invented form of worſhip, a likeneſs of the true worſhip; but not the true worſhip itſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A perſecuting, and endeavouring to ſuppreſs the power of the truth, even of the purity of the godly religion and worſhip, by means of this form, becauſe, for conſcience ſake, men who are taught otherwiſe by the ſpirit of God, cannot ſubmit and ſubject thereto.</p>
            <p>This God is coming down to plead with in that great city Babylon; and this God will firſt plead within thee. O New-England! conſider what of this is yet remaining in thee, or what of this thy heart hankers after, and part with it, as thou loveſt thy peace.

            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is commonly objected againſt us, that we condemn all but ourſelves; all the churches, martyrs and worthies, formerly, divers of whom ſealed their teſtimony with their blood, and all ſorts
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:019435_0076_0FABAC991E253960"/>
of Chriſtians and profeſſors at preſent, who are not juſt of our ſtamp and way, though otherwiſe ever ſo zealous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The churches, the bleſſed martyrs, who ſuffered for the teſtimony of a pure conſcience towards God, and all the worthies of the Lord in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generations, who fought againſt the falſe church and ſpirit, were accepted of God in their teſtimony againſt her, and are not diſowned by us, but dearly owned and honored therein; and for agreeing with them in their teſtimony in ſeveral things. And for teſtifying againſt the hypocriſies and corruptions of our age, do we ſuffer in this our day even as they did in their day, from the ſame ſpirit that perſecuted them; which, though it hath much changed its form and way of appearance, yet ſtill retaineth the ſame nature.</p>
            <p>But all things were not diſcovered at once. The times were then dark, and the light ſmall; yet they being faithful according to what was diſcovered, were precious in the Lord's eyes; and what through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance they erred in, the Lord winked at and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, being pleaſed with that ſincerity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of heart which he had ſtirred up in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf. But if they were now alive in theſe our days, and ſhould depart from the ſincerity which was then in them, and oppoſe the light and appearance of the ſpirit in this age, they would not then be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, but their former ſincerity would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. For the light ſhineth more and more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perfect day: And it is not the owning of the light as it ſhone in the foregoing ages, which will now commend any man to God; but the knowing and ſubjecting to the light of the preſent age. Even as in theſe our days that are paſt, there was, ſome
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:019435_0077_0FABAC99DACE26F0"/>
years ago, an honeſt zeal and true ſimplicity ſtirring in ſome churches, eſpecially among the Quakers, which was of the Lord, and was very dear to him; and had the generations of this age abode there, they would have been able to have followed the Lord in every further ſtep and leading of his ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from that into ſome form or other, the true ſimplicity withered, and another thing began to live in them; and ſo they ſettled upon their lees, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the form they had choſe to themſelves, till at length their hearts became hardened from the pure fear, even to the contracting of a ſpirit of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſomuch as they could mock at the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and diſcovery of the ſpirit as ſome new light: And ſo by degrees have grown, and are growing, perſecutors of that ſpirit in its appearance to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, which they themſelves had once ſome taſte of, while they were reproached and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for Quakers. And the god of this world, who at firſt tempted them aſide into the form, hath at length prevailed ſo far to blind them therewith, that they can neither ſee what ſpirit they themſelves are of, nor what it is they are endeavouring to perſecute.</p>
            <p>Let therefore people conſider the truth of the thing, as it is before the Lord: We do not caſt dirt upon any in whom the truth of God hath ſtirred and appeared in any meaſure in former ages, or in this our age; but this we teſtify againſt, viz. the ſetting up of any form without the life: For it is the erring ſpirit that ſtill crieth up the form, to keep down the power by the form, and ſo by the help of it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch from the ſpirit wherein is the life, and not in the form. This was the painted Jezabel of the apoſtles age; falſe teachers finely dreſſed up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the form of godlineſs, and then under
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:019435_0078_0FABAC9B22F48068"/>
this cover they could deny the power, and make head againſt it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 5. How eaſy is it for them to appear in the forms of doctrines of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in the form of zeal, in the form of holineſs, to paſs in a nation for the true church; and then to aſperſe them for heretics, who, appearing in the power, cannot but deny that form which is without the power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is the great witch of this age, even that ſpirit of zeal and devotion which is beſt cloathed and decked with the form without the power, which though men, who judge of the things of God after the fleſh, juſtify, admire, and much contend for, in her ſeveral ſhapes and dreſſes, ſome being for one, ſome for another, yet the Lord is ſearching after her, and will find her out with his eternal flames, which will make her manifeſt, and all her lovers ſhall dread her burning and bed of torment. Now as all along the apoſtaſy this bewitching ſpirit, this ſpirit which bewitcheth from the power, hath crept up under a form of church worſhip and holineſs; ſo the other ſpirit, the pure ſpirit of life, the ſpirit of true zeal and fear of the Lord, hath ſtill appeared more and more out of the forms; who were the beſt preachers and moſt eminent Chriſtians, of the firſt riſe of the profeſſors of this age, were they not thoſe who leaſt minded the form then, nay, indeed, who were moſt againſt the form, and perſecuted, for their conſcientious teſtifying againſt it? And who were the greateſt perſecutors then, but they who were the moſt zealous for the form, both of the government and worſhip of the church of England? And where is the perſecuting ſpirit next to be looked for but in the forms which ſhould next appear? And where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the appearance of the true ſpirit next to be looked for, but in thoſe whom the Lord ſhould raiſe
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:019435_0079_0FABAC9CE0FEA7C0"/>
up to teſtify againſt thoſe forms, and to be the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſufferers for their teſtimony, as many of the profeſſors of this age have been foregoing ſufferers for their teſtimony. Yet if there be any perſons left, among any of the forms which have appeared, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther former or latter, that have not loſt their ſincerity and true zeal towards God, them we own and have unity with, ſo far as they keep, or rather are kept, thereto. If there be any among the Epiſcopal ſort that in truth of heart deſire to fear the Lord, and look upon the common prayer-book as an acceptable way of worſhipping him, we pity their blindneſs, yet are tender towards them, and would not have the ſimplicity perſecuted in them becauſe of this, but rather cheriſhed. If there be any among the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, or any other ſort, that in truth of heart wait upon the Lord in thoſe ways, and do not find a deadneſs overgrown them, but a pure, freſh, lively zeal towards God, with an unfeigned love to his people, our hearts are one with this; and we cannot fight againſt this good thing in any of them, though in love to them we teſtify, that their form and way of worſhip is their preſent loſs and hindrance; yet we doubt not but that the Lord, in his time, will make manifeſt to ſuch the light of this age, which is the very thing the people of God, in many foregoing ages, have been praying for. But this is our lamentation, that forms and ways of worſhip abound; but the pure principle, the pure ſpirit, is loſt and drowned in them all; and that men are hardened againſt our teſtimony, not from the remainders of the ſimplicity in them, but becauſe they are erred from the ſimplicity, and fallen in league with another ſpirit, which hath lain lurking in forms of knowledge and worſhips, to tempt aſide
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:019435_0080_0FABAC9D9AE3CA00"/>
from the ſimplicity, and to hide the ſight of the life and power from the panting ſoul, all this night of the apoſtaſy.</p>
            <p>Now mark how eaſy and natural it is to that ſpirit to enter into a form, to cry up a form, to ſet up a form in a nation, city, or country; doubtleſs it had been done in this nation long ago, had not the mighty hand of the Lord withſtood it. When the evil and unclean ſpirit is detected and driven out of one form, if it doth not ſuddenly get another to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in, and tempt with, it muſt needs loſe many of its ſubjects. The ſtrumpet, or falſe church, is forced, as God diſcovers her nakedneſs and lewdneſs, to change her dreſſes and appearances, to new trick and adorn her bed; and then, as if ſhe alſo were changed, and were now no longer the ſame, ſhe comes forth again with boldneſs, and tempteth the young man again to come in to her, <hi>Prov.</hi> vii. 16. And thus ſhe caſteth down many wounded; yea, many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her, ver. 26, who otherwiſe would have pondered the path of life, chap. v. vi. had they not been enſnared by her flatteries, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God, chap. ii. 17. There is no more certain and ready way to ſuppreſs truth, and to betray the honeſty which is ſingly ſearching after it, than to preſent a form of godlineſs or worſhip, as the proper way of meeting with it: For hereby the ſoul is lulled aſleep with a falſe hope, until the freſhneſs of its deſire begins to die, and its life to wither; and then the fleſhly part eaſily grows into unity with, and zeal for, that form which indeed is of the fleſh; though it appeared and tempted as if it had been otherwiſe. And how many have gone a great way towards hell, and have been deeply entangled and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:019435_0081_0FABACA176883098"/>
diſtreſſed in the chambers of death, by entering into this ſtrumpet's church or houſe, which they then, through the ſubtilty of her deceit, took for the houſe or church of God? <hi>Prov.</hi> vii. 27. Conſider the thing a little ſeriouſly. When the evil ſpirit is driven out of his ſtrong hold of groſs Popery, whither ſhould he run but into Epiſcopacy? When he is driven out of Epiſcopacy, whither ſhould he run but into Preſbytery? When he is driven out of Preſbytery, whither ſhould he run but into Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency? When he is driven out of Independency, whither ſhould he run but into Anabaptiſm? When he is driven out of Anabaptiſm, whither ſhould he run but into Quakeriſm? And what is his end of running into Epiſcopacy, but to ſave alive that ſpirit which was hunted of Popery, and could abide no longer there, and ſo the better, and the ſafer from being diſcerned, to reproach and perſecute the other ſpirit, wherever it appeared, under the nick-names of the ſeveral ſorts and ſects of profeſſors? &amp;c. And what is his end afterwards of running into Preſbte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but to ſave that alive which is hunted out of Epiſcopacy, and to perſecute the former truly zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, where it ſhould further appear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by means of that form? Thus the forms and appearances of things change; but the fight is ſtill the ſame, the evil ſpirit ſtill getting uppermoſt, under a form of godlineſs, and from thence ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth its arrows at thoſe who ſeek after purity of heart, and cannot but teſtify againſt thoſe forms where the impure one lodgeth.</p>
            <p>This then is the ſum of our anſwer in this reſpect; we are not againſt the true life and power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherever it hath appeared, or yet appears, under the veil of any form whatſoever. Nay, all
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:019435_0082_0FABACA31F0B5788"/>
perſons who ſingly wait upon the Lord in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and ſincerity of their hearts, whether under any form, or out of forms, that matters little to us, are very dear unto us in the Lord. But we are againſt all forms, images, imitations, and appearances, which betray the ſimplicity and ſincerity of the heart, keep the life in bondage, and endanger the loſs of the ſoul. And too many ſuch now there are, which hold the immortal ſeed of life in captivity under death, over which we cannot but mourn, and wait for its break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the chains, and its riſing out of all its graves into its own pure life, power, and fulneſs of liberty in the Lord.</p>

and betray one another, both by counſel and ſtrength; and as they have banded themſelves to break you, whom God hath gathered, ſo ſshall they band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one againſt another, to break, to ſpoil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another; and through the multitude of their treacheries, all credit or belief, upon account of their ſolemn engagement, ſhall fail; ſo that few men ſhall count themſelves, or what is theirs, ſafe in the hand of his friend, who hath not choſen his ſafety and friendſhip in the pure light of the unchangeable truth of God; and all the ſecret counſels of the ungodly ſhall be brought to nought, ſometimes by the means of ſome of themſelves, and ſometimes by impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities lying in their way, which ſhall make their hearts fail of ever accompliſhing what they have determined; and in this ſtate ſhall men fret themſelves for a ſeaſon, and ſhall not be able to ſee the hand that turns againſt them, but ſhall turn to fight againſt one thing, and another, and a third thing, and ſhall ſtagger, and reel, and be confounded in council and judgment, as drunken men that know not where to find the way to reſt; and when they do yet ſtir themſelves up againſt the holy people, and againſt the holy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of light, and them that walk in it, they ſhall but the more be confounded; for they that truly follow the leader of Iſrael ſhall be helped with a little help, which all the ungodly ſhall not hinder them of, viz. the ſecret arm of the Lord, maintaining their cauſe, and raiſing up a witneſs in the very hearts of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to plead their innocency, and this ſhall make them yet the more to vex themſelves, for when they ſhall look to their religion, to their power, policy or preferments, or friendſhips, or whatſoever elſe they had truſted in, and relied upon, they ſhall have cauſe to curſe it; and when they look downwards to the effects

produced by all thoſe things, behold then trouble, and horror, and vexation take hold on them, and drive them to darkneſs; and having no help but what is earthly, and being out of the knowledge of the mighty overturning power of the Lord God Almighty, they ſhall deſpair and wear out their days with anguiſh; and beſides all this, the terrible hand of the Lord is and ſhall be openly manifeſted againſt this ungodly generation, by bringing grievous and terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and plagues upon them, bringing down all things in which their pride and glory ſtood, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning even the foundations of their ſtrength, yea, the Lord will lay waſte the mountain of the ungodly, and the ſtrength of the fenced city ſhall fail; and when men ſhall ſay, we will take refuge in them, they ſhall become but a ſnare, and there ſhall the ſword devour: And when they ſhall ſay, we will go into the field, and put truſt in the number and courage of our ſoldiers, they ſhall both be taken away; and this evil alſo will come of the Lord, and his hand will be ſtretched out ſtill, and ſhall bring confuſion, ruin upon ruin, and war upon war; and the hearts of men ſhall be ſtirred in them, and the nations ſhall be as waters, into which a tempeſt, a ſwift whirlwind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and even as waves ſwell up to the diſſolution one of another, and breaking one of another, ſo ſhall the commotions and ſwellings of people be; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hardſhips and ſorrows of thoſe days many ſhall ſeek and deſire death, rather than life.</p>
            <p>Alas! my heart relents, and is moved within me, under a ſenſe of theſe things, and much more than I can write or declare, which the Lord will do in the earth, and will alſo make haſte to accompliſh among the ſons of men, that they may know and confeſs, that the Moſt High doth rule in the kingdoms of

men, and pulleth down and ſetteth up according to his own will; and this ſhall men do before ſeven times paſs over them, and ſhall be content to give their glory unto him that ſits in heaven.</p>
            <p>But, Oh friends! while all theſe things are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing to paſs, repoſe ye yourſelves in the munition of that rock that is immoveable, that all theſe troubles, tempeſts and ſhakings, ſhall not be able to move, even in the knowledge and feeling of the eternal power of God, keeping you ſubjectly given up to his heavenly will, and feel it daily to kill and mortify that which remains in any of you, which is of this world, for the worldly part in any, is the changeable part, and that is up and down, full and empty, joyful and ſorrowful, as things go well or ill in the world: For as the truth is but one, and many are made partakers of its ſpirit, ſo the world is but one, and many are partakers of the ſpirit of it; and ſo many as do partake of it, ſo many will be ſtraitened and perplexed with it; but they who are ſingle to the light and manifeſtation of grace in them, waiting daily to feel the life and virtue of it in their hearts, theſe ſhall rejoice in the midſt of adverſity; theſe ſhall not have their hearts moved with fear, nor toſſed with anguiſh, becauſe of evil tidings, becauſe that which fixeth them remains with them: Theſe ſhall know their entrance with the bridegroom, and ſo be kept from ſorrow, though his coming be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly as a thief in the night, and when a midnight is come upon man's glory, yet they being ready and prepared, it will be well with them, and having a true ſenſe of the power working in themſelves, they cannot but have unity and fellowſhip with the works of it in the earth, and will not at all murmur againſt what is, nor wiſh nor will what is not to be; theſe will
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:019435_0087_0FABACA69FBB4E68"/>
be at reſt till the indignation paſſeth over, and theſe having no deſign to carry on, nor no party to promote in the earth, cannot poſſibly be defeated nor diſappointed in their undertakings.</p>
            <p>And when you ſee diviſions, and parties, and rendings in the bowels of nations, and rumours and tempeſts in the minds of the people, then take heed of being moved to this party or to that party, or giving your ſtrength to this or that, or couſelling this or that way, but ſtand ſingle to the truth of God, in which neither war, rent nor diviſion, is; and take heed of that part in any of you, which truſts and relies upon any ſort of the men of this world, in the day of their proſperity; for the ſame party will bring you to ſuffer with them in the time of their adverſity, which will not be long after; for ſtability in that ground there will be none. But when they ſhall ſay, come join with us in this or that, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you are joined to the Lord by his pure ſpirit, to walk with him in peace and righteouſneſs, and you feeling this, this gathers out of all commotions, and noiſes, and parties, and tumults, and leads you to exalt the ſtandard of truth and righteouſneſs, in an innocent and honeſt converſation, to ſee who will flow unto that; and this ſhall be a refuge for many of the weary, toſſed and afflicted ones, in thoſe days, and a ſhelter for many whoſe day is not yet over.</p>
            <p>So, dearly beloved friends and brethren, who have believed and known the bleſſed appearance of the truth, let not your hearts be troubled at any of theſe things! Oh! let not the things that are at preſent, nor things that are yet to come, move you from ſtedfaſtneſs, but rather double your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, zeal and faithfulneſs, to the cauſe of God:

For they that know the work wrought in themſelves, they ſhall reſt in the day of trouble, yea, though the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flocks ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet the faithful will rejoice in the Lord, and will joy in the God of their ſalvation, <hi>Hab.</hi> iii. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>And how near theſe days are to this poor nation, few know, and therefore the cry of the Lord is very loud unto its inhabitants, by his meſſenger of peace whom he hath ſent, that they would prize their time while they have it, leſt they be overturned, waſted, and laid deſolate, before they are aware; and before deſtruction come upon them, and there be no remedy, as it hath already been upon many.</p>
            <p>Oh inhabitants! inhabitants! of the land of the Engliſh nation, that thou and thy rulers would have conſidered, and hearkened, and heard, in the day of thy warnings and invitations, and not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in thy rebellion againſt the King of hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And, Oh! ſaith my ſoul, that thy inhabitants would yet be warned, and perſuaded to repent; and turn to the Lord, by putting away every one the evil that is in their hearts, againſt truth in themſelves, and againſt thoſe that walk in it, before a greater deſolation and deſtruction overtake them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:019435_0089_0FABACA9033B4D10"/>Oh! what ſhall I ſay to prevail with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this land? Oh! hearken and hear, you that have ears to hear, but the uncircumciſed in heart and ears cannot, what the Lord is about to do in the land. The Lord hath called aloud, he hath roared out of Sion unto them, but many of them have not hearkened at all, nor conſidered at all.</p>
            <p>Well, Oh my friends, and thou my ſoul, return to the leader of Iſrael, and dwell in the pavilion of the houſe of your God, and my God, and ſhelter yourſelves under the ſhadow of his wings, where ye ſhall be witneſſes of his doings, and ſee his ſtrange act brought to paſs, and ſhall not be hurt therewith, nor diſmayed.</p>
            <p>Oh, my friends, in the bowels of dear and tender love, have I ſignified theſe things unto you, that ye might ſtand armed, with the whole armour of God, cloathed in righteouſneſs, and your feet ſhod with the preparation of the goſpel of peace, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given up in all things to the diſpoſing of the Lord, who will deliver us, not by might, nor by ſword nor ſpear, but by his own eternal inviſible arm will he yet ſave us and deliver us, and get himſelf a name by preſerving us; and we ſhall yet live to praiſe him who is worthy of glory, of honor and renown, from the riſing of the ſun to the going down of the ſame; the great and terrible name of God is to be praiſed, both this time, henceforth and for evermore; ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting praiſes are due unto God that is holy. Amen.</p>
            <p>But if the wicked and ungodly will not hear, nor obey the goſpel, by the meſſenger of peace whom God hath ſent, God's curſe and vengeance will come upon them, and his plagues will purſue them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, if they proceed in this work; and their wives ſhall be widows, and their children fatherleſs;

the Lord hath ſpoken it. Methinks if they had the hearts of men or of fleſh, they would be afraid, and bluſh at the very thoughts thereof. My heart and ſoul melt within me, and I am even bowed down, (with cries to God) in my ſpirit, to think of the hardneſs of their hearts.</p>
            <p>And will the Lord God Almighty cut ſhort thy work in righteouſneſs, and ſhorten the days of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and cruelty, for thine elect's ſake, which crieth night and day unto thee, and make known thy name and power to the ends of the earth; and let the heathen hear and fear, and bow to thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſceptre; and let the kings of the earth lay down their crowns at the feet of the lamb, that through thy righteous judgments they may partake of thy tender mercies, which endure for ever, that their eyes may be no longer withholden nor blinded by the god of this world, the power and prince of darkneſs. And will the Lord be pleaſed, for the ſake of the dear Son of thy love, to open all blind eyes, and unſtop all deaf ears, and take the dark veils from off all faces, that they may come to ſee thee who art inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and enjoy the ſame precious life of pure unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love, which abounds in the hearts of thy hidden ones, and receive thy peaceable wiſdom, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, and to govern them therein; then would they ſurely know the meſſenger of peace whom thou haſt ſent, and confeſs to thy glorious truth, and ſpeak good of thy name, and magnify thy power, and no longer count the blood of thy everlaſting covenant, wherewith we are ſanctified, as an unholy thing.</p>
