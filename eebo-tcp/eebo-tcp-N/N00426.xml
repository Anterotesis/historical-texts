            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Blessed God, who has made <hi>Sacraments</hi> to be such very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and agreeable Engines for a maintaining of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between the <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Invisible World,</hi> has in both <hi>Testaments</hi> appointed several such means of our Fellowship with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000535_0010_0FA6B6ED80D1BB68"/>
A <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> by which is declared, and confirmed, and conveyed some <hi>Spiritual</hi> Thing unto us. Tho' the <hi>Word</hi> SACRAMENT be not in the Scripture; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borrowed from the Name of the <hi>Oath,</hi> which passed between <hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> of old: yet the <hi>Thing</hi> we are abundantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised of; and there are <hi>two</hi> Sacraments which under the Evangelical Dispensation of the new Covenant, our God would have us approach unto him in. Those are a Sacred <hi>Baptism,</hi> and a <hi>S</hi>acred <hi>Supper;</hi> the former of which is to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our <hi>Inoculation</hi> into the Lord Jesus Christ, and our <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Serve</hi> and <hi>Fight</hi> under Him; but the latter of them is to signifie our <hi>Participation</hi> in all the saving Benefits of our Lord Jesus, and our <hi>Augmentation</hi> in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Obedience to Him. It is <hi>Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> (and a Worthy Person of another Nation in a Treatise Entituled <hi>La manducation du Corps de Christ,</hi> i find long since putting such a <hi>Remark</hi> upon it) that as of old under the Law those two <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Washing</hi> and <hi>Feeding</hi> were those which did represent the <hi>Application</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> to come, and by those <hi>two Acts</hi> were the People made partakers of the then Holy things: thus the <hi>two Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>New-Testament</hi> have those two <hi>Acts</hi> to manage them.</p>
            <p>They are not few or small Duties which you
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000535_0011_0FA6B6EE47A6EC60"/>
that are <hi>Baptized</hi> must count your selves bound unto. Tis no less than <hi>A putting on Christ,</hi> unto which you are engaged by your <hi>Baptismal Vow.</hi> God forbid that you should look upon your <hi>Baptism</hi> as an useless <hi>Formality</hi> or a trifling <hi>Ceremony</hi> The Waters of <hi>Baptism,</hi> will prove more bitter and baneful than the waters of <hi>jealousie</hi> to the guilty Souls of them that forget what engagements are by their <hi>Baptism</hi> laid upon them.</p>
            <p>You are <hi>Baptized into the Name</hi> of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity, to intimate the Bonds which now ly upon you to acknowledg God the Father, as your <hi>Father,</hi> God the Son as your <hi>Saviour,</hi> and God the Spirit as your <hi>Strengthener.</hi> You have received His <hi>Mark</hi> on your <hi>Foreheads,</hi>

to be those <hi>Agapae.</hi> You must indulge me in an Opinion, however singular it may seem, that there was a Jewish party in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> which would not come to the S<hi>upper</hi> of the Lord without a <hi>Paschal</hi> A<hi>nte</hi>-S<hi>upper,</hi> wherein they ate and drank <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Now to rectifie these Abuses, the <hi>A</hi>postle reduces them to the <hi>Original Institution</hi> of that blessed <hi>Sacrament.</hi> This is the scope of the Paragraph, which affords our Text unto us; the Apostle recites what our <hi>L</hi>ord <hi>said,</hi> and what He <hi>Did,</hi> when He appointed this Holy <hi>Ordinance.</hi> Accordingly, in the words of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here quotes, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Account given by <hi>Three</hi> Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, we have two Things.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We do not read, that any <hi>Kneeling</hi> here is required of us.

Alas, that any man, who calls himself a <hi>Protestant,</hi> should in this manner symbolize with Popish Idolaters!

Moreover, The Apostle gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that if we would be Regular in our Evangelical <hi>A</hi>dministrations, we must Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce matters to the <hi>First Institution</hi> of them.

And I suppose 'twas done in such a <hi>Succession,</hi> that the <hi>Bread</hi> was Eaten before the <hi>Wine</hi> was <hi>Taken.</hi> This is to signifie, That the Son of God has <hi>Taken</hi> our Nature into a personal Union with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. That astonishing thing, <hi>The Incarnation
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000535_0029_0FA6B703FB678500"/>
of our Lord;</hi> or, <hi>God manifest in the Flesh,</hi> is herein referred unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S</hi>econdly, The <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are to be <hi>Blessed.</hi> They are thus (namely by a <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> over them) <hi>consecrated</hi> unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice now before us. We know not what <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> were used in the first <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration</hi> by our Lord Jesus; it is evident that the Sentence which the Romanists attribute such a more than <hi>Creating</hi> and <hi>Conversive</hi> power unto; namely, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> was not, is not of a <hi>consecrating</hi> Influence; it is only <hi>Assertive</hi> of what the Sacrament is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that clause be uttered. No, 'tis prayers and praises for the Blessings of <hi>Redemption</hi> accommodated unto this occasion, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate what is before us. This is to signify, That our Lord Jesus hath been <hi>set apart</hi> unto the Office of a Mediator. While <hi>This</hi> is doing, our Lord as it were says, <hi>Thus for their sakes I sanctifie my self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The B<hi>read</hi> is to be <hi>Broken.</hi> That the <hi>pouring</hi> of the <hi>Wine</hi> should be Look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as any part of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I do not understand; I have not yet seen the Order for it. But the <hi>Breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> is a Remarkable article of our Business here; and far from <hi>Adiaphorous,</hi> or I<hi>ndifferent.</hi> Hence by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> the whole <hi>Administration</hi> sometimes is called, <hi>The Breaking of Bread.</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:000535_0030_0FA6B704CBFA5478"/>
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> sins not a little by the Omission of it. This is to signify, That our Lord Jesus has been <hi>Broken</hi> for our Sin. Tho' His Bones were not to be <hi>Broken,</hi> (and this was the Martyrs Argument against <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>) yet His <hi>Flesh</hi> was broken, and His <hi>Heart</hi> was broken, for us. While this Action is passing, our Lord calls from on high unto us, <hi>Thus was my Body Broken for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The B<hi>read</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> are to be <hi>given.</hi> As our Lord, put first the <hi>Bread,</hi> and anon the <hi>Wine</hi> into the <hi>Hands</hi> (not into the <hi>Mouths</hi>) of the Disciples; thus the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> are still to do, by the Mediation of the <hi>Deacons.</hi> We do not find that <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>They</hi> rose up, for Him to deliver the B<hi>read</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> to each of them immediately; but <hi>He</hi> gave it unto the <hi>First,</hi> and the <hi>First</hi> gave it unto the <hi>Next;</hi> and thus we find in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Ages, there were <hi>Distributors</hi> of these Holy Things to the Communicants. But there seems no Necessity of Repeating the Invitations of the Lord Jesus over again, to each person at the Delivery of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> tho' in some of the Primitive Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, there seems to have been such a Thing, which every Communicant answered an, <hi>Amen,</hi> unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Well, This is to signifie, That God now <hi>giveth</hi> Christ, He gives that match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Gift,</hi> both <hi>To</hi> and <hi>For</hi> His People. The

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> are to be <hi>Received.</hi> We are (unless in case of <hi>Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>) to <hi>Take</hi> the B<hi>read</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> even into our <hi>Hands;</hi> it profanes them not for our Hands to <hi>Touch</hi> them; and the Popish Mode of <hi>Taking</hi> them otherwise, is more fit for <hi>Beasts</hi> or <hi>Birds,</hi> than for the Children of <hi>Men.</hi> But this is to signify, That we <hi>Receive</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ as our <hi>Prince</hi> and our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> As we have the <hi>Eye</hi> of a True Faith, in <hi>Looking</hi> to Him, and the <hi>Foot</hi> of a True Faith, in <hi>Coming</hi> to Him; so it becomes now to have the <hi>Hand</hi> of a True Faith, in <hi>Taking</hi> of Him. We are now to <hi>Renew</hi> our Faith, and <hi>profess</hi> our Faith, and say, <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> I <hi>now embrace thee, as the Prophet, and the Priest, and the King of my miserable</hi> S<hi>oul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, We are to <hi>Eat</hi> the <hi>Bread,</hi> and to <hi>Drink</hi> the <hi>Wine,</hi> thus prepared for us. There is an <hi>Eating,</hi> which is incumbent on us here. In the Ratifying and Confirming of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and (yet oftner) in the expressing and maintaining of a <hi>Friendship</hi> among men, <hi>Eating</hi> has been but usual. Behold, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention of Him that is the King of Kings, who thus admits us poor Beggars to <hi>Eat</hi> with Him! 'Tis to signify, That our Souls now
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000535_0032_0FA6B7070291FD50"/>
feed <hi>On,</hi> as well as <hi>with,</hi> a Crucify'd Jesus! Herein we obey that C<hi>ommand</hi> of our Lord, <hi>Eat my Flesh and have Eternal Life;</hi> and therein our Lord fulfils that Promise to us, <hi>I will come in, and Sup with Him.</hi> But we are also to <hi>Drink</hi> as well as to <hi>Eat.</hi> Indeed, the Romish Ecclesiasticks deprive the Lords People of the C<hi>up</hi> in the <hi>L</hi>ords Supper. But it is very surprizing to see, how particularly our Lord long since laid in against this Execrable <hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cril<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Communion in both kinds</hi> was not utterly abolished, until the year 1300; and the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> in the year 1455. at length approved and confirmed that Abolition, by a Canon which runs in such Horrible Terms as these, <hi>Tho' Christ did Institute in both Kinds; and the Primitive Church did so Administer, yet we desire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to be observed.</hi> But what an Hellish

Boldness is it thus to over-rule the word of the Lord Jesus!

My Brethren, <hi>All</hi> of you are to Drink of this blessed Chalice. And it is to signify, That the Lord Jesus therein says unto us, <hi>Drink in the Spirit of the Lord!</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What shall I say more? God wou'd not allow any man to Taste of <hi>Blood,</hi> until the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord Jesus came to be shed. And you may observe, That the <hi>Law</hi> forbad the Drinking of <hi>Blood,</hi> for that Reason, <hi>you shall drink no blood, for 'tis to be shed for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin.</hi> Whereas the Lord commands the Drinking of <hi>blood,</hi> for the very same Reason: <hi>Drink this blood, for 'tis shed for the Remission of sins!</hi> 'Tis in a S<hi>acramental Style</hi> that these things are spoken.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>T</hi>hat <hi>Regeneration</hi> is the Thing without which a Title unto <hi>Sacraments</hi> is not to be

pretended unto. <hi>Real Regeneration,</hi> is that which before <hi>God (in foro coeli</hi>) renders men capable of claiming <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or <hi>Expressed</hi> Regeneration is that which before <hi>Men, (in foro Soli</hi>) enables us to make such a claim. Or, take it so, A <hi>probable and credible</hi> P<hi>rofession of a Saving Faith,</hi> (and no less than <hi>That) must be made by a man, before the Supper of the Lord may be</hi> A<hi>dmini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto him.</hi>

                     <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Qualification</hi> without which a man cannot Challenge <hi>Baptism,</hi> is much more to be demanded of them that would approach unto the <hi>Supper of the Lord.</hi> For no <hi>unbaptised</hi> person may be a Communicant in <hi>This</hi> Ordinance; and what is Necessary at the <hi>Threshold,</hi> is much more Necessary at the <hi>Table:</hi> they that may not be reckoned as <hi>Incipients,</hi> much more may not be treated as <hi>Proficients,</hi> in the House of God. But a man may not Challenge <hi>Baptism,</hi> without a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and Credible Profession of a Saving Faith.</hi> The very <hi>Form</hi> of the words used in Baptism shows, That a man must not onely <hi>Beleeve

God,</hi> but also <hi>Beleeve IN God,</hi> when he is Baptised. Now [<hi>Defferunt,</hi> credo Deum, <hi>et</hi> Credo IN De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But, without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> a man may not be Baptised. Those persons methinks must have the Itch of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting that will give me any Trouble to make This appear. But for <hi>their</hi> Satisfaction, let it be Remembred, <hi>That</hi> our Lord and His Apostles, did still prepare men for <hi>Baptism</hi> by Preaching of <hi>Repentance.</hi> What said <hi>Peter</hi> in Acts 2.38. <hi>Repent and</hi> [then] <hi>be</hi> B<hi>aptised;</hi> Certainly, we should not be more lax in <hi>our</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:000535_0039_0FA6B71185BB5C88"/>
B<hi>aptism,</hi> than <hi>John</hi> was in <hi>His.</hi> But <hi>His</hi> B<hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> was called in Mark 1. 3. <hi>The baptism of Repentance;</hi> and such <hi>a Repentance</hi> also, as the <hi>Remission of sins</hi> was annexed unto. He did not B<hi>aptize</hi> all that came unto him; only those who did <hi>Confess</hi> their sins (and give just cause of hope, that they did <hi>Forsake</hi> them too) were welcome to his baptism, and such as had <hi>Fruits</hi> to justifie the <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> professed by them; as for them who made no proof of a True <hi>Repentance,</hi> 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Luc 7 30. <hi>They were not baptized of him.</hi> What shall I say more? B<hi>aptism</hi> is to be accompany'd with <hi>The Answer of a good Conscience</hi> to all the proposals of the Gospel; 'tis to be accompany'd with a Renunciation of <hi>The World, the Flesh and the Devil;</hi> 'tis to be accompanied with an Hearty Listing our selves under the <hi>banner of the Lord Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Now, there is no less than a <hi>Saving Faith</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in such things as these. Wherefore I close this Argument, with the words of the Renowned <hi>Gilespy, I believe no Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Minister, would adventure to baptize one, that has manifest signs of Unregeneration; and how shall we bring such an One then to the Table of the Lord?</hi> I do, in imitation of my <hi>Father</hi> before me, account this passage, <hi>A passage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to be written in Letters of Gold.</hi>

a man may not be taken into <hi>Church Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> is doubtless to be demanded of them that would approach unto the S<hi>upper of the Lord.</hi> For, without, a <hi>Regular standing in a Visible Church,</hi> the Holy Table ought to be Inaccessible; and it is blindness, to imagine, That the Lord has prepared this <hi>blessed</hi> B<hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi> for any but those that come into His <hi>Holy Mountain.</hi> It has indeed been disputed, Whether <hi>All</hi> C<hi>hurch-Members</hi> may presently be admitted unto the Lords Table. We all of us do stigmatize it as a gross Error, in those degenerate Christians, the <hi>Abissines,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> the <hi>Maronites,</hi> and some others, <hi>To distribute the Eucharist unto children.</hi> And the purest C<hi>hurches</hi> of the Lord Jesus, have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally not been so <hi>large,</hi> or so <hi>soon</hi> in the Administration of the <hi>Lords</hi> S<hi>upper,</hi> as of B<hi>aptism.</hi> One has been given as <hi>Milk,</hi> when the other, like S<hi>trong Meat</hi> has been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; and the Ancients usually <hi>Detained</hi> the <hi>baptized,</hi> a while before they were C<hi>onfirmed.</hi> But no man of sense ever imagined any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that <hi>Only</hi> C<hi>hurch-Members</hi> might be admitted hereunto. Now a man may not be taken into <hi>Church-Fellowship</hi> without a <hi>probable and credible Profession of a</hi> S<hi>aving Faith</hi>

                  <p>And the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> gave this general Rule, <hi>That the inward state of Penitents be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in order to their Admission to communion with us.</hi> Now, if they that are <hi>Impenitent</hi> for <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular sin, may not come to the Table of the Lord, surely they that may be thought <hi>Impenitent</hi> for a whole <hi>course</hi> of Sin, are also to be <hi>kept out of Doors,</hi> which is to be esteem'd the case of all them whom we may not <hi>Reasonably</hi> as well as <hi>Charitably</hi> judg <hi>Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Ghost.</hi>

Covenant was not without a <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the <hi>Trees</hi> which God then did set such a special Remark upon. But the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is purely a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>New-Covenant;</hi> And it is Folly to think, that until a man accept of the <hi>Covenant</hi> he may meddle with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> The <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is a Sacrament provided by the <hi>Second Adam</hi> for such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come united unto <hi>Him;</hi> as for those that keep their Union with the <hi>First Adam</hi> still, our Lord sayes unto them, <hi>What hast thou to do to take my Sacrament into thy mouth?</hi> Now till a person make a <hi>Probable</hi> and <hi>Credible Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a saving Faith,</hi> he pretends to none but the <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi> He remains what he was, when <hi>First born</hi> into the World; but the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord stands in that <hi>Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> whereof our Lord sayes unto us, <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except a man be born again, he cannot see</hi> [he is uncapable of] <hi>that Kingdom.</hi>

unto the terms of the Gospel,</hi> and Subjection to the Lord Jesus Christ as his <hi>Prophet,</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>King</hi> for ever? every <hi>Communicant</hi> with us is to <hi>say</hi> thus much: <hi>The Lord Jesus is my Prince and my Saviour:</hi> but without <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and credible Profession of a saving Faith,</hi> it is a great LYE for a man so to <hi>say.</hi> We may not encourage men to <hi>ly unto the Holy Ghost,</hi> by causing them to <hi>speak</hi> what (and while) yet they do not <hi>Feel;</hi> but we must first look to that, <hi>Let them</hi> (hopefully) <hi>Believe, and so let them speak.</hi> It is well said by a worthy man, <hi>The Sealing of the Covenant unto men, before they understand it, and take hold of it, is the common cutthroat of Souls in our Parishes.</hi> The least thing to be exacted of a Communicant is, <hi>An Engagement to leave off the wayes of sin.</hi> Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he must engage to do it presently, or else hereafter: If he engage only to do it <hi>hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> there is a most cursed and hellish Impiety in that <hi>Procrastination,</hi> and the Sinner does therein as bad as declare, <hi>That he will remain an Enemy to God all his dayes.</hi> I pray, what <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament can belong to such an one?</hi> If he engage to do it <hi>presently,</hi> we shall have cause to judge that either he do's Engage it <hi>Sincerely,</hi> or that he does it <hi>Fallaciously, Deceitfully, Hypocritically.</hi> But what <hi>Promise</hi> did our God ever make, or what <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Value</hi> did he ever command us to show unto <hi>such Engagements?</hi> It was

the Resolution of <hi>David, He that works Deceit, shall not dwell within my House; He that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Lyes shall not tarry in my sight.</hi> And shall we fill the <hi>House</hi> of our <hi>David,</hi> with such as (we may be justly jealous) are <hi>Deceivers</hi> and <hi>Lyars</hi> in their pretences of Allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ?

                     <hi>Sixthl'y,</hi> If the <hi>Supper of the Lord</hi> be not appointed for a <hi>converting Ordinance,</hi> then a <hi>probable and credible Profession of a saving Faith,</hi> (or Conversion) is to be first made by them that would approach unto it. They that plead for more <hi>promiscuous Admissions</hi> to the Lords Table, usually suppose, That the <hi>Holy Supper</hi> is to be used for the <hi>Conversion</hi> of such as come unto it. But against this, I assume, That the <hi>L</hi>ords Supper is not <hi>Ex Instituto,</hi> a <hi>converting Ordinance.</hi> That this Ordinance has <hi>never</hi> by <hi>Accident,</hi> been sanctify'd for the <hi>First Conversion</hi> of them that had never bin brought home to God before, I do not now <hi>say;</hi> tho' I suppose it would puzzle any man to <hi>prove</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:000535_0049_0FA6B71D835CF258"/>
that, <hi>It ever has.</hi> If it <hi>have,</hi> what of that? I can tell the Name of a man converted by hearing himself Preach; yet I hope the Church will be loth to admit unto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry such as they may not be first well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded about the <hi>Conversion</hi> of. I have knowe some, whom a <hi>Dream</hi> has been very instrumental in converting unto God; yet a <hi>Dream</hi> I suppose, is not now a <hi>converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</hi> But this Ordinance is not by <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> such an one as is to be employ'd for the <hi>First Conversion</hi> of such as have never yet given themselves up to the Lord Redeemer. 'Tis impossible to tell why the very <hi>Heathens</hi> are not capable of it, if it were a <hi>converting Ordinance;</hi> and why we should not be as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable in driving men to the <hi>Lords</hi> S<hi>upper,</hi> as the Papists are in driving them to <hi>Baptism;</hi> among whom we read of one old Priest that Baptized <hi>seven hundred thousand.</hi> No, There is A<hi>nother Ordinance</hi> directed thereunto; <hi>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God;</hi> but it is no where said, <hi>That Faith comes by Receiving of the</hi> S<hi>acrament;</hi> nor is there so much as one instance in the Bible to countenance any such expectations.

                     <hi>If the</hi> S<hi>acraments</hi> had been <hi>converting Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> would <hi>Pauls</hi> Commission have Run that way, S<hi>ent not to Baptize, but to</hi> P<hi>reach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?

What was this, but to deprive him of a great Remedy for his <hi>Conversion</hi> and Amendment, if an <hi>Erastian</hi> may be credited?</p>
                  <p>Finally, The <hi>Lords</hi> S<hi>upper</hi> is an Ordinance rather <hi>Encharistical</hi> and <hi>Consolatory,</hi> than <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting.</hi> 'Tis also an Ordinance principally designed for <hi>Nourishment,</hi> and that supposes <hi>Lise, Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> bcen't for D<hi>ead men.</hi>

In short, The L<hi>ords Supper</hi> is a S<hi>eal;</hi> and it is to <hi>Seal</hi> our Interest in the <hi>Righteousness of Faith,</hi> in the D<hi>eath of</hi> C<hi>hrist,</hi> and in the <hi>Crown of Life.</hi> If it Seal only the Reality of Gods Covenant, and his proffering and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it unto us, it seals no more to a <hi>Receiver</hi> than to a Spectator, or to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers alike. No, it is to Seal our <hi>Interest.</hi> And there should be the <hi>Thing</hi> S<hi>ealed,</hi> before the <hi>Seal</hi>

It can S<hi>eal</hi> no comfortable thing to the Ungodly Man, for it not only <hi>Seals</hi> the offers of the Gospel, but it also <hi>Seals</hi> our Tempers towards those Offers.

The <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a <hi>Seal,</hi> in regards more awful and exact than the <hi>Word</hi> can be. 'Tis great ignorance to think otherwise; and hence <hi>Luther</hi> could say, <hi>If I were to call for a Curse upon my greatest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, it should be this; Let them go hear the Word of God, and then Despise it and Reject it.

                     <hi>Seventhly</hi> and Lastly, We have the <hi>Best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> to convince us, That nothing less than

a <hi>probable and credible Profession of a saving Faith</hi> is to be required in those that would be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants at the Table of the Lord. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Monuments of Antiquity, and you'l find the Ancients <hi>Uno Ore</hi> describing their <hi>Baptized</hi> Ones, as Regenerate, and Renewed by the Inherent Graces of Gods Holy <hi>S</hi>pirit. And what then were their <hi>Communicants?</hi> The Primitive Church would not admit <hi>Paul</hi> into their Society, till they were well satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Reality of the <hi>work of Grace</hi> in his Heart, and his <hi>Profession</hi> was become <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and credible</hi> unto them. In the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, they were too <hi>strict</hi> indeed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than too L<hi>oose</hi> in their Admissions; and they held men a long while <hi>Competentes</hi> (as they call'd them) before they would gratify their desires of Communion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> expresly tells us, <hi>That the Christians did most exquisitely search the</hi> S<hi>ouls of those that asked a full Communion w'ith them:</hi> elsewhere he sayes, <hi>When men have made such a proficiency that they appear sanctified by the Divine Word, then we call them to our mysteries.</hi> And else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>The mysteries of the Religion of Jesus, are duely delivered only to those who are holy and pure. Lactantius</hi> tells us. <hi>That Bona mens purum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, vita Innocens,</hi> were in his dayes required of Communicants. In <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who lived in the second Century, writes, That they
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000535_0053_0FA6B72075491148"/>
did examine persons, not only about their <hi>Perswasion,</hi> but whether they had attained such a work of God upon their Souls, as would enable them to conform entirely unto the Word and Will of God. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived in the Century after him, could say <hi>Vix pleba persuadec</hi>—He could not easily perswade the Brethren of his Flock to consent unto the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of such in whom <hi>Sincerity</hi> was questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others inform us how the <hi>Catechumens</hi> were dealt withal; and what a <hi>Serutinium</hi> or <hi>Trial</hi> they underwent; <hi>Whether they did indeed Renounce all their former vanities.</hi> It was the Rule, <hi>Fiant s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It may be <hi>Again</hi> Answered, That even among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> those that came to the <hi>Sacraments</hi> were under Obligation to give manifestation of what might be esteemed, <hi>A Work of Grace in their</hi> S<hi>ouls.</hi> If they would not Express a sense of their <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Wretchedness</hi> by Nature, and their Need of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and a S<hi>aviour,</hi> they might not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.

                  <p>It may be, L<hi>astly,</hi> answered, That the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> did use to be most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully <hi>Accurate</hi> and <hi>Scrupulous,</hi> in their Trying of <hi>Proselytes,</hi> before they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit these to S<hi>acraments</hi> among them. <hi>Buxtor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be then Enquired,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is it that we may safely Judge to be,</hi> A probable and credible profession of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer; That we must beware of <hi>Unscriptural Impositions</hi> in this Affair; we must not impose any <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Profession</hi> which we have no warrant for. 'Tis a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> to Enjoin upon every man, <hi>A Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the precise Time and Way of their Conversion unto God.</hi> Few that have been Restrained by a Religious Education, can give such an one. Nor, is it any other than a <hi>cruelty,</hi> to Enjoin upon every man, <hi>An Oral and a Publick Relation of his Experiences.</hi> Every Good man has not such a courage and presence of mind, as can speak perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently before a Congregation of many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds.</p>
                  <p>But still; as the <hi>Probationers</hi> for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, are to make a <hi>Profession</hi> of their Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, as that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer <hi>in whom all</hi> F<hi>ullness dwells,</hi> and on whom they Rely for communications from that <hi>Fullness</hi> to their own Souls; thus, we must Look for some <hi>justifying circumstance</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:000535_0059_0FA6B7297B1E1C08"/>
of that Profession. Our C<hi>harity</hi> towards all men of whom we know nothing amiss is. <hi>To Hope all things,</hi> and Believe the Best. But when we come to make a <hi>Judgment</hi> of them that lay claim to <hi>priviledges</hi> with us, 'tis but Reason that our Charity should require a more <hi>positive Evidence</hi> of the Qualification on which the claim is made. In the Primitive Times, They made such a <hi>Profession</hi> at their being <hi>Added unto the Church;</hi> and the <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> had this <hi>Justifying Circumstance</hi> in it, that they made it, when they Endangered their very L<hi>ives</hi> to make it. I make no doubt, but that in such a Time of <hi>Persecution,</hi> the Like <hi>Profession</hi> ought to be esteemed <hi>sufficient.</hi> But in places where the true Religion is in <hi>Repute</hi> and <hi>Fashion,</hi> then to look for some other <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Circumstance</hi> of a <hi>Profession,</hi> is but a Reasonable Conformity to the custome and manner of the Apostles.

               </gap> memorable Text, recommended unto us.</p>
            <p>The First is, an <hi>Antecedent</hi> Duty which is enjoyned upon us, to <hi>Qualifie</hi> us for the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the t'other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let a man examine himself</hi>] What <hi>Man</hi> is to do this? why, the <hi>Man</hi> that would be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant at the Holy Table; the <hi>Man</hi> that pretends a Right and Claim unto the Supper of the Lord. The man is to <hi>Examine himself.</hi> A Metaphor is here taken from the Action of a <hi>Goldsmith</hi> upon a <hi>Metal.</hi> The Word of God is compared unto, <hi>A Fire;</hi> and in this Heavenly <hi>Fire</hi> we are to make a Trial of our selves: which no way excludes or hinders a <hi>further Trial</hi> to be made of us, by those that have in their Hands the <hi>Keys</hi> of that House, which we demand an entrance into.</p>
            <p>The other is, a <hi>Consequent</hi> Duty, and it is propounded as likewise a <hi>Priviledg</hi> to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by those that upon <hi>Examination</hi> find themselves ready for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so let him eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup.</hi>] So! That So, is, as one sayes upon it, An Hedge planted against every <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion.</hi> Tis not an Exercise which every man is immediately to be put upon. The Gospel, that is to be <hi>Preached unto every Creature:</hi> But
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000535_0090_0FA6B74FB68630E0"/>
the <hi>Supper of the Lord</hi> is only for those who upon a <hi>Self-Examination</hi> find themselves to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects capable and convenient for it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here a direct Contradiction to a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Sacriledg</hi> in the False <hi>Aposrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church of Rome.</hi>  The Apostle sayes, There is <hi>Bread</hi> now to be <hi>Eaten:</hi> the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of <hi>Rome</hi> sayes, No, 'tis not <hi>Bread</hi> but the very <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord. The Apostle sayes, Let any Believer <hi>Drink</hi> of the C<hi>up:</hi> the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> sayes, No, let none but a Bigotted <hi>Clergy-man</hi> tast a Drop of it. What an Opposition is here? <hi>O my People, come out of that Babylon, saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that remains for our Consideration is,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Self-Examination</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Duty of a <hi>Good Conversation;</hi> and particularly incumbent on us in our <hi>Preparation</hi> for the Table of the Lord.</p>

I <hi>Pray thee, of whom</hi> S<hi>peaks the Prophet this? of himself, or of some other?</hi> Truly, it cannot be said, of S<hi>olomon,</hi> That he was a proper <hi>Shepherd,</hi> or that he was any where shut out of Doors, till his Head was <hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> she was beaten by <hi>Watchmen</hi> that found her seeking of him.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The Opinion, That this was a <hi>Love-Song,</hi> made upon the too Exceptionable wedding between <hi>Davids</hi> Son and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, is confuted, by the mention which the Song makes about <hi>The Tower of Lebanon,</hi>

that was not built until more than Twenty years afterwards. It is therefore Evident, That <hi>A Greater than Solomon is here!</hi> Our Lord Jesus and His Church are the <hi>Lovers,</hi> whose Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are here describ'd unto us. The Wise man, in his old Age, bitterly Repenting of the <hi>Impure Loves</hi> which his younger years had been defil'd withall, do's now write of a more <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and S<hi>acred</hi> Love.</p>
            <p>In our Text, we have the <hi>Respect</hi> of the Church unto the Lord Jesus Christ; upon which, Two Things are to be noted.</p>
            <p>First, we have the S<hi>eason</hi> of it. It is, <hi>when the King sitteth at His Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the <hi>Person</hi> which we are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with; it is a <hi>Great King</hi> who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to be treating with us miserable Beggars and Sinner here. O that we could enough Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Benignity and the Condescension of the <hi>King</hi> that ha's brought us hither! If we now put that <hi>Question,</hi> in Psal.24 8,10. <hi>Who is this King of Glory? Who is this King!</hi> We may take that answer, in Mal.1.14. <hi>I am a</hi> G<hi>reat King, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Our Blessed Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is the <hi>King,</hi> whom we now make our Addresses to; and it is our Business here to acknowledge Him as our <hi>King.</hi> Very <hi>Royal</hi> is the largess, which we are here to <hi>Expect</hi> from His magnificent and munificent Hands;
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000535_0143_0FA6B7904FA90C68"/>
we must now look for those things, that <hi>Life</hi> and that <hi>Peace,</hi> which it may well be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eem the Dignity of such a <hi>King</hi> to give. We are here also to <hi>Resolve</hi> that we will be Governed by His Laws; and with an unspotted <hi>Loyalty</hi> unto Him, we are now to say, <hi>The Lord is our King, and He shall save us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But behold also the <hi>Posture</hi> which He stoops unto. We find He, <hi>Sitteth at His Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> The Hebrew Original represents Him as <hi>Lying Down</hi> in a <hi>Round</hi> or a <hi>Ring</hi> of persons, whom He do's feast Himself withal. There is a Blessed <hi>Feast</hi> which the Lord Jesus do's Refresh the <hi>S</hi>ouls of His <hi>People</hi> with; and He do's vouchsafe of His <hi>Presence</hi> to them as, and in this Heavenly Festival. This <hi>Presence</hi> of His, is indeed that which sweetens all!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have the <hi>Effect</hi> of it. It is thus Expressed, <hi>my Spiknard sends forth the smell thereof.</hi> Which is to be understood rather <hi>Actively,</hi> than <hi>Passively. It</hi> signifies not only, That the Lord Jesus doth here Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume His Church with the Liquid and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Nard</hi> of His own <hi>S</hi>pirit; and that, <hi>We have an Unction from the Holy One;</hi> But it also and cheefly Signifies, that the Church doth here very sweetly Delight the Lord Jesus, by Exercising of much <hi>Grace</hi> upon Him. The <hi>Grace</hi> of God, is as a pure and rich <hi>Spice</hi> in
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:000535_0144_0FA6B7915096AC70"/>
the Souls of them that have it; when this G<hi>race</hi> is Exercised, it is like a <hi>Perfume</hi> in the Resentments of our Lord Jesus Christ; and He says upon it, <hi>My Spouse, how much better is the smell of thine Ointments, than all Spices?</hi> Our <hi>Lavender,</hi> which is a Bastard <hi>Spiknard,</hi> is very sweet; but the true and right S<hi>pik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> of the <hi>East-</hi> I<hi>ndies,</hi> is unspeakably more Delicious; however, the G<hi>race</hi> of God Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in us, is far more fragant and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that Holy Lord.</p>
            <p>But we have this <hi>Doctrine</hi> then to think upon.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Graces ought to be the <hi>Endeavour</hi> of Christians at the Cable of the Lord.</p>
            <p>One word or two will bring us to the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of this <hi>Faithfull saying.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> There is an Historical <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the Lord Jesus to be had at his Holy Table. The <hi>Elements</hi> and the <hi>Actions</hi> in the Sacrament all serve to represent the History of the Lord Jesus Christ unto us, and we should therefore so <hi>sit</hi> in the Meeting house, as that we may <hi>see</hi> those <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> during the whole Administration. Having before-hand read the <hi>History</hi> of the Lord Jesus in the S<hi>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> we are now to read it over again in the S<hi>upper</hi> and accompany him from His <hi>Birth</hi> to his <hi>Grave</hi> with our Meditations.  <hi>Remember</hi> now the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and the following <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of the <hi>L</hi>ord Jesus Christ, in all the parts of it; and <hi>Remember</hi> especially the Agonies of his Bloody Passion, <hi>When his</hi> S<hi>oul was made an Offering for Sin.

Anguish of divers Hours caused Him to give up the Ghost. <hi>Remember</hi> the <hi>Soul-Torments</hi> endured by the Lord Jesus, when the Terrors of His mind fetch'd from Him a Sweat of <hi>Blood,</hi> tho' He were then in a cold Night gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling on the cold Earth; and when His Roarings were <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> O <hi>Remember</hi> the horrible suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord; Hear the <hi>Echo's</hi> of His <hi>Groans,</hi> and look again into every one of His Grievous, Hideous <hi>Wounds</hi> and Imagine that you have like <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> His Dead <hi>Body</hi> all <hi>Ghastly,</hi> and Bloody in your Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is furthermore, an <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Remembrance</hi> of the Lord Jesus, to be had at his Holy Table.</p>
               <p>But How?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We are here to <hi>Remember</hi> the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, with an <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Mysteries</hi> appearing in His Dying for us.

                     </gap>s! Remember</hi> the <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cause of His Death, which was the <hi>Sin</hi> of Man. With Admiration again Behold, and say, <hi>He was wounded for our Transgressions, He was bruised for our Iniquities, the chastisement of our Peace was upon him!</hi> Behold and say, <hi>God made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in Him!</hi>  These are <hi>Mysteries</hi> to be here adored. Let us also look upon the <hi>Effects</hi> of His Death, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the <hi>Mysteries</hi> Illustratious in them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Reconciliation</hi> which His Death has effected for us, and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the <hi>Friendship</hi> now established be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man. With Admiration here Behold and say, <hi>When we were Enemies we were reconciled unto</hi> G<hi>od by the Death of His Son!</hi> Behold and say, G<hi>od is in Christ reconciling the World unto Himself, nor Imputing their Trespasses unto them!</hi> Remember also that <hi>Victoriousness</hi> Which His Death has effected for us: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect how we are made <hi>Conquerors, and more than conquerors thorough Him that loved us.</hi> With Admiration again, Behold, and say, <hi>The</hi> L<hi>ord Jesus Christ hath now overcome Death, and destroy'd him that had the power of Death, which is the Divel.</hi> Behold, and say, <hi>The Lord Jesus having spoiled Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers hath made shew of them openly, in His Cross triumphing over them!</hi> These are further

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are here to <hi>Remember</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ, with a deep R<hi>epentance</hi> for, our sins, which His Death is to be ascribed unto.</p>
               <p>Particularly, We are now to R<hi>emember</hi> our Dying Jesus, with a <hi>Sorrow</hi> for all our sins. Here we should fulfil that word, in Zech. 12. 12. <hi>They shall look on Him, whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn.</hi> O We should now <hi>mourn</hi> to think of the <hi>Grief,</hi> which our sins have put the Lord Jesus Christ unto; and we should look upon <hi>our selves,</hi> as the <hi>Judas,</hi> the <hi>Pilate,</hi> and all the Wicked Miscreants that butchered ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When we see our Blessed Jesus fearfully mangled on his Table we may take it for granted, <hi>Surely some evil Beast has devoured Him!</hi> But we must presently remind that we <hi>our selves</hi> were the <hi>Devourers,</hi> and we may a little alter the Words used by <hi>David</hi> of old, <hi>Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but this Lamb, what has he done?</hi> Hereupon all the Strokes and Stabs given to our Lord, should enter into our Hearts; and as when our Dying Lord said unto <hi>Mary, Behold thy Son!</hi> it is noted, <hi>A Sword passed through her Soul:</hi> So when tis here said unto us, <hi>Behold thy Saviour!</hi> Every sin of ours that brought the <hi>Curse</hi> upon him, should be as a <hi>Sword</hi> unto our very <hi>Souls</hi> within us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Preaching Elder</hi>s <hi>that Rule well, are not worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Honour, unless they labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>

               <p>B<hi>ut there are Elders who Rule well, that are worthy of double</hi> H<hi>onour, tho' they do not Labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>May our Churches then every where, look out, for <hi>Prudent, Gracious,</hi> H<hi>umble men;</hi> who may have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care incumbent on them, about the <hi>Admission</hi> and <hi>Exclusion</hi> of Members; to inspect the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Walk</hi> of all the Communicants; to prevent all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of <hi>Division</hi>s and <hi>Contention</hi>s; to warn all persons unto the <hi>Dutie</hi>s more peculiarly pertinent unto their Circumstances, by a <hi>personal Instruction</hi> from House to House: to visit the S<hi>ick,</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> the T<hi>empted,</hi> &amp; the P<hi>ersecuted;</hi> to inform the <hi>Minister</hi>s about the <hi>state of the Flock</hi> from Time to Time; and to consult with them about all the Affairs of the Society, over which they do preside.
