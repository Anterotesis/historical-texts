            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Occaſion of theſe Words, is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the firſt Part of the Verſe: They are Chriſt's Reply to a blaſphemous and ſcandalous Inſinuation of the Phariſees. We have an Account in the 22 ver. of Chriſt's caſting out a Devil from a Perſon who was made blind and dumb by him, and his healing the Man; inſomuch, that the whole Multitude were amazed, and glorified God, and cried, <hi>Is not this the Son of</hi> David, <hi>i. e.</hi> the promiſed

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as plain as the Sun; and the Phariſees could not deny, but it was an extraordinary Thing, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural: And they could no Way avoid the Concluſion, That this was the Son of <hi>David,</hi> out by ſuggeſting, that VChriſt caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> that there was a Compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Devil, and purſuant to this, the Devil was not properly caſt out, but did voluntarily retire, and give back with Deſign. This was the laſt Refuge of an obſtinate Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, that was reſolved to ſtand it out againſt the cleareſt Conviction. Chriſt's Reply to this baſe Imputation, is copious and cogent; that (as Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> notes)
<q>Every Mouth may be ſtopped with Senſe and Reaſon, before it be ſtopped with Fire and Brimſtone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Argument is in my Text, in which our Lord ſhews them, That it would be very ſtrange, and was highly improbable, that Satan ſhould be caſt out by ſuch a Compact, becauſe then his Kingdom would be divided againſt itſelf; which is a Thing, conſidering his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, not be imagined: Wherefore, Chriſt's lays down a known Rule, univerſally approved by the Reaſon and Conſciences of all Sorts of Men, That in all Societies, a common Ruin is the Conſequence of mutual Quarrels. <hi>Every Kingdom divided against itſelf, is brought to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;</hi> and ſo is every Society and Family
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006797_0005_1029A3B6CE8EC6B0"/>too. This, the great <hi>Roman</hi> Orator, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, obſerves as a Thing obvious, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily reſulting from the Nature of the Thing. <hi>Quae enim Domus tam Stabilis eſt, Quae tam firma Civitas, quae non odiis, et diſſi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            <p>DOCT. <hi>Diviſions and Contentions in Churches, as well as other Societies of Men, tend to, and if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, do bring on their Ruin and Deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not at preſent, purpoſely conſider how they tend to the Ruin of other Societies; deſigning eſpecially to conſider how they tend to the Ruin and Deſolation of Churches.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Societies of Men combin'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Religious and Eccleſiaſtical Polity, and ſo partake of the common Nature of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Cities, and other Societies of Men; and the Propoſition which Chriſt lays down here, is univerſal, a known Rule, with Reſpect to all Societies, and holds with Reſpect to Churches, as well as others.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006797_0006_1029A3BBCA9D3190"/>
I ſhall propoſe ſeveral Conſiderations, to ſhew and illuſtrate the Truth of this Aſſertion, and then make ſome Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such Diviſions and Contentions tend to increaſe the Allenation of particular Members, from one another, where Churches and Church Members are joined together, as they ought to be, according to the Apoſtle's Rule. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 10. <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame Thing, and that there be no Diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment,</hi> then will be no Diviſions among them. All Diviſions and Contentions muſt take their Riſe from difference of Sentiments, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Alienation of Affection of one Perſon from another; the Continuance of theſe, tend to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them more and more; they tend to beget and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe hard Thoughts, and unkind Suſpicions of one another's Actions and Principles. When Church Members are divided, they are apt to grow ſtrange to one another, to converſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly or ſhily with, and be afraid to truſt one another; they are ready to entertain Jealouſies of one another, that this and that Man had ſome Deſign againſt them, and is aiming to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and counteract them: For in Diviſions and Contentions, the different Parties have different Deſigns in View; from whence natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raily
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006797_0007_1029A3BD4F16C718"/>ariſe Jealouſies of each other, and Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions that their Neighbours and Brethren who differ from them, deſign to overthrow their Purpoſes, and defeat their Intentions; and even theſe Jealouſies and Suſpicions which ariſe in their Minds, do of themſelves increaſe the Alienation of their Affections, and ſtill ſet them at a farther Diſtance; and tend either to break off all Communication, or to render what they have, an angry, or a ſly, cautious, and deſigning Thing, and at length to iſſue in open and declared Enmity. <hi>Two cannot walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except they be agreed,</hi> Amos 3.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such Diviſions tend to many Sins, and ſinful Carriages of Brethren and Members towards one another.</p>
            <p>As they create and increaſe Jealouſies and Suſpicions of one another, theſe tend to break out into ſinful Actions. While they wrongly interpret one another's Views and Deſigns, they foſter the Imputation of ſome Crime upon their Brethren, which they are not guilty of; aggravate their Infirmities, and account, and treat them as groſs and wilful Sins: They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Minds to put the worſt Conſtruction upon thoſe Actions which ſeem to be bad, and to put bad ones upon thoſe Actions which are really Virtuous and Religious. Diviſions tend to ſtir up Anger, and Wrath, Clamour, and Evil-ſpeaking. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006797_0008_1029A3C095A16250"/>heard that their Brethren had built an Altar on t'other Side <hi>Jordan,</hi> they preſently concluded that they were turning away from the Lord, and thereupon readily concluded to go to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22 12 When <hi>Ziba</hi> fawn'd upon <hi>David,</hi> and flatter'd him, and he let in evil Thoughts of <hi>Mephiboſheph,</hi> he preſently gave Credit to <hi>Ziba</hi>'s Lye, and unjuſtly, and without an Hearing, gave away his Land to <hi>Ziba.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.3, 4. Hence ſuch Cautions and Warnings are given to God's People, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the Children of thy People, but then ſhall love thy Neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> Prov. 10.12, 18. <hi>Hatred ſtirreth up Strifes; but Love covereth all Sins. He that bideth Hatred with lying Lips, and he that uttereth Slander, is a Foel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Such Diviſions and Contentions among Brethren, tend to deprive themſelves, and one another, of the Means of their Spiritual Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>The next and immediate Work of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to break off, and put an End to that Chriſtian and Brotherly Converſation which Chriſtians ought to maintain, to inſtruct, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and edify one another. Contentions break off moſt, if not all of this Sort of Converſation; and if the Shadow of it is kept up, 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly turn'd into Diſputes and Debates about reconciling their Words and Actions, one Side
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006797_0009_1029A3C3D18CAD00"/>charging Crimes, the other juſtifying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves; the Iſſue of which, is often a Wrangle, and greater Diſſention, and ſo one great Means of mutual Edification is at an End, and then follows ſuch Alienation of Affection, and hard Thoughts of one another, that they can't hold Communion together any longer. One thinks the other too bad, and too little of a Chriſtian, to have Communion with him; either that his Principles or Practices are ſuch, that he can't join with him in any Thing, and the other preſently thinks as hardly of him. Beſides, they often bring on ſuch an Alienation and Diſaffection, that one will not promote the common Edification of the Body, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his Part of the Charge of it, perhaps chiefly becauſe 'tis in a Way which the other propoſes or chuſes. He concludes it can't be right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Man, or that Party which propoſes it, muſt needs be wrong; and having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before, that they are bad Men; and have bad Deſigns, he is well ſatisfied, that what they are purſuing, can't be good. By theſe Means, they are in Danger to drop the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and the ordinary Means he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Edification and Salvation. So they tend to break the Bands of Church Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and crumble them to pieces, in full Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Direction of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Let nothing be done through Strife or Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,

Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man alſo on the Things of others.</hi> Contrary to his Direction, and his Example, propoſed for our Imitation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Give none Offence; neither to the</hi> Jew <hi>nor the</hi> Gentile, <hi>nor to the Church of God. Even as I pleaſe all Men in all Things, not ſeeking mine own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi>

But when they are crumbled, broken, and divided into Factions and Parties, they become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to thoſe that are without, who are apt to look upon them as different Parties of Hypocrites; proud, conceited, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, and treat them with Scorn, deſpiſe their Diſcipline, and the Teſtimony they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give for Religion, as a Tool to ſerve their Paſſions, and promote their Party De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.

            </p>
            <p>USE 1. Hence Chriſtians and Churches ſhould dread Diviſions and Contentions among themſelves. Since they have ſuch a bad Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to their Ruin and Deſolation, they ought to have a great Dread of them, and watch againſt the Beginnings, and all Occaſions of them; for when once they are let in, 'tis not eaſy to foreſee their End: This is agreeable to the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The beginning of ſtrife, is as when one letteth out Water; therefore leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</hi>

We ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006797_0017_1029A3DE1C8BD0C8"/>dread the firſt Spark of this Fire, the firſt breaking forth of this Ire: Therefore leave it off, not only when you ſee the worſt of it, but when you ſee the firſt of it.</q> Beſides what has been ſaid, let me mention two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Contentions in Churches are a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Diſhonour to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Men are apt to make light of Religious Contentions, and even to boaſt of them as the natural and neceſſary Reſult of true Religion; as what Chriſt has fore-told con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Event of the Goſpel, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.14, 35. <hi>Think not that I am come to ſend Peace on Earth; I came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword. For I am come to ſet a Man at Variance againſt his Father, and the Daughter againſt her Mother, and the Daughter-in-Law againſt her Mother-in-Law.</hi> We are not to underſtand that Chriſt came to make Quarrels in his own Church, or to ſet his own Diſciples at Variance with one another. He did not come to give temporal or carnal Peace, and worldly Proſperity, as they then ſeem'd to think he did. His Errand was not to give his Diſciples temporal Power, Eaſe, and Wealth, in this World. No! He came to give us Peace with God, Peace in our Conſciences, Peace with our Brethren. Tho' <hi>in the World</hi> (he ſays) <hi>ye ſhall have Tribulation.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006797_0018_1029A3E14AEA5790"/>If all the World would Heardly receive Chriſt, and his Doctrine, there would be an univerſal Peace: But while there are ſo many that reject him, who are the Children of the World, and the Seed of the Serpent, the Children of God muſt expect to feel their Enmity. The Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Contentions there are among Men, are not the Fruit of the Goſpel, but of the Luſts of thoſe who do not cordially receive it. The moſt violent and implacable Feuds, have been thoſe which have ariſen about Religion. The Goſpel proves the Occaſion of Diviſions; but it is not becauſe there is any Tendency in the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, to make Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable, but becauſe Men's Luſts oppoſe the peaceable, pure, and holy Doctrines which he teaches them. But all Chriſtian Churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be Diſciples of Chriſt, who is the Prince and Author of Peace; and are ſolemnly bound by Covenant, to obey his Will, and be govern'd by his Laws; and their Diſſentions and Quarrels are a ſad Evidence, that they are not as they ſhould be: That either ſome of them are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, or at leſt, that they are not ſo much under the Power of Chriſt's Laws, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with the true Principles of his holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as they ought to be; and they ſcandalize the Name of Chriſt, as if he was the Patron of their Contentions, and reproach his holy
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006797_0019_1029A3E68DE65980"/>Religion, as if Devotees of it might live in ſuch Wrath, Variance, Emulations, and Strife, as he declares are <hi>not the Works of the Spirit, but of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.20. As if when he bids Chriſtians, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. <hi>to contend earnestly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> he gave them a Licence to quarrel with their Brethren, to call them hard Names and to injure and hurt them by Force or Craft, becauſe they ſee not as they do, or think differently from them, in thoſe Things wherein they think the Eſſence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does not lie; whereas Chriſtians are only to contend for the Faith, by ſound Doctrine, ſtrong Arguments, holy Lives, plous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, firm Patience, and deep Humility, in bearing all the Evils they meet with from an evil World, in the Way of their ſtedfaſt and perſevering Obedience to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diviſions and Contentions in Churches, do much harm to others, as well as to their own Souls. The Diviſions and Contentions of the viſible Body of Chriſt, are, as has been ſaid, great Hindrances to their own mutual Edification. They are alſo a ſad Stumbling to weak Chriſtians, and expoſe them to many Temptations, and Means of their uncharitable, uncomfortable, and unholy Walking. And they prove an Occaſion of Ruin to ſome, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006797_0020_1029A3E9D8A19290"/>perhaps many poor Souls, and harden them in their Unbelief, and Atheiſm. 'Tis no uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Thing to hear the Reproach of Inſiders againſt Religion, on Account of the unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Behaviour of profeſſing Chriſtians. 'Tis not very ſeldom they may be heard to ſay of them, That there are ſuch Differences among themſelves in their own Doctrines and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Religion, that there can be no Certainty in them: That there are ſuch ſierce Debates, ſuch Heats, Animoſities, and envious, and ſelfiſh Controverſies, contrary to the Doctrines of Peace and Love, Patience and Forbearance, which they all pretend to acknowledge, that it evidences none; but the more weak and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe them, and ſo they conclude that it is all Impoſture. When carnal Men ſee the viſible Body of Chriſt bringing forth like Fruits, as the carnal World do, ſpringing from a bitter, perſecuting, cenſorious, impatient, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengful Spirit, in like Works of the Fleſh, as Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Striſe, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Hereſies, they believe there is no more Religion in one than the other; and ſo they ſink in Atheiſm, and are confirmed in their Rejection and Neglect of Chriſt, and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrine. Wherefore Churches, and particular Chriſtians, ſhould dread theſe Things, as they would love and promote the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006797_0021_1029A3975F476E58"/>Honour of their Divine Maſter; and dread whatſoever tends to the Reproach and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing of his ſacred and precious Name, who has bid them <hi>be one,</hi> and pray'd that they <hi>might be one, as he and his Father are one.</hi> If thoſe who have been long engaged in Contentions and Diviſions, think 'tis too late for them to be warned of the Danger, and excited to dread the beginnings of them: However, 'tis not too late to dread the Miſchiefs of them, and ſeek Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſtians and Churches ſhould be greatly concerned to heal Diviſions among themſelves. How far foever any Churches have gone in Diviſions, 'tis to be hoped 'tis not too late to entreat you to put an End to them, and to uſe the Means of healing. 'Tis not too late to put the Queſtion to you, which <hi>Abner</hi> did to <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 2.26. <hi>Shall the Sword devour forever? Knowest thou not that it will be Bitterneſs in the latter End?</hi> If Diviſions have gone far, 'tis ſurely Time to ſee if there be no Balm in <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead,</hi> if there be no Phyſician there.—Hoping that ſuch Churches and Perſons are heartily concern'd to have the Hurt of the Daughter of God's People healed, let me propoſe to your Conſideration, ſome Means of healing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. See that an hearty Deſire of God's Glory, and the Advancement of the Intereſts of Chriſt's Kingdom, rule in your Hearts.</p>

If, my Brethren, you be all actuated and governed by a ſupream Love of God, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and if a ſincere Deſire of his Glory, and the Advancement of the great, eſſential Intereſts of Religion, do govern your Hearts (and I am perſuaded there is not a Man or you, who either does not pretend it does, or at leſt owns it ought to be ſo), Diviſions and Contentions then will ſoon ceaſe. There's nothing in the World will ſo calm your Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſweeten your Tempers, and bring all your Self-Will, worldly Intereſts and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices to the Foot of Chriſt, and make you willing to forego them all for that one great and common Intereſt, the Edification and Salvation of the Body. This will make you willing to ſacrifice every private and Party Intereſt to the Honour of God, and the common Good. If the great, neceſſary, all-concerning Things of Religion may be preſerved, and the common Good promoted, you will not think it of any great Conſequence, whether it be in a Way exactly, and in all Circumſtances agreable to your Mind or not; for God's Glory, and the common Salvation, will appear to you to be Things infinitely greater than your own Will or Humour, or particular Opinions, or any particular Intereſt of yours. This will moſt effectually teach you, not to ſeparate any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,

This will do abundance, to convince you that Religion diſdains the narrow Limits of a Party. And if Men may be brought to Union with Chriſt by true Faith, ſincere Love. If they be made ſincerely holy and obedient, and you yourſelves abound in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Virtues, it is worth all the Intereſts of this World; yea, that they are nothing in Compariſon with it: All other Concerns would run into this great one, like Rivers into the Sea, which would ſwallow up all. For Chriſt ſhews us, we ſhould be ready to part with our Lives for his <hi>Sake, and to lay them down for the Brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. Therefore all other Intereſts would be transferred to this.</p>

3. There muſt be a Forbearing one another a all Things not eſſential to Salvation. As Chriſtians muſt be all of one Mind in all Things abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, ſo in other Matters, there is little Room to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they ſhould be of one wind: They never have been in any Age of Chriſtianity, nor is it like they ever will be in this World. 'Tis almoſt as common to differ in their Thoughts about other Things, as in their Looks. And if you are reſolved to maintain Diſſention and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, becauſe there are many Things wherein you have different Apprehenſions from others, you may e'en ſit down in Deſpair of an Union. If Chriſtians are reſolved to contend, becauſe you don't all think alike about Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or the Explication of every particular Text of Scripture, you may give over the Thoughts of Peace and Union, and conclude to tear the ſeamleſs Coat of Chriſt to pieces. The Chriſtian Church, 'tis like, will never be in Peace in this World, but by a kind and charitable Forbearance of one another in all Things which are not eſſential to Salvation. This is the Way of being of one Mind in theſe Things; and 'tis like God has left theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters liable to Diſputes and Debates, among other wiſe Reaſons, for this, <hi>viz.</hi> to exerciſe the Humility, Forbearance, and Charity, as
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006797_0026_1029A3FF2D4F0F60"/>well as Diligence of Chriſtians; this, in theſe Matters, is the Rule of Peace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in any Thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheleſs, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A patient bearing, and ready forgiving one another all manner of perſonal Injuries, and all ſuppoſed unchriſtian Wrongs, ſo far as the Law of Chriſt allows of it. <hi>In the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Words, there wanteth not Sin.</hi> In the long Contentions which have ſubſiſted among Chriſtian Brethren, if none of you have by wrong and hard Speeches, and injurious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wronged your Neighbours; if none have by unchriſtian Actions, Words, and Behaviour, and an unchriſtian Temper, in the Management of your Controverſies, diſhonoured Chriſt and Religion, you are doubtleſs a very ſingular People; yea, if there be not found much of theſe Things with every Party.—Now the Rule is in theſe Matters, as to what is perſonal, and ſo far as 'tis a perſonal Injury, to bear every Thing patiently. It don't become a Chriſtian to have any perſonal Quarrel with any Man in the World, but to bear perſonal Injuries pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and eye the Hand of God therein, as

               <hi>David</hi> did in <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing him. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.17. This Rule we are taught by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5, 7. <hi>Charity beareth all Things.</hi> Col. 3.12, 13. <hi>Put on therefore (at the Elect of God, holy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) Bowels of Mercies, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; if any Man have a Quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye.</hi> Chriſt don't allow his Diſciples to bear any Grudge, or avenge themſelves at all upon any, for any Injury; but ſo far as Injuries are perſonal, he requires them abſolutely to forgive them, aſked, or unaſked, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>For, if ye forgive Men their Treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will alſo forgive you: But if ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your Treſpaſſes.</hi> And if you apprehend the Laws and Rules of Chriſt are broken, you muſt ſee to it, that you don't aggravate Matters, or treat the Fault with any farther Severity than is neceſſary, purely to vindicate the Honour of Chriſt, and Religion. Your own Wills or Intereſts muſt have nothing to do in handling theſe Matters; but purely the Will and Glory of God and Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1, 2. and ver. 31, 32. <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil-ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all Malice. And be ye
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006797_0028_1029A40272D65BC8"/>kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's Sake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Fervently love and pray for one another, and for the ſpecial Preſence of God among you. You muſt be above all Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that you may have the ſpecial Preſence of God among you, by his Divine Spirit. If he be with you, this will make your Way eaſy, and lighten your Path. This will revive God's Work in your Souls. It will make it eaſy to confeſs your Faults, and eaſy to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confeſs your Faults one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and pray for one another.</hi> 1 John 5.16. <hi>If any Man ſee his Brother <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a Sin, which is not unto Death, he ſhall aſk, and he ſhall give him Life for them that ſin not unto Death.</hi>—If God give you an hearty Love for one another's Souls, and Spiritual Edification, and help you fervently and ſincerely to pray for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, your Party-Intereſts, and Self-Will, will wonderfully ſubſide and die away. While you are heartily praying God to forgive your Brethren and Neighbours, you will not be unwilling to forgive them yourſelves: You can't ſincerely ſay the Lord's Prayer with an unforgiving Spirit. If God pour upon you a Spirit of hearty and fervent Prayer for his Preſence and his Spirit among you: If there
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006797_0029_1029A405B5474070"/>were ſuch a Spirit of Prayer in the Churches of this Land, it would be an happy Omen of the Revival of true Religion, of the powerful Influence of Truth, of Righteouſneſs, and abundance of Peace: Which God of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy grant, for Chriſt Jeſus' Sake.
