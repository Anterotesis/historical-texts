            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT <hi>Man</hi> is deſign'd for <hi>Society,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the original <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the human <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE need and deſire each others <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> for mutual <hi>Support, Comfort</hi> and <hi>Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and have a <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> to communicate our <hi>Ideas</hi> to thoſe of our own <hi>Species,</hi> as well as <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Beneficence.</hi> Theſe <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> being <hi>common</hi> and mutual, ſhew that we are born for <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF this, mutual <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Band</hi> and <hi>Cement;</hi> which, unleſs it be preſerv'd and expreſs'd, <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> becomes a <hi>Snare</hi> and <hi>Torment,</hi> and cannot comfortably or profitably ſubſiſt, yea, hardly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at all, for any long Duration: For Men, by the Neglect of its Exerciſe, and much more by its Contrary, will be tempted, againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> to ſeek a <hi>ſingle</hi> and independent State, in order to ſecure their <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as <hi>Love</hi> is agreeable to the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the original <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Minds</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> ſo, of conſequence, it cannot but agree with the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> the unalterable <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Practice,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which is its <hi>Prototype,</hi> or original <hi>Copy</hi> and <hi>Exemplar.</hi> Hence
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006243_0004_10281D7654AE6B18"/>
we are inform'd by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Love; i. e.</hi> inclin'd to vouchſafe upon his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> Acts of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Benignity,</hi> and does not inflict <hi>Penalties,</hi> till they be as it were extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>criminal Conduct</hi> of his <hi>Creatures.</hi> Hence <hi>Judgment</hi> is repreſented as <hi>his ſtrange Work;</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> his <hi>Delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR are we only obliged to <hi>love</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Ties</hi> of <hi>Humanity,</hi> as we are <hi>Men;</hi> but likewiſe by the <hi>Laws</hi> of Chriſtianity, as we are <hi>Brethren</hi> (at leaſt by Profeſſion) <hi>Children</hi> of the ſame <hi>Father, Members</hi> of the ſame religious <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity</hi> (or Body myſtical) <hi>Heirs</hi> of the ſame <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Expectants</hi> of the ſame <hi>Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the moſt powerful <hi>Incentive</hi> to the <hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> is the glorious <hi>Example</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer's Love to us,</hi> which the Apoſtle beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repreſents in the Words of our Text, <hi>And walk in Love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us an Offering, and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God for a ſweet-ſmelling Savour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN theſe Words we may obſerve an important <hi>Duty</hi> enjoin'd, <hi>Walk in Love;</hi> and a powerful <hi>Motive</hi> exciting thereto <hi>propos'd, viz.</hi> The <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us; expreſs'd in the <hi>Giving of himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice of a ſweet-ſmelling Savour to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN order to prepare this <hi>Subject</hi> for Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is neceſſary to open and explain the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Particulars:</p>
            <p>AS to the <hi>Duty</hi> enjoin'd, let us enquire what is imply'd in <hi>Walking in Love</hi> to our Neighbour? I anſwer, it implies our <hi>Eſteem</hi> of him, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>excellent</hi> in him, either <hi>natural, acquired,</hi> or <hi>gracious.</hi> The All-wiſe <hi>God</hi> has diſpenſed his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006243_0005_10281D796559EF78"/>
               <hi>Gifts</hi> variouſly upon the Children of Men; and that with this <hi>Deſign,</hi> that univerſal <hi>Love</hi> to our Fellow-Creatures might take place. There is none whom we converſe with for ſome Time, but we may perceive ſomething <hi>amiable</hi> in them, which deſerves our <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Reſpect.</hi> O! if Mankind were as quick in Spying one another's <hi>Excellencies,</hi> as they are each other's <hi>Faults,</hi> how candid and noble wou'd it be? And how much wou'd it promote univerſal <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Benevolence!</hi> But alas! the contrary <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> too much prevails generally. If our Neighbour has not <hi>ſaving Grace,</hi> which is, no doubt, the <hi>Ground</hi> of our <hi>ſpecial Reſpect</hi> and Complacence, perhaps he has ſome <hi>moral Excellency;</hi> if not, he has at leaſt an <hi>immortal Soul,</hi> which, in reſpect of its <hi>Nature,</hi> may be ſaid to bear the natural <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> But <hi>Love</hi> to our <hi>Brother</hi> does not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our <hi>Eſteem</hi> of him, but our <hi>hearty Deſire</hi> after his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> in the moſt extenſive Senſe; as well as our <hi>Complacence</hi> therein, and <hi>Grief</hi> for the contrary.</p>
            <p>AND this <hi>Love</hi> will doubtleſs manifeſt itſelf in kind and <hi>courteous Speech;</hi> and, where <hi>Neceſſity</hi> requires, and <hi>Ability</hi> admits, in <hi>beneficent Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT more particularly, that <hi>ſpecial Love</hi> to <hi>pious People,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had chiefly in <hi>View</hi> in our <hi>Text,</hi> and which is propos'd by the <hi>Apoſtle John,</hi> as a <hi>Mark</hi> of true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> has the following <hi>Properties:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is <hi>ſincere,</hi> chiefly for their Goodneſs and Holineſs:—</p>
            <p>IT is <hi>univerſal,</hi> extending to all that we have reaſon to think are <hi>pious,</hi> from their <hi>Soundneſs</hi> in the <hi>main Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> their regular <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006243_0006_10281D7B08495298"/>
and <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with experimental <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> If our <hi>Love</hi> be confin'd to thoſe only who are of our <hi>Way of Thinking</hi> in every <hi>minute Point,</hi> it is not true <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Brethren,</hi> but the ſelfiſh <hi>Love</hi> of a <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FARTHER: <hi>Brotherly Love</hi> is <hi>proportional,</hi> ſuited to the different <hi>Degrees</hi> of ſpiritual <hi>Good</hi> we apprehend to be in others. Such as we conceive to be more <hi>holy</hi> than others, we <hi>love</hi> them more in <hi>Degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is likewiſe <hi>effectual;</hi> not conſiſting <hi>in Word, and in Tongue only, but in Deed, and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW to <hi>walk in Love,</hi> implies a <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to our <hi>Brethren,</hi> in <hi>Diſpoſition, Speech</hi> and <hi>Action;</hi> as well as our taking <hi>Pains</hi> to this End. We muſtn't only <hi>begin</hi> to <hi>love</hi> them, but we ſhould make <hi>Progreſs</hi> therein, and <hi>continue</hi> to the <hi>End.</hi> And truly this cannot be done without <hi>Pains:</hi> For as our <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>try'd</hi> variouſly, ſo is our <hi>Love;</hi> and indeed it is proper it ſhould be ſo: For this <hi>Life</hi> is altogether a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Trial</hi> and <hi>Probation,</hi> in order to another <hi>State</hi> after <hi>Death.</hi> Now there are three Sorts of <hi>Trials</hi> that the <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God</hi> is pleaſed ſometimes to ſuffer to come in the Way of our <hi>Love, viz. Spiritual Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Offences</hi> in <hi>Conduct,</hi> and <hi>Difference</hi> in <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> about the <hi>circumſtantial Points</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN a Child of God is long deſerted, his <hi>Savour</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> does of conſequence decline. This muſt needs affect, in ſome Degree, his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> and make it more <hi>unſavoury,</hi> and <hi>leſs edifying:</hi> He is, in this Situation, like a <hi>Tree</hi> in <hi>Winter,</hi> which, tho' it has <hi>Life</hi> at the <hi>Root,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe of its Want of <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Verdure,</hi> as tho' it were quite <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>dead.</hi> Now, a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006243_0007_10281D7CAF46FB48"/>
in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who has much Joy and Comfort, and is fir'd with his firſt <hi>Love,</hi> not having been try'd with <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> and being, on that Account, comparatively unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Devices</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>Depths</hi> of his own <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> is apt to look upon poor deſerted Creatures with ſome Degree of <hi>Contempt,</hi> and cenſure them ſeverely; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to judge that they have no Good in them, becauſe they <hi>have loſt their firſt Love, and fallen from their firſt Works,</hi> in ſome Meaſure. But this is exceeding <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>barbarous!</hi> Very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> and hurtful to Society! And ſuch who are guilty of this Severity, if they will not, by <hi>gentle Meaſures,</hi> be brought to a merciful <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> they muſt learn its Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Excellency by <hi>broken Bones,</hi> by their own Falls and Blunders; they muſt come down from their <hi>Pinacle</hi> of ſpiritual <hi>Pride</hi> one Way or other. O Sirs! let us <hi>be merciful, as our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father is merciful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT another <hi>Trial</hi> of our <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> is <hi>Offences</hi> committed againſt us by them. We are all imperfect Creatures, and <hi>in many Things offend all;</hi> and therefore need each others <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance</hi> and <hi>Charity.—Grace</hi> is in the beſt, like <hi>Gold</hi> in the <hi>Ore,</hi> attended with Weakneſſes and <hi>Defects.</hi> Now <hi>Satan,</hi> who is the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> in Caſe of <hi>Offence,</hi> excites us to impute it to <hi>bad Deſign;</hi> which much aggravates the <hi>Matter,</hi> and ſo tends to inflame our <hi>Reſentments,</hi> and widen the <hi>Breach.</hi> In Oppoſition hereto, it is a neceſſary, tho' difficult Duty, <hi>To hope all Things, and believe all Things</hi> that are Good of our poor <hi>Brother;</hi> to impute his <hi>Offence</hi> to <hi>inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency</hi>

or <hi>Miſtake,</hi> or ſome violent <hi>Temptation,</hi> and not to malicious Intention. This Method has a noble Tendency to ſoften Offences, and to conciliate <hi>Peace.</hi> And this Treatment we expect and deſire from others, and think we are wrong'd when we get it not; and therefore we ſhould render it to others. <hi>If our Brother offends, not only ſeven Times, but ſeventy Times ſeven, when he repents, we ſhould forgive him; and walk in Love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FARTHER: Another Way by which our <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Brethren</hi> is try'd, is <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> in the ſmaller Points of <hi>Religion.</hi> This often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions great Uneaſineſs, Heart-burnings and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, tho' very unreaſonably. We ſhould allow to another the ſame <hi>Liberty</hi> we take ourſelves, and conſider that <hi>Men</hi> can't alter their <hi>Opinions,</hi> or retain them according to their <hi>Neighbours Pleaſure;</hi> but muſt think and believe as Things appear to them from Time to Time. Seeing that every Man has an equal Right to think for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſeeing that <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Force</hi> can't alter the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of the Mind, it is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and unjuſt; yea ſome Degree of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> to be <hi>offended</hi> with our <hi>Brother,</hi> becauſe he doesn't think as we do in every Thing. And inaſmuch as our <hi>Knowledge</hi> is imperfect, as well as our <hi>Graces;</hi> and we are bid to <hi>grow in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as well as in <hi>Grace;</hi> we may, by the Increaſe of Light, be oblig'd to change our <hi>Sentiments</hi> in ſome <hi>circumſtantial Points,</hi> and to need others <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Forbearance</hi> towards us: And why then ſhou'd we not expreſs it towards them? In the <hi>apoſtolick Times</hi> there was a Difference of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi> between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile Chriſtians</hi>

            <p>ON the other Hand, the <hi>Gentile Chriſtians,</hi> not being educated in their <hi>Way,</hi> and better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Extent of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> wou'd not be bro't into <hi>Bondage</hi> by them; but their <hi>Tempers</hi> being over-heated by <hi>Debate,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> they were inclin'd, not only to cenſure them as <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,</hi> with an <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Reſentment,</hi> but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Deſign;</hi> in a Word, the <hi>Ferment</hi> of <hi>Contention</hi> roſe to ſuch a Height, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the aforeſaid <hi>circumſtantial Matters,</hi> that each <hi>Party</hi> were ready to un-church the other: Between them the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> acts as a <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> in the fourteenth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and labours to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the <hi>angry Flame,</hi> by proper <hi>Lenitives;</hi> he adviſes the ſtrong <hi>Gentile,</hi> to receive the <hi>weak Jew</hi> to Communion, or Church-Fellowſhip, tho' in ſome circumſtantial <hi>Errors;</hi> and not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and plague him with <hi>doubtful Diſputations,</hi> or <hi>Debates</hi> about leſſer Things, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively doubtful.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006243_0010_10281D88287DD458"/>
the <hi>Promiſe</hi> farther, will confine the true <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt to one <hi>Fold,</hi> to one <hi>Pale,</hi> and perhaps to a ſmall Number in that, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unreaſonable and uncharitable. There are but a very few of the Children of Men, who are in all minute <hi>Points</hi> of the ſame <hi>Mind;</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> does not extend abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to every <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all that are truly <hi>Pious,</hi> wou'd be unanimous in them; which certainly is not the Caſe; then it will follow, that the proper <hi>Foundation</hi> of our Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> is not <hi>infallible;</hi> and therefore however unreaſonably <hi>confident</hi> Perſons are, on both Sides of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> as generally indeed there is too much of this; yet theſe Things may be truly call'd, at leaſt comparatively, <hi>doubtful Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> A modeſt <hi>Diffidence</hi> of our own <hi>Judgment,</hi> as to thoſe <hi>Matters,</hi> ſo far as to entertain honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Sentiments</hi> of ſuch as are otherwiſe minded, is an amiable <hi>Character:</hi> It is an Argument of a weak Mind, to raiſe a <hi>Superſtructure</hi> diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd to the <hi>Foundation;</hi> on the contrary, it is an Inſtance of true <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to have our <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> ſuited in <hi>Degree</hi> to the <hi>Grounds</hi> on which it is built, and the <hi>Degree</hi> of our <hi>Zeal</hi> proportioned to the Weight and Importance of the Things we are zealous about: <hi>Foundation Truths</hi> ſhould be earneſtly contended for, as well as <hi>experimental</hi> and <hi>practical Religion,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs:</hi> But as to <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> we ſhould be <hi>moderate</hi> and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, elſe inſtead of doing <hi>Good</hi> with our <hi>Zeal</hi> devoid of <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> we ſhall do much <hi>Hurt,</hi> and imitate the pernicious <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, who were very warm <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <p>THE <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> adviſes the contending <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile Chriſtians,</hi> in the aforeſaid Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to abſtain from deſpiſing of and judging one another, on Account of <hi>ſmaller Differences</hi> in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</hi> To this End he obſerves, that Perſons were equally <hi>ſincere</hi> and upright on each Side of the <hi>Queſtion; He that regardeth a Day, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the Day to the Lord, he doth not regard it:</hi> He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerves, That the Conſideration of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be judged by the great <hi>God</hi> at laſt, ſhou'd incline them to avoid <hi>raſh judging</hi> of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Argument that the Apoſtle uſes to excite them to <hi>Peace</hi> and mutual <hi>Love,</hi> is this, That the <hi>Subſtance</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> did not conſiſt in thoſe Things about which they contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; he that in theſe Things ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men. Almighty God,</hi> for wiſe <hi>Purpoſes,</hi> ſuffers his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be of different <hi>Sentiments</hi> about <hi>ſmaller Points</hi> in <hi>Religion;</hi> and particularly for this, that the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Love</hi> may be brought to the <hi>Teſt.</hi> To have regard to thoſe only that are of our Way of thinking in <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> while more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſons, who agree with us in the Main, are <hi>ſlighted,</hi> becauſe they differ in <hi>leſſer Things;</hi> it is an Argument of a <hi>party, factious, ſelfiſh Love:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006243_0012_10281D8CF67AB760"/>
But true <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Brethren,</hi> extends to all thoſe that we have Reaſon to hope, from their <hi>Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in <hi>Foundation-Principles,</hi> Acquaintance with <hi>experimental Religion</hi> and <hi>practical Holineſs,</hi> bear the <hi>moral Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whether they be of our <hi>Denomination</hi> or not: We ſhou'd <hi>bear</hi> with one another's ſuppoſed or real <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> in <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> as well as <hi>Practice,</hi> and, notwithſtanding, <hi>love</hi> one another; Mens different <hi>Capacities,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Ways</hi> of <hi>Education,</hi> the different <hi>Books</hi> they read, the different <hi>Company</hi> they keep, lead them to different Ways of thinking: Add to this, that ſometimes <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> give a ſecret and inſenſible <hi>Byas</hi> to the <hi>Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a ſingular <hi>Mercy</hi> and great <hi>Comfort,</hi> when Perſons are agreed in the moſt important Points; <hi>Whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule; let us mind the ſame Thing; and if in any Thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you.</hi> 'Tis eaſy and natural to love thoſe that are of our Way of Thinking in <hi>every Thing,</hi> and that do not offend us: But when the contrary of theſe happens, then it is difficult. Hence it may ſafely be aſſerted, as a general and juſt <hi>Maxim,</hi> that the more <hi>Tryals</hi> our <hi>Love</hi> meets with, and yet it ſtands them, and proves <hi>Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> the more <hi>Evidence</hi> it has of its being of a Divine <hi>Original;</hi> of its being that <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> which aſcertains our Tranſlation from <hi>Death</hi> to <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to ſpeak of the MOTIVE excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Duty aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> The LOVE of CHRIST to his People; <hi>As Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and given himſelf for us.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:006243_0013_10281D9197AE8BB8"/>HERE let me ſpeak of the <hi>Nature, Properties</hi> and <hi>Manifeſtations,</hi> of CHRIST'S LOVE to his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the general <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> I think it is commonly repreſented to be, <hi>Affectus Unionis;</hi> a Deſire of Union with, or Nearneſs to the <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Object;</hi> and it is Two-fold, namely, of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence</hi> and <hi>Complacency.</hi> The former ſignifies God's kind <hi>Intention</hi> of conferring <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Benefits</hi> upon his People in <hi>Time.</hi> In this Senſe, no doubt, the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> lov'd them before the <hi>Foundations of the Earth were laid;</hi> but the latter ſignifies the Delight he takes in his own <hi>Image</hi> conferr'd actually on thoſe that fear him, in <hi>Time,</hi> and the Application of his <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to them thro' <hi>Faith.</hi> Hence are theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Song of <hi>Solomon, Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no Spot in thee; thou haſt raviſhed my Heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe, with one Chain of thy Neck.</hi> Theſe Expreſſions ſeem to repreſent the Agreeableneſs of the Divine <hi>Image</hi> in his People, to the Divine <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> as well as the Neceſſity of a Change in Mens <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Frame</hi> in order to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhould carefully obſerve, that ſuch a Love as is in us, muſt not be aſcrib'd to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he is <hi>God;</hi> for ours is <hi>paſſionate</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> cauſing a Commotion in our Blood and Spirits; whereas his <hi>Love,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> is a moſt pure and eternal <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> whereby he wills <hi>Good</hi> to us: Yet a <hi>human Love</hi> may be properly aſcrib'd to him, as Man, but with great Pre-eminence to ours: As <hi>Man,</hi> he has a <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body, Will</hi> and <hi>Affections, Blood</hi> and <hi>animal Spirits,</hi> as we, but perfectly pure;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006243_0014_10281D951B465C60"/>
his Love is without <hi>Exceſs</hi> in its <hi>Tendencies,</hi> and without <hi>Tumult</hi> in its <hi>Effects;</hi> the <hi>Motions</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> are entirely <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>calm,</hi> agreeable to right <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the Love of Chriſt has the following <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>IT is <hi>Everlaſting; He has loved us with an everlaſting Love, and therefore with loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has he drawn us.</hi> The Reaſon why any are powerfully enclin'd and enabled to believe, in Time, is, becauſe they were loved before it, with a Love of <hi>kind Intention.</hi> The <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> is repreſented in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as <hi>pleas'd</hi> with his <hi>Deſigns</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Love of Chriſt is <hi>free</hi> and unexcited: Our <hi>dear Lord</hi> lov'd us, when there was nothing <hi>lovely</hi> in us! When we <hi>lay in our Blood,</hi> polluted and expoſed, <hi>he ſpread the Skirt of his Affection over us, and ſaid to us, live!</hi> Yea, <hi>when we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he died for us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Love of Chriſt is <hi>immutable: Whom he loves, he loves to the End. He gives his Sheep eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of his Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Love of Chriſt, my Brethren, is <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, it paſſes Knowledge.</hi> Hence are theſe memorable Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>And may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height, and to know the Love of Chriſt, which paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> There was a great Love between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan; Jonathan</hi> lov'd him as his own Soul! The <hi>Mother's</hi> Love to her <hi>ſucking Child</hi> is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006243_0015_10281D99EC268550"/>
yet greater! And the conjugal Love is doubtleſs ſtronger than theſe! <hi>Am not I better to thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elkanah</hi> to his <hi>Conſort, than ten Sons?</hi> But the nobleſt <hi>Inſtance</hi> of human Love is that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who was willing <hi>to be accurſed from Chriſt for them.</hi> Yet theſe <hi>Affections</hi> glow'd in human <hi>Boſoms,</hi> and ſo do not tranſcend human <hi>Knowledge;</hi> but the Love of Chriſt <hi>paſſes Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and therefore has no Parallel in this lower Globe, but reſembles the Love which the Father has to him; <hi>As the Father hath loved me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>even ſo have I loved you:</hi> But how this is, we can neither conceive or expreſs.</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to ſpeak of the <hi>Manifeſtations</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Love.</hi>

            <p>NOW the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> manifeſts itſelf, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thoughts about them, and by <hi>high Thoughts</hi> of them; hence they are ſaid <hi>to be graven on the Palms of his Hands, and ſet as a Seal upon his Heart;</hi> and we are further told, that tho' <hi>the Mother may forget her ſucking Child, the Son of her Womb, yet he will not forget them;</hi> and what is ſtill more amazing! is the <hi>high Thoughts</hi> he has of his People; in which reſpect they are call'd his <hi>Jewels,</hi> his <hi>Treaſure,</hi> his <hi>Diadem,</hi> his <hi>Joy,</hi> his <hi>Glory!</hi>

He admits his poor People to a <hi>Marriage-union</hi> with his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Majeſty; their Redeemer</hi> is their <hi>Huſband, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name;</hi> and in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this dear and valuable <hi>Relation,</hi> he makes them <hi>honourable, powerful, amiable;</hi> they are call'd not Servants only, but the <hi>Friends of God!</hi> And to which of the <hi>Angels</hi> is this Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>Father, Chriſt</hi> our elder <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> our <hi>Guide,</hi> the bleſſed <hi>Angels</hi> our <hi>Guard,</hi> this <hi>Earth</hi> our <hi>Inn,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> our everlaſting <hi>Home!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS dear Lord does likewiſe make us <hi>comely thro' his Comelineſs, which he puts upon us:</hi> He makes his People all glorious within, he ſheds a Luſtre on our Souls, that out-ſhines the Face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites cou'd not behold him;</hi> that out-ſhines the <hi>Sun,</hi> in his unclouded Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Meridian <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND are not the Sheep of Chriſt, made by their deareſt Lord <hi>powerful?</hi> Yes, through him they have a Kind of <hi>Omnipotence!

            <p>GOD the <hi>Father</hi> is ours in all his <hi>Attributes</hi>— his <hi>Purpoſes</hi>—his <hi>Operations</hi>—his <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Providences!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD the <hi>Son</hi> is ours, he <hi>has given himſelf to us,</hi> his <hi>Perſon</hi>—his <hi>Purchaſe</hi>—his <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is ours, in all his <hi>Influences</hi> and <hi>Graces!—I will pray the Father,</hi> ſays Jeſus to his Diſciples, <hi>and he ſhall give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorter, that he may abide with you forever!</hi> O the unſearchable, inexpreſſible, unparallel'd, and amazing Love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt! Can Men, Can Angels fully repreſent it? No! It is too big, too vaſt, for human Language to expreſs! Too bright, too glorious, for a human Mind to comprehend! Yea; the Thoughts of the ſublimeſt <hi>Seraphs,</hi> are ſwallowed up and loſt, in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and unfathomable <hi>Ocean!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, my dear Brethren, the bleſſed, the adorable Lord Jeſus, has manifeſted his Love to his poor People, by the moſt painful <hi>Paſſions</hi> for them! <hi>He has loved us, and given himſelf for us.</hi> Here, Sirs, let us pauſe a little, and enquire who it was that gave himſelf, to what, for whom, and how.</p>
            <p>WHO? a <hi>God</hi> of glorious <hi>Majeſty,</hi> a <hi>God</hi> of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant <hi>Excellency,</hi> a <hi>God</hi> of unrival'd <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Perfection! Fairer than the Children of Men!
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006243_0018_10281D9E81EFA6B8"/>
Fairer than the Sons of God,</hi> the bleſſed Angels! Who? a <hi>Being</hi> of almighty <hi>Power!</hi> who by a <hi>Word,</hi> and in a <hi>Moment,</hi> has produced the vaſt <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and preſerves them in their preſent <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence!</hi> A <hi>Being</hi> of independant <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty!</hi> who is abſolute Lord of the Univerſe, upon whoſe <hi>Power</hi> all Nature hangs and is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and to whoſe providential Government, the whole Syſtem of <hi>Beings</hi> within the capacious Circuit of the <hi>vaſt</hi> Creation, muſt yield a ſpeedy and ſilent Subjection! Who? A <hi>Being</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from the Days of <hi>Eternity, Whoſe Goings forth, have been forever of old, even from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> One who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and the Ending; nor has Succeſſion in Duration! A <hi>Being</hi> of abſolute Self-ſufficiency, and All-ſufficiency; who has enough of Beauty and of Good, within the Verge of his own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eſſence, to compleat forever his own and his People's <hi>Happineſs!</hi> Nor can his eſſential Glory and Bleſſedneſs admit of any <hi>Acceſſion</hi> or <hi>Decay!</hi> A <hi>Being</hi> of infinite Knowledge, who perfectly fore-knew all the preſent <hi>Unworthineſs,</hi> and future <hi>Swervings</hi> of his People from his Statutes: For to him the <hi>Depth</hi> of the Night is as the <hi>Dawn</hi> of the Morning; to him <hi>the End is known, from the Beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to what did this great, this glorious Lord give himſelf? Why, to <hi>Shame,</hi> to <hi>Miſery,</hi> to <hi>Death!</hi> and that of the moſt ignominious, and formidable Kind! <hi>He humbled himſelf to Death, even to the Death of the Croſs!</hi> O! the ſevere Chaſtiſement <hi>of our Peace, was laid upon him,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006243_0019_10281DA59B434F20"/>
that thro' his Stripes we might be healed!</hi> Such was the unutterable Grace and Goodneſs of the deareſt, deareſt Lord Jeſus, that <hi>tho' he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and incomprehenſibly rich,</hi> in the Poſſeſſion of all his Father's Excellencies, yet he became voluntarily, and, to Appearance, <hi>poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be rich!</hi> The Brightneſs and unapproachable Blaze of his divine Glory, was veil'd with the humble Mantle of Humanity! <hi>He who counted it not Robbery to be equal to God, aſſumed the Form of a Servant,</hi> that we might be made the Sons of the higheſt! <hi>He</hi> who is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing Spring of Sweetneſs and Conſolation, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief!</hi> that we might drink of the River of <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> that flows from the <hi>Throne</hi> of God and the Lamb! <hi>He,</hi> who is the Center of Reſt and Motion, became <hi>weary,</hi> that he might give to the Weary <hi>Reſt! He,</hi> who is All-fullneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>hungry,</hi> that he might feed the Hungry with the <hi>Bread</hi> of Life, the <hi>Apples</hi> of Salvation! <hi>He,</hi> who is Health itſelf, was <hi>wounded,</hi> that we might be <hi>healed</hi> with the Balm of <hi>Gilead!</hi> He who is the Reſurrection and the Life, died that we might <hi>live,</hi> and that forever. O Miracle of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! O inexpreſſible Prodigy of divine Love!</p>
            <p>BUT who were theſe for whom the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus endured ſuch intolerable Agonies? Were they Angels, or perfect Creatures? No, They were <hi>Sinners, Rebels, Enemies;</hi> ſuch as had tranſgreſſed his righteous Laws; ſuch as had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the Allegiance due to his equitable Government, and ſuch as were poſſeſſed of a deadly Enmity againſt his Perſon and Rule; ſuch
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006243_0020_10281DAA6A55DC30"/>
as were utterly unworthy of his Love, and neither ſought it, nor were able to requite it; ſuch who, even after Converſion, are in a Degree <hi>ungrateful, jealous, diſloyal,</hi> make not ſuitable Returns for Benefits received, ſuſpect his Kindneſs, and are diſpoſed to ſpiritual Whoredom!</p>
            <p>BUT how did the deareſt Lord Jeſus give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? I anſwer; Moſt freely. <hi>In the Volume of thy Book,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is written of me, lo I come to do thy Will, O God, and thy Law is within my Heart!</hi> All Manner of Miſeries he endured moſt patiently. <hi>He was led like a Lamb to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo he opened not his Mouth: Yea he was ſtreight'ned till his Sufferings for our Sakes were accompliſhed.</hi> O aſtoniſhing Love!</p>
            <p>AND tho' the Perſons whom the bleſſed Lord Jeſus ſet his Love upon, were ſuch as have been deſcribed, yet he loved them more than the beſt of Men love one another; <hi>Greater Love hath no Man, than that a Man lay down his Life for his Friend; but Chriſt hath laid down his Life for his Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YEA, the holy Jeſus loves Man more then he loves himſelf. The unregenerate Man loves not his Soul, the nobleſt Part of himſelf; nor does he love his Body in Reference to Eternity—And the Love of the regenerate Man is imperfect, but the Love of Chriſt was without Defect.</p>
            <p>I MAY add, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> That the dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer <hi>loves</hi> Men more than <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> for he left the one, and rejected the Offers of the other for his ſake.</p>
            <p>AND didn't the Lord Jeſus love Men more than the Angels? <hi>For he took not upon him their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006243_0021_10281DABEFD214A8"/>
nor is there any <hi>Offer</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> made thro' him, to thoſe that fell from their original State.</p>
            <p>YEA we may ſay that the adorable Redeemer lov'd his People, in ſome Reſpects, more than <hi>himſelf!</hi> He pray'd for them more than himſelf; and that when he was juſt entering upon the laſt Scene of his awful <hi>Sufferings!</hi> He expreſſed more <hi>Joy</hi> at their <hi>Welfare,</hi> than his own, as Man: With what Keenneſs and Pungency did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he adviſed him to <hi>ſpare</hi> himſelf? <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan!</hi> When the <hi>Diſciples</hi> inform'd him of the Succeſs of their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> tho' he was <hi>a Man of Sorrows,</hi> yet he <hi>rejoyced</hi> on that <hi>Occaſion!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ADD to this, that he willingly ſuffered the Sword of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to pierce his Heart, rather than Men ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi> eternally! He <hi>gave himſelf</hi> a Sacrifice to avenging <hi>Wrath!</hi> A Prey to <hi>Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> and to all Manner of <hi>Miſeries!</hi> This <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Chriſt was, as our Text aſſerts, <hi>Of a ſweet-ſmelling Savour to God!</hi> i. e. <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> and ſatisfactory for the Sins of Men.</p>
            <p>AND indeed the Love of Jeſus is ſuch, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd him, not only to <hi>give</hi> himſelf to ſuffer for us, all the <hi>Miſeries</hi> our Sins deſerved, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Kind,</hi> yet in <hi>Weight;</hi> but likewiſe to ſuffer by us, and with us. O! his Love incites him to bear many Affronts from us, tho' <hi>we make him to ſerve by our Sins, and he is as it were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under them, as a Cart under Sheaves:</hi> Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all our <hi>Backſlidings,</hi> which are, in ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, more heinous then the Sins of others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe committed againſt greater <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> He invites us to <hi>return,</hi> and graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006243_0022_10281DAD9910CF20"/>
upon our doing ſo, <hi>To heal our Backſlidings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and love us freely!</hi> And doesn't his Love diſpoſe him to <hi>ſimpathize</hi> with us, in all our Sorrows! <hi>In all our Afflictions he is afflicted! We have not a High Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, but was in all Things tempted as we are, yet without Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to the <hi>Improvement</hi> of this Subject.</p>
            <p>METHINKS what has been ſaid, ſhould excite us to enquire, whether Chriſt loves us with a ſpecial <hi>complacential</hi> Love? If ſo, we have been made to <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> our abſolute <hi>Need</hi> of his <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>ſhut up</hi> thereto, as the only <hi>Door of Hope:</hi> If ſo, <hi>Chriſt has manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us</hi> by his Goſpel, in Regard of his All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and Willingneſs to <hi>ſave</hi> poor Sinners! So that we have hereby been induced to venture our Souls upon the alone <hi>Foundation</hi> of his Merit, for our <hi>Acceptance</hi> with God; and have hereupon received ſuch Communications of his Love, as have inclin'd us to <hi>love</hi> him habitually, ſupremely, ingenuouſly; <hi>We love him</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>John) becauſe he has loved us firſt:</hi> And does our Love to Chriſt conſtrain us, to endeavour a univerſal, willing, and perſevering Obedience to his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts? Then are ye my Friends,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>if ye do whatever I command you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FARTHER, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> we ſhould enquire, <hi>whether we walk in Love,</hi> ſo as has been before hinted? If ſo, it is a bleſſed Evidence of our being <hi>Tranſlated from Death to Life:</hi> Such as upon Enquiry, find the aforeſaid <hi>Characters</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may ſafely conclude, that they are in a State of <hi>Favour</hi> with God; <hi>And if God is for
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006243_0023_10281DB3DAE53548"/>
them, who ſhall be againſt them?</hi> They have great Reaſon to <hi>rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> however difficult and diſtreſſing their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Circumſtances</hi> may be! For all that they meet with in Time, ſhall be turn'd to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the <hi>Iſſue; They ſhall work together for their Good: Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or Life, or Death, all is theirs, and they are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's!</hi> Remember, dear <hi>Brethren, That your Sufferings in this Life, which are but for a Moment, are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory, which ſhall be,</hi> in a little Time, <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you,</hi> and you made Poſſeſſors thereof.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuch as are deſtitute of the aforeſaid Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, have great Reaſon to <hi>mourn</hi> and <hi>lament!</hi> For their prent State is unſpeakably <hi>dangerous,</hi> and extreamly <hi>miſerable!</hi> Without Chriſt there is no true Safety, nor ſolid Comfort: He is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Hiding-place,</hi> that can effectually ſcreen us from the Storms of divine Wrath! The only <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> that can effectually ſweeten our <hi>Sorrows,</hi> ſatisfy our <hi>Deſires,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our <hi>Hopes!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YE ſhould therefore be entreated, <hi>Sirs,</hi> to ſeek an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the Love of Chriſt, and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of it; the former makes your State <hi>ſafe,</hi> the latter <hi>comfortable.</hi> The ſenſible Knowledge of Chriſt's Love to us, is a <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>Earth!</hi> This makes us bold in <hi>Danger,</hi> and patient in <hi>Adverſity;</hi> this aſſwages every <hi>Grief,</hi> and is as Oyl to the Wheels of <hi>Devotion;</hi> this gives a freſh Spring to our animal <hi>Spirits,</hi> a new Reliſh to our outward <hi>Comforts,</hi> and is the very <hi>Life</hi> of Life!
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006243_0024_10281DB714CABD18"/>
This makes the Mind calm and ſerene, when the <hi>Surges</hi> of <hi>Difficulty</hi> ſwell, and the <hi>Tempeſt</hi> roars; it is enough if Chriſt be ours; of whom then, or of what ſhould we be afraid?</p>
            <p>NOW to obtain an Intereſt in your <hi>Redeemer</hi>'s Love,</p>
            <p>LABOUR to know your <hi>Need</hi> of him, as well as his <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Readineſs</hi> to relieve all that take their Flight to him.</p>
            <p>BELIEVE on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THINK much on the <hi>Riches</hi> of his Love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the precious <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TRY to be like him in Heart and in Life; ſuch as <hi>ſay they have Fellowſhip with him and walk in Darkneſs, do lie, and know not the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſuch who have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in Chriſt's Love, but want the <hi>Evidence</hi> of it,</p>
            <p>LET them endeavour to <hi>know, and do the</hi> Will <hi>of God: He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt myſelf to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CONVERSE much with Chriſt, by ſerious and delightful <hi>Study.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEWARE of Unbelief, and unkind Returns for Mercies received; <hi>When he ſpeaks Peace, do not return to Folly.</hi>—</p>
            <p>CRY for <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to a gracious God, for Chriſt's ſake, with <hi>Hopes</hi> of obtaining it.—</p>
            <p>WALK IN LOVE, <hi>as Chriſt alſo has loved us;</hi> live in Love, let this be your <hi>Element!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LOVE as Chriſt did, let your Thoughts be kind; <hi>For Charity thinks no Evil, but hopes all Things, and believes all Things that are good of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006243_0025_10281DB8988A1EA8"/>
as far as there is any Reaſon for it. Let your Speeches be courteous, <hi>Put on, as the Elect of God, Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, and Humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind; be pitiful, be courteous, and O let your Actions be beneficent: Say not to the Hungry, be fed, and to the Naked, be clothed, when it is in the Power of your Hand to give:</hi> If ſo, <hi>How dwells the Love of God in you?</hi> The Love of Chriſt is a long-ſuffering, ſympathizing, forgiving, and enduring Love; and ſo ſhou'd ours be: In caſe of <hi>Offences,</hi> and different <hi>Sentiments</hi> in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> bear, forbear, forgive; <hi>In Meekneſs and Long-ſuffering,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>forbearing and forgiving one another, even as God has, for Chriſt's ſake, forgiven you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, Sirs, ye ſhou'd <hi>walk</hi> in Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your <hi>Brethren,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chriſt has loved you:</hi> He has forgiven much to you, and will not you forgive a little to your poor <hi>Brother?</hi> He has graciouſly cancell'd your <hi>Debt</hi> of a Thouſand <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> and will you take your <hi>Brother</hi> by the <hi>Throat</hi> for a few <hi>Pence?</hi> Chriſt bears with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Weakneſſes in you, and won't you bear with a few in your <hi>Brother?</hi> No more powerful <hi>Argument</hi> can be offered to the Sons of Men, to invite their Love, than the Love of Chriſt. Dear <hi>Sirs!</hi> by walking in Love to your <hi>Brethren,</hi> you fulfil the ſecond <hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to your ſelves, as well as others, your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious State: This is truly amiable, the right Way to promote the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and the <hi>Good</hi> of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. O! <hi>How amiable is it for Brethren to dwell together in Unity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IS it not, dear <hi>Sirs!</hi> one great <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Ordinance</hi> in view, to promote <hi>Brotherly Love?</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:006243_0026_10281DBA1B0EF8B0"/>
by ſetting before us, ſenſible <hi>Repreſentations</hi> of the dying Love of Chriſt? And hence 'tis call'd a Love-Feaſt.</p>
            <p>THIS leads me to ſay, That another excellent <hi>Mean</hi> of obtaining <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> is, to attend with <hi>Humility, Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> upon the bleſſed <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> by which <hi>we ſhew forth his Death till he come again.</hi> This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd not only as a <hi>Sign</hi> to repreſent the <hi>Strength</hi> of the Redeemer's <hi>Affection,</hi> but as a <hi>Seal</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our Intereſt in it. O then! <hi>while the King comes to his Table, let our Spikenard ſend forth the Smell thereof: Who is this that comes from Bozra, with Garments died red, travelling in the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Strength?</hi> O how amiable is our Lord in his bloody <hi>Robes! Quot vulnera tot ora;</hi> As many Wounds as he received for us, ſo many Mouths are open to plead for our Love to him.</p>
            <p>SUFFER me here, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> to enlarge a little upon this ſolemn <hi>ſacramental Occaſion!</hi> Let us, dear <hi>Sirs!</hi> take a tranſient Survey of our Lord's ABASURE and SUFFERINGS, by which he expreſs'd the Strength of his <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is ſtrange indeed! that the great GOD ſhou'd ſtoop ſo low, as to <hi>make himſelf of no Reputation</hi> for our ſakes, and <hi>appear in the Faſhion of a Man!</hi> Strange!
