            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THis following</hi> Exhortation <hi>was written two or three months agoe, since which time the Lord hath given us to see a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Turn of Providence, <hi>in a way of signal mercy towards his poor</hi> New-England-People. <hi>Nevertheless I have for weighty Reasons, been willing to let it pass, as it is, the main design of it being to quicken sedulous endeavours towards the</hi> Reformation <hi>of provoking Evills; and there is still cause for urgency in that matter. God forbid that we should act as if we were delivered to do abominations, for then it is certain that the continuance of this affliction would have been afar greater mercy, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of it. And I will freely confess, that I am not altogether without fears, that there is yet another Storm hastening upon this Land, if Repentance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it not. For as yet men are not convinced of that which I believe is the Lords</hi> special Controversie <hi>with this Land. Though some doe, yet</hi> the generality of the people <hi>do not see and own these iniquityes, which the righteous God hath been contending for. Nor is there to this day so much done respecting a</hi> General Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>of evills amongst us, as the Lord expects. Nay, there have been such tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes committed, in the time of our distress, as I am perswaded God will yet visit for. It hath often been so, that if much sin hath been committed, eminent delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances have been attended with sad after-claps. When the children of Israel were saved from the</hi> Midianites, <hi>the Inhabitants of</hi> Succoth <hi>and</hi> Penuel <hi>did perish after that. And in</hi> J<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>phthahs <hi>dayes, he had no sooner subdued the common enemy, but intestine troubles arose, so that</hi> there fell of the Ephraimites at that time forty and two thousand. <hi>Let us not then be high-minded but fear: especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that of late time, the Lord in his providence hath been giving us very</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn warnings, <hi>The deaths of so many righteous and useful ones, both of the</hi> first generation, <hi>and also a great number of precious ones of the</hi> second generation, <hi>as have bin</hi> taken away this year <hi>by Gods own hand, seems to be portentous of more</hi> evil to come. <hi>And the sudden awfull deaths of some, whom the Lord hath overthrown, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, look like ominous warnings. And that</hi> Epidemical Disease <hi>that prevailed this Spring, is a very solemn voice from Heaven unto us. We have heard also how terrible the Lord hath been in his doings towards our Country men and Brethren in other parts of the World. Not to speak of the present state of bleeding</hi> Virginia, <hi>what an awfull providence was that which hapned in</hi> Barbados <hi>in</hi> August <hi>last, when a Plantation there, was</hi> visited with thunder, and with great noise, and with a storm and tempest, and flame of devouring fire, <hi>so that in a few hours a considerable town
<pb facs="unknown:000221_0003_0FA36B46F5866868"/>
was brought into ruinous heaps, The Lord give unto that</hi> Island <hi>Grace, duly to consider of it, and to sin no more</hi> lest a worse thing come unto them. <hi>And how awfull was the hand of God in</hi> September <hi>last, when a fire brake forth in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous town in the heart of</hi> England (North-Hampton <hi>by name</hi>) <hi>and in about the space of eight hours, consumed the whole Town, that very few houses were left standing, and the Inhabitants many of them, saved nothing but the cloathes on their backs. Now if we that hear of these things,</hi> fear God and receive instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, our dwellings shall not be cut off, <hi>but if we be secure and unaffected with the divine Dispensations, how can we think that the worst is past? The Lord can easily punish us by the same Instruments again, if we go on to provoke him. Yea if the power and good providence of God prevent it not, it will be so. Many of these Heathen that have of late submitted themselves, are treacherous and blouay. And the</hi> Indians <hi>that have been helpfull in this</hi> War, <hi>will be apt to grow insolent upon conceiting, that we could not have subdued our enemyes if it had not been for them; and it will be a great mercy if rude ungoverned</hi> English <hi>do not ere long scandalize and exasperate them. Or if none of these things should be, God hath a thousand wayes to punish us, which we cannot think of. Why then should carnal security grow upon us? When some said unto the holy Prophet,</hi> Watchman what of the night? Watchman what of the night? <hi>He replyed,</hi> The morning cometh and also night. <hi>Even so, albeit at present, a comfortable</hi> Morning <hi>is dawned upon us, it concerns us to improve it well, otherwise we shall have cause to think on the other words</hi> also the night. <hi>Only it must be remembred that things of this nature, (all promises and threatnings respecting temporal mercies or Judgments are so) are to be understood</hi> conditionally, <hi>according to that which the Lord expresseth, Jer.</hi> 18 7, 8, 9, 10. At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up, to pull down, and to destroy it, if that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evill, I will repent of the evill that I thought to doe unto them. And at what instant I shall speak concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a nation and concerning a Kingdom to build and to plant it: if it do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them. <hi>We had need then to pray earnesly, that past and present dispensations may be sanctified to us. If we be indeed bettered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, we are like to see happy dayes again in</hi> New-England, <hi>but if otherwise,</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England hath not yet seen its worst dayes. <hi>Now the Lord Jesus help us to consider it. O that there were such an heart in us, that we would fear him &amp; keep all his Commandments, alwayes, that it may be well with us and with our children for ever, Which is the prayer of him who accounts himself happy, if he may do any faithfull Service, for God and for his People.</hi>

               </gap>! That so many Candlesticks should be removed out of their places! How are we spoiled? we are greatly confounded because our dwelling places have cast us out. Alas that <hi>New-England</hi> should be brought so low in so short a time (for she is come down wonderfully) and that by such vile enemyes, by the Heathen, <hi>yea the worst of the Heathen:</hi> that should be an affecting humbling Consideration to us, that our heavenly Father should be provoked to set <hi>vile Indians</hi> upon the backs of his Children to scourge them so severely, because of the provoking of his sons and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Lord hath moved us to anger with a foolish Nation, and moved us to jealousie with those which are not a people. As the Lord begins to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, we are apt to forget the fears and sorrows which have been upon us, but that is the ready way to greater Calamity.</p>
            <p>Verily if we lay not these things to heart, there is cause to fear that those other Judgments (which nothing but wonderfull mercy hath saved us from) even <hi>Famine and Pestilence</hi> are not far off. We have seen the Lord come ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding amongst us upon his <hi>Red horse,</hi> if this awaken us not, how can we expect

other, but that ere long we shall behold a <hi>Black Horse,</hi> yea and a <hi>Pale Horse,</hi> and his name that shall sit thereon is <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let due enquiry be made into the cause of the Lords controversie with us,</hi> We know in general, it is for sin, Mich. 1. 5. <hi>For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.</hi> God is never wont to forsake his People except they do first forsake him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2, <hi>The Lord is with you whilst you be with him, but if you forsake him he will forsake you.</hi> Inasmuch then as God hath seemed to cast us off, and put us to shame, and hath refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to go forth with our <hi>Armies,</hi> he doth by his Providence testifie against us to our faces, that we have forsaken him. He would not have given us to the Spoil, and to the Robbers, if we had not sinned against him. But some one will say, <hi>how shall we know What sin it is that the Lord now contends with us for? Answer.</hi> Although that be a most needful Question to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, yet I shall not say <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to it, besides what I have at sundry times expressed, when speaking in the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Take we heed how we embrace such notions as will lead us into mistakes about the causes of our misery,</hi> e. g. that imagination which some have, that all this is come upon us, only for tryal, and not for Correction on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of sins, without doubt it is for both. Why should we suppose that God is not offended with us, when his displeasure is written, in such visible and bloody Characters? and truly before the present Judgement came upon us, it was evident that the glorious Lord was provoked against us: those general and <hi>continued Blastings,</hi> which were upon the fruits of the Earth, spake no less, when the like hand of God was upon the Land of Israel, though but for three years, <hi>David</hi> enquired of the Lord about the cause of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> displeasure. Interpreters observe, that the first and second year <hi>David</hi> made no inquiry, because he might possibly think it was nothing, but what according to the ordinary Course of Nature might well be expected, but when he saw that drought was upon the land for three years together, he concluded that it was for some sin that had provoked the Most High. So with us, God by a continued <hi>Series</hi> of Providence for more then three times three years, one after another, hath been blasting the fruits of the earth in a great measure; therefore we may know that God is angry for something.</p>
            <p>Again, that notion, that God is provoked for one sin only, or for some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret unknown sin only, tends <hi>to</hi> lead into mistakes concerning the true cause of our miseries. Not but that there may be <hi>Secret sins which the Lord doth set in the light of his countenance,</hi> and which we ought diligently to search af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but when there are so many evils visible and manifest, it is the subtilty of Satan to perswade men that this judgement cometh for some one secret sin, that so he may keep them from taking notice of that which is indeed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000221_0007_0FA36B4AAACFFDD0"/>
the Lords controversie, and from repenting of those evils, which if they be truly repented of, the Judgements which have been upon us will certainly be removed: Also that principle, that whoever suffers in this common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is the cause of it, will surely lead into misapprehensions concerning it.</p>
            <p>In the Primitive times, when Plagues and Wars arose, because the Heathen Nations in those times persecuted the Church, some Christians perished (as to their Estates, Bodies, Lives) in the common calamity, albeit it was not for the sake of their sins, but for the sake of unworthy dealings towards them, that those desolating <hi>Plagues</hi> came upon the World: look as wicked men do sometimes escape temporal Judgements, for the sake of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous amongst whom they dwell, so do the Righteous many times suffer great outward Calamity, because of the Wickedness of those they live among: once more, they that suppose this Judgement cometh on account of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any principle alwayes avowed by the <hi>chief of the Fathers</hi> in these Churches, will (I doubt not) mistake in their conclusions. Those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which concern the <hi>Purity of Churches,</hi> the <hi>Authority of Elders,</hi> the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Brethren,</hi> a due extent of the Grace <hi>of the Covenant zeal for God in matters of the first as well as of the second Table,</hi> were alwayes asserted and pleaded for by the <hi>chief of the Fathers of New-England,</hi> when God did wonderfully own this People, and suffered no Weapon that was formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them to prosper: but all that did attempt to devour them offended, and evil came upon them, wherefore it will be in vain to Impute our Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, unto any of the Principles (or practices according thereunto) which have been mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> The wayes of God are everlasting; wherefore <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> brings the same Judgements upon his People now as in the dayes of old, in case there be the same transgressions: If then we would know why Droughts, Blastings, &amp;c. have been upon our Land, let us search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and see for what sins those Judgements have befallen Gods Israel of old. Was it not because the good Creatures of God were abused, to nourish pride and sensuality? and because Temple work was neglected, and because men were guilty of robbing God? are the same sins found amongst us? then we may safely conclude, that those Judgements have come in special for those sins: and let us look into the Scripture, and there see what sins have in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages brought the punishment of the <hi>Sword</hi> upon a professing People: and if those very sins are prevailing amongst us, write upon it, then it is for them, that this Judgment is come upon us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hearken to the voice of God in the Ministry of his word,</hi> mind what the Messengers of God speak in his name, <hi>for surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secrets to his Servants the Prophets,</hi> Amos. 3. 7. If I were to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000221_0008_0FA36B4B09A0B4D8"/>
give Counsel to <hi>N. E.</hi> for my life, it should be the same that <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> gave to the people of God in his time, when circumstanced in respect of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of heathen Enemies, against them, as we are this day: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 20. <hi>Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established, believe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets so shall you prosper.</hi> What though in these dayes Ministers are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible? yet they are in respect of Office <hi>Watchmen</hi> and <hi>Seers,</hi> and therefore you may expect that God will communicate Light to you by them, yea they told you of these dayes before they came. Do not say that the Ministers of God cannot tell you why this Judgment is come, how then could they give you faithfull warning thereof long enough before it came? I pray you consider this one thing, What were the sins which the Messengers of God declared would certainly bring <hi>A day of Trouble</hi> upon this Land? And hath the Lord confirmed the word of his Servants? then you may without danger conclude, it is for those sins that the Lord is now contending: And truly if we refuse to hearken to the voice of God not only in the <hi>former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> but also by those who are still speaking in his name, why should we marvel that the Lord doth not incline his ear to our voice when we pray and humble our Souls before him? God cryeth to us by his Messengers, and we will, not hear; therefore it is that though we cry to God he will not hear. <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 12. with <hi>Zacha.</hi> 7. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Consider how this Judgment is circumstanced,</hi> If we mind where it began and by what Instruments, we may well think that God is greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the <hi>Heathenisme</hi> of the English People. How many that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

How many Families that live like <hi>profane Indians</hi> without any <hi>Family prayer?</hi> Yea there have been whole Plantations that have lived from year to year, without any publick Invocation of the Name of God, and without his Word. And in most places Instituted Worship (whereby <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> are distinguished from <hi>Heathen</hi>) hath been too much neglected. Now there is no place under heaven where the neglect of <hi>Divine Institutions</hi> will so highly provoke and incense the displeasure of God as in <hi>New-England,</hi> because (as after shall be said) <hi>Religion is our Interest</hi> and that which our Fathers came into this Land for.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let there be a sincere Reformation of those evills which have provoked the eyes of Gods Glory.</hi> Deliverance will never come in mercy, except we turn to him that smiteth us. It is true that this Judgment may possibly be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though there be not Repentance, but then another Judgment will come ere long that will be seven times greater then this. Wofull experience may convince us of the truth of this, for the Providence of God is very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in that the Blasting that hath been without Intermission for these many
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000221_0009_0FA36B4B8A08C190"/>
years, hath not been this last year as formerly, but behold another judgment seven times greater is come in the roome of it. Yea moreover, either <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> must be, or else (as long as the 26<hi>th.</hi> chapter of <hi>Leviticus</hi> is Scripture) at the last <hi>Desolation</hi> shall be, <hi>I will make you desolate because of your Sins,</hi> Micah 6. 13.</p>
            <p>I remember it is storied concerning <hi>Tamerlain</hi> the great, that when he laid Seige against his enemyes, the first day he would set out a <hi>white Flag,</hi> to signifie mercy in case they did submit, and the next day <hi>a red Flag,</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate they must now look for the Sword, and the third day <hi>a black Flag,</hi> to signify utter destruction and desolation. Truly the Lord hath been display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the white Flagg, for many years before us, but it hath been dispised, and now he cometh with his red Flag, if this doe us not good, we have cause to fear that the <hi>Black Flag will come ere long.</hi> How easily can the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story us? there is not the most contemptible Creature, but he can arm it so as there shall be no standing before it. I have read of a great City that was destroyed by Ants; and of another that was destroyed by Rats, and of whole Countreys that have been depopulated by Frogs, yea by Fleas.

                  </gap>.</hi> But though I thus speak, I believe that God will reform his people by this Judgment, by this shall the Iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this shall be all the fruit to take away his sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu But what shall be done that so there may be such a Reformation as God will accept of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>These Evills which have been confessed before the Lord, and which are manifest let them be reformed.</hi> In that <hi>Order</hi> before mentioned respecting a day of publick Humiliation appointed by <hi>Authority</hi> there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evills instanced in as matter of Confession and Humiliation before the Lord, let those sins be repented of, and turned from. We shall here take notice of some of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Manyfold abuses of Peace and the Blessings of God in this good land.</hi> Alas when we have had peace from enemies, we would not be at peace among our selves. And as the Calamity which is come upon us is General, so <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a sin which all sorts of men have been too guilty of: and now we see the bitter fruit of it, whilst the Sheep (yea the Shepherds too some of them) have been contending one with another, God hath let loose Wolves upon us all. And how have the Blessings of God been abused to serve <hi>Baal?</hi> The Plenty, which our Peace hath been attended with, hath been abused unto great Sensuality, and many Professors and Church-Members have been shamefully guilty in that respect. How common hath it been with them <hi>to haunt Taverns,</hi> and squander away precious hours, nay dayes in publick
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000221_0010_0FA36B4C4E045160"/>
houses, which if but half that time had been spent in Meditation, Secret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Self Examination, it had been happy for them, and it may be for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their sakes. When as our Fathers were <hi>Patterns of Sobriety,</hi> they would not drink a cup of wine nor strong drink, more then should suffice nature, and conduce to their health, mea of latter time could transact no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, nor hardly ingage in any discourses, but it must be over a pint of wine or a pot of beer, yea so as that Drunkenness in the sight of man is become a common Sin, but how much more that which is Drunkenness in the sight of God. And how have the Blessings of God been abused to nourish <hi>pride?</hi> There hath been no small Provocation before the Lord in that thing, yea as to <hi>Pride in respect of Apparel.</hi> People in this Land have not carryed it, as it becometh those that are in a Wilderness, especially when it is such an humbling time as of late years hath been. And none more guilty then the poorer fort of people, who will needs go in their Silks and Bravery as if they were the best in the Land. Though it be also too true that the rich and honourable have many of them greatly offended by strange Apparel, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally here in <hi>Boston.</hi> A proud Fashion no sooner comes into the Country, but <hi>the haughty Daughters of Zion</hi> in this place are taking it up, and thereby the whole land is at last infected. What shall we say when men are seen in the Streets with monstrous and horrid <hi>Perriwigs,</hi> and Women with their <hi>Borders and False Locks</hi> and such like whorish Fashions, whereby the anger of the Lord is kindled against this sinfull Land! And now behold how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully is God fulfilling the third chapter of Isaiah. <hi>Moreover the Lord saith,</hi> (if the Lord say it who dare slight what is said) <hi>because the Daughters of Zion are haughty, therefore he will discover their Nakedness.</hi> Hath not the Lord fulfilled this threatning, when the <hi>Indians</hi> have taken so many and stripped them naked as in the day that they were born. <hi>And instead of a sweet smell there shall be a Stink,</hi> Is not this verified when poor Creatures are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Captive into the Indians filt by and stinking <hi>Wigwams,</hi> yea when so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny English are faign to croud together, till it becomes loathsome and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury? <hi>And burning instead of Beauty,</hi> is it not so when poor creatures are exposed to the burning heat of the sun, and burnt and turned thereby till they become of an hue like unto these Indians! <hi>Thy men shall fall by the Sword, &amp; thy Mighty by the War.</hi> Hath not that word been fulfilled upon us when so many have fallen by the Sword, yea so many Captains in this War, and this is because of the pride of the Daughters of Zion. Oh then let that sin be reformed and repented of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another sin mentioned by the Council in that Order for a day of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Humiliation, before hinted at, is, <hi>Ill entertainment of the Ministry of the Gospel of Peace.</hi> It cannot be denied but that the Ministers of God in this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000221_0011_0FA36B4D05AB0CC0"/>
have for the generality of them, had miserable encouragement from men in the work of Christ. Through the undeserved mercy of God, and love of a dear People amongst whom I live, I am not at present under such personal temptation to speak in this matter as many better then my self are, but therefore I may the more freely speak in the behalf of my Brethren whose sorrows I greatly condole. How many of the Servants of Christ have there been, that though they have preached the Gospel, have not (as the Scripture saith it should be) lived on the Gospel? but when their whole time and studyes should have been taken up in attending Services for Christ and for his people, they have been constrained (as the Levites in Nehemiah) <hi>even to flee every one into his Field, and the house of God hath been forsaken.</hi> I doubt it will one day appear, that the coals which have been stolen from Gods Altar, have burnt down many of those Plantations which are now desolate. Worthy Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> in a Letter which he wrote to me bearing Date. 12<hi>th.</hi> of 4 <hi>mo.</hi> 1666. thus expresseth himself, <hi>I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>long been of that mind that N.E. is guilty of great unthankfulness for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, &amp; strait-heartedness, &amp; close handedness toward the Ministers. Your blessed Father in law Mr.</hi> Cotton, <hi>was sensible of it, as I can shew in his letters to me in answer of mine to him, his conclusion after some other expressions was, that the Ministry of the Gospel is the cheapest Commodity in this Land: when I consider these things I see cause of Admiration that the Gospel is yet continued in N, E. &amp; that our Candlesticks are not removed: but it is from Gods pitty to some sucking Children that the Breasts are not yet dryed up.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Davenport.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And verily I cannot believe, that God would have taken away so many of his Ministers out of <hi>New-England</hi> in so short a time, if the People had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards God and them, as-ought to have been. <hi>Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the Land darkned.</hi> He that holds the Stars in his right hand hath removed many of them, and great darkness hath followed. In about thirteen years space there have been (to my observation) no less then five and thirty Stars that have set in this Horizon, I mean five and thirty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (and some of them Stars of the first magnitude) that have in so short a time dyed in <hi>New-England:</hi> why did we not behold the <hi>War</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we saw the Lord calling home the Ambassadours of peace! I am not without fears lest that most awful passage which blessed Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> hath (in his <hi>Sound Believer</hi> P. 250.) be prophetical, <hi>Verily I am afraid</hi> (saith he) <hi>such a dismal Night is towards, such sore afflictions of Famine, Wars, Blood, Mortality, Death of Gods precious Servants especially, that the Lord will fill the hearts of all Churches, Families, Christians that shall live in those dayes, with such rendings, tearings, shakings, anguish of Spirit as scarce any were, in the worst dayes of our Fore-fathers, and that this shall continue, until the remnant
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000221_0012_0FA36B4F0E0EA5E8"/>
that escape, shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Blessed be the face and feet of that Minister that shall come unto us in Christs Name.</hi> O then let this sin of ill entertainment of the Ministry be repented of and reformed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another sin which hath been confessed is, that of <hi>Formality in Religion.</hi> These are perillous times which we now live in, when men are getting their Bread with the peril of their lives, because of the Sword of the Wilderness, when they can scarce look out of doors, but they are in danger of being seized upon by ravening Wolves, who lye in wait to shed blood, when men go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way side, but the Sword of the Enemy, and fear is on every side: surely the times are perillous; and that which brings such times is, the <hi>taking up a form of godliness without the power of it:</hi> and is it not so with us, the <hi>first Generation</hi> which was in this Land, had much of the power of Godliness, but the present <hi>Generation</hi> hath the form, and as to the <hi>body of the Generation,</hi> but little of the power of <hi>Religion.</hi> Alas in our Churches, we have a form of Discipline, but little of the power of it, and how it is in Families, and in Closets God knows, yea and as to our publick and most solemn approaches before the Lord, how slight and formal are the most of men? little or no preparation for them, no brokenness of heart in them, in which respect we have no cause to wonder that sad tydings hath come to us so often on dayes of Fasting and Prayes. Historians observe that <hi>Pompey</hi> seized upon the Temple, when it was the Jews solemn Fasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: and after that <hi>Sosius</hi> took <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon a day of solemn Humiliation, the Jews were then exceedingly degenerated, having the form of these duties, but little of the power of them: hath it not been so with us in a sad degree <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us then no more content our selves, with having a name to live, and yet be Dead.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another Evil, which we have confessed before the Lord is, that of <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Affection to the World.</hi> Idolatry brings the Sword, and Covetousness is Idolatry. <hi>Land! Land!</hi> hath been the Idol of many in <hi>New-England:</hi> whereas the first Planters here that they might keep themselves together were satisfied with one Acre for each person, as his propriety, and after that with twenty Acres for a Family, how have Men since coveted after the earth, that many hundreds, nay thousands of Acres, have been engrossed by one man, and they that profess themselves Christians, have forsaken Churches, and Ordinances, and all for land and elbow-room enough in the World. <hi>Lot</hi> would forsake the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Church, which was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, that he might have better worldly accommodations in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and we see what came of it, God fired him out of all; his house and goods were burnt, and he forced to leave his goodly Pastures, which his heart (though
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000221_0013_0FA36B4FCA123B58"/>
otherwise a good man) was too much set upon. Is the interest of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> indeed changed from a Religious to a Worldly interest? that's a <hi>strange God,</hi> and if it be so, no wonder that there is <hi>War in our Gates:</hi> do men prefer their Farms and Merchandize above the Gospel? here is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Armies are sent forth against us, and our Cities are burnt up. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate love to <hi>this present evil World,</hi> hath been the Fountain of all that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, that we are bleeding under at this day; Those unhappy <hi>Indian-trading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,</hi> whereby the Heathen have been so wofully scandalized, hath not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness built them, and continued them for so long a time? and was it not from the same root of all evil, that the Indians have been furnished with Arms, and Amunition? would ever men have sold Guns, and Powder, and Shot, to such faithless and bloody creatures, if a lust of Covetousness had not too far prevailed with them? now then since these evils which have been mentioned (not to insist upon other particulars) have bin confessed, let us be sure to reform them, otherwise in our Confessions we have but dallied with the Almighty, who will never suffer himself to be mocked by any of the Sons of men.</p>
            <p>And besides these Iniquities which have been acknowledged, as hath been expressed, there are other evils <hi>manifest,</hi> in respect whereof <hi>Reformation</hi> is necessary, as ever we desire to see good times and happy dayes in this Land. For alas it may be said, that <hi>because of Swearing the Land mourneth;</hi> not only in that Swearing is become a common sin, which even Children in the streets are guilty of, but in other respects which few take notice of. It is well if the <hi>Freemans Oath</hi> be not violated by too many, who are acted <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by faction, then by Conscience. Solemn Oaths upon trivial differences are too frequent. The body of the present Generation is guilty of <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental perjury</hi> in the sight of God, by breaking their <hi>Baptismal vow,</hi> and not observing all things whatsoever the Lord Jesus hath commanded them. Also wrath is come upon <hi>New-England,</hi> because the <hi>Sabbath</hi> hath been profaned. Persons under pretence of difference in Judgement about the beginning of the Sabbath (some being for the evening and others for the morning) keep <hi>no night</hi> at all <hi>holy</hi> unto the Lord. And it is to be feared that even since this War began servile works have been attended upon the Lords day, more then any necessity hath called for. And if we look into Families, Churches, or Common-wealth, we shall see such rebellious breaches of the <hi>fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as may cause horror when we think of it. That Spirit of <hi>Koraisme</hi> which blessed Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> when dying did so sadly bewaile, and testifie against, how hath it prevailed? and men will not be convinced of this evil, except God open their eyes by strange Plagues, which are yet behind, and it may be not far off.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:000221_0014_0FA36B50099BDAA8"/>The breach of <hi>the fifth Commandment</hi> is one of the great and <hi>National sins,</hi> which the Indians are guilty of: their Children have no regard nor reverence towards their Fathers. If we learn the way of the Heathen, and become like them, God will punish us by them. And it is to me a sad and solemn thought, that this miserable War, hath been raised and fomented by proud and vain young men. The old Indians were very unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a War with the English, but the young men would do it, whether their Fathers would or no, and did at last precipitate you also into it, to the ruine of both Fathers and Children. I pray the Lord, that ungoverned young-men in Families and Societies may not prove the ruine of <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> If Fathers, if <hi>Abners</hi> will say, let the young men now arise and play before us, it may be it will be bitterness in the latter end.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what shall be said concerning that sin of <hi>Oppression,</hi> which is a general sin, and yet no man is guilty of it: since <hi>Day-labourers</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks</hi> are so unreasonable in their demands, and <hi>Merchants</hi> (some of them) so excessive in the prizes which they set upon their Goods, it is enough to bring the <hi>Oppressing Sword.</hi> And what a shame is it that ever that odious sin of <hi>Usury</hi> should be pleaded for, or practised in <hi>New-England,</hi> especially by such as should give a better example? Now for the Lords sake let such evils as these are be reformed, and no more heard of amongst us.</p>
            <p>And there is another evil, which although it hath not been confessed so much as should have been, yet it is a <hi>manifest</hi> provocation, and although I touch'd upon it before, yet I can hardly for bear inlarging upon that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I mean those <hi>woful Contentions</hi> which have made such a noise as is enough to provoke the Lord to turn us out of his house. This is a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which doth escape altogether unpunished as to men, but therefore God will punish it, and the rather because his own Children and Servants have been found faulty in respect of a divided heart. No doubt but the <hi>Wars and Fightings</hi> which we have had one with another, have brought the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War upon us, from the Lord. O that God would help those whose hands have been chief in this trespass, sadly to consider of it, lest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other evil greater then this overtake us in our security ere long. If we will be pecking at one another, it may be the God of Heaven will send a great Kite, ready to devour us all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to Reformation: <hi>Let there be a due execution of wholsome Laws which are founded upon the Word of God.</hi> If there be any Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us which cannot be warranted from the Word, change them and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish other in their room (I speak of Laws which respect the punishment of transgressors) but if the Scripture will justifie this or that testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Transgressors; either of first or second Table, let that and only that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000221_0015_0FA36B50CBF6BA98"/>
be done which shall please God: I have read, that it is a Rule in <hi>Politicks, that a bad Executioner of Laws is worse then a violator of them.</hi> Our defect is not so much in respect of the want of good Laws, as in the non-execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Laws that are good. It were better never to make Laws for the suppressing of Evils that are provoking in the sight of God, then not to see them faithfully executed when they are made.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Solemn Renewal of Covenant with God in Jesus Christ, is a great Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expedient in order to Reformation:</hi> we finde that the second Generation, of them who came out of Egypt whilst yet in the Wilderness having also a difficult undertaking before them, being to engage with their Heathen Enemies, and in other respects their state and case to be parallel with ours, they did most solemnly renew their Covenant with God. It seems to be of weighty consideration, that although the Lords People of old did frequeutly renew their Covenant with him, yet it was never done but a blessed effect followed thereupon, not so much as one Instance to be given in all the Book of God, when his People did <hi>explicitly</hi> renew the Covenant but a wonderful blessing did ensue. There is the nature of a Vow in this matter, Now Divines are wont to observe, that no instance can be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned out of the Scripture, when the Servants of God have vowed as well as prayed, but God hath heard them, we read that <hi>when the Canaanites fought against Israel, and took some of them Prisoners</hi> (just as it is with us) <hi>and Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael vowed a vow unto the Lord, and the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites,</hi> Numb. 21. 2, 2, 3. And in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time (to omit other Examples) he considering that there was wrath upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and those that fell by the Sword, and whose Sons, and Daughters, and Wives were in Captivity (all which things may be said of us) <hi>It was in his heart to make a Covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us,</hi> 2 Cron. 29. 8, 9, 10. If the Lord help these Churches to attend this thing with such seriousness and sincerity, as ought to be, without doubt we shall see good dayes in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that it may be done the more effectually, it is much to be desired that the <hi>Civil Authority</hi> would (though not impose yet) recommend this matter to the Churches, otherwise it will meet with insuperable obstructions in some places; also that not some only, but all the Churches engage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and that the special evils prevailing in this or that place, be particularly bewailed, and Reformation of them inserted, and (by the help of Christ) promised, in this <hi>renewed Covenant.</hi> Verily I do believe, the neglect of our duty in this matter hath retarded our deliverance for so long a time, why then should we not make haste, and not delay to keep the Lords Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000221_0016_0FA36B518583DD80"/>4. One thing more I shall add, which if it be hearkned unto, to be sure <hi>Reformation</hi> acceptable to the Lord will be, It is this, <hi>Let every man strive to amend one.</hi> And who amongst us but have cause to think of Reforming? There are none of us so good but we may be better, we may (and should) grow in Grace and make progress in the work of Mortification. And God by the Judgment which is upon us, doth evidently point at, and call upon all sorts of men to the work of <hi>Reformation.</hi> As for our faithfull Magistrates (whom we have great cause to bless the Lord for) it shall be far from me to go about to discover the Nakedness of Fathers, or to say that which may tend to weaken their Authority amongst the people, nevertheless I will be bold to say, that if the Lord help them by this affliction to be more forward in the work of Reformation, more zealous in looking after the execution of wholesome, good and righteous Laws, more carefull to sanctifie God before the people, that in open Courts they may not (since God was angry with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses upon that account) discover unseemly Passions, and more carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain their children that they may not (as Josias were, for which God at last punished them <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 8) either in their attire (or however) be evill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and thereby hinder the Reformation of others in that particular; we shall then have cause to magnify the faithfulness of that God, who hath brought such an affliction upon us and sanctifyed it to us.</p>
            <p>And as for us who are Ministers in the house of God (and some of us amongst the deepest Sufferers in the present Calamity) are there not with us even with us also sins against the Lord our God? Have all of us in every respect been ensamples to the Flock? Have we given our selves to Reading and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and have we been very much in prayer for our selves and for the dear people of God? Have we been wholly in these things, without concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves in affairs not proper for us to ingage in? when we have been unworthily reflected upon by these or those, have we not been more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at it, then hath become us to be in our own case, considering that we should shew our selves examples in Patience, and Long-Suffering? Have we abstained from all appearance of evill? Is there no one that hath brought reproach upon the Ministry? Have none of us affected worldly <hi>Gallantry</hi> more then becometh the Ministers of God to due, who should approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Patterns of Mortification</hi> to all the world about them? Have we ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our own houses aright? As for some of us, have not people seen our Relations, our Wives, our Children fl<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and gaudy and Fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whereby others have been scandalized: let us then be humbled and <hi>Reform,</hi> yea let us never leave Fasting and Praying, until the promise of the Father come upon us, and the Lord Jesus pour of his Spirit from on high upon us, in that measure as is needfull for men in that relation which we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000221_0017_0FA36CB74B2685D0"/>
stand in before the Lord &amp; before his people. And as it is noted of the great <hi>Athanasim,</hi> that by his Prayers and tears, and sweating labours in writing and Preaching, (like the bleeding of a chast vine) he cured much of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie of that tainted age wherein he lived, so let us endeavour to do the like. It may be, that God intends by the present fiery Dispensation, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the Sons of Levi, then shall the offerings of Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old, and as in former years. And let not people think to free themselves by charging their <hi>Leaders</hi> with miscarriages. Through the abundant Grace of Christ towards his Servants there is no such cause of complaint, as some have made, whether against Moses, or against Aaron. It was most truly and solemnly affirmed by our famous, and now blessed Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> in his last <hi>Election-Sermon</hi> speaking concerning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry in <hi>New-England, I may</hi> (said he) <hi>say thus much, and pardon my speech, a more yeelding Ministry to the people, I believe is not in the world.</hi> Yea they have many of them stood in the Gap, and have turned away the wrath of God from this people. This Judgment had come sooner if they had not improved their interest in heaven to divert it, and if their counsels and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Exhortations</hi> had been hearkned to, the present misery had never been. And therefore let all the People of the Land turn unto the Lord, and hear this Rod and him that hath appointed it, so will he <hi>soon subdue our enemies and turn his hand</hi> (a Turn of Gods hand will save us) <hi>against our Adversaryes, and the haters of the Lord shall submit themselves,</hi> then God will restore <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> to its former state, yea it shall be better with us then at our beginning.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us beware of adding new sins to the old score.</hi> When the host go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth against their enemies, keep thee from every evill thing. There were provocations enough before this Calamity came upon us, from which we are not cleansed untill this day: But alas! How have we lengthned out our sorrows by fresh bleeding guilt in the sight of God? A Judgment may come upon a people for one sin and be continued for another, it may begin on the account of former Iniquityes, and be continued because of later transgressions, It is possible that those evills which have provoked the Lord to whet his glittering Sword, and his hand to take hold on Judgment, may be seen and acknowledged, and yet he may goe on to smite us because of some evills which the eyes of his glory have been provoked by, since this <hi>War</hi> began.</p>
            <p>I will (by the help of Christ) speak faithfully as I shall answer it before him that hath set me a <hi>Watch-man,</hi> another day.

The Lord lay it not to the Charge of <hi>New-England.</hi> More over since this <hi>War</hi> begun, the <hi>Indians</hi> have been scandalized by the <hi>English:</hi> It is well if some English have not the guilt of Indian bloud upon their souls, yea if in their skirts he not found the bloud of the souls of poor innocents.

Judicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors conceive that the reason why the Lord did so plague his people <hi>Israel,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> had slain the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> was because though Saul did it, yet <hi>the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People</hi> approved of it and rejoyced in that bloudy fact when it was done.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Remember the Errand that our Fathers came into this Wilderness for, and pursue that Interest.</hi> In general, it was on the account of <hi>Religion,</hi> that our Fathers followed the Lord into this Wilderness, whilst it was a Land which was not sown. There are other out-goings of our <hi>Nation,</hi> besides these Colonies in <hi>New-England,</hi> but they were not built upon a Foundation or Interest <hi>purely Religious,</hi> as is to be affirmed of these <hi>Plantations.</hi> It was with respect to some worldly accommodation, that other Plantations were erected, but <hi>Religion and not the World</hi> was that which our Fathers came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for? why did the Children of Israel of old go into the wilderness? was it not that they might serve God? for the very same reason did our Fathers
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000221_0020_0FA36CB987BFFA70"/>
come into this Wilderness, even that so they might worship God according to his Will, and that all things which concern the house of God might be according to the pattern shewed in the Mount <hi>Pure Worship and Ordinances</hi> without the mixture of humane Inventions, was that which the first Fathers of this Colony designed in their coming hither. We are the Children of the good old <hi>Non-Conformists:</hi> and therefore are we under the deepest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, not only to reject <hi>Inventions Humane</hi> in the things of God, but to come up to the practice of <hi>Institutions Divine.</hi> As to our Ecclesiastical constitution, the <hi>Congregational way,</hi> as 'tis distinguished from the rigid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of <hi>Presbyterianisme,</hi> and <hi>Brownisme,</hi> is that which we profess. And as to our <hi>Civil Polity,</hi> our Profession hath been, that they that are Rulers should be men that Fear God, and that they that choose them should be such also, and that Laws in the Common-Wealth should be regulated by the Word of God, that so the Lord Jesus may reign there.</p>
            <p>It was worthily spoken by blessed Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> in a <hi>Lecture Sermon,</hi> that there is much of the Kingdome of Christ in our Civil Constitution: and it will be sad for those who that put their hands to alter it, Such dash themselves against that stone, that whoso falls upon it shall be broken to shivers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Man of God solemnly protested, saying, <hi>Wo to that man, be he old or young, Church-member or non-member, Freeman or non-freeman, that shall go about to destroy, or basely betray the liberties of this People; it were better for him, that a Mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and he thrown with it into the midst of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it was in a special manner with respect to posterity, that our Fathers came into this Land, that so their Children might not see evil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and be in danger of being corrupted thereby, as 'tis in other parts of the world, but that they might be left under the Goverment and Discipline of Christ in his Church, and be sure to have the great advantage of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Education. And therefore that woful neglect of the <hi>Rising Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which hath bin amongst us, is a sad sign that we have in great part for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten our <hi>Errand</hi> into this Wilderness: and then why should we marvail that God taketh no pleasure in our young men, but they are numbred for the Sword, the present judgement lighting chiefly upon the <hi>Rising Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yet more, our Fathers came hither to this end, that they might <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Gospel,</hi> and be instrumental to set up the Kingdome of the Lord Jesus amongst the <hi>Heathen.</hi> And although some of the Lords Servants here have been sent forth (not without gracious success) to labour in that work, yet it is great pity, and I doubt one of the great sins which the English have been guilty of, that no more hath been done in order to the conversion of the Heathen: how great then is their sin, who do wholly despise and decry

that work, and those beginnings of the Kingdome of the Lord Jesus, which is to be seen amongst them, our Fathers were of another Spirit. There is a Letter Printed which was written by my honoured Father (<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>There is so much of Gods work amongst them, as that I cannot but count it a great evil, yea a great injury to God and his goodness, for any to make light or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, to see and to hear Indians opening their months and lifting up their hands and their eyes in a solemn Prayer to the living God, calling on him by his Name Jehovah, in the mediation of Jesus Christ, to hear and see them, exhorting one another from the Word of God, confessing the Name of Jesus Christ, and their own sinfulness; this is more then usual, we saw them, and we heard them perform the duties mentioned, with such plenty of Tears trickling down the cheeks of some of them, as did argue to us that they spake with much good Affection and holy Fear of God; that it much affected our hearts.</hi>

the Macedonians:</hi> So did the Fathers of this Country conclude, that the Lord had called them to take an effectual course, that the Gospel might be Preached to the Indians, and therefore it is not to be wondred at, that the Lord hath afflicted us by the Indians <hi>since the body of the present Generation hath no more of an heart to endeavour their Conversion and Salvation.</hi> The Histories of our own Nation Declare, that whereas there were famous Christian Churches amongst the ancient <hi>Brittains,</hi> yet when in process of time, they scandalized the <hi>Heathen Saxons,</hi> who lived amongst them, <hi>and neglected to use means for their Conversion unto Christ.</hi> God was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with those Churches, so as to dissipate and drive them out of their Land by those very Heathen Nations, whose conversion they should have but did not endeavour, let us consider of it in the fear of God. And if we mind and seek the things of Christ as we ought to do, though our Enemies were more and greater then they are, and we fewer then we are, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we shall be victorious over them: As it was with the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> whilst they made Religion their business, and kept in with God, they prevailed wonderfully against those that waged War upon them.</p>
            <p>At one time eleven of them put to flight three hundred of their Enemies, &amp; at another time five hundred of them destroyed five &amp; twenty hundred of their Adversaries; and this is but according to what the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to his People as long as they are faithful unto that which is his and their interest.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Give not way to desperate unbelieving thoughts:</hi> say not there is no hope, the case is desperate. At first we too much despised the chastning of the Lord, let us not now faint when we are rebuked of him, we are apt to run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. Are there not some that once thought this Calamity would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-past in few dayes, who now are ready to say it will never be? well, do not think that God will utterly destroy <hi>New-England</hi> as yet. It was said of the Children of Israel of old, when they were in as degenerate a condition as we are in, yea and far worse, <hi>the Lord was gracious to them, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on them, and had respect unto them, and would not destroy them, neither cast them from his presence as yet,</hi> 2 King. 13. 23. what may come on this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Land at last I know not, nevertheless I am verily perswaded that utter destruction will not come <hi>as yet</hi> For Jesus Christ hath by a wonderful hand of providence dispossessed Sathan who reigned in these dark corners of the Earth, in ages that are past, and hath taken possession of this Land for himself. Now, shall we think that Christ will suffer the Devil to drive him out of his possession again presently? The Lord hath a great Interest in this Land which he will not easily part with: There are many Churches of Christ here. In this Colony of <hi>Mattachusets,</hi> that are (or at least were when this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000221_0023_0FA36CBBC9879728"/>
War began) seven and forty Churches, and in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony there are twelve or thirteen Churches: and in Connecticut Colony there are nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Churches, besides the three Churches in <hi>Long-Island:</hi> so that there are above fourscore, Churches in <hi>New-England.</hi> Surely the Lord will not bring utter ruine upon them all as yet: And there are some of the first Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration (alas that there are so few of them) as yet surviving, now we may hope that God will not utterly consume all things in their dayes.</p>
            <p>As a man that lived in <hi>Luthers</hi> time was wont to say, that he did not fear the ruine of <hi>Germany</hi> so long as <hi>Luther</hi> was alive, So neither doe I fear the utter ruine of <hi>N-England,</hi> so long as and of the first Generation who for the Gospels sake came into this Wilderness, are alive.

Besides all this, the Children which have been born in <hi>New-England,</hi> are many of them the posterity of those who have had an eminent Interest in God, yea the posterity of those who have been great sufferers for his name and Truth.

Truly we may plead it as an Argument with the blessed God, and say before him, Lord as for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who have been born in <hi>New-England,</hi> their Fathers many of them ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their lives into a wilderness for thy sake, they left their Fathers Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and possessions in this world, out of respect to thy Kingdome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have thou compassion on them, <hi>God will have compassion on them for his Covenant sake:</hi> And indeed the mercy which the Lord hath shewed in the midst of wrath, since the Sword has been drawn amongst us, argueth that he hath no mind to destroy us: what a favour of God was it that the Army was not cut off at the <hi>Fort fight?</hi> and that they perished not with cold

The Lord hath a controversie with the Heathen, and therefore he hath suffered them (in a degree) to pull down his Temple, that so they might pull down vengeance upon themselves for ever, God hath wayes to bring them down that we cannot think of: he can soon mingle a perverse Spirit amongst them, and cause them to destroy one another, he that did sometimes set the <hi>Egyptians against the Egyptians</hi> can set the

God is the same still, and will do for us as as he did for our Fathers, only <hi>he waits to be gracious,</hi> he waits to see when we shall be fit for such mercy. It was said to the Church in <hi>Thyatira, he that over cometh shall have power over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers,</hi> Rev. 2. 26.

Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness &amp; not light? even very dark, &amp; no brightness in it The time is come that Judgement must begin at the House of God, and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God? verily I am perswaded, that the Calamity which is come upon <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> is a solemn warning from Heaven, that dismal things are hastening upon the <hi>English Nation,</hi> and not only so, but indeed upon the whole World, that it will not be long before that Scripture be fulfilled, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 8. where the Lord speaketh, saying. <hi>My determination is to gather the Nations, that I may assemble the Kingdomes to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the Earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousie.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, certain it is, that the most terrible changes are coming upon the Earth that ever were known since the world began. There are indeed glorious times not far off, <hi>glorious things are spoken of thee, O thou Citty of God.</hi> After the destruction of <hi>Rome</hi> the Conversion of the Jews; and the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in (which things I know and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus, that they are nearer then some imagine for) peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity shall run down like a River, and like a mighty Stream, the whole World throughout, <hi>the Nations shall learn War no more,</hi> but a little before that, there shall be distress of Nations with great perplexity, mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things. The powers of Heaven shall be shaken, the Sun shall be turned into darkness, the Moon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood, and the Stars of Heaven shall loose their shining, Alas who shall live when God doth these things? <hi>There shall be such a time of trouble as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was since there was a Nation even to that same time,</hi> Dan. 12. 1.</p>
