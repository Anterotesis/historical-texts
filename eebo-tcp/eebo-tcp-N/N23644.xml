            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>"WHEN the foundations of the earth were laid, the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of GOD shouted for joy."
Let AMERICANS, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout imitation, proclaim the BIRTH-DAY of FREEDOM, the glorious REGENERATION of MAN. On this MEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORABLE ANNIVERSARY, may each heart become an altar of liberty; its incense, the purest effusions of gratitude. Let industry cease from labor. Let one common, elevated joy inspire all classes of society!</p>
            <p>That an address, in obedience to the wishes of my fellow-citizens, needs not the dazzling charms of bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy to secure attention; that in reciting events, so often repeated, which ought to be transmitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variation, to the latest ages, <hi>novelty</hi> would be worse than impertinent; are ideas peculiarly encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging. These considerations, added to the generous glow of patriotism which beams from every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the zealous attachment to INDEPENDENCE which characterizes the audience, induce the speaker to attempt the praises of our country; to trace the leading causes, attendants, and effects of the American revolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:031285_0005_0FEBFBFD7AC7DA00"/>Assembled, my respected auditors, not like other nations, to celebrate feats of successful carnage, or the senseless ceremonials of superstition; but excited by the animating energy of gratitude, we commemorate the struggles of <hi>freemen,</hi> the consequent emancipation of a WORLD!</p>
            <p>Pause for a moment, and realize with rapture, that our country is free and happy; that the same country, which, within a century and a half, resounded with the yell of the <hi>savage,</hi> and so lately shuddered at the outrages of still more <hi>barbarous Britons;</hi> now smiles in peace and plenty, on a nation of discerning, <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> republicans.</p>
            <p>In defiance of the tyranny which has so long bestrode creation; notwithstanding the debased con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to which servitude has reduced so great a part of the species; the sacred truth, the basis of American constitutions, that
"all men are born free and equal,"
is deeply engraven, and dearly cherished in the hearts of those, who have never bowed the knee to slavery.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY is a pure, original emanation from the great source of life, which animates the universe. Yet so long have mankind been insulted with the idea, that it is the exclusive property of a few; so long have they gazed, in stupid admiration, at the splendor of dominion, which has shone but to scorch them; so long have force and artifice on the one hand, and fear and ignorance on the other, combined with the power of all-conquering habit, that this eternal principle was almost erased from the human mind; when AMERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CA, indignant at oppression, rose, and proclaimed it with a voice, which broke the spell confining nations, roused them from the lethargy of ages, and struck like thunder on the ears of despots.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:031285_0006_0FEBFBFF10878588"/>Government, pure, rational, representative govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, equally remote from the encroachments of power, and the evils of anarchy, has, until our revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, been a stranger to nations. Liberty has been hunted about the earth with implacable malice; and like the dove from the ark, has
"found no rest for the sole of her foot."
Chased from one quarter of the globe to another, the heavenly goddess was ready to abandon her charge, when the enterprize of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus surmounted every difficulty, discovered this western world, and furnished her a more secure, more inviting retreat.</p>
            <p>To trace the progress of usurpation, or the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional glimmerings of equal liberty, which appeared, like lightning, to display, by contrast, the horrors of ancient night, would far exceed our limits.</p>
            <p>At the discovery of America, Europe, age after age, encumbered by despotism, had groaned under the combined pressure of the crown and mitre. <hi>Holy</hi> popes, assisted by bigoted, artful, assuming monks, and <hi>sacred</hi> kings, supported by the whole strength of the civil arm, assuming the very <hi>names</hi> of the Deity, invested themselves with all which could excite the fear, or command the reverence of the people, and produced a dismal chaos in science, literature, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</p>
            <p>The history of nations shocks humanity. Kings were given the Jews in a <hi>curse;</hi> and this incident to royalty has been <hi>entailed</hi> upon the world. Could all the popes, kings, and emperors who have ruled man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, become contemporary inhabitants of a single city, like Sodom of old, it would contain scarce five <hi>just</hi> men to save it from destruction!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:031285_0007_0FEBFC01BA8EEBC8"/>The shades of Vandal night began at length to recede before the sun of science, and a noble spirit of inquiry produced by a number of favorable events. Navigation was loosed from confinement; its ancient land-marks were disregarded, and near the close of the fifteenth century, America was discovered.</p>
            <p>More than an hundred years elapsed before the settlement of New-England. Difficulties so numerous and formidable were to be encountered, that some extraordinary stimulus was necessary to succeed the attempt.</p>
            <p>The same pliant credulity which had complimented the pope with the patrimony of Saint Peter, readily transferred its homage to Henry 8th, king of England. In a pompous mockery of divine jurisdiction, the sovereigns of that country thought themselves author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized to establish a standard of religious faith and worship, at the point of the sword, or even by the terrors of the faggot. Persecution, with its usual effect, produced a party which dared to dissent from the bigoted impositions of a Laud. Rather than relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish the right of opinion, our ancestors braved the dangers and hardships of a distant wilderness. Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to secure their freedom, they early obtained a promise of what was, <hi>then,</hi> considered the ultimate point of liberty,
"all the rights, immunities, and privileges of British subjects."
In confidence of this security, these American states continued, without much molestation, to increase and prosper, until the peace of Paris, in 1763, terminated a war, rendered, by the joint exertions of Britain and her colonies, most flattering to the pride of that haughty nation. But in acquiring unsubstantial renown, she accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031285_0008_0FEBFC04DCB5A7B8"/>
an enormous load of debt; and among other desperate expedients for lessening its weight, employed that of <hi>taxing her colonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had long been a favorite folly of Europeans, to represent America vastly superior to the old world in the whole face of nature, as inhabited by men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the rest of the species.</p>
            <p>The capture of Cape-Breton was the first event by which we attracted foreign respect. From that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Britain watched our rising greatness with a jealousy which has never ceased to operate. When the loyalty of the colonies was at the highest pitch; when we discovered the utmost promptitude in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting not only to the monopoly of our commerce, but to direct contribution; a British House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons dared unanimously to decree, that they had a right to <hi>tax us without our consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a flagrant violation of our charters could not fail to grieve and alarm. Resentment <hi>electerized</hi> every independent mind. Massachusetts, as ready to resist the encroachments of power as to comply with just demands, early resented this unconstitutional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, by the vote of her representatives. But in vain was the principle contested. In pursuance of this erroneous plan, an ill-directed ministry thought it an opportunity to new-model our charters, and reduce us to unconditional dependence. That <hi>vulture</hi> of <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi> the infamous <hi>stamp-act,</hi> was <hi>fledged,</hi> and sent to <hi>devour</hi> us.</p>
            <p>This was an important crisis in our national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. The imposition tamely suffered, arbitrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action was established by precedent; our whole prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty was completely at the disposal of parliament. Possessing not only the power, but the most tempting
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031285_0009_0FEBFC07AB53BC60"/>
inducement to rob us; every shilling they extorted from the colonies, would have diminished the weight of their cumbrous national load. What they plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from industry with one hand, would have been thrown into the coffers of extravagance with the other.</p>
            <p>The spirited agreement of the colonies, to import no article of British manufacture, while it existed, forced a king and parliament, who had unrelentingly heard the clearest reasoning, and the most pathetic remonstrances, to repeal the <hi>stamp-act.</hi> Still British pride could not brook the idea of acknowledging an error, even for the purposes of justice. They formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly edicted that
<hi>"they had a right to bind us in all cases whatever."</hi>
Heaping injury upon insult, by quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troops upon us, with evident intention of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling submission, under pretence that we, who had lately saved a British army from destruction; who had defended ourselves in earliest infancy, needed protection; more fully displayed their tyrannical designs.</p>
            <p>This was but the dawn of oppression. Interested, profligate minions of power, the worst of whom were our own treacherous governors, had the utmost suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in representing us as a rebellious mob of insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Petitions, the constitutional mode of seeking redress, were sometimes refused, and always treated with neglect. Arbitrary institutions, unknown to the laws, were, in many cases, substituted for trial by jury, the great security of life, liberty, and property. Our commerce and fisheries were ruined. The most studied cruelties were combined with the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading insults, by successive ministers, who exhausted ingenuity to enslave the colonies, to deceive, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ruin the whole nation which they governed.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031285_0010_0FEBFC0B854FA650"/>
If the resistance of the colonies, or the clamors of Britain, forced them to repeal the most obnoxious statutes, others started forth, like the heads of the Hydra, more numerous and terrific than the former. Treason and rebellion were the mildest names applied to resistance. Britain could not believe, that when subjects in Europe had been so long in habits of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience, Americans would dare to investigate the principles of government. They thought us a servile race of peasants, formed to bear the load of oppression, to kiss the rod of correction. But, thank God, their base designs were unattempted, until the people had knowledge to perceive, and courage to resist the infringement of their rights. A spirit of inquiry and resistance animated the continent. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustibles were collected in every part of the colonies, which needed but a <hi>spark</hi> to produce a tremendous blaze.</p>
            <p>Previously to these troubles, Britain had been fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revered as our nurturing parent. But when, with more than infernal fury, she condemned us unheard;<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Need I call your recollection to the dismal scene when the bloody troops of George 3d, dared to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the work of civil carnage? when the heroic soldiers, who opposed the invaders, were saluted with the insulting language,
"Disperse, you rebels, throw down your arms, and disperse"?
Need I paint to you the public stores destroyed, your houses rifled, your wives insulted, and wild with terror, your friends, perhaps nearest relations, among the slain, and all the complicate horrors of April, '75? No. You to whom memory, with easy effort, has too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently recalled these distressing events, and more especially those of you, who have fought the battles, or labored in the councils of injured America, will more deeply feel, on this occasion, than language can express.</p>
            <p>Excuse me, if I have touched too sad a string. Our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031285_0012_0FEBFC10B0F50138"/>
present enjoyments receive an animated zest from comparison with former distresses. The defenders of their country ought never to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>Who <hi>can</hi> forget the heroes of our war? What heart but shudders to recollect the dismal prospect presented America, at the commencement of hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? At that period, when fear had almost induced despair, the great, the good, the patriotic WASHINGTON, despising the charms of ease and affluence, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with public happiness, rose in dignity and brightness, like the early planet of evening, and led the way to a host of luminaries which shed their irradiating beams upon our desponding country.</p>
            <p>While we recollect, with gratitude, the services of our <hi>political savior,</hi> let the long catalogue of <hi>statesmen and soldiers, of all, who assisted in maintaining our rights, be handed as models to the latest ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No truth can be more obvious to common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, than that allegiance and protection are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal. When Britain not only withdrew her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the colonies, but attempted to enslave them, we owed her nothing but resentment. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with a sense of the right, of the indispensable duty of protecting our freedom; CONGRESS, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with every difficulty which could beset a nation, in the face of the most formidable army which had ever appeared on the continent, had virtue and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to proclaim the INDEPENDENCE of AMERICA! This was patriotism, this was firmness, this was wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which succeeding ages shall not cease to admire. The declaration of INDEPENDENCE separated us from haughty Britain, and raised us from disjointed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent colonies, to a respectable, united, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nation. But for this declaration, we should,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031285_0013_0FEBFC13698D2948"/>
               <hi>now,</hi> be styled, <hi>his majesty's submissive subjects.</hi> The narrow prejudices of one colony against another, would have remained in full operation. Our country, populating beyond example, under the influence of the <hi>federal constitution,</hi> would have continued, in a great measure, unexplored, subject to discordant char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and royal commissions. Our commerce, now bounded only by the globe, would still have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a single nation, hampered by their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions.</p>
            <p>But why do I enlarge? How absurd, how degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the idea, that such a free, enlightened nation, should be subject to kings born and educated in a foreign country; in total ignorance of the people, surrounded by sycophants, whose business it is to cherish their vices, to flatter and deceive them; most probably inheriting vice and folly, from a long line of profligate ancestors! What can be more ignominious, than that such a nation, possessing a vast, fertile conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, should be governed by sovereigns of petty islands, which would be scarcely visible by the side of America? What more unnatural, than that a system of SUNS should revolve in humble subservience around a planet?</p>
            <p>The declaration of <hi>American independence</hi> was not an ebullition of faction or enthusiasm. It was not the effect of sudden success. It was not the offspring of intemperate ambition. But the cool, considerate resolution of the most distinguished sages, echoed and supported by millions of freemen, to save themselves and posterity from the furious jaws of oppression. Imagination, at this cool period, cannot conceive the ardent patriotism, which sacrificed every thing to the common cause. Destitute of national resources to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031285_0014_0FEBFC160AE8C920"/>
supply, or compensate an army; a formidable band of soldier-citizens was raised, and supported by the influence of public spirit.</p>
            <p>Britons throng our shores. Thunder from your navies. Embattle your own machines, German hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and Indian auxiliaries. Destroy churches, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, towns, all that is dear or sacred. Boast, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, issue manifestoes, display all your fury. WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON surprises your Hessians in the midst of security, heroic GATES, and his republican brothers, soon crop the withered laurels from the brows of your favorite Burgoyne.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these energetic exertions, thick and alarming clouds lowered in the political horizon. Embarrassments innumerable sprung from poverty and inexperience. Surrounded by refugees and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign armies, our military establishment extremely precarious, many were willing to comply with insidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proposals of accommodation, calculated to divide, to conquer and enslave us.</p>
            <p>Our allies in Europe, whatever motives actuated their assistance, receive our grateful acknowledgments. The names of FAYETTE, de GRASSE, ROCHAMBEAU, VERGENNES, and many distinguished Frenchmen, will ever be dear to Americans.</p>
            <p>Shall we recite the signal victories obtained over the enemy, both before, and after the French alliance? Need we display the fortitude, patience and intrepidity of our troops, until they obtained the object of our toils; until they forced the enemy to acknowledge our INDEPENDENCE? Modesty forbids it. Fame has filled the world with praises of our revolution. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring nations, already, imitate the example.</p>
            <p>Eight long years our country bled at every vein.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031285_0015_0FEBFC18F6BEFFD8"/>
Enormous was the national expense. Inconceivable were the sufferings of our patriotic defenders. IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORTAL HEROES! Yours was the glory to protect your injured country; it was yours to baffle an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, hitherto deemed irresistible. You fought in the cause of <hi>man.</hi> If the war-worn soldier could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pecuniary compensation, his merit is recorded in the heart of his countrymen, and we trust, on the tablets of eternal justice.</p>
            <p>But, my friends, expelling the enemy was only half our work. To erect a government, which should <hi>secure</hi> the advantages, was an object equally important. The defects of our old confederation were deeply felt. But, to devise, and persuade the states to adopt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, which should harmonize the jarring inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, habits, and wishes of so many states, peopled from different nations, was truly an Herculean task. It was attempted, formed, and accepted. Three sta<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s have already been added to the federal constellation. Its splendor becomes daily more bright and diffusive. The DARING EAGLE, fabled to perch on the sceptre of Jupiter, now actually wields the sovereignty of a WORLD!</p>
            <p>Immortal are the names of authors and orators, who, even amidst the dangers of tyranny, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated humanity, have analyzed the principles of government. But the glory of reducing their theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to practice, of combining the essential rights of nature with the refinement, the security of civil as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation, was reserved for America.</p>
            <p>Government, among other nations, has been an enormous weight and restraint upon the people. The American has diffused unexampled happiness through every part of the empire. Some of the causes are obvious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:031285_0016_0FEBFC1C9EE7F4F0"/>The old governments of the earth derive right and power from the same polluted source, the <hi>grant</hi> of kings. These <hi>grants</hi> are founded upon <hi>usurpation,</hi> and supported by a well-known principle in English law, that
<hi>"kings can do no wrong;"</hi>
therefore, are not responsible. The American constitutions acknowledge no authority superior to the laws. They rest upon very different principles, that right is derived from heaven, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of power from the people, and law from the will of a majority. In the picture of <hi>Europe,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a few hereditary robbers, in the <hi>most conspicuous point of light,</hi> engrossing the honour and profit of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erning; in the <hi>remotest back ground,</hi> we can just discern the people, crouching under the weight of oppression, dependent on the nobles even for subsistence. In <hi>America,</hi> government is maintained for the good of the whole, by men who scorn to derive support from any source but their own exertions; <hi>equality</hi> inspires a spirit of <hi>independence.</hi> In the <hi>former,</hi> the very light of heaven is taxed, the vitals of society are consumed, to support placemen, pensioners and superfluous officers, whose interest it is, to darken and brutalize mankind. In the <hi>latter,</hi> taxes are scarcely felt, and cheerfully bestowed, because devoted, with strictest economy, to support a government which protects the liberties, and enlightens the minds of the people. In short, <hi>the one,</hi> founded in ignorance, or imposed by conquest, are supported by force and fraud; the <hi>other,</hi> construct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by enlightened experience in candid discussion, rests upon the firm basis of common interest, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral affection. Even the celebrated constitution of Great Britain is a mere patch-work of shreds and remnants, extorted from the weakness, or granted by the affected liberality of kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:031285_0017_0FEBE533ACD9CFC0"/>A peculiar and important blessing of the American revolution, is <hi>religious toleration.</hi> By abolishing the unnatural connexion of civil and ecclesiastical tyranny, it has left religion to the direction of conscience.</p>
            <p>But why enumerate the advantages of governments, which concentrate the wisdom of ages, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the admiration and applause of every impartial statesman in the world? Why describe the evils of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potism, which have received most pointed execrations from the ablest pens? To realize the curses which bedew Europe with the tears of its inhabitants, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which have revived the golden age in the new; survey Europe, then turn and behold America. On these subjects, words cannot express my emotions. I can only entreat you to <hi>think,</hi> to <hi>feel</hi> for yourselves.</p>
            <p>My zeal, I fear, has already carried the comparison beyond your patience. But should any heart beat one pulse more with genuine detestation of tyranny, with grateful exultation that France has broken her fetters, or with love to the constitutions of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the speaker has well employed his time; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he hopes, will not regret their attention.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the excellency of our governments, although the legislative, judiciary, and executive branches are accurately separated, and so nicely bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced as to guard the encroachments of each other, which best defines a free constitution; we have an easy, peaceful mode of revision; while other nations must wade to reformation through seas of blood.</p>
            <p>Remote from the vortex of European politics, where the slightest causes may involve whole nations in war; at peace with all the world, possessing every article of necessity, utility, or elegance, the UNITED STATES have attained an unparalleled degree of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031285_0018_0FEBFC24645763F8"/>
and happiness. A numerous body of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened farmers cultivate an extensive continent of their own productive soil, the most healthy, independent and happy employment of man, and constitute the pillars of our republic. Although a few of the most insignificant beings in creation have affected to despise agriculture, a work which has employed the most respected characters of ancient and modern times; and to deride the mechanic arts, so useful, so honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in society, arts, which have engaged the first geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses of the world; Americans know their value, they know that a man's family or employment should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer neither honor nor disgrace; that <hi>every honest, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious citizen deserves protection and respect.</hi> Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is generally diffused. The arts and sciences fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a continual supply for the gratification of taste, and the support of society. In short, the <hi>American revolution</hi> has produced effects equalled only in fiction.</p>
            <p>The unprecedented ravages of war, in Europe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the most striking lessons of instruction, at the same time, they administer to our wealth, beyond calculation, by furnishing a market for every article of produce.</p>
            <p>Unhappily, the most perfect works of man are fraught with error, and subject to abuse. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too frequently imbibe, at an early period, the seeds of corruption, which incorporate with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, grow with their age, and at length, effect their ruin. <hi>Luxury</hi> has destroyed the most renowned empires of time. <hi>Faction,</hi> the fruitful mother of evil; <hi>faction,</hi> the peculiar curse of <hi>republics,</hi> has already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered our rising greatness.</p>
            <p>To avoid these elements of destruction, let it ever be remembered, that a <hi>free government cannot long exist,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031285_0019_0FEBFC26730F9FF0"/>
unsupported by a great degree of knowledge and virtue.</hi> Not to mention the other important advantages of morality and learning, they have uniformly been found foes to tyranny. Many who credulously dread the sacrifice of our liberty by open attack, who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with apprehension, that a short-lived treaty may prove injurious; or that an unprincipled magistrate may, hereafter, preside at the helm of government; do not properly consider, that <hi>any</hi> evils, which <hi>can</hi> proceed from <hi>such</hi> sources, must be <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> compared with those which <hi>must</hi> ensue from <hi>general ignorance,</hi> or <hi>depravity</hi> of <hi>morals.</hi> When virtue and information are predominant in a nation, should any tyrant attempt usurpation, his life would soon be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated to public vengeance. On the contrary, a people, prepared, by degeneracy, for a master, will submit to the sword of a conqueror, or be sold to the highest bidder. The history of the Jews, Persians, Greeks, Romans, of every considerable nation, ancient or modern, fully evinces the necessity of public virtue, to the preservation of liberty; the ruinous tendency of vice. Respect, then, and support <hi>institutions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Secure freedom of the press; liberty, but not licentiousness of opinion. Patronize with liberal care <hi>seminaries of learning.</hi> Citizens in ignorance will be liable to vice, to superstition, to every error and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Enlighten their minds, they will rise, in a great degree, superior to prejudice; they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, revere, obey the laws. Considering our liability to war, and that their country looks to them for protection, the <hi>militia</hi> will preserve their regard to discipline, be ever ready to support the constituted authorities, and continue the firm guardians of our rights. Resist the torrent of foreign vice and folly,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031285_0020_0FEBFC280FBEAF78"/>
continually pouring into our sea-ports. Their servil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, their parade, their vanity, their corruption, may destroy the simplicity of our manners, create artificial wants, and at length, eradicate republican sentiments. Let us preserve <hi>real independence;</hi> establish a standard of <hi>taste,</hi> of <hi>opinion,</hi> of <hi>action,</hi> purely our own. Many who scorn to barter their liberty for gold, would thoughtlessly lose it by servile imitation. Avoid, then, undue foreign influence. We are neither French nor Englishmen, but glory in the name of AMERICANS. Guard against the tumults of faction, the false colors of party. Value and preserve purity in elections. Foster a well-regulated spirit of enterprise, of industry, of economy, and every virtue. Thus, AMERICANS! may we transmit our free constitutions, unimpaired, to posterity; thus perpetuate our present enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Although the breath of calumny would gladly tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the brightest reputations, our governments have been administered, almost without exception, by men of the greatest wisdom, integrity and firmness; men who would <hi>lose every thing dear, and gain nothing but infamy,</hi> should they betray their constituents.</p>
            <p>What are the characters and designs of men, who tell us the contrary, who abuse the liberty of the press, and the most worthy officers of the people? Who are these flaming patriots that insult credulity, excite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual uneasiness, and fill the minds of the people with unreasonable jealousy? Who tell us that the PRESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENT is a <hi>tyrant, opposed to independence, bribed by British gold,</hi> and other lies, equally gross and senseless? They are a few disappointed, ambitious demagogues, who attempt to drown the pilot, and sink the federal ship, to repair their ruined fortunes by the wreck. Where were these new-made champions of liberty, when
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031285_0021_0FEBFC29BA3784C8"/>
               <hi>Washington</hi> inhabited the <hi>camp,</hi> and braved the foes of his country? Where will their memory be when his shall be almost adored? They sprung from faction, are supported by vice and ignorance, and not even their crimes can save them from oblivion. These are not the friends of the people. Far from protecting your rights, they would sooner trample on your necks. It would delight their aspiring pride to see creation the footstool of their grandeur. Do they discover the cool, dispassionate temper of genuine republicans? No. They excite the same ferment which disappointed profligates would always raise. They are actuated by the same lawless ambition, with which Robespierre bawled liberty in France, until he had desolated that country with crimes and cruelties beyond conception. They burn with the same malignant envy at your prosperity, which led the first enemy of man to mar the enjoyments of Paradise.<note n="*" place="bottom">These observations apply <hi>equally</hi> to unprincipled, <hi>factious</hi> men, of <hi>whatever party.</hi> They were not intended, as some have imagined, to describe <hi>anti-federalists</hi> in <hi>principle.</hi>
               </note> Let us not be duped by men, who need only be known, to become detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Guard with more than vestal care, the exercise of power, but let not <hi>ingratitude</hi> mark your vigilance.</p>
            <p>The advantages of the American revolution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compressed within the compass of a few pages. Its effects are not confined to one age or country. The human mind has received a stimulus, and attained an expansion, which will extend its influence beyond calculation.</p>
            <p>Frenchmen, the most gallant, powerful and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical nation in Europe, <hi>glow</hi> with the <hi>flame</hi> first <hi>kindled</hi> in <hi>this commonwealth.</hi> The spark excited in Lexington and Concord, has already consumed the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031285_0022_0FEBFC2C55197D40"/>
moss-grown, Gothic structure of arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in France, and melted the useless, ostentatious statues of kings, images of saints, and the richest crown in Europe, to purchase liberty and government, for six and twenty millions of mankind. The same Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean spirit of <hi>independence,</hi> which, in the American cradle, strangled the two serpents, British tyranny, and domestic faction, is now belaboring the slaves of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potism with the heaviest blows of republican manhood. But now, from the mountains of Italy, we heard the reverberated blows.</p>
            <p>To celebrate the magnanimity, to mention the amazing resources of genius, courage and property, which France has discovered during the contest, is far beyond our power. We hope her excesses, the effect of former oppression, will totally subside, that her new constitution has established liberty upon law and reason.</p>
            <p>The dismemberment of Poland, the infamous treaty of Pilnitz, with the subsequent accession of the other powers to the combination in the outrageous attempt to subjugate an independent nation, have fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the fury, the madness of despots.</p>
            <p>While tyrants are making such desperate efforts to suppress a spirit of inquiry and freedom, fatal to their existence, it is peculiarly incumbent upon the friends of liberty, to advocate her cause. Survey the globe. Asia, Africa, Europe, with few exceptions, the West-Indies, and South America, glimmer in political twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or grope in total darkness. FRANCE and the UNITED STATES, a great political ATLAS, support on their shoulders the REPUBLICAN WORLD.</p>
            <p>With confidence we predict, that the mad struggles of despotism will exhaust its strength. All hail! ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching revolutions! AMERICANS! <hi>we have lived
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031285_0023_0FEBFC32B3ED6D30"/>
ages in a day!</hi> Huge pyramids of lawless power, the work of centuries, have fallen in a moment. With fondest ardor we indulge our wishes, that nations shall yet see the pride, the weakness, and the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy of their governors. Fired by the bright exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of France and America, may kingdom rise indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant after kingdom, burst their chains, and level every fabric of tyranny with the dust. We cordially sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the SUPREME DIRECTOR OF EVENTS, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the empire of enlightened reason and pure relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, until virtue, knowledge, liberty and happiness shall become extensive as the globe, permanent as time. But, whatever issue awaits the present Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean contest, whatever may be the fate of other nations, continue, GREAT AUTHOR OF GOOD, the prosperity of AMERICA, perpetuate our peace, happiness, INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE!</p>
