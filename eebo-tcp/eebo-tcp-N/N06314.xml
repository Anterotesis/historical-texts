            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAving been for ſome Time under a <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>mournful</hi> Senſe of the States of many of the Churches of Chriſt, a <hi>weighty</hi> Concern came upon my Spirit, to communicate ſome of thoſe Things to you which came under my Conſideration, and I could not be eaſy until I had given up to do it; and as I foreſee what I ſhall write will be <hi>long,</hi> and the <hi>longer</hi> by <hi>commemorating</hi> the Dealings of the LORD with us in <hi>this</hi> Nation, as well as by writing ſome Things <hi>new</hi> and <hi>old:</hi> So therefore, I deſire you will bear its Length, it being, in Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the laſt Time that ever I ſhall write to you, for I am but <hi>weak</hi> in Body, and <hi>ill</hi> able to write at this Time; and, in all <hi>human Proſpect,</hi> not likely to continue long in this World. But however that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008008_0003_102DCB3D641F92E8"/>
may be, Oh! ſaith my Soul, that the Lord will be pleaſed to keep and preſerve me <hi>near</hi> to himſelf to the End, that ſo in the End of my Time, I may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that <hi>everlaſting</hi> Reſt, that the ELDERS, who have gone before me, are already entred into.</p>
            <p>And now, my <hi>dear Friends,</hi> I herewith ſend you the Salutation of my <hi>endeared</hi> Love in our LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>fervent</hi> with me now in <hi>old</hi> Age, as in my <hi>Youth,</hi> more eſpecially to you that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and are zealouſly concerned for the Welfare and Proſperity of SION, you are as <hi>near</hi> and <hi>dear</hi> to me as ever, and I have Unity with you, in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Love and Life, whether you are <hi>old</hi> or <hi>young, rich</hi> or <hi>poor,</hi> for in this Love it is that we are bound up together in the Bundle of Life, being <hi>baptized by one Spirit into one Body,</hi> and in this Love which proceeds from the Spirit, the true Unity of the Church is kept up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Bond of Peace,</hi> whereby the <hi>whole Body is edified</hi> together in love, which you know is a <hi>ſtronger</hi> Bond and Tye than all <hi>outward</hi> Laws, Creeds, or Confeſſions of Faith <hi>without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides this Gift of the HOLY SPIRIT, which CHRIST has given us for our Salvation, he has given <hi>additional</hi> Means and Aſſiſtances <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive</hi> to that great End; thus he has afforded us the HOLY SCRIPTURES for our <hi>Information, Edification</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> thro' the Spirit. He has ſent us his <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> whom he has furniſhed with the <hi>immediate</hi> Power of his Word: He has gifted ELDERS to <hi>overſee, adviſe</hi> and <hi>admoniſh</hi> us, and, by his holy Spirit, he has moved upon both Miniſters and Elders, to give forth and leave us <hi>holy Inſtructions,</hi> for keeping <hi>godly</hi> Order
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008008_0004_102DCB69D7EAB9F8"/>
and Diſcipline in the <hi>Churches</hi> of CHRIST, to be as an <hi>Hedge</hi> and <hi>Fence</hi> about us for our Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (ſo far as Means can do) in this Unity of the Spirit, as well as to keep us from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads</hi> of the Enemy, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>gracious</hi> LORD has done all this for us in our Day and Time, as he did formerly, ſo that we may truly ſay with that holy Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who ſpoke from the Mouth of the Lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it.</hi> And I pray God it may not be ſaid of many of us now as he ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> then, <hi>viz.

            <p>Now, my <hi>dear Friends,</hi> that which bears the greateſt Weight upon my Spirt at this Time, is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>godly</hi> Order and Diſcipline in the Churches of Chriſt: And tho' I well know that you, who have retained your <hi>firſt</hi> Love to God, and have kept your Habitations in his <hi>holy Truth,</hi> do not want any Information of mine to convince you of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> thereof; yet, as <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart: the Mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> ſo out of the abundant Concern I feel upon my Spirit for the Proſperity of Truth, I beſeech you bear with me while I eaſe my Mind, if it but prove of the leaſt Benefit to the Younger in your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſtirring up the <hi>pure Mind by Way of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;</hi> for notwithſtanding I am very ſenſible that ſome of you do want but little ſtirring up to your Duty, reſpecting Diſcipline, yet I believe many others do. Neither do you want to be convinced that our <hi>Womens,</hi> as well as <hi>Mens,</hi> Meeting for

Diſcipline, were <hi>firſt</hi> ſet up by the <hi>Movings</hi> of the LORD's Power, through that <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> Elder GEORGE FOX; and alſo, that the Authority of theſe Meetings is to be kept up and maintained therein, you are <hi>living</hi> Witneſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, becauſe the LORD has often owned your Services in them by the <hi>Overſhawdowings</hi> of his <hi>glorious</hi> Power.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 4.</note> You know alſo, that in the <hi>firſt Inſtitution</hi> of theſe our Mens Meetings, the Members of them were to be <hi>faithful</hi> Men, who were to rule and govern for the LORD, <hi>Men fearing</hi> GOD, <hi>and hating Covetouſneſs,</hi> agreeable to thoſe in the Apoſtles Times, whom the HOLY GHOST had made <hi>Overſeers</hi> in the Church of CHRIST; yet this does not exclude <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt minded</hi> young Men from being admitted to ſit in thoſe Meetings <hi>as Learners,</hi> who, growing in Truth, may at length come to have their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Senſes exerciſed, ſo as <hi>rightly</hi> to diſcern between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>Things that differ,</hi> tho' at firſt they may not ſee into Things <hi>ſo clearly</hi> as the <hi>faithful</hi> Elders did, yet as they grow in Truth, and <hi>follow them,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes, <hi>the Lord in due Time will reveal ſuch Things unto them.</hi> I can ſpeak this from my own Experience; likewiſe, in a more general Way, as there are, and always will be, <hi>different</hi> Degrees of Growth in the Members of the Church of CHRIST, yet as all are <hi>growing</hi> in Truth, and drawing <hi>one Way,</hi> and aiming at the <hi>ſame</hi> Thing, namely the <hi>Honour of the</hi> LORD, and Proſperity of his <hi>holy</hi> Truth, there will be a <hi>general</hi> Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Submiſſion to one another, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>godly</hi> Elders and Overſeers; here the<note place="margin">

               <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>Self-will</hi> of Man is kept out, and the Unity of the Spirit, in an <hi>heavenly</hi> Harmony, maintained in thoſe Meetings, as well as among the whole Body, or Church of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>And while Things remained in this Order, the true <hi>Watchmen</hi> for CHRIST, thoſe Elders, <hi>were good</hi> Examples to the Flock themſelves; they diligently watched them, leſt the Enemy ſhould ſteal in upon them; and when at any Time he made an Appearance, they gave the Alarm to the Flock to beware of the Devourer: Thus, if any Thing did appear <hi>contrary</hi> to Truth, of what Kind ſoever, then preſently (without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay) thoſe <hi>true Watchmen</hi> did endeavour to put a Stop thereto; then it was that Things went well in general in the Churches of CHRIST. I could enlarge abundantly upon the good Effects of it, but ſtop myſelf, and in a few Words ſay, <hi>That then the Diſorderly were dealt with in due Time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of their Offences, and for their Good: And if they could not be reclaimed, they were ſet in their Places, Truth cleared, and they made as Examples to others, and then thoſe Examples in ſome Meaſure became a Terror to ſuch who were inclined and ready to follow their diſorderly Steps, by which Means many, I believe, were deterred there from: And thus holy Diſcipline was kept in its right Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and, above all, the LORD was pleaſed to own thoſe Services with his heavenly Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! alas! The State of Things continued in this Condition but a few Years before the Enemy of all Righteouſneſs made Attempts to break down the <hi>Fence</hi> of Diſcipline, which had been ſet up by the <hi>Power</hi> of GOD, and even prevailed on ſome, who had been as <hi>leading</hi> Elders and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008008_0007_102DCB932B7B6C88"/>
to be concerned therein (ſuch who once knew better Things) but had departed from their <hi>firſt</hi> Love to Truth, and Zeal for it; theſe Men, with their <hi>libertine</hi> Company in our bordering Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did riſe up againſt that <hi>Man</hi> of GOD, <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who had been made the Inſtrument, in the Hand of the LORD, to ſet up good Order and Diſcipline; they levelled their Rage and Malice againſt him in particular, with thoſe who had kept their <hi>firſt</hi> Love in general: But their <hi>chief</hi> End was to lay waſte, and deſtroy this <hi>good</hi> Order and Diſcipline, and <hi>leave every one to do as they pleaſed,</hi> and would have no Bounds ſet, with this <hi>plauſible</hi> Pretence, that all muſt be left to the Light in their Conſciences, and Friends muſt wait until they are convinced, that ſuch and ſuch Things were <hi>contrary</hi> to Truth, tho' even many of the Things they went into, the <hi>Light</hi> of CHRIST led the <hi>true</hi> Followers of it out of, and to teſtify againſt, <hi>in the Beginning.</hi> This was <hi>pleaſing</hi> Doctrine to <hi>Libertines;</hi> it took with them, and they made uſe of it, and thereupon went into <hi>wrong</hi> Liberty, as <hi>Height, Pride, Faſhions</hi> of the <hi>World, Stiff-neckedneſs, Strife, Centention,</hi> and <hi>ſo unruly,</hi> that they would not ſubmit their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to Friends, with many other Things <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to Truth, too long to enumerate; and yet all this under a Pretence of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and that they were not convinced by the <hi>Light</hi> in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to the contrary. In ſhort, the Rebellion and Confederacy (againſt good Order in the Church) was very great and ſtrong, and in ſome Places they ſet up <hi>ſeparate</hi> Meetings; but the LORD brought a <hi>Blaſt</hi> upon that Spirit, and they came to nothing, as a Body of People; yet notwithſtanding this, the Seeds, which they had ſown in this Time of <hi>undue</hi>

Liberty remained, and ſtill remain amongſt many, in ſome Places, and in this Time it was that ſome of thoſe Seeds were brought into this Nation, by Examples from them, and in particular <hi>Height</hi> and <hi>Finery</hi> in <hi>Apparel</hi> and <hi>Houſhold Stuff,</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things, of which I am preſently to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Tho' I was but a <hi>young Man</hi> then, yet an <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear</hi> Witneſs of many of thoſe Things, having been at ſeveral of the Meetings in <hi>England,</hi> wherein this <hi>libertine</hi> Spirit raiſed Contention, and then I clearly ſaw the Tendency thereof, that it would, if poſſible, lay waſte the whole <hi>Heritage</hi> of GOD, and I bore my Teſtimony againſt it, as <hi>convenient</hi> Seaſons and Opportunities offered.</p>
            <p>I have written after this Manner to ſhew how <hi>good</hi> Order and Diſcipline was ſet up and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a general Way, and what Spirit it was that oppoſed it then, and I greatly fear the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is at work now, in this Nation, tho' in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Appearance, not by their oppoſing all Diſcipline in a general Manner as they did, but by breaking of Minutes, and weakening the Hands of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> who are <hi>zealouſly</hi> concerned in Spirit for the Promotion of Truth, and keeping up the Diſcipline thereof, in its <hi>right</hi> Line.</p>
            <p>Now, in opening theſe Things, I find I ſhall be ſtill led on in an <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Manner, and therefore deſire your Patience, and tho' it tend not to the Information of you <hi>faithful</hi> Elders in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who know them already, yet it may be to the Younger, by <hi>commemorating</hi> the kind Dealings of the LORD towards us, and ſtirring up the <hi>pure</hi> Mind in them, and that none of us may be ungrateful to him, for all the Benefits and Labour that he has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us.</p>

I have already ſaid, that ſome of the Seeds, which that libertine Spirit had ſown, were brought over into this Nation, and particularly that of <hi>Height and Finery in Apparel and Houſehold Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp;c. And by exampling one another, they came to a great Height at laſt, tho' not to that Degree, as in the other Nation, but we are going faſt into them.</p>
            <p>Now, upon this Occaſion, I muſt revive the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that <hi>Worthy</hi> Elder <hi>William Edmundſon,</hi> of this Nation, whoſe Memory and Labours live, and are ſweet to the <hi>upright</hi> in Heart, and who (as moſt of you well know) was <hi>eminently</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the Hand of the LORD, not only in a <hi>powerful</hi> Miniſtry by Word and Doctrine, but alſo for eſtabliſhing and maintaining <hi>good</hi> Order and Diſcipline in the Churches of CHRIST. He <hi>zealouſly</hi> and with <hi>undaunted</hi> Courage ſtood up <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> for the LORD and his Cauſe, and oppoſed all <hi>falſe</hi> Liberty, in its <hi>firſt</hi> Appearance, and was, to my <hi>certain</hi> Knowledge, much grieved, when he ſaw it growing in this Nation, and faithfully bore his Teſtimony againſt it, <hi>without Favour or Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and tho' he did ſo, and that many Epiſtles and Minutes went forth from our Half-year Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, againſt that <hi>libertine</hi> Spirit of <hi>Height, Pride, and other Things,</hi> that had grown upon us, yet all did not prove fully effectual, until at laſt the LORD bleſt his <hi>unwearied</hi> Endeavours, with Succeſs, as a <hi>chief</hi> Inſtrument in the Hand of GOD, for putting <hi>godly</hi> Diſcipline in <hi>due</hi> and <hi>cloſe</hi> Execution, and by which Means a Stop was put to that Spirit, in <hi>great</hi> Meaſure, until he was taken from us, and it is now about out Thirty Years ſince the LORD raiſed up and ſpirited many <hi>godly</hi> Elders to join with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008008_0010_102DCB9A199F0560"/>
him, as one Man, in this Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and thereupon Epiſtles were given forth from Half-years Meetings, which named Abundance of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, in <hi>Apparel, Houſe Furniture, garniſhing of Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>numerous</hi> other Things relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Converſation</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> and running <hi>greedily</hi> after the Things of this World, too long to enumerate, and which may be ſeen in thoſe Minutes, and for the more effectual performing this Work, they directed us to chuſe out <hi>right ſpirited</hi> Friends, who had a Concern upon them for the Proſperity of Truth, and putting away all thoſe Things that were as <hi>Nuiſances</hi> in the Church, to viſit every <hi>particular</hi> Family, to <hi>ſee, inſpect</hi> and <hi>adviſe</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as they ſaw Occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>Now, about this Time, the LORD had alſo raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Concern in the Minds of the <hi>faithful</hi> Elders, in moſt Parts of this Nation, and, with them, had likewiſe been preparing the Hearts of a <hi>younger</hi> and <hi>middle aged</hi> Generation, to join in this Work, and when thoſe Epiſtles and Minutes came down to this Province, there was a <hi>general</hi> Aſſent in the Minds of Friends to comply with the Advices they gave us, as ſeeing the Neceſſity of it; and indeed I muſt confeſs, I believe that we, in this City of <hi>Cork,</hi> were at that time as much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take the Advice as any in the Nation; for tho' our Wives and Children dreſſed pretty plain, yet many of them wore <hi>rich coſtly</hi> Apparel, tho' of grave Colours, and many of our Houſes were furniſhed with <hi>divers</hi> Superfluities, that were not <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Plainneſs of Truth, and as Truth (I am ſatisfied) led into, in the Beginning.</p>
            <p>However, ſo it was that the LORD touched the Hearts of thoſe alſo, and they joined <hi>Heart and</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:008008_0011_102DCB9E09751CB0"/>
               <hi>Hand</hi> to the Work, in firſt cleanſing their own Houſes and Families from theſe Things, and after that, as Elders were appointed according to the Advice of the Half-year's Meeting to viſit Families, ſo ſome of thoſe, the <hi>Younger,</hi> were appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt; but I well know it was very hard for ſome them to give up to it, as thinking the Service too <hi>weighty</hi> for them, but having a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon their Spirits, that the Work ſhould go on, they at laſt complied, tho' in a Croſs to their own Wills, they went in much <hi>Weakneſs, Fear and Trembling,</hi> but the LORD (I teſtify) was with and ſtrengthened them in the Service. I write this for the Encouragement of all <hi>honeſt hearted young Perſons,</hi> ſuch who are concerned in Spirit for the Proſperity of Truth, and that think themſelves very weak, and thereby are <hi>too backward</hi> in ſuch Services, which the <hi>faithful</hi> Elders in the Church of GOD ſhall think them meaſurably capable of.</p>
            <p>It is with me to let the <hi>Younger</hi> know how Friends proceeded in their Viſits; and this I do, in order to ſtir up their Minds by Way of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Encouragement. The Viſiters choſen <hi>firſt</hi> met together, and, in the Love of GOD, without <hi>Partiality,</hi> examined one another, how far they ſtood <hi>clear</hi> themſelves, relating to the Things about which they were going to adviſe others; and, after due Examination, proceeded thus: When we came to a Family, we ſat down with them, and firſt wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while upon the LORD, and then, as it aroſe in the Minds of any, we principally in the firſt Place directed them to the Gift of the LORD's Spirit in themſelves, as that by which <hi>alone</hi> they could grow in the Truth, and which would lead them in outward Things, agreeable thereto, as to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:008008_0012_102DCB9F9A0A2340"/>
               <hi>Behaviour and Plainneſs of Apparel and Speech,</hi> &amp;c. as it led our Elders in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and that altho' theſe Things were very <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable</hi> in their Places, yet told them, they would not do <hi>of themſelves,</hi> except the Heart was alſo right in the Sight of the LORD: And having ſpoken what was in our Minds, according to the State of the Family we viſited (ſometimes all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſometimes particularly apart, as we ſaw Occaſion for it) we then came to the Minutes from our Half-year's Meeting, and ſpoke parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to them.</p>
            <p>And this I may tell you of a Truth, that in all thoſe Viſits we made in this City at that time we met with no <hi>Oppoſition</hi> or <hi>Contradiction</hi> in any one Family or particular Perſon, that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but a <hi>general</hi> Condeſcenſion in all, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>open</hi> Confeſſion of Things that had been amiſs, and that in <hi>great</hi> Tenderneſs, with Hopes of Amendment for the future; ſo that the Viſiters and Viſited had <hi>great</hi> Satisfaction in that Service; and this I may further tell you, above all, the LORD owned our Service, by favouring us with his holy Power therein, ſo that in ſome Families, where Things were well, the LORD overſhadowed us by his <hi>living</hi> Preſence, and melted us down together, as into one Lump; <hi>May my Soul never forget thoſe Times, while I have a Day to live in this World!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, after thoſe Viſits were over in this City, in convenient Time moſt of thoſe Viſiters here did accompany ſome other <hi>faithful</hi> Elders in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and they went through it, viſiting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of Friends, like as they had done in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which had much the <hi>ſame</hi> Effects as here, there
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008008_0013_102DCBA12BFF5228"/>
being <hi>a general</hi> Condeſcenſion to comply with the Deſire of the Half-year's Meeting; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, in Time, there was (I think I may ſay) a pretty full and <hi>effectual</hi> Reformation in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in outward Things that had been amiſs, and which that Meeting deſired might be put away) and I underſtood the like Succeſs attended that Service in other Parts of this Nation; and thus Things ſtood for ſeveral Years, and there was <hi>great</hi> Unity among Friends of this Province in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as well as in general throughout the reſt of the Kingdom, and the LORD was pleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which he manifeſted oftentimes by the <hi>Overflowings</hi> of his <hi>divine Power</hi> in the Meetings of Friends.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, my dear Friends, my writing after this Manner looks rather like an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> than an Epiſtle, but I deſire you will bear with me, it being to magnify the <hi>loving Kindneſs</hi> of the LORD in (rehearſing) his Dealings with us, and for the Information and Encouragement of the <hi>Younger,</hi> that they may follow the Steps of the <hi>worthy Antients,</hi> who have followed Chriſt, and ſhun and avoid that <hi>libertine</hi> Spirit, which I fear is now getting in, and has got in again, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to throw down and lay waſte what our <hi>godly</hi> Elders had reared up by the <hi>Power</hi> of the LORD, and from this Fear, I am led to query after this Manner.</p>
            <p>Is there not (ſome) in Being, who not only ſaw thoſe Times of <hi>outward</hi> Reformation, but alſo heartily joined therein, by putting away out of their Houſes and Families thoſe Superfluities in <hi>Fineneſs of Apparel</hi> and <hi>Houſhold Furniture,</hi> &amp;c. I am ſatisfied there are. Or is there any who, ſince
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008008_0014_102DCBA3C9665F40"/>
that Time, have owned that Concern, and for a Time ſtood zealous for the Plainneſs of Truth? I am perſuaded there are. And now I query, is there any of late Times, of both Sorts, who have loſt that former Zeal, and ſuffered or permitted ſome of the <hi>ſame</hi> or <hi>greater Superfluities in Apparel and Dreſs to be worn by their Children, and in their Families; and likewiſe have ſuffered or permitted as fine or finer Houſe Furniture and Garniſhing to come into their own Houſes, or their Childrens,</hi> which I am ſatisfied they might have prevented, by zealouſly ſtanding againſt it; and moreover, have they not connived at others that have gone into ſuch Things? I fear there are ſuch.</p>
            <p>Now, by theſe and the like Means, and by taking Examples from one another, the Seeds of <hi>Height, Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> have grown and ſpread more (among us) than ever they were before that Time of <hi>Reformation,</hi> to the Wounding and Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Souls of the upright in Heart. Oh! Friends (<hi>Friends</hi>) I have this to ſay to you, from the Movings of the Spirit of the LORD in my Heart, how will you anſwer it in the Day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? You, I ſay, that by your <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> and <hi>Luke-warmneſs,</hi> have let in thoſe offenſive Things upon us again; for as our bleſſed Lord ſaid, <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little Ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a Milſtone were hanged about his Neck, and that he were drowned in the Depth of the Sea.</hi> What will be the Portion of ſuch as theſe? Therefore let all who are concerned herein repent, and do their <hi>firſt</hi> Works, before it be <hi>too late.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, beſides <hi>Height, Pride</hi> and <hi>Faſhions,</hi> which have (I fear) appeared in too many with a <hi>daring</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:008008_0015_102DCBA7B9F92020"/>
Face, is there not ſome that have very much loſt, or been aſhamed of, the <hi>plain</hi> Language, both in <hi>ſpeaking</hi> and <hi>writing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I further query, Are there not ſome, who have gone into <hi>undue</hi> Liberty of many Kinds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that would be accounted <hi>ſomething,</hi> who have gone into <hi>Contentions, Broils,</hi> and <hi>Differences,</hi> (through a <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Spirit) to the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Church? I wiſh there may not. But I cannot well paſs by that <hi>evil</hi> Spirit of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without the following Remark. <q>It is an abominable Evil in the Sight of the LORD, CHRIST himſelf ſeverely reprehended it, and cautioned to beware thereof; his <hi>holy</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle called it <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the <hi>former</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets cried out againſt it; as did in like Manner that <hi>worthy</hi> Elder <hi>William Edmundſon</hi> (herein before mentioned) often warning us to beware thereof; where it takes <hi>deep</hi> Root in the Heart, it is a <hi>mercileſs devouring</hi> Spirit, not only endeavouring to <hi>devour</hi> others, but even deſtroy that <hi>Man himſelf</hi> who gives Way thereto, and very little can ſtand before it, therefore beware thereof wherever it appears.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, beſides what I have queried above, I here query in a more general Manner, Are there not ſome who were once very zealous, and ſtood againſt all thoſe Things I have mentioned, and if they had kept their Habitations in the LORD's <hi>holy</hi> Truth, might have been made ſerviceable Inſtruments in his Hand; and as <hi>bright</hi> Stars in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of his Power, and have joined <hi>Hand in Hand,</hi> and put <hi>Shoulder to Shoulder,</hi> in helping the <hi>Faithful</hi> to keep out thoſe Things; and by which Means I am
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008008_0016_102DCBDA5E7E6198"/>
perſuaded they would in great Meaſure have been kept out. I ſay, Is there not ſome of thoſe (tho' I hope not many) that now of late Years have been <hi>faulty</hi> in ſome of thoſe Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others who have ſtood <hi>eaſy,</hi> and <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi> in Mind, while they have ſeen and beheld ſome that were going into them, and inſtead of helping the zealous and upright in Heart, have rather <hi>clogged</hi> and <hi>weakened</hi> their Hands, by <hi>openly</hi> or <hi>ſecretly</hi> abetting the Cauſe of the wrong Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the Diſorderly, ſo far as they were able, and thereby have ſometimes fended off the Stroke of Juſtice and Judgment, in the Way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline (and hindered the Line thereof) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtretched over ſuch <hi>in due Time,</hi> according to the Nature of their Offences: <hi>For if right Times be not obſerved, right Services may be loſt.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if true Diſcipline had been duly and rightly executed, it might probably have tended to the <hi>Good of ſuch Offenders themſelves;</hi> as well as the <hi>Dettering others</hi> from following their Steps; but, above all, it would have kept up, and eſtabliſhed good Order and Diſcipline in its right Line in the Church of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The Breaking or Obſtructing this right Line of Diſcipline has (I fear) produced a <hi>partial</hi> conniving amongſt ſome; for have not the <hi>Eaſy, Luke-warm,</hi> and <hi>Indifferent</hi> (who have loſt their firſt Love) daubed with <hi>untempered</hi> Mortar, while they have endeavoured to ſkreen and defend the <hi>Covetous,</hi> and <hi>Troublers</hi> of the Church? And, on the other Hand, have not ſuch joined with the <hi>luke-warm</hi> Daubers, when they have been juſtly found Fault withal, and then
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008008_0017_102DCBDCEC941FE8"/>
both Sorts have been eaſy with the <hi>High, Proud</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> who alſo in <hi>their Turn</hi> (as they had Opportunity) defended the reſt; and thus they have ſtrengthened one another, contrary to that <hi>moſt ſolemn</hi> Charge which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in Relation to the Management of the Church Affairs, <hi>viz. I charge thee</hi> (ſays he) <hi>before</hi> GOD, <hi>and the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and the elect Angels, that thou obſerve theſe Things, without preferring one before another, doing nothing by Partiality,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 21. Such as theſe are Men for GOD, and <hi>right</hi> Judges for Him. They cannot ſwerve or be <hi>partial</hi> to any Party, Perſon, or even neareſt Relations, for <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Affection,</hi> or <hi>worldly Ends;</hi> but as to thoſe who are <hi>eaſy, luke-warm, partial</hi> or <hi>cold,</hi> or ſuch that are <hi>Troublers of the Church of</hi> GOD, and who <hi>once knew better Things,</hi> I have this in my Heart to ſay (if there be any ſuch, as I fear there are) the LORD's Controverſy is againſt them, whether they pretend to be <hi>Teachers</hi> of others, or as Elders, and he will dreadfully plead with <hi>ſuch</hi> above others, for they may not only have their <hi>own</hi> Blood to anſwer for, but alſo the Blood of others; therefore repent <hi>in Time,</hi> before it be <hi>too late.</hi> If any one ſhall think me <hi>too ſharp</hi> in what I write, I may tell them it is no pleaſing Work to me, for I do it in a Croſs to my own Will, but the Day calls for <hi>plain Dealing,</hi> and I muſt diſcharge my Conſcience.</p>
            <p>But as for you, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained your <hi>firſt</hi> Love to GOD, and have ſtood <hi>zealous</hi> for the LORD and his Truth, whether you are Miniſters or Elders, <hi>young</hi> or <hi>old,</hi> what
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008008_0018_102DCBDF6BBB0D98"/>
I write touches you not; therefore I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you will not be offended at it, for you can diſcern from what Spirit I write: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I have enumerated ſo many <hi>hurtful</hi> Things which have prevailed upon ſome that have been <hi>unwatchful,</hi> yet I hope none will mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me ſo far as that thereby I mean the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Friends, which I am far from doing; for I believe, and know, that the Lord has ſtill a <hi>faithful</hi> People in this Nation, which I hope he will preſerve to the End.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I have this in particular to ſay to you that go <hi>mourning</hi> under the Burden of thoſe Things I have mentioned, be not <hi>too</hi> much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged tho' ſome of your Brethren, that ſhould have helped you, have left you, it was ſo of old; remember that great Servant of the LORD, <hi>Moſes,</hi> how often he was brought into great Straits, by Oppoſitions he met with from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Iſrael,</hi> yet the LORD ſtood by him, and carried him through to the End. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the <hi>Prophets, Elijah, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> with others, who ſometimes thought they ſtood alone, yet the LORD ſtood by them, and likewiſe carried them through. Remember <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid to <hi>Timothy</hi> upon Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that <hi>no Man ſtood with him, and all they of</hi> Aſia <hi>turned from him,</hi> and he oftentimes met with great Oppoſition and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, yet the LORD ſtood by him, and carried him through: Theſe may be as Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Encouragements to you; therefore ſlack not your Hands, be not diſmayed becauſe of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Diſcouragements you meet withal <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.</note>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:008008_0019_102DCBE1B925E5E8"/>
ſtand your Ground, and be zealous for the LORD and his Teſtimony, and though <hi>you cannot do all you deſire, yet do all you can for him,</hi> and the LORD will ſtand by you, as he did by them formerly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> there is another Thing of great Conſequence that I have not yet mentioned, which has done abundance of Miſchief in the Church, and that is the <hi>Fondneſs</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> of many <hi>Parents</hi> to their <hi>Children,</hi> in giving them their own Way and Wills ſo long, until the Root of Evil has grown and ſpread itſelf forth into many <hi>evil</hi> Branches, and at length they have been ſo alienated from Truth and Friends, that ſome of them have run quite out. I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large abundantly upon the <hi>evil</hi> Effects of this <hi>fond</hi> Indulgence, but that I have been ſo large already on other Matters, and that we have ſo many Minutes againſt it.</p>
            <p>However I ſay, that tho' ſome godly Parents have diſcharged their Duty to their Children, which has not had the deſired Effect, yet they will be clear of their Blood; but I believe too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have not performed their Duty, by which Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect their Children have taken wrong Liberty, and fallen into hurtful Things; ſuch Parents muſt be accountable for it in the Day of the LORD.</p>
            <p>I have already ſpoken of admitting <hi>young</hi> Men into <hi>Mens</hi> Meetings, but have this to add (not as your Director) but as believing it is what Truth will lead all <hi>right ſpirited</hi> Friends into in every Quarter, <hi>viz.</hi> To be very careful not to admit of any unleſs they come under theſe following Qualifications. Firſt, They ſhould be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008008_0020_102DCBE406B28DC8"/>
               <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> in their Converſations. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſhould be <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>exemplary</hi> in their Habit, Apparel and Dreſſing, likewiſe <hi>no Tatlers.</hi> And thirdly, that ſo far as Friends can have a Senſe of their Spirits, that they will be <hi>condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to godly</hi> Elders, and not either in their Words or Spirits likely to oppoſe them, for I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in my Time, that ſome, who have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without theſe Qualifications, have in Time proved <hi>great</hi> Troublers of the Church, eſpecially if they have had <hi>fluent</hi> Tongues, which I have beheld in ſome Places (in my former Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,) <hi>to the Grief of my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Thing I may obſerve to you, that we have <hi>a great</hi> many <hi>young</hi> and <hi>middle-aged</hi> Men amongſt us, who are <hi>orderly,</hi> in their Converſations, and alſo wiſh well to the Proſperity of Truth, and yet are (as I may term it) either <hi>indolent,</hi> or too much incumbred in the Things of this World, and thereby are backward in coming up into <hi>that Service</hi> for Truth, which otherwiſe they might be capable of, were their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Senſes rightly exerciſed, but by their being <hi>ſo backward</hi> their Senſes grow (as it were) <hi>dull,</hi> for want of Uſe, and I believe it will become the Duty of <hi>godly</hi> Elders in all the Meetings where ſuch are, to <hi>ſtir</hi> them up to <hi>mind the Gift</hi> that is in them, or if Need be, even to <hi>rouſe</hi> them up to their Duties, as well for their <hi>own</hi> Good, as the <hi>Service</hi> they may have for the Truth.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>dear Friends,</hi> I am come near to as End of this very long Epiſtle, and tho' I have been <hi>thus large</hi> already, yet <hi>one</hi> Thing more, bears
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008008_0021_102DCBE6796B3418"/>
Weight upon my Mind, and I could not be <hi>eaſy</hi> without touching upon it, which if it ſhall only tend to <hi>a Caution</hi> of the Younger, my End will be anſwered; and that is relating to the <hi>cloſe Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in Familiarity with any <hi>dark oppoſite</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly</hi> Spirits; you know we have Minutes againſt it; and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was of the <hi>ſame</hi> Mind, when he adviſed to <hi>have no Company with any who obeyed not their Word, by that Epiſtle,</hi> 2 Theſ. iii. 14. 16. yet in that Caſe adviſeth not <hi>to count ſuch as an Enemy, but admoniſh him as a Brother,</hi> but poſitively commands, in the Name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, to <hi>withdraw from every Brother that walked diſorderly and not after the Tradition received of the Apoſtle,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Theſ. iii. 6. and likewiſe to <hi>have no Fellowſhip with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Works of Darkneſs, but reprove them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if any of thoſe who walk <hi>orderly,</hi> and are in Fellowſhip with Friends, do contract a very <hi>intimate and unneceſſary Familiarity</hi> with Perſons of <hi>dark</hi> or <hi>oppoſite</hi> Spirits, I believe it will have theſe following <hi>bad</hi> Effects. Firſt, It may rather ſtrengthen them in that Spirit, than help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them from their <hi>Oppoſition.</hi> Secondly, It may harden them in <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt thoſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the ſame. Thirdly, It may be of <hi>ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> and tend to the further Hurt of others, who are inclined to follow the Steps of the <hi>Unfaithful.</hi> But beyond all this, in my Time I have obſerved, that even the <hi>Orderly</hi> themſelves have been <hi>greatly</hi> hurt, at laſt ſome of them <hi>loſt</hi> thereby, for having theſe Opportunities of <hi>frequent</hi> Converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and by the <hi>continual</hi> buzzing Things againſt the <hi>Faithful,</hi> the <hi>Orderly</hi> have in length of Time
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008008_0022_102DCBE83116E8E8"/>
lent an Ear to them, whereby <hi>Surmiſes</hi> and <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies</hi> have been begotten, then <hi>Hardneſs</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> have entered; and laſtly, a <hi>joining in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with dark Spirits</hi> againſt thoſe who have nothing more in their View than the <hi>Honour</hi> of the LORD, and <hi>Good of Souls;</hi> and by this very Means (even to my own certain Knowledge) many who (at firſt) were <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>honeſt mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> were caught in this Snare in the Time of the <hi>Separation,</hi> and ſome taken in the ſame in this Nation alſo: Therefore, I hope the <hi>Orderly</hi> will obſerve our Minutes and the Advice and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Apoſtles, and if they have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as they may often) to converſe with any of the other Sort, to <hi>keep upon their Watch,</hi> and carry towards them, as to <hi>ſuch who are under Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi> for I am ſure Truth will lead thereto.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall conclude, in much brotherly Love, your dear Friend,</p>
