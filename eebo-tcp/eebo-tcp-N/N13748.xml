         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FEW characters among the nobility of this age and nation are better known than that of the late ingenious and witty EARL of CHESTERFIELD; who was alike diſtinguiſhed in the polite, the political, and the learned circles. With a great portion of good ſenſe, he poſſeſſed a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mankind; he was a complete gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and a delightful companion. Bleſt with ſuch rare talents and amiable qualities, no man ſurely was ever more happily quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to aſſume the PRECEPTOR, and to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION.</p>
            <p>In this character, however, it is more than probable his Lordſhip would never have appeared, had he not, luckily for poſterity, had a NATURAL SON, (by one MADAME DU BOUCHET, a French Lady), whom he loved, and cheriſhed, with all the fondneſs of a father, and whoſe education was for many years the chief engagement of his life.</p>
            <p>The following ſheets contain his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's ADVICE to that SON, whom he meant to form, what he was himſelf, an all-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed man; and in which the Reader is preſented with a ſelection of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's moſt beautiful thoughts on various ſubjects; his judicious Remarks on MEN and MANNERS, and uſeful Obſervations to form the MAN of VIRTUE, TASTE, and FASHION.</p>

               <head>ABSENCE OF MIND.</head>
               <p>AN abſent Man is generally either a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak, or a very affected man; he is, however, a very diſagreeable man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He is defective in all the common of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of civility; he does not enter into the general converſation, but breaks into it from time to time, with ſome ſtarts of his own, as if he waked from a dream. He ſeems wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in thought, and poſſibly does not think at all: he does not know his moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance by ſight, or anſwers them
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017372_0009_0FA110C00A2AFF30"/>as if he were at croſs purpoſes. He leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, and would probably leave his ſhoes in a third, if his buckles though awry, did not ſave them. This is a ſure indication, either of a mind ſo weak that it cannot bear above one object at a time; or ſo affected, that it would be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be wholly ingroſſed, by ſome very great and important objects. Sir Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Mr. Locke, and perhaps five or ſix more ſince the creation, may have had a right to abſence, from the intenſe thought their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigations required.</p>
               <p>No man is, in any degree, fit for either buſineſs or converſation, who does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his attention to the preſent object he what it will. When I ſee a man abſent in mind, I chooſe to be abſent in body; for it is almoſt impoſſible for me to ſtay in the room, as I cannot ſtand inattention and awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>I would rather be in company with a dead man, than with an abſent one; for if the dead man affords me no pleaſure at leaſt he ſhows me no contempt; whereas the abſent man very plainly, though ſilently, tells me that he does not think me worth his attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides, an abſent man can never make any obſervations upon the characters, cuſtoms and manners of the company. He may be in the beſt companies all his life-time, (if
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017372_0010_0FA110C10B2EC718"/>they will admit him) and never become the wiſer: we may as well converſe with a deaf man, as an abſent man. It is indeed a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical blunder to addreſs ourſelves to a man, who we plainly perceive neither hears, minds, nor underſtands us.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>ATTENTION.</head>
               <p>A MAN is fit for neither buſineſs nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, who either cannot, or does not, command and direct his attention to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent object, and in ſome degree, baniſh, for that time, all other objects from his thoughts. If at a ball, a ſupper, or a party of pleaſure, a man were to be ſolving, in his own mind, a problem in Euclid, he would be a very bad companion, and make a poor figure in that company; or if, in ſtudying a problem in his cloſet, he were to think of a minuet, I am apt to believe that he would make a very poor mathematician.</p>
               <p>There is time enough for every thing, in the courſe of the day, if you do but one thing at once; but there is not time enough in the year, if you will do two things at a time.</p>
               <p>This ſteady and undiſſipated attention to one object is a ſure mark of a ſuperior geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017372_0011_0FA110C185459048"/>as hurry, buſtle and agitation, are the never-failing ſymptoms of a weak and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous mind.</p>
               <p>Indeed, without attention nothing is to be done: want of attention, which is really want of thought, is either folly or madneſs. You ſhould not only have attention to every thing, but a quickneſs of attention, ſo as to obſerve at once, all the people in the room; their motions, their looks, and their words; and yet without ſtaring at them, and ſeeming to be an obſerver. This quick and unobſerved obſervation is of infinite advantage in life, and is to be acquired with care; and, on the contrary, what is called abſence, which is a thoughtleſſneſs and want of attention about what is doing, makes a man ſo like either a fool or a madman, that, for my part, I ſee no real difference. A fool never has thought; a madman has loft it; and an abſent man is, for the time, without it.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the moſt material knowledge of all, I mean the knowledge of the world, is never to be acquired without great attention; and I know many old people, who, though they have lived long in the world, are but children ſtill as to the knowledge of it, from their levity, and inattention. Certain forms, which all people comply with, and certain arts, which all people aim at, hide, in ſome degree, the truth, and give a general exterior
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017372_0012_0FA110C6194256D0"/>reſemblence to almoſt every body. Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſagacity muſt ſee thro' that veil, and diſcover the natural character.</p>

If we were to laugh at a man for his averſion to a cat or cheeſe (which are common antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,) or by inattention or negligence, to let them come in his way where we could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; he would in the firſt caſe, think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſulted; and in the ſecond ſlighted; and would remember both. But, on the other hand, our care to procure for him what he likes, and to remove from him what he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017372_0013_0FA110C7C60B93B0"/>ſhews him that he is at leaſt an object of our attention, flatters his vanity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps makes him more your friend, than a more important ſervice would have done. The more trifling theſe things are, the more they prove your attention for the perſon, and are conſequently the more engaging. Conſult your own breaſt, and recollect how theſe little attentions, when ſhewn you by others, flatter that degree of ſelf-love and vanity from which no man living is free. Reflect how they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and attract you to that perſon, and how you are propitiated afterwards to all which that perſon ſays or does. The ſame cauſes will have the ſame effects in your favour.</p>

               <head>AWKWARDNESS OF DIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERENT KINDS.</head>
               <p>MANY very worthy and ſenſible peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have certain odd tricks, ill habits, and awkwardneſs in their behaviour, which excite a diſguſt to and diſlike of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that cannot be removed or overcome by any other valuable endowment or merit which they may poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>Now, awkwardneſs can proceed but from too cauſes; either from not having kept good company, or from not having attended to it.</p>
               <p>When an awkward fellow firſt comes into
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017372_0014_0FA110C91A812FD0"/>a room, it is highly probable, that his ſword gets between his legs, and throws him down, or makes him ſtumble, at leaſt; when he has recovered this accident, he goes and places him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the very place of the whole room where he ſhould not; there he ſoon lets his hat fall down, and, in taking it up again, throws down his cane; in recovering his cane, his hat falls a ſecond time: ſo that he is a quarter of an hour before he is in order again. If he drinks tea or coffee, he certainly ſcalds his mouth, and lets either the cup or the ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer fall, and ſpills the tea or coffee in his breeches. At dinner, his awkwardneſs diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes itſelf particularly, as he has more to do: there be holds his knife, fork and ſpoon, differently from other people; eats with his knife to the great danger of his mouth, picks his teeth with his fork, and puts his ſpoon, which has been in his throat twenty times, into the diſhes again. If he is to carve, can never hit the joint; but in his vain efforts to cut through the bone, ſcatters the ſauce in every body's face. He generally daubs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſoup and greaſe, though his napkin is commonly ſtuck through a button hole, and tickles his chin. When he drinks, he infallibly coughs in his glaſs, and beſprinkles the company. Beſides all this he has ſtrange tricks and geſtures; ſuch as ſnuffing up his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017372_0015_0FA110C9D510D280"/>noſe, or blowing it, and looking afterwards in his handkerchief, ſo as to make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſick. His hands are troubleſome to him when he has not ſomething in them, and he does not know where to put them: but they are in perpetual motion between his boſom and his breeches: he does not wear his clothes, and in ſhort, does nothing like other people. All this, I own, is not in any degree criminal; but it is highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable and ridiculous in company, and ought moſt carefully to be avoided by who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſires to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>From this account of what you ſhould not do, you may eaſily judge what you ſhould do, and a due attention to the manners of people of faſhion, and who have ſeen the world, will make it habitual and familiar to you.</p>
               <p>There is, likewiſe, an awkwardneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and words moſt carefull to be avoided; ſuch as falſe Engli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, old ſayings, and common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs; which are ſo many pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fs of having kept bad and low company. For example: if, inſtead of ſaying that <q>taſtes are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and that every man has his own peculiar one,</q> you ſhould let off a proverb, and ſay, that <q>what is one man's meat is another man's porion:</q> or elſe, <q>every one as they like, as the good man ſaid when he kiſſed his cow,</q> every body
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017372_0016_0FA110CA87EC9C38"/>would be perſuaded that you had never kept company with any body above footmen and houſe maids.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe an awkwardneſs of the mind, that ought to be, and with care may be, avoided: as for inſtance: to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To call people by improper titles and appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations is ſo too; as my Lord, for Sir; and Sir, for my Lord. To begin a ſtory or a narration when you are not perfect in it, and cannot go through with it, but are forced, poſſibly to ſay, in the middle of it, "I have forgot the reſt," is very unpleaſant and bungling. One muſt be extremely exact, clear, and perſpicuous in every thing one ſays; otherwiſe, inſtead of entertaining or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming others, one only tires and puzzles them.</p>

               <head>BASHFULNESS.</head>
               <p>BASHFULNESS is the diſtinguiſhing character of an Engliſh booby, who appears freightened out of his wits if people of faſhion ſpeak to him, and bluſhes and ſtammers without being able to give a proper
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017372_0017_0FA110CB47522928"/>anſwer; by which means he becomes truly ridiculous from the groundleſs fear of being laughed at.</p>
               <p>There is a very material difference between modeſty and awkward baſhfulneſs, which is as ridiculous as true modeſty is commendable: it is as abſurd to be a ſimpleton as to be an impudent fellow; and we make ourſelves contemptible, if we cannot come into a room and ſpeak to people without being out of countenance, or without embarraſſment. A man who is really diffident, timid, and baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, be his merit what it will, never can puſh himſelf in the world, his deſpondency throws him into inaction, and the forward, the buſtling, and the petulent will always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede him. The manner makes the whole difference. What would be impudence in one man, is only a proper and decent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in another. A man of ſenſe, and of knowledge of the world, will aſſert his own rights, and purſue his own objects as ſteadily and intrepidly as the moſt impudent man living, and commonly more ſo; but then he has art enough to give an outward air of modeſty to all he does. This engages and prevails, whilſt the very ſame things ſhock and fail, from the over-bearing or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent manner only of doing them.</p>
               <p>Engliſhmen, in general, are aſhamed of going into company, when we avoid ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017372_0018_0FA110CC1C948B28"/>what ſhould we be aſhamed of? And why ſhould not we go into a mixed company, with as much eaſe, and as little concern, as we would go into our own room? Vice and ignorance are the only things we ought to be aſhamed of: while we keep clear of them, we may venture any where without fear or concern. Nothing ſinks a young man into low company ſo ſurely as baſhfulneſs. If he thinks that he ſhall not, he moſt ſurely will not pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Some, indeed, from feeling the pain and inconveniencies of Baſhfulneſs, have ruſhed into the other extreme, and turned impudent, as cowards ſometimes grow deſperate from exceſs of danger: but this is equally to be avoided, there being nothing more generally ſhocking than impudence. The medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two extremes points out the well-bred man, who always feels himſelf firm and eaſy in all companies: who is modeſt without being baſhful, and ſteady without being impudent.</p>
               <p>A mean fellow is aſhamed and embarraſſed when he comes into company, is diſconcerted when ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017372_0019_0FA110CCC593EEC8"/>ſuperior rank; he pays all the reſpect that is due to it, without being diſconcerted: and can converſe as eaſily with a king as with any one of his ſubjects. This is the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being introduced young into good company, and of converſing with our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. A well bred man will converſe with his inferiors without inſolence, and with his ſuperiors with reſpect, and with eaſe. Add to this, that a man of a gentleman-like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, though of inferior parts, is better received than a man of ſuperior abilities, who is unacquainted with the world. Modeſty, and a polite, eaſy aſſurance, ſhould be united.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017372_0021_0FA110D182884508"/>wits and poets, is very inviting to young men, who are pleaſed with it if they have wit themſelves; and if they have none, are fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly proud of being one of it. But ſuch companies ſhould be frequented with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgment. A wit is a very unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular denomination, as it carries terror along with it; and people are as much afraid of a wit in company, as a woman is of a gun, which ſhe ſuppoſes may go off of itſelf, and do her a miſchief. Their acquaintance, however, is worth ſeeking, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany worth frequenting; but not excluſively of others, nor to ſuch a degree as to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only of one of that particular ſett.</p>
               <p>Above all things, endeavour to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with people above you; for there you riſe, as much as you ſink with people below. When I ſay company above you, I do not mean with regard to their birth; but with regard to their merit, and the light in which the world conſiders them.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of good company; one, which is called BEAU MONDE, and conſiſts of thoſe people which have the lead in courts, and in the gay part of life; the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of thoſe who are diſtinguiſhed by ſome particular merit, or who excel in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and valuable arts or ſcience.</p>
               <p>Be equally careful to avoid that low com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which, in every ſenſe of the word, is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017372_0022_0FA110D21A1F7448"/>low indeed; low in rank, low in its parts, low in manners, and low in merit. Vanity, that ſource of many of our follies, and of ſome of our crimes, has ſunk many a man into company in every light infinitely below him, for the ſake of being the firſt man in it. There he dictates, is applauded, and admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having thus pointed out what company you ſhould avoid, and what company you ſhould aſſociate with, I ſhall next lay down a few
<lb/>RULES FOR BEHAVIOUR IN COMPANY.</p>
               <p>When a young man, new in the world, firſt gets into company, he determines to conform to and imitate it. But he too often miſtakes the object of his imitation. He has frequently heard the abſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m of genteel and faſhionable vices. He there obſerves ſome people who ſhine and who in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are admired and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſteemed; and perceives that theſe people are rakes, drunkards, or gameſters; he therefore adopts their vices, miſtaking their defects for their perfections, and imagining that they owe their faſhion and their luſtre to theſe g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el vice. But it is exactly the reverſe; for theſe people have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the reputation by their parts, their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017372_0023_0FA110D2CD4D9038"/>their good breeding, and other real ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments; and are only blemiſhed and lowered in the opinions of all reaſonable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by theſe general and faſhionable vices. It is therefore plain, that in theſe mixed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, the good part only makes people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give but not approve the bad.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhould unfortunately have any vices, he ought at leaſt to be content with his own, and not adopt other people's. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of vice has ruined ten times more young men than natural inclinations.</p>
               <p>Let us imitate the real perfections of the good company into which we may get; copy their politeneſs, their carriage, their addreſs, and the eaſy and well-bred turn of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; but we ſhould remember, that, let them ſhine ever ſo bright, their vices, if they have any, are ſo many blemiſhes, which we would no more endeavour to imitate, than we would make artificial warts upon our faces becauſe ſome very handſome man had the misfortune to have a natural one upon his. We ſhould, on the contrary, think how much handſomer he would have been without it.</p>
               <p>Having thus given you inſtructions for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you well received in good company, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed next to lay before you, the polite.</p>

                  <p>Never, in converſation attack whole bodies of any kind, for you may thereby unneceſſarily make yourſelf a great number of enemies. Among women, as among men, there are good as well as bad, and it may be, full as many or more good than among men. This rule holds as to lawyers, ſoldiers, parſons, courtiers, citizens, &amp;c.

Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als forgive ſometimes, but bodies and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties never do.

The former buys whatever he does not want, and does not pay for what he does want. He cannot withſtand the charms of a toy-ſhop; ſnuff-boxes, watches, heads of canes, &amp;c. are his deſtruction.

               <p>YOUNG perſons have commonly an unguarded frankneſs about them, which makes them the eaſy prey and bubbles of the artful and the experienced: they look upon every knave, or fool, who tells them that he is their friend, to be really ſo; and pay that profeſſion of ſimulated friendſhip with an indiſcreet and unbounded confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, always to their loſs, often to their ruin.

Do not ſuppoſe that people become friends at firſt ſight, or even upon a ſhort acquaintance.

               <p>There is another kind of nominal friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among young people, which is warm for the time, but luckily of ſhort duration. This friendſhip is haſtily produced, by their being accidentally thrown together, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the ſame courſe of riot and debauchery. A fine friendſhip, truly! and well cemented with drunkenneſs and lewdneſs. It ſhould rather be called a conſpiracy againſt morals and good manners, and be puniſhed as ſuch by the civil magiſtrate.

               <head>GOOD-BREEDING.</head>
               <p>GOOD-BREEDING has been very juſtly defined to be <q>the reſult of much good ſenſe, ſome good-nature, and a little ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial for the ſake of others, and with a view to obtain the ſame indulgence from them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Good-breeding alone can prepoſſeſs people in our favour at firſt ſight; more time being neceſſary to diſcover greater talents. Good-breeding, however, does not conſiſt in low bows, and formal ceremony, but in an eaſy, civil, and reſpectable behaviour.</p>
               <p>Indeed, good ſenſe, in many caſes, muſt determine good-breeding; for what would be civil at one time, and to one perſon, would be rude at another time, and to another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: there are, however, ſome general rules of good-breeding. As for example: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer only yes, or no, to any perſon, without adding Sir, My Lord, or Madam (as it may happen) is always extremely rude; and it is
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017372_0043_0FA110E995AB6CA0"/>equally ſo not to give proper attention and a civil anſwer, when ſpoken to: ſuch behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our convinces the perſon who is ſpeaking to us, that we deſpiſe him, and do not think him worthy of our attention, or an anſwer.</p>
               <p>A well-bred perſon will take care to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with complaiſance when he is ſpoken to; will place himſelf at the lower end of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs bid to go higher; will firſt drink to the lady of the houſe, and then to the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he will not eat awkwardly or dirtily, nor ſit when others ſtand; and he will do all this with an air of complaiſance, and not with a grave ill-natured look, as if he did it all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more difficult to attain, or ſo neceſſary to poſſeſs, as perfect good-breeding; which is equally inconſiſtent with a ſtiff formality, an impertinent forwardneſs, and an awkward baſhfulneſs. A little cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is ſometimes neceſſary, a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of firmneſs is abſolutely ſo: and an awkward modeſty is extremely becoming.</p>
               <p>Virtue and learning, like gold, have their intrinſic value; but if they are not poliſhed, they certainly loſe a great deal of their luſtre: and even poliſhed braſs will paſs upon more people than rough gold. What a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fins does the chearful, eaſy, good-breeding of the French frequently cover!</p>
               <p>My Lord Bacon ſays, <q>That a pleaſing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017372_0044_0FA110EB66002A28"/>figure is a perpetual letter of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> It is certainly an agreeable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of merit, and ſmooths the way for it.</p>
               <p>A man of good-breeding ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the forms and particular cuſtoms of Courts. At Vienna, men always make curtſies inſtead of bows, to the Emperor; in France, nobody bows to the King, or kiſſes his hand; but, in Spain and England, bows are made, and hands are kiſſed. Thus every Court has ſome peculiarity, which thoſe who viſit them ought previouſly to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of, to avoid blunders and awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>Very few, ſcarcely any, are wanting in the reſpect which they ſhould ſhow to thoſe whom they acknowledge to be infinitely their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. The man of faſhion, and of the world, expreſſes it in its fulleſt extent; but naturally eaſily, and without concern: whereas a man, who is not uſed to keep-good company, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it awkwardly: one ſees that he is not uſed to, and that it coſts him a great deal: but I never ſaw the worſt-bred man living, guilty of lolling, whiſtling, ſcratching his head, and ſuch-like indecencies, in company that he reſpected. In ſuch companies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the only point to be attended to is, to ſhow that reſpect, which every body means to ſhow, in an eaſy, unembarraſſed, and graceful manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:017372_0045_0FA110EC05BC8568"/>
In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part of them, is, for the time at leaſt, ſuppoſed to be upon a footing of equality with the reſt; and, conſequently, every one claims, and very juſtly, every mark of civility and good-breeding. Eaſe is allowed, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs and negligence are ſtrictly forbidden. If a man accoſts you, and talks to you ever ſo dully or frivolouſly; it is worſe than rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is brutality, to ſhow him, by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt inattention to what he ſays, that you think him a fool or a blockhead, and not worth hearing. It is much more ſo with regard to women; who, of whatever rank they are, are entitled, in conſideration of their ſex, not only to an attentive, but an officious good-breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, diſlikes, preferences, antipathies, fancies, whims, and even impertinencies, muſt be officiouſly attended to, flattered, and, if poſſible, gueſſed at and anticipated, by a well-bred man. You muſt never uſurp to yourſelf thoſe conveniencies and <hi>agremens</hi> which are of common right: ſuch as the beſt places, the beſt diſhes, &amp;c. but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, always decline them yourſelf, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you; ſo that, upon the whole you will, in your turn, enjoy your ſhare of common right.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of good-breeding is local,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017372_0046_0FA110F14FB81410"/>and is variouſly modified, in not only differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent countries, but in different towns of the ſame country. But it muſt be founded upon the two former ſorts; they are the matter; to which, in this caſe, Faſhion and Cuſtom only give the different ſhapes and impreſſions. Whoever has the two firſt ſorts, will eaſily acquire this third ſort of good-breeding, which depends ſingly upon attention and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. It is properly the poliſh, the luſtre, the laſt finiſhing ſtrokes of good-breeding. A man of ſenſe therefore carefully attends to the local manners of the reſpective places where he is, and takes for his models thoſe perſons whom he obſerves to be at the head of the faſhion and good-breeding. He watches how they addreſs themſelves to their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, how they accoſt their equals, and how they treat their inferiors; and lets none of thoſe little niceties eſcape him; which are to good-breeding, what the laſt delicate and maſterly touches are to a good picture: and which the vulgar have no notion of, but by which good judges diſtinguiſh the maſter. He attends even to their air, dreſs and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and imitates them liberally, and not ſervilely; he copies, but does not mimic. Theſe perſonal graces are of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. They anticipate the ſentiments, before merit engage the underſtanding; they
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017372_0047_0FA110F59BAA32F8"/>captivate the heart and give riſe, I believe, to the extravagant notions of Charms and Philters. Their effects were ſo ſurpriſing, that they were reckoned ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, as it is neceſſary to poſſeſs learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, honour, and virtue, to gain the eſteem and admiration of mankind, ſo politeneſs and good-breeding are equally neceſſary to render us agreeable in converſation, and common life. Great talents are above the generality of the world; who neither poſſeſs them themſelves, nor are competent judges of them in others: but all are judges of the leſſer talents, ſuch as civility, affability, and an agreeable addreſs and manner; becauſe they feel the good effects of them, as making ſociety eaſy and agreeable.</p>
               <p>To conclude; be aſſured that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt learning, without good-breeding, is unwelcome and tireſome pedantry, that a man who is not perfectly well bred, is unfit for good-company, and unwelcome in it; and that a man, who is not well-bred, is full as unfit for buſineſs as for company.</p>
               <p>Make, then, good breeding, the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your thoughts and actions. Obſerve carefully the behaviour and manners of thoſe who are diſtinguiſhed by their good-breeding; imitate, nay endeavour to excel that you may at leaſt reach them, and be convinced that good-beeding is, to all worldly qualifications,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017372_0048_0FA110F615FF9F50"/>what charity is to all chriſtian virtues. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how it adorns merit, and how often it covers the want of it.</p>

                  <p>THE deſire of pleaſing is at leaſt half the art of doing it; the reſt depends only upon the manner, which attention, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and frequenting good company, will teach. Thoſe who are lazy, careleſs, and indifferent whether they pleaſe or not, we may depend upon it, will never pleaſe. The art of pleaſing is a very neceſſary one to poſſeſs: but a very difficult one to acquire. To do as one would be done by, is the ſureſt method of pleaſing. Obſerve carefully what pleaſes us in others, and probably the ſame things in us will pleaſe others. If we are pleaſed with complaiſance and attention of others to our humours, or taſtes, or our weakneſſes; the ſame complaiſance and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on our parts to theirs, will equally pleaſe them. Let us be ſerious, gay, or even trifling, as we find the preſent humour of the company: this is an attention due from every individual to the majority. The art of pleaſing cannot be reduced to a receipt;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017372_0049_0FA110F6C62034F0"/>if it could, that receipt would be worth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing at any price. Good ſenſe and good nature are the principal ingredients; and our own obſervation, and the good advice of others, muſt give the right colour and taſte to it.</p>
                  <p>The graces of the perſon, the countenance, and the way of ſpeaking, are eſſential things; the very ſame thing, ſaid by a genteel perſon, in an engaging way, and gracefully and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly ſpoken, would pleaſe: which would ſhock if muttered out by an awkward figure, with a ſullen ſerious countenance. The Poets repreſent Venus as attended by the three Graces, to intimate, that even beauty will not do without. Minerva ought to have three alſo; for, without them, learning has few attractions.</p>
                  <p>If we examine ourſelves ſeriouſly, why particular people pleaſe and engage us, more than others of equal merit; we ſhall always find that it is becauſe the former have the graces, and the latter not. I have known many a woman, with an exact ſhape, and a ſymetrical aſſemblage of beautiful features, pleaſe nobody; while others, with very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſhapes and features have charmed every body. It is certain that Venus will not charm ſo much without her attendant Graces, as they will without her. Among men, how often has the moſt ſolid merit been neglected, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017372_0050_0FA10E4F5B160948"/>or even rejected for want of them? while flimſy parts, little knowledge, and leſs merit, introduced by the Graces, have been received, cheriſhed, and admired.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now to inveſtigate what theſe Graces are, and to give ſome inſtruction for acquiring them.</p>

                  <p>Dreſs is one of the various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients that contribute to the art of pleaſing, and therefore an object of ſome attention; for we cannot help forming ſome opinion of a man's ſenſe and character from his dreſs. All af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation in dreſs, implies a flaw in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Men of ſenſe carefully avoid any particular character in their dreſs; they are accurately clean for their own ſake, but all the reſt is for the ſake of other people. A man ſhould dreſs as well, and in the ſame manner, as the people of ſenſe and faſhion of the place where he is: if he dreſſes more than they, he is a fop; if he dreſſes leſs, he is unpardonably negligent: but, of the two,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017372_0056_0FA10E530CD6D5B0"/>a young fellow ſhould be rather too much than too little dreſſed; the exceſs of that ſide will wear off, with a little age and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
                  <p>The difference in dreſs between a man and a fop, is, that the fop values himſelf upon his dreſs; and the man of ſenſe laughs at it, at the ſame time that he knows that he muſt not neglect it: there are a thouſand fooliſh cuſtoms of this kind, which, as they are not criminal, muſt be complied with, and even chearfully, by men of ſenſe. Diogenes the Cynic was a wiſe man for deſpiſing them, but a fool for ſhewing it.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould not attempt to rival, or to excel a fop in dreſs, but it is neceſſary to dreſs to avoid ſingularity, and ridicule. Great care ſhould be taken to be always dreſſed like the reaſonable people of our own age in the place where we are, whoſe dreſs is never ſpoken of one way or another, as neither too negligent, or too much ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>Awkwardneſs of carriage is very alienating, and a total negligence of dreſs and air, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent inſult upon cuſtom and faſhion. Women have great influence as to a man's faſhionable character; and an awkward man will never have their votes, which are very numerous, and oftener counted than weighed.</p>
                  <p>When we are once well-dreſſed for a day, we ſhould think no more of it afterwards;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017372_0057_0FA10E53EE4C3BE0"/>and, without any ſtiffneſs for fear of diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that dreſs we ſhould be as eaſy and natural as if we had no clothes on at all.</p>
                  <p>Dancing, likewiſe, though a ſilly trifling thing, is one of thoſe eſtabliſhed follies which people of ſenſe are ſometimes obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to; and if they do, they ſhould be able to perform it well.</p>
                  <p>In dancing, the motion of the arms ſhould be particularly attended to, as theſe decide a man's being genteel or otherwiſe, more than any other part of the body. A twiſt or ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the wriſt will make a man look awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If a man dances well from the waiſt upwards, wears his hat well, and moves his head properly, he dances well. Coming into a room, and preſenting yourſelf to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould be alſo attended to, as this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gives the firſt impreſſion, which is often indelible.

I do not deſire you to write a ſtiff formal hand, like that of a ſchool-maſter, but a genteel, legible and liberal character, and to be able to write quick.

                  <p>Vulgariſm in language is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain characteriſtic of bad company, and a bad education. Proverbial expeſſions, and trite ſayings, are the flowers of the rhetoric of a vulgar man. Would he ſay, that men differ in their taſtes; he both ſupports and adorns that opinion, by the good old ſaying, as he reſpectfully calls it, "What is one man's meat, is another man's poiſon." If any body attempts being <hi>ſmart,</hi> as he calls it, upon him, he gives them <hi>tit for tat,</hi> aye, that he does.

                  <p>Humming a tune within ourſelves, drumming with our ſingers, making a noiſe with your feet, and ſuch awkward habits being all breaches of good manners, are therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of our contempt for the perſons preſent, and conſequently ſhould not be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
                  <p>Lating very quick, or very ſlow, is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of vulgarity; the former infers poverty; the latter, if abroad, that you are diſguſted with your entertainment; and if at home, that you are rude enough to give your friends what you cannot eat yourſelf. Eating ſoup with your noſe in the plate, is alſo vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. So likewiſe is ſmelling to the meat while on the fork, before you put it in your
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:017372_0066_0FA10E5F45226460"/>mouth. If you diſlike what is ſent upon your plate, leave it; but never by ſmelling to, or examining it, appear to tax your friend with placing unwholſome proviſions before you.</p>
                  <p>Spitting on the floor or carpet is a filthy practice, and which, were it to become ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, would render it as neceſſary to change the carpets as the table-cloths. Not to add, it will induce our acquaintance to ſuppoſe that we have not been uſed to genteel furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for which reaſon alone, if for no other, a man of liberal education ſhould avoid it.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this article: Never walk faſt in the ſtreets, which is a mark of vulgarity, ill-befitting the character of a gentleman or a man of faſhion, though it may be tolerable in a tradeſman.</p>
                  <p>To ſtare any perſon full in the face, whom you may chance to meet, is an act alſo of ill-breeding; it would ſeem to beſpeak as if you ſaw ſomething wonderful in his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and is therefore a tacit reprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>Keep yourſelf free, likewiſe, from all odd tricks or habits; ſuch as ſcratching yourſelf, putting your fingers to your mouth, noſe, and ears, thruſting out your tongue, ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping your fingers, biting your nails, rubbing your hands, ſighing aloud, an affected ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your body, gaping, and many others,

               <p>WE ſhould endeavour to hoard up, while we are young, a great ſtock of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for though during that time of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, we may not have occaſion to ſpend much of it, yet a time will come when we ſhall want it to maintain us.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of the world is only to be acquired in the world, and not in a cloſet. Books alone will never teach it you; but they will ſuggeſt many things to your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which might otherwiſe eſcape you; and your own obſervations upon mankind, when compared with thoſe which you will find in books, will help you to fix the true point.</p>
               <p>To know mankind well, requires full as much attention and application as to know books, and, it may be, more ſagacity and diſcernment. I am, at this time, acquainted with many elderly people, who have all paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their whole lives in the great world, but with ſuch levity and inattention, that they know no more of it now than they did at fifteen. Do not flatter yourſelf, therefore, with the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:017372_0068_0FA10E60876E2920"/>thoughts that you can acquire this knowledge in the frivolous chit-chat of idle companies; no, you muſt go much deeper than that. You muſt look into people, as well as at them. Search therefore, with the greateſt care, into the characters of all thoſe whom you converſe with; endeavour to diſcover their predominant paſſions, their prevailing weakneſſes, their vanities, their follies, and their humours; with all the right and wrong, wiſe and ſilly ſprings of human actions, which make ſuch inconſiſtent and whimſical beings of us rational creatures.</p>
               <p>There are no perſons ſo inſignificant and inconſiderable, but may, ſome time or other, and in ſome thing or other, have it in their power to be of uſe to you; which they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will not, if you have once ſhown them contempt. Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt never is. Our pride remembers it forever. Remember therefore, moſt carefully to conceal your contempt, however juſt, wherever you would not make an implacable enemy. Men are much more unwilling to have their weakneſſes and their imperfections known, than their crimes; and if you hint to a man that you think him filly, ignorant, or even ill-bred or awkward, he will hate you more, and longer than if you tell him, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that you think him a rogue.</p>

Good-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and good-nature incline us rather to raiſe people up to ourſelves, than to mortify and depreſs them. Beſides, it is making ourſelves ſo many friends, inſtead of ſo many enemies. A conſtant attention to pleaſe, is a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ingredient in the art of pleaſing; it flatters the ſelf-love of thoſe to whom it is ſhewn; it engages and captivates, more than things of much greater importance. Every man is, in ſome meaſure, obliged to diſcharge the ſocial duties of life; but theſe attentions are voluntary acts, the free-will offerings of good-breeding and good-nature: they are received, remembered, and returned as ſuch. Women in particular, have a right to them; and any omiſſion, in that reſpect, is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ill-breeding.</p>
               <p>We ſhould never yield to that temptation, which to moſt young men is very ſtrong, of expoſing other people's weakneſſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, for the ſake either of diverting the company, or of ſhewing our own ſuperiority.

               <p>There are many inoffenſive arts which are neceſſary in the courſe of the world, and which he who practiſes the earlieſt, will pleaſe the moſt, and riſe the ſooneſt.

In any point, which prudence bids you purſue and which a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt utility attends, let difficulties only ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate your induſtry, not deter you from the purſuit. If one way has failed, try another; be active, perſevere, and you will conquer. Some people are to be reaſoned, ſome flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:017372_0072_0FA10ECE04C2AC78"/>ſome intimidated, and ſome teazed into a thing; but, in general, all are to be brought into it at laſt, if ſkilfully applied to, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed, and indefatigably attacked in their ſeveral weak places.

               <p>In order to judge of the inſide of others, ſtudy your own, for men in general are very much alike, and though one has one prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſion, and another has another, yet their operations are much the ſame: and whatever engages or diſguſts, pleaſes or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For inſtance Do you find yourſelf hurt and mortified, when another makes you feel his ſuperiority, and your own inferiority, in knowledge, parts, rank, or fortune? you will certainly take great care not to make a perſon, whoſe good

If diſagreeable inſinuations, ſly ſneers, or repeated contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, teaze and irritate you, would you uſe them where you wiſhed to engage and pleaſe? Surely not: and I hope you wiſh to engage and pleaſe, almoſt univerſally. The temptation of ſaying a ſmart and witty thing, or <hi>bon mot,</hi> and the malicious applauſe with which it is commonly received, have made people who can ſay them, and ſtill oftener, people who think they can, but cannot, and yet try, more enemies, and implacable ones too, than any one other thing that I know of. When ſuch things then, ſhall happen to be ſaid at your expence, (a ſometimes they certainly will) reflect ſeriouſly upon the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of uneaſineſs, anger, and reſentment, which they excite in you; and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be prudent, by the ſame means, to excite the ſame ſentiments in others againſt you. It is a decided folly to loſe a friend for a jeſt; but, in my mind, it is not a much leſs degree of folly to make an enemy of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and neutral perſon, for the ſake of a <hi>bon mot.</hi>—When things of this kind happen to be ſaid of you, the moſt prudent way is to ſeem not to ſuppoſe that they are meant at you, but to diſſemble and conceal whatever degree of anger you may feel inwardly; and, ſhould
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:017372_0074_0FA10ED482EEEA60"/>they be ſo plain that you cannot be ſuppoſed ignorant of their meaning, to join in the laugh of the company againſt yourſelf; acknowledge the hit to be a fair one, and the jeſt a good one, and play off the whole thing in ſeeming good humour; but by no means reply in the ſame way; which only ſhows that you are hurt, and publiſhes the victory which you might have concealed. Should the thing ſaid, indeed, injure your honour or moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, remember there are but two alternatives for a gentleman and a man of parts—extreme politeneſs, or a duel.</p>
               <p>If a man notoriouſly and deſignedly inſults and affronts you, knock him down; but if he only injures you, your beſt revenge is to be extremely civil to him in your outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, though at the ſame time you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwork him, and return him the compliment, perhaps with intereſt. This is not perfidy nor diſſimulation; it would be ſo if you were at the ſame time to make profeſſions of eſteem and friendſhip to this man; which I by no means recommend, but, on the contrary, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor. All acts of civility are, by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, underſtood to be no more than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to cuſtom, for the quiet and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of ſociety, the <hi>agremens</hi> of which are not to be diſturbed by private diſlikes and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. Only women and little minds pout and ſpar for the entertainment of the company,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:017372_0075_0FA10ED60433C288"/>that always laughs at, and never pities them. For my own part, though I would by no means give up any point to a competitor, yet I would pique myſelf upon ſhowing him rather more civility than to another man. In the firſt place, this behaviour infallibly makes all the laughers of your ſide, which is a conſiderable party; and in the next place, it certainly pleaſes the object of the competition, be it either man or woman; who never fail to ſay, upon ſuch an occaſion, that <q>they muſt own you have behaved yourſelf very handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the whole affair.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, let this be one invariable rule of your conduct: Never to ſhow the leaſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of reſentment, which you cannot to a certain degree, gratify; but always to ſmile where you cannot ſtrike.

A man's general character may be that of the honeſteſt man of the world: do not diſpute it; you might be thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious or ill-natured: but at the ſame time, do not take this probity upon truſt, to ſuch a degree as to put your life, fortune, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in his power.

If you would particularly gain the affection and friendſhip of particular people, whether men or women, endeavour to find our their predominant excellency, if they have one, and their prevailing weakneſs, which every body has; and do juſtice to the one, and ſomething more than juſtice to the other. Men have various objects in which they may excel, or at leaſt would be thought to excel; and, though they love to hear juſtice done to them, where they know that they excel, yet they are moſt and beſt flattered upon thoſe points where they wiſh to excel, and yet are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether they do or not. As for example: Cardinal Richlieu, who was undoubtedly the ableſt ſtateſman of his time, or perhaps of any other, had the idle vanity of being thought the beſt poet too; he envied the great Corneille his reputation, and ordered a criticiſm to be written upon the CID. Thoſe therefore, who flattered ſkilfully, ſaid little to him of his abilities in ſtate affairs, or at leaſt but EN PAS SANI, and as it might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally occur. But the incenſe which they give him, the ſmoke of which, they knew would turn his head in their favour, was as a BE<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You will eaſily diſcover every man's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing vanity, by obſerving his favourite
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:017372_0078_0FA10ED7E0DEB7F8"/>topic of converſation; for every man talks moſt of what he has moſt a mind to be thought to excel in. Touch him but there, and you touch him to the quick.</p>

If her figure is deformed, her face, ſhe thinks, counterbalances it. If they are both bad, ſhe comforts herſelf, that ſhe has graces; a certain manner; IE NE SCAIS QUOI, ſtill more engaging than beauty. This truth is evident, from the ſtudied and elaborate dreſs of the uglieſt women in the world. An undoubted, unconteſted, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beauty, is, of all women, the leaſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of flattery upon that head: ſhe knows it is her due, and is therefore obliged to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body for giving it her. She muſt be flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her underſtanding; which, though ſhe may poſſibly not doubt of herſelf, yet ſhe ſuſpects that men may diſtruſt.</p>
               <p>Do not miſtake me, and think that I mean to recommend to you abject and criminal flattery: no, flatter nobody's vices or crimes: on the contrary, abhor and diſcourage them.
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:017372_0079_0FA10ED88D5B47F0"/>But there is no living in the world without a complaiſant indulgence for people's weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and innocent, though ridiculous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. If a man has a mind to be thought wiſer, and a woman handſomer, than they really are, their error is a comfortable one to themſelves, and an innocent one with regard to other people; and I would rather make them my friends, by indulging them in it, than my enemies, by endeavouring (and that to no purpoſe) to undeceive them.</p>

Pry into the receſſes of their hearts yourſelf, as far as you are able, and never implicitly adopt a character upon common fame; which though generally right as to the great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of characters, is always wrong in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>Be upon your guard againſt thoſe who, upon very ſlight acquaintance, obtrude their unaſked and unmerited friendſhip and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon you; for they probably cram you with them only for their own eating: but,

Truſt them with your love-tales, if you pleaſe; but keep your ſerious views ſecret. Truſt thoſe only to ſome tried friend, more experienced than yourſelf, and who, being in a different walk of life from you, is not likely to become your rival; for I would not adviſe you to depend ſo much upon the heroic virtue of mankind, as to hope or believe, that your competitor will ever be your friend, as to the object of that compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
               <p>A ſeaming ignorance is very often a moſt neceſſary part of worldly knowledge. It is, for inſtance, commonly adviſeable to ſeem ignorant of what people offer to tell you; and when they ſay, Have you not heard of ſuch a thing? to anſwer, No, and to let them go on, though you know it already. Some have a pleaſure in telling it, becauſe they think they tell it well; others have a pride in it, as being the ſagacious diſcoverers; and many have a vanity in ſhowing that they have been, though very undeſervedly, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: all theſe would be diſappointed, and conſequently diſpleaſed, if you ſaid, Yes. Seem always ignorant (unleſs to one moſt
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:017372_0082_0FA10EDD84D71320"/>intimate friend) of all matters of private ſcandal and defamation, though you ſhould hear them a thouſand times, for the parties affected always look upon the receiver to be almoſt as bad as the thief: and whenever they become the topic of converſation, ſeem to be a ſceptic, though you are really a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious believer; and always take the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating part. But all this ſeeming ignorance ſhould be joined to thorough and extenſive private informations: and, indeed, it is the beſt method of procuring them; for moſt people have ſuch a vanity in ſhewing a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over others, though but for a moment, and in the mereſt trifles, that they will tell you what they ſhould not, rather than no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, fiſh for facts, and take pains to be well informed of every thing that paſſes; but fiſh judiciouſly, and not always, nor indeed often, in the ſhape of direct queſtions; which always put people upon their guard, and, often repeated, grow tireſome. But ſometimes take the things that you would know, for granted; upon which ſomebody will, kindly and officiouſly, ſet you right: ſometimes ſay, that you have heard ſo and ſo; and at other times ſeem to know
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:017372_0083_0FA10EDEB94358F8"/>more than you do in order to know all that you want: but avoid direct queſtioning as much as you can.</p>
               <p>Human nature is the ſame all over the world; but its operations are ſo varied by education and habit, that one muſt ſee it in all its d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The paſſion of ambition, for inſtance is the ſame in a courtier, a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or an eccleſiaſtic; but from their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent educations and habits they will take very different methods to gratify it. Civility, which is a dipoſition to accommodate and oblige others, is eſſentially the ſame in every country; but good-breeding, as it is called, which is the manner of exerting that diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is different in almoſt every country, and merely local; and every man of ſenſe imitates and conforms to that local good-breeding of the place which he is at.—A conformity and flexibility of manners is neceſſary in the courſe of the world; that is, with regard to all things which are not wrong in themſelves. The <hi>verſatile ingenium</hi> is the moſt uſeful of all. It can turn inſtantly from one object to another, aſſuming the proper manner for each. It can be ſerious with the grave, chearful with the gay, and trifling with the frivolous.</p>
               <p>Indeed, nothing is more engaging than a chearful and eaſy conformity to people's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:017372_0084_0FA10EDF45E110E0"/>manners, habits, and even weakneſſes; nothing (to uſe a vulgar expreſſion) ſhould come amiſs to a young fellow. He ſhould be, for good purpoſes, what Alcibiades was commonly for bad ones—a Proteus, aſſuming with eaſe, and wearing with chearfulneſs, any ſhape. Heat, cold, luxury, abſtinence, gravity, gaiety, ceremony, eaſineſs, learning, trifling, buſineſs, and pleaſure, are modes which he ſhould be able to take, lay aſide, or change occaſionally, with as much eaſe as he would take or lay aſide his hat.</p>
               <p>Young men are apt to think that every thing is to be carried by ſpirit and vigour; that art is meanneſs, and that verſatility and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance are the refuge of puſillanimity and weakneſs. This moſt miſtaken opinion gives an indelicacy, an abruptneſs, and a rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the manners. Fools, who can never be undeceived, retain them as long as they live; reflection, with a little experience, makes men of ſenſe ſhake them off ſoon. When they come to be a little better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with themſelves, and with their own ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, they diſcover, that plain right reaſon is, nine times in ten the fettered and ſhack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led attendant of the triumph of the heart and the paſſions; conſequently, they addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nine times in ten to the conqueror, not to be conquered: and conquerors, you
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:017372_0085_0FA10EE0274469F8"/>know muſt be applied to in the gentleſt, the moſt engaging, and the moſt inſinuating manner.</p>
               <p>But unfortunately, young men are as apt to think themſelves wiſe enough, as drunken men are to think themſelves ſober enough. They look upon ſpirit to be a much better thing than experience; which they call cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They are but half miſtaken; for though ſpirit without experience is dangerous, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience without ſpirit is languid and defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Their union which is very rare, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: you may join them, if you pleaſe, for all my experience is at your ſervice; and I do not deſire one grain of your ſpirit in return. Uſe them both; and let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally animate and check each other. I mean here, by the ſpirit of youth, only the vivacity and preſumption of youth; which hinder them from ſeeing the difficulties or dangers of an undertaking; but I do not mean what the ſilly vulgar calls ſpirit, by which they are captious jealous of their rank, ſuſpicious of being undervalued, and tart (as they call it) in their repartees, upon the ſlighteſt occaſions. This is an evil, and a very ſilly ſpirit, which ſhould be driven out, and transferred to an herd of ſwine.</p>
               <p>To conclude: Never neglect or deſpiſe old, for the ſake of new, or more ſhining acquaintance, which would be ungrateful
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:017372_0086_0FA10EE1EB59A800"/>on your part, and never forgiven on theirs. Take care to make perſonal friends, and as few perſonal enemies as poſſible. I do not mean, by perſonal friends, intimate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential friends, of which no man can hope to have half a dozen in the whole courſe of his life; but I mean friends, in the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word; that is, people who ſpeak well of you, and who would rather do you good than harm, conſiſtently with their own intereſt, and no farther.</p>

               <p>NOTHING is more criminal, mean, or ridiculous, than Lying. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction either of malice or cowardice, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but it generally miſſes of its aim in every one of theſe views; for lies are always detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſooner or later. If we advance a malicious lye, in order to affect any man's fortune or character, we may, indeed, injure him for ſome time, but we ſhall certainly be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſufferers in the end; for as ſoon as we are detected, we are blaſted for the infamous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: and whatever is ſaid afterwards to the diſadvantage of that perſon, however true, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for calumny. To lie, or to equivocate, (which is the ſame thing) to excuſe ourſelves
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:017372_0087_0FA10EE24DD941F0"/>for what we have ſaid or done, and to avoid the danger of the ſhame that we apprehend from it, we diſcover our fear as well as our falſhood; and only increaſe, inſtead of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the danger and the ſhame; we ſhow our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the loweſt and meaneſt of mankind, and are ſure to be always treated as ſuch. If we have the misfortune to be in the wrong, there is ſomething noble in frankly owning it; it is the only way of atoning for it, and the only way to be forgiven. To remove a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger, by equivocating, evading, or ſhuffling, is ſomething ſo deſpicable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays ſo much fear, that whoever practiſes them deſerves to be chaſtiſed.</p>
               <p>There are people who indulge themſelves in another ſort of lying, which they reckon innocent, and which in one ſenſe is ſo; for it hurts nobody but themſelves. This ſort of lying is the ſpurious offspring of vanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten upon folly: theſe people deal in the marvellous; they have ſeen ſome things that never exiſted; they have ſeen other things which they never really ſaw, though they did exiſt, only becauſe they were thought worth ſeeing. Has any thing remarkable been ſaid or done in any place, or in any company; they immediately preſent and declare themſelves eye or ear witneſſes of it. They have done feats themſelves, unattempted, or at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed, by others. They are always the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:017372_0088_0FA10EE30A8C64C8"/>heroes of their own fables; and think that they gain conſideration, or at leaſt preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by it. Whereas, in truth, all that they get is ridicule and contempt, not without a good degree of diſtruſt: for one muſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that he who will tell any lie from idle vanity, will not ſcruple telling a greater for intereſt. Had I really ſeen any thing ſo very extraordinary as to be almoſt incredible, I would keep it to myſelf, rather than, by telling it, give any one body room to doubt for one minute of my veracity. It is moſt certain, that the reputation of chaſtity is not ſo neceſſary for a woman, as that of veracity is for a man: and with reaſon; for it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a woman to be virtuous, though not ſtrictly chaſte: but it is not poſſible for a man to be virtuous without ſtrict veracity. The ſlips of the poor woman are ſometimes mere bodily frailties: but a lie in a man is a vice of the mind, and of the heart.</p>
               <p>Nothing but truth can carry us through the world, with either our conſcience or our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unwounded. It is not only our duty, but our intereſt; as a proof of which, it may be obſerved, that the greateſt fools are the greateſt liars.

               <head>DIGNITY OF MANNERS.</head>
               <p>A CERTAIN dignity of manners is abſolutely neceſſary, to make even the moſt valuable character either reſpected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable in the world.</p>
               <p>Horſe-play, romping, frequent and loud fits of laughter, jokes, waggery, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate familiarity, will ſink both merit and knowledge into a degree of contempt. They compoſe at moſt a merry fellow, and a merry fellow was never yet a reſpectable man. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminate familiarity either offends your ſuperiors, or elſe dubbs you their dependent, and led captain. It gives your inferiors juſt, but troubleſome and improper claims of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A joker is near akin to a buffoon; and neither of them is the leaſt related to wit. Whoever is admitted or ſought for, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, upon any other account than that of his merit and manners, is never reſpected there, but only made uſe of. We will have ſuch a one, for he ſings prettily; we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite ſuch a one to a ball, for he dances well; we will have ſuch a one to ſupper, for he is always joking and laughing; we will aſk ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he plays deep at all games, or becauſe he can drink a great deal. Theſe are all vilifying diſtinctions, mortifying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and exclude all ideas of eſteem and regard. Whoever <hi>is had</hi> (as it is called (in
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:017372_0090_0FA10EE48A50A3E8"/>company, for the ſake of any one thing ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is ſingly that thing, and will never be conſidered in any other light; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never reſpected, let his merits be what they will.</p>
               <p>Dignity of manners is not only as different from pride, as true courage is from bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or true wit from joking; but is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with it; for nothing vilifies and degrades more than pride. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the poor man are oftener treated with ſheer and contempt, than with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as we offer ridiculouſly too little to a tradeſman, who aſks ridiculouſly too much for his goods: but we do not haggle with one who only aſks a juſt and reaſonable price.</p>
               <p>Abject flattery and indiſcriminate aſſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion degrade, as much as indiſcriminate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and noiſy debate diſguſt. But a modeſt aſſertion of one's own opinion, and a complaiſant acquieſcence to other people's, preſerve dignity.</p>
               <p>Vulgar, low expreſſions, awkward motions and addreſs, vilify as they imply either a very low turn of mind, or low education and low company.</p>
               <p>Frivolous curioſity about trifles, and a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious attention to little objects, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther require nor deſerve a moment's thought, lower a man; who from thence is thought (and not unjuſtly) incapable of greater matters.

               <p>In your friendſhips and connections, as well as in your enmities, this rule is particularly uſeful; let your firmneſs and vigour preſerve and invite attachments to you; but at the ſame time, let your manner hinder the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of your friends and dependants from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming yours: let your enemies be diſarmed by the gentleneſs of your manner; but let them feel, at the ſame time, the ſteadineſs of your juſt reſentment; for there is great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between bearing malice, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ungenerous, and a reſolute ſelf-defence, which is always prudent and juſtifiable.</p>

               <head>ORATORY.</head>
               <p>ORATORY, or the art of ſpeaking well, is uſeful in every ſituation of life, and abſolutely neceſſary in moſt. A man cannot diſtinguiſh himſelf without it, in parliament, in the pulpit, or at the bar; and even in common converſation, he who has acquired an eaſy and habitual eloquence, and who
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:017372_0100_0FA10EF0CE069768"/>ſpeaks with propriety and accuracy, will have a great advantage over thoſe who ſpeak inelegantly and incorrectly. The buſineſs of oratory is to perſuade; and to pleaſe, is the moſt effectual ſtep towards perſuading. It is very advantageous for a man who ſpeaks in public, to pleaſe his hearers ſo much as to gain their attention; which he cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do, without the aſſiſtance of pratory.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that by ſtudy and application, every man may make himſelf a tolerable good orator, eloquence depending upon obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care. Every man may, if he pleaſes, make choice of good inſtead of bad words and phraſes, may ſpeak with propriety inſtead of impropriety, and may be clear and perſpicuous in his recitals, inſtead of dark and unintelligible: he may have grace inſtead of awkwardneſs in his geſtures and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In ſhort, it is in the power of every man, with pains and application, to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable, inſtead of a very diſagreeable ſpeaker; and it is well worth the labour to excel other men in that particular article in which they excel beaſts.</p>
               <p>Demoſthenes thought it ſo eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſpeak well, that though he natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtuttered, and had weak lungs, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by application, to overcome thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages. He cured his ſtammering, by
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:017372_0101_0FA10EF14A682B58"/>putting ſmall pebbles in his mouth, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſtrengthened his lungs, by daily uſing himſelf to ſpeak loudly and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctly for a conſiderable time. In ſtormy weather he often viſited the ſea ſhore, where he ſpoke as loud as he could, in order to prepare himſelf for the noiſe and murmurs of the popular aſſemblies of the Athenians, before whom he was to ſpeak. By this extraordinary care and attention, and the conſtant ſtudy of the beſt authors, he became the greateſt orator that his own, or any other age or country have produced.</p>
               <p>Whatever language a perſon uſes, he ſhould ſpeak it in its greateſt purity, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of grammar: nor is it ſufficient that we do not ſpeak a language ill, we muſt endeavour to ſpeak it well; for which purpoſe, we ſhould read the beſt authors with attention, and obſerve how people of faſhion and education ſpeak. Common people, in general, ſpeak ill; they make uſe of inele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and vulgar expreſſions, which people of rank never do. In numbers they frequently join the ſingular and the plural together, and confound the maſculine with the feminine gender, and ſeldom make choice of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tenſe. To avoid all theſe faults we ſhould read with attention, and obſerve the turn and expreſſions of the beſt authors; nor ſhould we paſs over a word that we do not perfectly
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:017372_0102_0FA10EF610BF3370"/>underſtand, without ſearching or enquiring for the exact meaning of it.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, That a man muſt be born a poet; but it is in his power to make himſelf an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; for to be a poet requires a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſtrength and vivacity of mind; but that attention, reading and labour, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to form an orator.</p>

               <p>EVERY excellency, and every virtue, has its kindred vice or weakneſs; and, if carried beyond certain bounds, ſinks into the one or the other. Generoſity often runs into profuſion, economy into avarice, courage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to raſhneſs, caution into timidity, and ſo on: inſomuch that I believe, there is more judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment required, for the proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Vice in its true light, is ſo deformed, that it ſhocks us at firſt ſight; and would hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeduce us, if it did not, at firſt, wear the maſk of ſome virtue. But virtue is, in itſelf, ſo beautiful, that it charms us at firſt ſight; engages us more and more, upon further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; and, as with other beauties, we think exceſs impoſſible; it is here that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is neceſſary, to moderate and direct the effects of an excellent cauſe. In the ſame
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:017372_0103_0FA10EF7D39B8FD0"/>manner, great learning, if not accompanied with ſound judgment, frequently carries us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to error, pride, and pedantry.</p>
               <p>Some learned men, proud of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, only ſpeak to decide, and give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without appeal. The conſequence of which is, that mankind, provoked by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and injured by the oppreſſion, revolt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The more you know the modeſter you ſhould be: and that modeſty is the ſureſt way of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your vanity. Even where you are ſure, ſeem rather doubtful: repreſent, but do not pronounce: and, if you would convince others, ſeem open to conviction yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Others, to ſhow their learning, or often from the prejudices of a ſchool education, where they hear of nothing elſe, are always talking of the Ancients as ſomething more than men, and of the Moderns as ſomething leſs. They are never without a claſſic or two in their pockets; they ſtick to the old good ſenſe; they read none of the modern traſh; and will ſhow you plainly, that no improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been made, in any one art or ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, theſe laſt ſeventeen hundred years. I would by no means have you diſown your acquaintance with the Ancients; but ſtill leſs would I have you brag of an excluſive inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with them. Speak of the Moderns
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:017372_0104_0FA10EF9046E6640"/>without contempt, and of the Ancients with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out idolatry judge them all by their merits, but not by their ages; and if you happen to have an Elzevir claſſic in your pocket, neither ſhow it nor mention it.</p>
               <p>Some great ſcholars, moſt abſurdly draw all their maxims, both for public and private life, from what they call parallel caſes in the ancient authors; without conſidering, that, in the firſt place, there never were, ſince the Creation of the World, two caſes exactly parallel: and, in the next place, that there never was a caſe ſtated, or even known, by any hiſtorian with every one of its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which, however, ought to be known in order to be reaſoned from. Reaſon upon the caſe itſelf, and the ſeveral circumſtances that attend it, and act accordingly; but not from the authority of ancient poets or hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Take into your conſideration, if you pleaſe, caſes ſeemingly analogous; but take them as helps only, not as guides.</p>
               <p>There is another ſpecies of learned men, who, though leſs dogmatical and ſupercilious, are not leſs impertinent. Theſe are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative and ſhining pedants, who adorn their converſation, even with women, by happy quotations of Greek and Latin, and who have contracted ſuch a familiarity with the Greek and Roman authors, that they call
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:017372_0105_0FA10EF98B54CD78"/>them by certain names or epithets denoting intimacy. As <hi>old</hi> Homer; that <hi>ſly rogue</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race; <hi>Maro,</hi> inſtead of Virgil; and <hi>Naſo,</hi> inſtead of Ovid. Theſe are often imitated by coxcombs, who have no learning at all; but who have got ſome names, and ſome ſcraps of ancient authors by heart, which they improperly and impertinently retail in all companies, in hopes of paſſing for ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.

But the pleaſures of a man of parts either flatter the ſenſes, or improve the mind.</p>
               <p>There are liberal and illiberal pleaſures, as well as liberal and illiberal arts. Sottiſh drunkenneſs, indiſcriminate gluttony, driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coaches, ruſtic ſports, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The more we apply to buſineſs, the more we reliſh our pleaſures: the exerciſe of the mind in the morning, by ſtudy, whets the appetite for the pleaſures of the evening, as the exerciſe of the body whets the appetite for dinner. Buſineſs and pleaſure, rightly underſtood, mutually aſſiſt each other; inſtead of being enemies, as fooliſh or dull people often think them. We cannot taſte pleaſures truly, unleſs we earn them by previous buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and few people do buſineſs well, who do nothing elſe. But when I ſpeak of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I always mean the elegant pleaſures of a rational being, and not the brutal ones of a ſwine.</p>

               <p>NEVER adopt the notions of any books you may read, or of any company you may keep, without examining whether they are juſt or not, as you will otherwiſe be liable to be hurried away by prejudices, inſtead of being guided by reaſon; and quietly cheriſh error, inſtead of ſeeking for truth.</p>
               <p>Uſe and aſſert your own reaſon; reflect, examine, and analyſe every thing, in order to form a ſound and mature judgment; let no <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> impoſe upon your underſtanding, miſlead your actions, or dictate your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Be early, what, if you are not, you will, when too late, wiſh you had been. Conſult your reaſon betimes: I do not ſay, that it will always prove an unerring guide; for human reaſon is not infallible: but it will prove the leaſt erring guide that you can follow. Books and converſation may aſſiſt it; but adopt neither, blindly and implicitly; try both by that beſt rule, which God has given to direct us, Reaſon. Of all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, do not decline, as many people do, that of thinking. The herd of mankind can hardly be ſaid to think; their notions are almoſt all adoptive; and, in general, I believe it is better that it ſhould be ſo; as ſuch common prejudices contribute more to
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:017372_0110_0FA10EFD530CF7E8"/>order and quiet, than their own ſeparate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings would do, uncultivated and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as they are.</p>
               <p>Local prejudices prevail only with the herd of mankind; and do not impoſe upon culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, informed, and reflecting minds: but then there are notions equally falſe, though not ſo glaringly abſurd, which are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by people of ſuperior and improved underſtandings, merely for want of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary pains to inveſtigate, the proper atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to examine, and the penetration requiſite to determine the truth. Thoſe are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices which I would have you guard againſt, by a manly exertion and attention of your reaſoning faculty.</p>

               <head>EMPLOYMENT OF TIME.</head>
               <p>HOW little do we reflect on the uſe and value of time! It is in every body's mouth, but in few people's practice. Every fool, who ſlatterns away his whole time in nothings, frequently utters ſome trite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place ſentence to prove, at once, the value and the fleetneſs of time. The ſun dials, all over Europe, have ſome ingenious inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that effect: ſo that nobody ſquanders away their time without frequently hearing and ſeeing how neceſſary it is to employ it well; and how irrecoverable it is if loſt. Young
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:017372_0112_0FA10EFFC7E122B8"/>people are apt to think they have ſo much time before them, that they may ſquander what they pleaſe of it, and yet have enough left; as great fortunes have frequently ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced people to a ruinous profuſion. But all theſe admonitions are uſeleſs, where there is not a fund of good ſenſe, and reaſon to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt rather than receive them.</p>
               <p>Time is precious, life ſhort, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not a ſingle moment ſhould be loſt. Senſible men know how to make the moſt of time, and put out their whole ſum either to intereſt or pleaſure: they are never idle, but continually employed either in amuſements or ſtudy. It is a univerſal maxim, That idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the mother of vice. It is, however, certain, that lazineſs is the inheritance of fools, and nothing can be ſo deſpicable as a ſluggard. Cato the Cenſor, a wiſe and virtuous Roman, uſed to ſay, there were but three actions of his life that he regretted. The firſt was, the having revealed a ſecret to his wife; the ſecond, that he had once gone by ſea when he might have gone by land; and the third, the having paſſed one day without <hi>doing any good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Take care of the pence, for the pounds will take care of themſelves.</q> was a very juſt and ſenſible reflection of old Mr. Lown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the famous Secretary of the Treaſury, under William III. Anne, and George I. I
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:017372_0113_0FA10F0136672B78"/>therefore recommed to you to take care of minutes, for hours will take care of themſelves. Be doing ſomething or other all day long; and not neglect half-hours and quarters of hours, which, at the year's end, amount to a great ſum. For inſtance: There are many ſhort intervals in the day, between ſtudies and pleaſures; inſtead of ſitting idle and yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in thoſe intervals, ſnatch up ſome valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able book, and continue the reading of that book till you have got through it; never bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your mind with more than one thing at a time: and, in reading this book, do not run over it ſuperficially, but read every paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age twice over, at leaſt do not paſs on to a ſecond, till you thoroughly underſtand the firſt, nor quit the book till you are maſter of the ſubject; for unleſs you do this, you may read it through, and not remember the contents of it for a week. The books I would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly recommend, among others, are the <hi>Marchioneſs Lambert's advice to her ſon and daughter, Cardinal Retz's Maxims, Rochfou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault's Moral Reflections, Bruyere's Characters, Fontenelle's Plurality of Worlds, Sir Joſiah Child on Trade, Bolingbroke's Works;</hi> for ſtyle, his <hi>Remarks on the Hiſtory of England,</hi> under the name of Sir John Oldcaſtle; <hi>Puffendorff's Jus Gentium,</hi> and <hi>Grotius de Jure Belli et Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis:</hi> the laſt two are well tranſlated by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berac. For occaſional half-hours or leſs, read
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:017372_0114_0FA10F01C53DEB40"/>works of invention, wit and humour; but never waſte your minutes on trifling authors, either ancient or modern.</p>
               <p>Nor are pleaſure, idleneſs, or time loſt, provided they are the pleaſures of a rational being; on the contrary, a certain portion of time employed in thoſe pleaſures, is very uſefully employed.</p>
               <p>Whatever buſineſs you have, do it the firſt moment you can; never by halves but finiſh it without interruption, if poſſible. Buſineſs muſt not be ſauntered and trifled with; and you muſt not ſay to it as Felix did to Paul, "at a more convenient ſeaſon I will ſpeak to thee." The moſt convenient ſeaſon for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the firſt; but ſtudy and buſineſs in ſome meaſure, point out their own times, to a man of ſenſe; time is much oftener ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered away in the wrong choice and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per methods of amuſement and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Diſpatch is the ſoul of buſineſs; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributes more to diſpatch than me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Lay down a method for every thing, and ſtick to it inviolable, as far as unexpected incidents may allow. Fix one certain hour and day in the week for your accounts, and keep them together in their proper order; by which means they will require very little time, and you can never be much cheated. Whatever letters and papers you keep, docket
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:017372_0115_0FA10F0561A119B0"/>and tie them up in their reſpective claſſes, ſo that you may inſtantly have recourſe to any one. Lay down a method alſo for your reading, for which you allot a certain ſhare of your mornings; let it be a conſiſtent and conſecutive courſe, and not in that deſultory and immethodical manner, in which many people read ſcraps of different authors upon different ſubjects. Keep a uſeful and ſhort common place book of what you read, to help your memory only, and not for pedantic quotations. Never read Hiſtory without having maps, and a chronological book, or tables, lying by you, and conſtantly recurred to; without which, Hiſtory is only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed heap of facts.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, it may be, as many young people would, that all this order and method is very troubleſome, only fit for dull people, and a diſagreeable reſtraint upon the noble fire of Youth. I deny it; and aſſert on the contrary, that it will procure you both more time and more taſte for your pleaſures; and, ſo far from being troubleſome to you, that, after you have purſued it a month, it would be troubleſome to you to lay it aſide. Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whets the appetite, and gives a taſte to pleaſures, as exerciſe does to food: and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can never be done without method: it raiſes the ſpirits for pleaſures; and a <hi>ſpectacle,</hi> a ball, an aſſembly, will much more ſenſibly
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:017372_0116_0FA10F070599C6E0"/>affect a man who has employed, than a man who has loſt the preceding part of the day; nay, I will venture to ſay, that a fine lady will ſeem to have more charms to a man of ſtudy or buſineſs, than to a ſaunterer. The ſame liſtleſſneſs runs through his whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and he is as inſipid in his pleaſures, as inefficient in every thing elſe</p>
               <p>I hope you earn your pleaſures, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taſte them: for by the way, I know a great many men who call themſelves Men of pleaſure, but who, in truth, have none. They adopt other people's indiſcriminately, but without any taſte of their own. I have known them often inflict exceſſes upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they thought them genteel; though they ſat as aukwardly upon them as other people's clothes would have done. Have no pleaſures but your own, and then you will ſhine in them.</p>
               <p>Many people think that they are in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, provided they are neither in ſtudy nor in buſineſs. Nothing like it: they are doing nothing, and might juſt as well be aſleep. They contract habitudes from lazineſs, and they only frequent thoſe places where they are free from all reſtraints and attentions. Be upon your guard againſt this idle profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time; and let every place you go to be either the ſcene of quick and lively plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:017372_0117_0FA10F070E3ADA50"/>or the ſchool of your improvements: let every company you go into, either gratify your ſenſes, extend your knowledge, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine your manners.</p>
               <p>If, by accident, two or three hours are ſometimes wanting for ſome uſeful purpoſe, borrow them from your ſleep. Six or at moſt ſeven hours ſleep is, for a conſtancy, as much as you or any body can want: more is only lazineſs and dozing; and is both unwholſome and ſtupifying. If, by chance, your buſineſs or your pleaſures, ſhould keep you up till four or five o'clock in the morning riſe exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at your uſual time, that you may not loſe the precious morning hours; and that the want of ſleep may force you to go to bed earlier the next night.</p>
               <p>Above all things, guard againſt frivolouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The frivolous mind is always buſied but to little purpoſe; it takes little objects for great ones, and throws away upon trifles that time and attention which only important things deſerve. Nicknacks, butterflies, ſhells, inſects, &amp;c. are the objects of their moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reſearches. They contemplate the dreſs, not the characters, of the company they keep. They attend more to the decorations of a play, than to the ſenſe of it; and to the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of a court, more than to its politics. Such an employment of time is abſolute loſs of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:017372_0118_0FA10F07EB98EB50"/>
To conclude this ſubject: Sloth, indolence, and effeminacy, are pernicious and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young fellow; let them be your <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource</hi> forty years hence at ſooneſt. Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine at all events, and however diſagreeable it may be to you in ſome reſpects, and for ſome time, to keep the moſt diſtinguiſhed and faſhionable company of the place you are at, either for their rank, or for their learning, or <hi>le bel eſprit et le gout.</hi> This gives you cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials to the beſt companies, where-ever you go afterwards.</p>
               <p>Know the true value of time; ſnatch, ſeize, and enjoy every moment of it. No idleneſs, no lazineſs, no procraſtination; never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day. That was the rule of the famous and unfortunate Penſionary De Witt; who, by ſtrictly following it, found time not only to do the whole buſineſs of the Republic, but to paſs his evenings at aſſemblies and ſuppers, as if he had had nothing elſe to do or think of.</p>

               <p>VIRTUE is a ſubject which deſerves your and every man's attention. It conſiſts in doing good, and in ſpeaking truth; the effects of it therefore, are advantageous to all mankind, and to one's ſelf in particular; virtue makes us pity and relieve the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of mankind; it makes us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote juſtice and good order in ſociety; and, in general, contributes to whatever tends to the real good of mankind. To
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:017372_0121_0FA10F0AF2B88EE0"/>ourſelves it gives inward comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which nothing elſe can do, and which nothing can rob us of. All other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages depend upon others, as much as upon ourſelves. Riches, power, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may be taken away from us, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injuſtice of others, or by inevitable accidents; but virtue depends only upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and nobody can take it away from us. Sickneſs may deprive us of all the pleaſures of the body; but it cannot deprive us of our virtue, nor of the ſatisfaction which we feel from it. A virtuous man, under all the misfortunes of life, ſtill finds inward comfort and ſatisfaction, which makes him happier, than any wicked man can be with all the other advantages of life. If a man has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great power and riches by falſehood, injuſtice, and oppreſſion, he cannot enjoy them, becauſe his conſcience will torment him, and conſtantly reproach him with the means by which he got them. The ſtings of his conſcience will not even let him ſleep quietly; but he will dream of his crimes: and in the day-time, when alone, and when he has time to think, he will be uneaſy and melancholy. He is afraid of every thing; for, as he knows mankind muſt hate him, he has reaſon to think they will hurt him if they can. Whereas if a virtuous man be ever ſo poor or unfortunate in the world, ſtill his
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:017372_0122_0FA10F0B899DFD88"/>virtue is its own reward, and will comfort him under all afflictions. The quiet and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his conſcience make him chearful by day, and ſleep ſound by nights; he can be alone with pleaſure, and is not afraid of his own thoughts. Virtue forces her way, and ſhines through the obſcurity of a retired life; and, ſooner or later, it always is rewarded.</p>
               <p>To conclude:—Lord Shaftſbury ſays, that he would be virtuous for his own ſake, though nobody were to know it; as he would be clean for his own ſake, though nobody were to ſee him.</p>

            <p>A MAN who does not ſolidly eſtabliſh, and really deſerve, a character of truth, probity, good manners, and good morals, at his firſt ſetting out in the world, may impoſe, and ſhine like a meteor for a very ſhort time, but will very ſoon vaniſh, and be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with contempt. People eaſily pardon, in young men, the common irregularities of the ſenſes; but they do not forgive the leaſt vice of the heart.</p>
            <p>The greateſt favours may be done ſo awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and bunglingly as to offend; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable things may be done ſo diſagreeably as almoſt to oblige.</p>
            <p>There are very few Captains of foot, who are not much better company than ever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcartes or Sir Iſaac Newton were. I honour

In common life, one much oftener wants ſmall money, and ſilver, than gold. Give me a man who has ready caſh about him for preſent expences; ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, ſhillings, half-crowns, and crowns, which circulate eaſily: but a man who has only an ingot of gold about him, is much above common purpoſes, and his riches are not handy nor convenient. Have as much gold as you pleaſe in one pocket, but take care always to keep change in the other: for you will much oftener have occaſion for a ſhilling than a guinea.</p>
            <p>Advice is ſeldom welcome, and thoſe who want it the moſt, always like it the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Envy is one of the meaneſt and moſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of all paſſions, as there is hardly a perſon exiſting that has not given uneaſineſs to an envious breaſt; for the envious man cannot be happy, while he beholds others ſo.</p>

            <p>The ignorant and the weak only are idle, thoſe who have acquired a good ſtock of knowledge, always deſire to increaſe it. Knowledge is like power in this reſpect, that thoſe who have the moſt, are moſt deſirous of having more. Idleneſs is only the refuge of weak minds, and the holiday of fools.</p>
            <p>Every man has a natural right to his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and whoever endeavours to raviſh it from him, deſerves death more than the robber who attacks us for our money on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Modeſty is a commendable quality, and generally accompanies true merit; it engages and captivates the minds of people; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ſhocking and diſguſtful than preſumption and impudence. A man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed who is always commending himſelf, and who is the hero of his own ſtory.</p>
            <p>Not to perform our promiſe is a folly, a diſhonour, and a crime. It is a folly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no one will rely on us afterwards; and it is a diſhonour, and a crime, becauſe truth is the firſt duty of religion and morality; and whoever is not poſſeſſed of truth, cannot be ſuppoſed to have any one good quality, and muſt be held in deteſtation by all good men.</p>
            <p>Wit may create many admirers, but makes few friends. It ſhines and dazzles like the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:017372_0126_0FA10F0E8662D3A0"/>noon-day ſun, but, like that too, is very apt to ſcorch; and therefore is always feared. The milder morning and evening light and heat of that planet, ſoothe and calm our minds. Never ſeek for wit: if it preſents itſelf, well and good; but even in that caſe, let your judgment interpoſe: and take care that it be not at the expence of any body. POPE ſays very truly,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>"There are whom Heav'n has bleſt with ſtore of wit,</hi>

            <p>A proper ſecrecy is the only myſtery of able men; myſtery is the only ſecrecy of weak and cunning ones.</p>
            <p>To tell my friend, wife, or miſtreſs, any ſecret with which they have nothing to do, is diſcovering to them ſuch an unretentive weakneſs, as muſt convince them that you will tell it to twenty others, and conſequently that they may reveal it without the riſk of being diſcovered. But a ſecret properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, only to thoſe who are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the queſtion, will probably be kept by them, though they ſhould be a good
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:017372_0127_0FA10F0F4B503998"/>many. Little ſecrets are commonly told a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but great ones generally kept.</p>
            <p>A man who tells nothing, or who tells all, will equally have nothing told him.</p>
            <p>If a fool knows a ſecret, he tells it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a fool: if a knave knows one, he tells it wherever it is his intereſt to tell it. But women, and young men, are very apt to tell what ſecrete they know, from the vanity of having been truſted. Truſt none of theſe, wherever you can help it.</p>
            <p>In your friendſhips, and in your enmities, let your confidence and your hoſtilities have certain bounds: make not the former dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, nor the latter irreconcilable. There are ſtrange viciſſitudes in buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Smooth your way to the head through the heart. The way of reaſon is a good one: but it is commonly ſomething longer, and perhaps not ſo ſure.</p>
            <p>Spirit is now a very faſhionable word: to act with ſpirit, means only, to act raſhly, and to talk indiſcreetly. An able man ſhows his ſpirit, by gentle words and reſolute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: he is neither hot nor timid.</p>
            <p>Patience is a moſt neceſſary qualification for buſineſs: Many a man would rather you heard his ſtory, than granted his requeſt. One muſt ſeem to hear the unreaſonable demands of the petulant, unmoved; and the tedious details
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:017372_0128_0FA10F103787DDB8"/>of the dull, untired. That is, the leaſt price that a man muſt pay for a high ſtation.</p>
            <p>It is always right to detect a fraud, and to perceive a folly; but it is often very wrong to expoſe either. A man of buſineſs ſhould always have his eyes open, but muſt often ſeem to have them ſhut.</p>
            <p>In courts (and every where elſe) baſhfulneſs and timidity are as prejudicial on one hand, as impudence and raſhneſs are on the other. A ſteady aſſurance and a cool intrepidity, with an exterior modeſty, are the true and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary medium.</p>
            <p>Never apply for what you ſee very little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of obtaining; for you will, by aſking improper and unattainable things, accuſtom the miniſters to refuſe you ſo often, that they will find it eaſy to refuſe you the propereſt and moſt reaſonable ones. It is a common, but a moſt miſtaken rule at court, to aſk for every thing in order to get ſomething: you do get ſomething by it, it is true; but that ſomething is refuſals and ridicule.—This maxim, like the former, is of general application.</p>
            <p>A chearful eaſy countenance and behaviour are very uſeful: they make fools think you a good-natured man; and they make deſigning men think you an undeſigning one.</p>
            <p>There are ſome occaſions in which a man muſt tell half his ſecret, in order to conceal the reſt; but there is ſeldom one in which a man
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:017372_0129_0FA10F1625616D70"/>ſhould tell it all. Great ſkill is neceſſary to know how far to go, and where to ſtop.</p>
            <p>Ceremony is neceſſary, as the out work and defence of manners.</p>
            <p>A man's own good-breeding is his beſt ſecurity againſt other people's ill manners.</p>
            <p>Good-breeding carries along with it a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that is reſpected by the moſt petulant. Ill breeding invites and authorizes the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of the moſt timid. No man ever ſaid a pert thing to the Duke of Marlborough. No man ever ſaid a civil one (though many a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering one) to Sir Robert Walpole.</p>
            <p>Knowledge may give weight, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments only give luſtre; and many more people ſee than weigh.</p>
            <p>Moſt arts require long ſtudy and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the moſt uſeful art of all, that of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, requires only the deſire.</p>
            <p>It is to be preſumed that a man of common ſenſe, who does not deſire to pleaſe, deſires nothing at all; ſince he muſt know that he cannot obtain any thing without it.</p>
            <p>A ſkilful negociator will moſt carefully diſtinguiſh between the little and the great objects of his buſineſs, and will be as frank and open in the former, as he will be ſecret and pertinacious in the latter—This maxim holds equally true in common life.</p>
            <p>The Duc de Sully obſerves very juſtly, in his Memoirs, that nothing contributed more
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:017372_0130_0FA10F17CF6B28A8"/>to his riſe than that prudent economy which he had obſerved from his youth; and by which he had always a ſum of money before hand, in caſe of emergencies.</p>
            <p>It is very difficult to fix the particular point of economy: the beſt error of the two, is on the parſimonious ſide. That may be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other cannot.</p>
            <p>The reputation of generoſity is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed pretty cheap; it does not depend ſo much upon a man's general expence, as it does upon his giving handſomely where it is proper to give at all. A man, for inſtance, who ſhould give a ſervant four ſhillings, would paſs for covetous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while he who gave him a crown would be reckoned generous; ſo that the difference of thoſe two oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters turns upon one ſhilling. A man's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, in that particular depends a great deal upon the report of his own ſervants; a mere trifle above common wages makes their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſavourable.</p>
            <p>Take care always to form your eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo much within your income, as to leave a ſufficient fund for unexpected contingencies, and a prudent liberality. There is hardly a year, in any man's life, in which a ſmall ſum of ready money may not be employed to great advantage.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE POLITE PHILOSOPHER was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed originally at Edinburgh
<note n="*" place="bottom">In the year 1734.</note>, and part of the edition ſent up to London. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the title, and, to ſay truth, of the performance itſelf, for it is written in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner never before made uſe of in our language, recommended it to ſome, and prejudiced it in the opinion of others. But Time, which is the touchſtone of ſuch productions, did juſtice to this work, and at laſt procured it an eſteem, not only here, but abroad. This, together with my great eſteem for its ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous AUTHOR, who is now in Italy, and who is allowed by all who knew him to be truly a POL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>TE PHILOSOPHER, occaſioned my ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſecond edition into the world.</p>
            <p>The intent of the author (for I very well knew his intent) was, to make men aſhamed of their vices, by ſhewing them how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous they were made by them, and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it was for a bad man to be polite. It may be, graver books have been written
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:017372_0132_0FA10F1ADF276720"/>on this ſubject, but few more to the point; its author being equally ſkilled in books and in men, in the dead languages and the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I preſume, therefore, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations will be generally found true, and his maxims juſt.</p>
            <p>At firſt ſight, it may ſeem that this book is calculated only for a few; but I beg leave to obſerve, that in truth there are but few to whom it may not be uſeful. As every man in his ſtation ought to be honeſt, ſo every man in his behaviour may be polite; nay, he ought to be ſo, becauſe he will be ſure to find his account in it; ſince it is a quality eaſier diſcerned, and of conſequence ſooner rewarded, than the former. We muſt know and converſe with a man, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his probity; whereas we perceive at firſt ſight whether he has good manners; by this we are prejudiced in his favour: and who then would not ſtrive to learn an art at once ſo eaſy, and ſo extenſive in its uſe?</p>
            <p>But, if it be beneficial to all, it is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly neceſſary to YOUTH. It is at once a remedy for baſhfulneſs, and a preſervative againſt the contrary vice. A polite perſon ſtands in the middle, between a ſheepiſh modeſty and a diſtaſteful boldneſs It is the habit which adds the laſt poliſh to educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, brightens the man of letters, and ſpreads a gloſs over that ſort of learning which would
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:017372_0133_0FA10F1B45BFAA18"/>otherwiſe appear pedantic. The polite man may not only underſtand Latin and Greek, but may alſo introduce them into diſcourſe, provided it be before proper company, and on a proper occaſion. The unpoliſhed ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar lugs them in whenever they occur; quotes OVID to his miſtreſs, and repeats a paſſage from POLYAENEUS to a captain of the guards. To your youth therefore I beg leave to recommend thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> conciſe manual, which will coſt them but little time to read, and no great pains to practiſe.</p>
