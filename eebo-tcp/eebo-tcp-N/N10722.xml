            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MANY of the facts contained in the natural hiſtory of medicine among the Indians in the following oration, are taken from La Hontan's and Charlevoix's hiſtories of Canada: But the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of them are taken from perſons who had lived, or travelled among the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The author acknowledges himſelf indebted in a particular manner to Mr. Edward Hand, ſurgeon in the 18th regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who during ſeveral years reſidence at Fort Pitt, directed his enquiries into their cuſtoms, diſeaſes, and remedies, with a ſucceſs that does equal honor to his ingenuity and diligence.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I RISE with peculiar diffidence to addreſs you upon this occaſion, when I reflect upon the entertainment you propoſed to yourſelves from the eloquence of that learned member<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Charles Thompſon.</note>, whom your ſuffrages appointed to this honor after the delivery of the laſt anniverſary orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Unhappy for the intereſts of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his want of health has not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to comply with your appointment. I beg therefore that you would forget for a while, the abilities neceſſary to execute this taſk with propriety, and liſten with candor to the efforts of a member, whoſe attachment to the ſociety, was the only qualification that entitled him to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of your choice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013592_0005_0F914470CCEB1548"/>THE ſubject I have choſen for this evening's entertainment, is <q>An enquiry into the natural hiſtory of medicine among the Indians in North-America, and a comparative view of their diſeaſes and remedies with thoſe of civilized nations.</q> You will readily anticipate the difficulty of doing juſtice to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. How ſhall we diſtinguiſh between the original diſeaſes of the Indians and thoſe contracted from their intercourſe with the Europeans? By what arts ſhall we perſuade them to diſcover their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? and laſtly, how ſhall we come at the knowledge of facts in that cloud of errors, in which the credulity of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, and the ſuperſtition of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians have involved both their diſeaſes and remedies? Theſe difficulties ſerve to increaſe the importance of our ſubject. If I ſhould not be able to ſolve them, perhaps I may lead the way to more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful endeavors for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I SHALL firſt limit the tribes of Indians who are to be the objects of this enquiry, to thoſe who inhabit that part of North-America which extends from the 30th
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013592_0006_0F91447186B4FAE0"/>to the 60th degree of latitude. When we exclude the Eſquimaux, who inhabit the ſhores of Hudſon's bay, we ſhall find a general reſemblance in the color, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſtate of ſociety, among all the tribes of Indians who inhabit that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive tract of country.</p>
            <p>CIVILIANS have divided nations into ſavage, barbarous, and civilized. The ſavage, live by fiſhing and hunting. The barbarous, by paſturage or cattle; and the civilized, by agriculture. Each of theſe are connected together in ſuch a manner that the whole appear to form different parts of a circle. Even the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the moſt civilized nations partake of thoſe of the ſavage. It would ſeem as if liberty and indolence were the higheſt purſuits of man; and theſe are enjoyed in their greateſt perfection by ſavages, or in the practice of cuſtoms which reſemble thoſe of ſavages.</p>
            <p>THE Indians of North-America partake chiefly of the manners of ſavages. In the earlieſt accounts we have of them, we find them cultivating a ſpot of ground.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013592_0007_0F9144723B8361D0"/>The maize is an original grain among them. The different diſhes of it which are in uſe among the white people ſtill retain Indian names.</p>
            <p>IT will be unneceſſary to ſhow that the Indians live in a ſtate of ſociety adapted to all the exigencies of their mode of life. Thoſe who look for the ſimplicity and perfection of the ſtate of nature, muſt ſeek it in ſyſtems, as abſurd in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, as they are delightful in poetry.</p>
            <p>BEFORE we attempt to aſcertain the number of hiſtory of the diſeaſes of the Indians, it will be neceſſary to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe cuſtoms among them which we know influence diſeaſes. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſhall,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Mention a few facts which relate to the birth and treatment of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſpeak of their diet.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Of the cuſtoms peculiar to each of the ſexes. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:013592_0008_0F9144734F4F5B78"/>Fourthly, Of thoſe cuſtom which are common to them both.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of the birth and treatment of their children.</p>
            <p>MUCH of the future health of the body depends upon its original ſtamina. A child born of healthy parents always brings into the world a ſyſtem formed by nature to reſiſt the cauſes of diſeaſes. The treatment of children among the Indians, tends to ſecure this hereditary firmneſs of conſtitution. Their firſt food is their mother's milk. To harden them againſt the action of heat and cold (the natural enemies of health and life among the Indians) they are plunged every day in cold water. In order to facilitate their being moved from place to place, and at the ſame time, to preſerve their ſhapes, they are tied to a board, where they lie on their backs for ſix, ten, or eighteen months. A child generally ſucks its mother till it is two years old, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times longer. It is eaſy to conceive how much vigor their bodies muſt acquire from this ſimple, but wholeſome nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013592_0009_0F914473C6FE2940"/>The appetite we ſometimes obſerve in children for fleſh, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artificial. The peculiar irritability of the ſyſtem in infancy, forbids ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating aliment of all kinds. Nature never calls for animal food till ſhe has provided the child with thoſe teeth which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to divide it. I ſhall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to determine how far the wholſome quality of the mother's milk is increaſed by her refuſing the embraces of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, during the time of giving ſuck.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE diet of the Indians is of a mixed nature, being partly animal and partly vegetable; their animals are wild and therefore eaſy of digeſtion. As the Indians are naturally more diſpoſed to the indolent employment of fiſhing than hunting in ſummer, ſo we find them living more upon fiſh than land animals, in that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year. Their vegetables conſiſt of roots and fruits, mild in themſelves, or capable of being made ſo by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fire. Altho' the interior parts of our continent abound with ſalt ſprings, yet I cannot find that the Indians uſed ſalt in their diet, till they were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013592_0010_0F914476D653A320"/>to do ſo by the Europeans. The ſmall quantity of fixed alkali contained in the aſhes on which they roaſted their meat, could not add much to its ſtimulating quality. They preſerve their meat from putrefaction, by cutting it into ſmall pieces, and expoſing it in ſummer to the ſun, and in winter to the froſt. In the one caſe its moiſture is diſſipated, and in the other ſo frozen, that it cannot undergo the putrefactive proceſs. In dreſſing their meat, they are careful to preſerve its juices. They generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it in the form of ſoops. Hence we find, that among them, the uſe of the ſpoon preceded that of the knife and fork. They take the ſame pains to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the juice of their meat when they roaſt it, by turning it often. The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this animal juice in diſſolving meat in the ſtomach, has not been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by any of thoſe ſauces or liquors, which modern luxury has mixed with it for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THE Indians have no ſet time for eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but obey the gentle appetites of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as often as they call them. After
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013592_0011_0F914477F7A08638"/>whole days ſpent in the chaſe or in war, they often commit thoſe exceſſes in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to which long abſtinence can not fail of prompting them. It is common to ſee them ſpend three or four hours in ſatisfying their hunger. This is occaſioned not more by the quantity they eat, than by the pains they take in maſticating it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. WE come now to ſpeak of thoſe cuſtoms which are peculiar to the ſexes. And, firſt, of thoſe which belong to the WOMEN. They are doomed by their huſbands to ſuch domeſtic labor as gives a firmneſs to their bodies, bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the maſculine. Their menſes ſeldom begin to flow before they are eighteen, or twenty years of age, and generally ceaſe before they are forty. They have them in ſmall quantities, but at regular inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals. They ſeldom marry till they are above twenty. The conſtitution has now acquired a vigor, which enables it the better to ſupport the convulſions of child-bearing. This cuſtom likewiſe guards againſt a premature old age. Doctor
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013592_0012_0F9144784E68FED0"/>Bancroft aſcribes the haggard looks— the looſe hanging breaſts—and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent bellies of the Indian women at Guiana, entirely to their bearing children too early <note n="*" place="bottom">Natural hiſtory of Guiana.</note>. Where marriages are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful (which is ſeldom the caſe) a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is obtained by means of an eaſy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce; ſo that they are unacquainted with the diſquietudes which ſometimes ariſe from barrenneſs. During pregnancy, the women are exempted from the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious parts of their duty—Hence miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages rarely happen among them. Nature is their only midwife. Their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors are ſhort, and accompanied with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pain. Each woman is delivered in a private cabbin, without ſo much as one of her own ſex to attend her. After waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf in cold water, ſhe returns in a few days to her uſual employments; ſo that ſhe knows nothing of thoſe accidents which ariſe from the careleſſneſs, or ill management of midwives, or thoſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which ariſe from a month's confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a warm room. It is remarkable that there is hardly a period in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between the eruption and the ceaſing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013592_0013_0F91447904527DB8"/>of the menſes, in which they are not pregnant, or giving ſuck. This is the moſt natural ſtate of the conſtitution during that interval; and hence we often find it connected with the beſt ſtate of health in the women of civilized nations.</p>
            <p>THE cuſtoms peculiar to the Indian MEN, conſiſt chiefly in thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are neceſſary to preſerve animal life, and to defend their nation. Theſe employments are hunting and war, each of which is conducted in a manner that tends to call forth every fibre into exerciſe, and to enſure them the poſſeſſion of the utmoſt poſſible health. In times of plenty and peace, we ſee them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times riſing from their beloved indolence, and ſhaking off its influence by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary exerciſes of dancing and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. The Indian men ſeldom marry before they are thirty years of age: They no doubt derive conſiderable vigor from this cuſtom; for while they are ſecured by it, from the enervating effects of the premature dalliance of love, they may enſure more certain fruitfulneſs to their wives, and entail more certain health
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013592_0014_0F914479C4374110"/>upon their children. Tacitus deſcribes the ſame cuſtom among the Germans, and attributes to it the ſame good effects. <q>Sera juvenum venus, eoque inexauſta pubertas; nec virgines feſtinantur; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem juventa, ſimilis proceritas, pares validique miſcentur; ac robora paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum liberi referunt.</q> (a)</p>
            <p>AMONG the Indian men it is deemed a mark of heroiſm to bear the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite pain without complaining; upon this account they early inure themſelves to burning part of their bodies with fire, or cutting them with ſharp inſtruments. No young man can be admitted to the honors of manhood or war, who has not acquitted himſelf well in theſe trials of patience and fortitude. It is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how much this contributes to give a tenſion to the nervous ſyſtem, which renders it leſs ſubject to the occaſional cauſes of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. WE come now to ſpeak of thoſe cuſtoms which are common to both ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: Theſe are PAINTING, and the uſe of the COLD BATH. The practice of anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013592_0015_0F91447A82E8ACB8"/>the body with oil is common to the ſavages of all countries: In warm climates it is ſaid to promote longevity, by check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceſſive perſpiration. The Indians generally uſe bear's greaſe mixed with a clay; which bears the greateſt reſemblance to the color of their ſkins. This pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſerves to leſſen the ſenſibility of the extremeties of the nerves: It moreover fortifies them againſt the action of thoſe exhalations, which we ſhall mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as a conſiderable ſource of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The COLD BATH likewiſe fortifies the body, and renders it leſs ſubject to thoſe diſeaſes which ariſe from the extremes and viciſſitudes of heat and cold. We ſhall ſpeak hereafter of the Indian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of uſing it.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of ſociety among the Indians excludes the influence of moſt of thoſe paſſions which diſorder the body. The turbulent effects of anger are concealed in deep and laſting reſentments. Envy and ambition are excluded by their equality of power and property: Nor is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the perfections of the whole ſex ſhould be aſcribed to one, to induce them
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013592_0016_0F91447B40D2C508"/>to marry. <q>The weakneſs of love (ſays doctor Adam Smith) which is ſo much indulged in ages of humanity and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, is regarded among ſavages as the moſt unpardonable effeminacy. A young man would think himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced for ever, if he ſhowed the leaſt preference of one woman above another, or did not expreſs the moſt compleat indifference, both about the time when, and the perſon to whom he was to be married <note n="*" place="bottom">Theory of moral ſentiments.</note>.</q> Thus are they exempted from thoſe violent or laſting diſeaſes, which accompany the ſeveral ſtages of ſuch paſſions in both ſexes among civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized nations.</p>
            <p>IT is remarkable that there are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Indians: Some have ſuſpected from this circumſtance, that they put their deformed children to death; but nature here acts the part of an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mother. The ſeverity of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an manners deſtroys them. (b)</p>
            <p>FROM a review of the cuſtoms of the Indians, we need not be ſurpriſed at the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013592_0017_0F91447CF7DFDD10"/>ſtatelineſs, regularity of features, and dignity of aſpect by which they are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized. Where we obſerve theſe among ourſelves, there is always a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their being accompanied with health, and a ſtrong conſtitution.</p>
            <p>HAVING finiſhed our enquiry into the phyſical cuſtoms of the Indians, we ſhall proceed now to enquire into their diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>A CELEBRATED profeſſor of anatomy has aſſerted, that we could not tell by reaſoning a priori, that the body was mortal, ſo intimately woven with its tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are the principles of life. Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con declares, that the only cauſe of death which is natural to man, is that from old age; and complains of the imperfection of phyſic, in not being able to guard the principle of life, until the whole of the oil that feeds it, is conſumed. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit of this propoſition of our noble philoſopher. In the inventory of the grave in every country, we find more of the ſpoils of youth and manhood, than of age. This muſt be attributed to moral as well as phyſical cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:013592_0018_0F91447D78B8EB78"/>WE need only recollect the cuſtom among the Indians, of ſleeping in the open air in a variable climate—the alternate acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heat and cold upon their bodies, to which the warmth of their cabbins expoſes them—their long marches—their exceſſive exerciſe—their intemperance in eating, to which their long faſting, and their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic feaſts naturally prompt them: And, laſtly, the vicinity of their habitations to the banks of rivers, in order to diſcover the empire of diſeaſes among them in every ſtage of their lives. They have in vain attempted to elude the general laws of mortality, while their mode of life ſubjects them to theſe remote, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cauſes of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>FROM what we know of the action of theſe potentiae nocentes upon the human body, it will hardly be neceſſary to appeal to facts to determine that FEVERS conſtitute the only diſeaſes among the Indians. Theſe fevers are occaſioned by the ſenſible and inſenſible qualities of the air. Thoſe which are produced by cold, are of the inflammatory kind, ſuch as pleuriſies, peripneumonies, and rheumatiſms. Thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013592_0019_0F914480B30324A0"/>which are produced by the inſenſible qualities of the air, or by putrid exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, —are intermitting, —putrid, —and inflammatory, according as the exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are combined with more or leſs heat or cold. The DYSENTERY (which is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian diſeaſe) comes under the claſs of fevers. It is the febris introverſa of Dr. Sydenham.</p>
            <p>THE Indians are ſubject to ANIMAL and VEGETABLE POISONS. The effects of theſe upon the body, are in ſome degree analogous to the exhalations we have mentioned. When they do not bring on ſudden death, they produce according to their malignity, either an inflammatory or putrid fever.</p>
            <p>THE SMALL POX and the VENEREAL DISEASE were communicated to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in North-America by the Europeans. Nor can I find that they were ever ſubject to the SCURVY. Whether this was obviated by their method of preſerving their fleſh, or by their mixing it at all times with vegetables, I ſhall not undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Doctor Maclurg aſcribes to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013592_0020_0F914481E35ADB88"/>freſh meat an antiſeptic quality <note n="*" place="bottom">Experiments on the bile, and reflexions on the biliary ſecretion.</note>. The peculiar cuſtoms and manners of life among the Indians, ſeems to have exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from theſe, as well as all other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the fluids. The leproſy—elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaſis —ſcurvy—and venereal diſeaſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be different modifications of the ſame primary diſorder. The ſame cauſes produce them in every age and country. They are diverſified like plants by climate and nouriſhment. They all ſprung origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from a moiſt atmoſphere, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome diet: hence we read of their prevailing ſo much in the middle cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, when the principal parts of Europe were overflowed with water, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants lived entirely on fiſh, and a few unwholſome vegetables. The abolition of the feudal ſyſtem in Europe by introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freedom, introduced at the ſame time agriculture; which by multiplying the fruits of the earth, leſſened the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of animal food, and thus put a ſtop to theſe diſorders. The elephantiaſis is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unknown in Europe. The leproſy is confined chiefly to the low countries of Africa. The plica polonica once ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013592_0021_0F91448202813C40"/>in Poland is to be found only in books of medicine. The venereal diſeaſe will probably in a few years ceaſe to be a tax upon unlawful embraces. The ſmall pox is no longer a fatal diſorder, when the body is prepared for its reception, by a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table regimen. Even the plague itſelf is loſing its ſting. It is hardly dreaded at this time in Turky; and its very exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is preſerved there by the doctrine of fataliſm, which prevails among the inhabitants of that country. It may ſerve as a new and powerful motive againſt political ſlavery to perceive, that it is connected with thoſe diſeaſes which moſt deform and debaſe the human body. It may likewiſe ſerve to enhance the bleſſings of liberty, to trace its effects, in eradicating ſuch loathſome and deſtructive diſorders. (c)</p>
            <p>I HAVE heard of two or three caſes of the GOUT among the Indians, but it was only among thoſe who had learned the uſe of rum, from the white people. A queſtion naturally occurs here, and that is; why does not the gout appear more frequently among that claſs of people,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013592_0022_0F914482C9653278"/>who conſume the greateſt quantity of rum among ourſelves? To this I anſwer, that the effects of this liquor upon thoſe enfeebled people, are too ſudden and violent, to admit of their being thrown upon the extremities; as we know them to be among the Indians. They appear only in viſceral obſtructions, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated train of chronic diſeaſes. Thus putrid miaſmata are ſometimes too ſtrong to bring on a fever, but produce inſtant debility, and death. The Gout is ſeldom heard of in Ruſſia, Denmark or Poland. Is this occaſioned by the vigor of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion peculiar to the inhabitants of thoſe northern countries? Or is it cauſed by their exceſſive uſe of ſpirituous liquors, which produce the ſame chronic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints among them, which we ſaid were common among the lower claſs of people in this country? The ſimilarity of their diſeaſes, makes the laſt of theſe ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the moſt probable. The effects of wine, like tyrranny in a well formed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are felt firſt in the extremities; while ſpirits, like a bold invader, ſeize at once upon the vitals of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:013592_0023_0F91448388DA1530"/>I CANNOT find any accounts of diſeaſes from WORMS among the Indians. Worms are common to moſt animals; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce diſeaſes only in weak, or increaſe them in ſtrong conſtitutions.—Hence they have no place in the noſological ſyſtems of phyſic. Nor does DENTITION appear to be a diſorder among the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The facility with which the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy children of healthy parents cut their teeth, among civilized nations, gives us reaſon to conclude that the Indian chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren never ſuffer from this quarter.</p>
            <p>THE employments of the Indians ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to many accidents; hence we ſometimes read of WOUNDS, FRACTURES, and LUXATIONS among them.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus pointed out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſeaſes of the Indians, and ſhown what diſorders are foreign to them; we may venture to conclude, that FE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERS, OLD AGE, CASUALTIES and WAR are the only natural outlets of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life. War is nothing but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper; it is founded in the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of political bodies; juſt as fevers are
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013592_0024_0F9144844570EDD8"/>founded on the weakneſs of the animal body.—Providence in theſe diſeaſes ſeems to act like a mild legiſlature, which miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates the ſeverity of death, by inflicting it in a manner the leaſt painful upon the whole, to the patient and the ſurvivors.</p>
            <p>LET us now enquire into the REMEDIES of the Indians. Theſe like their diſeaſes are ſimple, and few in number. Among the firſt of them we ſhall mention the POWERS of NATURE. Fevers we ſaid formerly, conſtituted the chief of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes among the Indians; they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in the hands of nature, the principal inſtruments to remove the evils which threaten her diſſolution; (d) but the event of theſe efforts of nature, no doubt, ſoon convinced the Indians of the danger of truſting her in all caſes; and hence in the earlieſt accounts we have of their manners, we read of perſons who were intruſted with the office of phyſicians.</p>
            <p>IT will be difficult to find out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act order, in which the Indian remedies were ſuggeſted by nature; or diſcovered by art; nor will it be eaſy to arrange them in proper order. I ſhall however attempt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013592_0025_0F91448557DE7D28"/>it, by reducing them to NATURAL, and ARTIFICIAL.</p>
            <p>To the claſs of NATURAL REMEDIES belongs the Indian practice, of abſtracting from their patients all kinds of ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliment. The compliance of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians with this dictate of nature, in the early ſtage of a diſorder, no doubt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents in many caſes, their being obliged to uſe any other remedy. They follow nature ſtill cloſer, in allowing their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to drink plentifully of cold water; this being the only liquor a patient calls for in a fever.</p>
            <p>SWEATING is likewiſe a natural reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It was probably ſuggeſted by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fevers to be terminated by it. I ſhall not enquire how far theſe ſweats are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the criſis of fevers. The Indian mode of procuring this evacuation is as follows; the patient is confined in a cloſe tent, or wigwam, over a hole in the earth, in which a red hot ſtone is placed; a quantity of water is thrown upon this ſtone, which inſtantly involves the patient in a cloud of vapour and ſweat; in this
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013592_0026_0F91448993C77DE8"/>ſituation he ruſhes out, and plunges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a river; from whence he retires to his bed. If the remedy has been uſed with ſucceſs, he riſes from his bed in four and twenty hours, perfectly recovered from his indiſpoſition. This remedy is uſed not only to cure fevers, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that uneaſineſs which ariſes from fatigue of body.</p>
            <p>A THIRD natural remedy among the Indians, is PURGING. The fruits of the earth, the fleſh of birds, and other animals feeding upon particular vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and above all, the ſpontaneous efforts of nature, early led the Indians to perceive the neceſſity and advantages of this evacuation.</p>
            <p>VOMITS conſtitute their fourth natural remedy. They were probably like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſuggeſted by nature, and accident. The ipecacuana is one of the many roots they employ, for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THE ARTIFICIAL REMEDIES made uſe of by the Indians, are BLEEDING, CAUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICS, and ASTRINGENT medicines. They confine bleeding entirely to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013592_0027_0F91448B52366250"/>To know that opening a vein in the arm, or foot, would relieve a pain in the head, or ſide, ſuppoſes ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the animal oeconomy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marks an advanced period in the hiſtory of medicine.</p>
            <p>SHARP ſtones and thorns, are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments they uſe, to procure a diſcharge of blood.</p>
            <p>WE have an account of the Indians uſing ſomething like a POTENTIAL CAUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIC, in obſtinate pains. It conſiſts of a piece of rotten wood, called <hi>punk,</hi> which they place upon the part affected, and afterwards ſet it on fire; the fire gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually conſumes the wood, and its aſhes burn a hole in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>THE undue efforts of nature, in thoſe fevers which are connected with a diarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoea, or dyſentry, together with thoſe hemorrhages to which their mode of life expoſed them, neceſſarily led them to an early diſcovery of ſome ASTRINGENT VEGETABLES. I am uncertain whether the Indians rely upon aſtringent, or
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013592_0028_0F91448D06532400"/>any other vegetables, for the cure of the intermitting fever. This diſeaſe among them probably requires no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies than the cold bath, or cold air. Its greater obſtinacy, as well as frequency among ourſelves, muſt be ſought for in the greater feebleneſs of our conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and in that change which our country has undergone, from meadows— mill-dams—and the cutting down of woods; whereby morbid exhalations have been multiplied, and their paſſage rendered more free, through every part of the country. (e)</p>
            <p>THIS is a ſhort account of the remedies of the Indians. If they are ſimple, they are like their eloquence, full of ſtrength; if they are few in number, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, as their languages are to their ideas, to the whole of their diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>WE ſaid formerly that the Indians were ſubject to ACCIDENTS, ſuch as wounds—fractures—and the like. In theſe caſes, nature performs the office of a ſurgeon. We may judge of her qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for this office, by obſerving the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013592_0029_0F914401BA006B50"/>marks of wounds, and fractures, which are ſometimes diſcovered on wild ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. But further, what is the practice of our modern ſurgeons in theſe caſes? Is it not to lay aſide plaſters and oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and truſt the whole to nature? Thoſe ulcers which require the aſſiſtance of mercury, bark, and a particular regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are unknown to the Indians.</p>
            <p>THEIR practice of attempting to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver DROWNED PEOPLE, is irrational and unſucceſsful. It conſiſts in ſuſpending the patient by the heels, in order that the water may flow from his mouth. This practice is founded on a belief, that the patient dies from ſwallowing an exceſſive quantity of water. But modern obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion teaches us, that, drowned people die of an apoplexy. This diſcovery naturally ſuggeſts a method of cure, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to that in uſe among the Indians; and ſhows us that the practice of ſuſpending by the heels is hurtful.</p>
            <p>WE have heard much of their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic antidotes to the VENEREAL DISEASE. In the accounts of theſe antivenereal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013592_0030_0F91440279FF6980"/>ſome abatement ſhould be made for that love of the marvellous, and of novelty, which are apt to creep into the writings of travellers, and phyſicians. How many medicines which were once thought infallible in this diſorder, are now rejected from the materia medica! I have found upon enquiry, that the Indians always aſſiſt their medicines in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by a regimen which promotes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. Should we allow that mercury acts as a ſpecific in deſtroying this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, it does not follow that it is proof againſt the efficacy of medicines which act more mechanically upon the body. (f)</p>
            <p>THERE cannot be a ſtronger mark of the imperfect ſtate of knowledge in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine among the Indians, than their method of treating the SMALL-POX. We are told that they plunge themſelves in cold water, in the beginning of the diſorder, and that it generally proves fatal to them.</p>
            <p>TRAVELLERS ſpeak in high terms of the Indian ANTIDOTES to POISONS. We muſt remember, that many things have been
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013592_0031_0F914403742BCA08"/>thought poiſonous, which later experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath proved to poſſeſs no unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome quality. Moreover the uncertainty and variety in the operation of poiſons, render it extremely difficult to fix the certainty of their antidotes, to them. How many ſpecifics have derived their credit for preventing the hydrophobia, from perſons being wounded by animals, who were not in a ſituation to produce that diſorder! IF we may judge of all the Indian antidotes to poiſons, by thoſe which have fallen into our hands, we have little reaſon to aſcribe much to them in any caſes whatever.</p>
            <p>I HAVE heard of their performing ſeveral remarkable cures upon STIFF JOINTS, by an infuſion of certain herbs in water.— The mixture of ſeveral herbs together in this infuſion calls in queſtion the ſpecific efficacy of each of them. I cannot help attributing the whole ſucceſs of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, to the great heat of the water, in which the herbs were boiled; and to its being applied a long time to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. We find the ſame medicine to vary frequently in its ſucceſs, according
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013592_0032_0F914406685E9070"/>to its ſtrength, or to the continuance of its application. De Haen attributes the good effects of electricity, entirely to its being uſed for ſeveral months.</p>
            <p>We are ſometimes amuſed with accounts of Indian remedies for the DROPSY—EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEPSY—COLIC—GRAVEL and GOUT. If with all the advantages which modern phyſicians derive from their knowledge in ANATOMY—CHEMISTRY—BOTANY and PHILOSOPHY, if with the benefit of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries communicated from abroad, as well as handed down from our anceſtors, by more certain methods than tradition, we are ſtill ignorant of certain remedies for theſe diſeaſes; what can we expect from the Indians, who are not only deprived of theſe advantages, but want our chief motive, the ſenſe of the pain and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of thoſe diſorders, to prompt them to ſeek for ſuch remedies to relieve them? There cannot be a ſtronger proof of their ignorance of proper remedies for new or difficult diſeaſes, than their having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to enchantment. But to be more particular; I have taken pains to enquire
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013592_0033_0F91440793186998"/>into the ſucceſs of ſome of theſe Indian ſpecifics, and have never heard of one well atteſted caſe of their efficacy. I believe they derive all their credit from our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of their compoſition. The influence of ſecrecy is well known in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the credit of a medicine. The ſal ſeignet was an infallible medicine for the intermitting fever, while the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of it was confined to an apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary at Rochelle; but it loſt its virtues as ſoon as it was found to be compoſed of the ſalt of tartar, and a foſſil alkali. Doctor Ward's famous pill and drop, ceaſed to do wonders in ſcrophulous caſes, as ſoon as he bequeathed to the world his receipts for making them.</p>
            <p>I FORESEE an objection to what has been ſaid concerning the remedies of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, drawn from that knowledge which experience gives to a mind intent upon one ſubject. We have heard much of the perfection of their ſenſes of ſeeing and hearing. An Indian we are told, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover not only a particular tribe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians by their footſteps, but the diſtance of time in which they were made. In
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013592_0034_0F914407D11784D0"/>thoſe branches of knowledge which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to hunting and war, the Indians have accquired a degree of perfection that has not been equalled by civilized nations. But we muſt remember that medicine among them does not enjoy the like advantage, the arts of war and hunting, of being the chief object of their attention. The phyſician and the warrior are united in one character; to render him as able in the former, as he is in the latter profeſſion, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an entire abſtraction from every other employment, and a familiarity with external objects, which are incompatible with the wandering life of ſavages.</p>
            <p>THUS have we finiſhed our enquiry into the diſeaſes and remedies of the Indians in North-America.—We come now to enquire into the diſeaſes and remedies of civilized nations.</p>
            <p>NATIONS differ in their, degrees of civilization. We ſhall ſelect one for the ſubject of our enquiries which is moſt familiar to us; I mean the Britiſh Nation. Here we behold ſubordination and claſſes
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013592_0035_0F9144089921E238"/>of mankind eſtabliſhed by government—commerce—manufactures, and certain cuſtoms common to moſt of the civilized nations of Europe. We ſhall trace the origin of their diſeaſes through their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, in the ſame manner as we did thoſe of the Indians.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IT will be ſufficient to name the degrees of heat — the improper aliment —the tight dreſſes, and the premature ſtudies children are expoſed to, in order to ſhow the ample ſcope for diſeaſes, which is added to the original defect of ſtamina, they derive from their anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p n="2">II. CIVILIZATION riſes in its demands upon the health of women. Their faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their dreſs and diet—their eager purſuits and ardent enjoyment of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—their indolence and undue eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations in pregnancy—their cordials —hot regimen and neglect or uſe of art, in child-birth, are all ſo many inlets to diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>HUMANITY would fain be ſilent, while philoſophy calls upon us to mention the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013592_0036_0F9144094F506130"/>effects of intereſted marriages—of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in love, encreaſed by that concealment which the tyranny of cuſtom has impoſed upon the ſex; and laſtly, the effects of the long delay of the marriage bed. (g) All theſe exaggerate the natural, and encreaſe the number of artificial diſeaſes among women.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE diſeaſes introduced by civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization extend themſelves through every claſs and profeſſion among men. How fatal are the effects of idleneſs and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance among the rich—and of hard labor and penury among the poor! What palid looks are contracted by the votaries of ſcience from hanging over the "ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taper." How many diſeaſes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon manufacturers, by the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials in which they work, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their bodies! What monkiſh diſeaſes do we obſerve from monkiſh continence, and monkiſh vices! We paſs over the increaſe of accidents from build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—ſailing— riding and the like. War as if too ſlow in deſtroying the human ſpecies, calls in a train of diſeaſes pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to civilized nations. What havoc
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013592_0037_0F914409F9B894B0"/>have the corruption and monopoly of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions—a damp ſoil, and an unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſky, made in a few days in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my! The atchievements of britiſh valor at the Havannah, in the laſt war, were obtained at the expence of 9,000 men, 7,000 of whom periſhed with the Weſt-India fever. (h) Even our modern diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in geography, by extending the empire of commerce, have likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the empire of diſeaſes. What deſolation have the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies made, of Britiſh ſubjects! It has been found upon a nice calculation, that only ten of an hundred Europeans, live above ſeven years after they arrive in the iſland of Jamaica. (i)</p>
            <p n="4">IV. IT would take up too much of our time to point out all the cuſtoms both <hi>phyſical</hi> and <hi>moral,</hi> which influence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes among both ſexes. The former have engendred the ſeeds of diſeaſes, in the human body itſelf; hence the origin of catarrhs—jail and miliary fevers; with a long train of contagious diſorders, which compoſe ſo great a part of our books of medicine. The latter likewiſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013592_0038_0F91440AC8C8A840"/>have a large ſhare in producing diſeaſes. I am not one of thoſe modern philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who derive the vices of mankind from the influence of civilization: but I am ſafe in aſſerting, that their number and malignity encreaſe with the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of poliſhed life. To prove this, we need only ſurvey a ſcene too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to affect us: it is a bedlam, which injuſtice — inhumanity — avarice— pride — vanity and ambition have filled with inhabitants.</p>
            <p>THUS have we briefly pointed out the cuſtoms which influence the diſeaſes of civilized nations. It remains now that we take notice of their diſeaſes. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming the many new fevers, fluxes, haemorrhages, ſwellings from water, wind, fleſh, fat, pus and blood; foulneſſes on the ſkin from cancers, lepras, yaws, poxes, itch; and laſtly, the gout, the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria, and the hypochondriaſis, in all their variety of known and unknown ſhapes: I ſhall ſum all that is neceſſary upon this ſubject by adding, that the number of diſeaſes which belong to civilized nations, according to Doctor Cullen's noſology,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013592_0039_0F91440B8D813AC8"/>amounts to 1,387: the ſingle claſs of nervous diſeaſes form 612 of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>BEFORE we proceed to ſpeak of the remedies of civilized nations, we ſhall examine into the abilities of NATURE in curing their diſeaſes. We found her active and ſucceſsful in curing the diſeaſes of the Indians. Is her ſtrength, wiſdom, or benignity, equal to the encreaſe of thoſe dangers which threaten her diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution among civilized nations? In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to anſwer this queſtion, it will be neceſſary to explain the meaning of the term nature.</p>
            <p>BY NATURE, in the preſent caſe, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing but phyſical neceſſity: this at once excludes every thing like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from her operations: theſe are all performed in obedience to the ſame laws, which govern vegetation in plants and the inteſtine motions of foſſils: they are as truly mechanical as the laws of gravitation, electricity, or magnetiſm. A ſhip when laid on her broadſide by a wave, or a ſudden blaſt of wind, riſes
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013592_0040_0F91440C44CF4ED8"/>by the ſimple laws of her mechaniſm: but ſuppoſe this ſhip to be attacked by fire, or a water-ſpout, we are not to call in queſtion the ſkill of the ſhip-builder, if ſhe is conſumed by the one, or ſunk by the other. In like manner the author of nature hath furniſhed the body with powers to preſerve itſelf from its natural enemies; but when it is attacked by thoſe civil foes which are bred by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar cuſtoms of civilization, it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a company of Indians, armed with bows and arrows, againſt the complicated and deadly machinery of fire-arms. To place this ſubject in a proper light, we ſhall deliver a hiſtory of the operations of nature in a few of the diſeaſes of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized nations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THERE are caſes in which nature is ſtill ſucceſsful in curing diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>IN fevers ſhe ſtill deprives us of our appetite for animal food, and imparts to us a deſire for cool air and cold water.</p>
            <p>IN haemorrhages ſhe produces a fainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which occaſions a coagulum in the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013592_0041_0F91440D01D64A88"/>open veſſels; ſo that the further paſſage of blood through them is obſtructed.</p>
            <p>IN wounds of the fleſh and bones, ſhe diſcharges foreign matter by exciting an inflammation, and ſupplies the waſte of both with new fleſh and bone.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THERE are caſes where the efforts of nature are too feeble to do ſervice, as in putrid and nervous fevers.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THERE are caſes where the efforts of nature are over-proportioned to the ſtrength of the diſeaſe, as in the cholera morbus and dyſentery.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THERE are caſes where nature is idle, as in the atonic ſtages of the gout, the cancer, the epilepſy the mania, the venereal diſeaſe, the apoplexy and the tetanus.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoffman de Hypotheſium Medicarum Damno Sect. xv.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. THERE are caſes in which nature does miſchief. She waſtes herſelf with an uneceſſary fever, in a dropſy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. She throws a plethora upon
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013592_0042_0F91440E114AF8B0"/>the brains and lungs. She ends a pleuriſy and peripneumony in a vomica, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piema. She creates an unnatural appetite for food in the hypochondriac diſorder. And laſtly ſhe drives the melancholy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to ſolitude, where by brooding over the ſubject of his inſanity, he encreaſes his diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>WE are accuſtomed to hear of the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary kindneſs of nature in alarming us with pain, to prompt us to ſeek for a remedy. But,</p>
            <p n="6">VI. THERE are caſes in which ſhe refuſes to ſend this harbinger of the evils which threaten her, as in the aneuriſm, ſcirrhus, and ſtone of the bladder.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. THERE are caſes where the pain is not proportioned to the danger, as in the tetanus, conſumption and dropſy of the head. And,</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. THERE are caſes where the pain is over-proportioned to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as in the paronychia and tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:013592_0043_0F91440E9131E2D0"/>THIS is a ſhort account of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature, in the diſeaſes of civilized nations. A lunatic might as well plead againſt the ſequeſtration of his eſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he once enjoyed the full exerciſe of his reaſon, or becauſe he ſtill had lucid intervals, as nature be exempted from the charges we have brought againſt her.</p>
            <p>BUT this ſubject will receive ſtrength from conſidering the REMEDIES of civiliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nations. All the products of the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, foſſil and animal kingdoms, tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by heat and mixture into an almoſt infinite variety of forms; bleeding, cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, artificial drains by ſetons, iſſues, and bliſters; exerciſe active and paſſive; voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and journies; baths warm and cold, waters ſaline aerial and mineral, food by weight and meaſure, the royal touch, inchantment, miracles, in a word, the combined diſcoveries of natural hiſtory and philoſophy, united into a ſyſtem of materia medica, all ſhow, that although phyſicians are in ſpeculation the ſervants, yet in practice they are the maſters of nature. The whole of their remedies ſeem
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013592_0044_0F914411B4BECAD8"/>contrived on purpoſe to arouſe, aſſiſt reſtrain and controul her operations.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome truths like certain liquors which require ſtrong heads to bear them. I feel myſelf protected from the prejudices of vulgar minds, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that I am delivering theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a ſociety of philoſophers.</p>
            <p>LET us now take a COMPARITIVE VIEW of the diſeaſes and remedies of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, with thoſe of civilized nations. We ſhall begin with their diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>IN our account of the diſeaſes of the Indians we beheld death executing his commiſſion, it is true; but then his dart was hid in a mantle, under which he concealed his ſhape. But among civiliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nations we behold him multiplying his weapons in proportion to the number of organs and functions in the body; and pointing each of them in ſuch a manner, as to render his meſſengers more terrible than himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:013592_0045_0F9144136689EBC8"/>WE ſaid formerly that fevers conſtituted the chief diſeaſes of the Indians. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dr. Sydenham's computation above 66,000 out of 100,000 died of fevers in London about 100 years ago; but fevers now conſtitute but a little more than one tenth part of the diſeaſes of that city. Out of 21,780 perſons who died in London between December 1770 and December 1771, only 2273 died of ſimple fevers. I have more than once heard Dr. Huck complain, that he could find no marks of epidemic fevers in London as deſcribed by Dr. Sydenham. London has undergone a revolution in its manners and cuſtoms ſince Dr. Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's time. New diſeaſes, the offspring of luxury, have ſupplanted fevers; and the few that are left, appear ſo complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other diſeaſes, that their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can no longer be diſcovered with an epedemic conſtitution of the year. The pleuriſy and periupneumony, thoſe inflammatory fevers of ſtrong conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are now loſt in catarrhs, or colds; which inſtead of challenging the powers of nature or art to a fair combat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013592_0046_0F914414AAACA6F0"/>undermine the conſtitution, and bring on an incurable conſumption. Out of 22,434 who died between December 1769 and the ſame month in 1770, 4594 periſhed with that britiſh diſorder. Our countryman Dr. Maclurg has ventured to foretel that the Gout will be loſt in a few years, in a train of hypochondriac, hyſteric and bilious diſorders. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may we not look for a ſeaſon when fevers, the natural diſeaſes of the human body, will be loſt in an inundation of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial diſeaſes, brought on by the modiſh practices of modern civilization?</p>
            <p>IT may not be improper to compare the PROGNOSIS of the Indians, in diſeaſes, with that of civilized nations, before we take a comparative view of their remedies.</p>
            <p>THE Indians are ſaid to be ſucceſsful in predicting the events of diſeaſes. While diſeaſes are ſimple, the marks which diſtinguiſh them, or characterize their ſeveral ſtages, are generally uniform and obvious to the moſt indifferent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. Theſe marks afford ſo much
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013592_0047_0F91441549F3E1D0"/>certainty, that the Indians ſometimes kill their phyſicians for a falſe prognoſis, charging the death of the patient to his careleſſneſs, or ignorance. They eſtimate the danger of their patients by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of appetite; while an Indian is able to eat, he is looked upon as free from danger. But when we conſider the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and variety in the ſigns of diſeaſes, among civilized nations, together with the ſhortneſs of life, the fallacy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and the uncertainty of obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; where ſhall we find a phyſician will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to riſk his reputation, much leſs his life, upon the prediction of the event of our acute diſeaſes? We can derive no advantage from the ſimple ſign, by which the Indians eſtimate the danger of their patients; for we daily ſee a want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for food in diſeaſes which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no danger; and we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerve an unuſual degree of this appetite to precede the agonies of death. I honour the name of HIPPOCRATES: But forgive me ye votaries of antiquity, if I attempt to pluck a few grey hairs from his venerable head. I was once an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his altar, nor did I turn apoſtate
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013592_0048_0F9144160CA8F780"/>from his worſhip, till I was taught, that not a tenth part of his prognoſtics correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with modern experience, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. (k) The pulſe, (l) urine (m) and ſweats (n) from which the principal ſigns of life and death have been taken, are ſo variable in moſt of the acute diſeaſes of civilized nations, that the wiſeſt phyſicians have in ſome meaſure excluded the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſis, from being a part of their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>I AM here inſenſibly led to make an apology for the inſtability of the theories, and practice of phyſic. The theory of phyſic is founded upon the laws of the animal oeconomy. Theſe (unlike the laws of the mind, or the common laws of matter) do not appear at once, but are gradually brought to light, by the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomina of diſeaſes. The ſucceſs of nature, in curing the ſimple diſeaſes of Saxony, laid the foundation for the ANIMA MEDICA of Dr. STAHL. The endemicks of Holland (o) led Dr. BOERHAAVE to ſeek for the cauſes of all diſeaſes in the FLUIDS. And the univerſal prevalence of the diſeaſes of the NERVES, in Great-Britain, led Dr. CULLEN to diſcover their
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013592_0049_0F914416EDC558A0"/>peculiar laws, and to found a SYSTEM upon them. A ſyſtem, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably laſt till ſome new diſeaſes are let looſe upon the human ſpecies, which ſhall unfold other laws of the animal oeconomy!</p>
            <p>IT is in conſequence of this fluctuation in the principles, and practice of phyſic, being ſo neceſſarily connected with the changes in the cuſtoms of civilized nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that old and young phyſicians ſo often diſagree, in their opinions and practices. And it is by attending to the conſtant changes in theſe cuſtoms of civilized nations, that thoſe phyſicians have generally become the moſt eminent, who have ſooneſt emancipated themſelves from the tyranny of the ſchools of phyſic; and have occaſionly accomodat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their principles, and practice, to the changes in diſeaſes. (p) This variety in diſeaſes, which is produced by the changes in the cuſtoms of civilized nations, will enable us to account for many of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions which are to be found in authors of equal candor, and abilities, who have written of the materia medica.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:013592_0050_0F91441796EE29B8"/>IN forming a comparative view of the REMEDIES of the Indians, with thoſe of civilized nations, we ſhall remark, that the want of ſucceſs in a medicine, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by one of the following cauſes.</p>
            <p>FIRST, our ignorance of the diſorder. Secondly, an ignorance of a ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Thirdly, a want of efficacy in the remedy.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERING the violence of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Indians, it is probable their want of ſucceſs, is always occaſioned by a want of efficacy in their medicines. But the caſe is very different among civilized nations. Diſſections daily convince us of our ignorance of the ſeats of diſeaſes, and cauſe us to bluſh at our preſcriptions. What certain or equal remedies have we found for the gout, the epilepſy, apoplexy, palſy, dropſy of the brain, cancer and conſumption? How often are we diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in our expectations, from the the moſt certain and powerful of our remedies, by the negligence or obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our patients! What miſchief have we not done under the belief of falſe
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013592_0051_0F91441838A36B90"/>facts, and falſe theories! We have aſſiſted in multiplying diſeaſes.—We have done more—we have increaſed their mortality. (q)—</p>
            <p>I SHALL not pauſe to beg pardon of the faculty, for acknowledging in this public manner the weakneſſes of our profeſſion. I am purſuing truth, and while I can keep my eye fixed upon my guide—I am indifferent whiter I am led, provided ſhe is my leader.</p>
            <p>BUT further, the Indian ſubmits to his diſeaſe, without one fearful emotion, from his doubtfulneſs of its event; and at laſt meets his fate without an anxious wiſh for futurity; except it is of being admitted to an "equal ſky" where
<q>"His faithful dog ſhall bear him company."</q>
But among civilized nations, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a falſe religion in good, and of a true religion in bad men, has converted even the fear of death into a diſeaſe. It is this original diſtemper of the imagination which renders the plague moſt fatal, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its firſt appearance in a country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:013592_0052_0F91441B5C68CBF0"/>UNDER all theſe diſadvantages, in the ſtate of medicine, among civilized nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do more in proportion die of the diſeaſes peculiar to them, than of fevers, cauſualties and old age, among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians? If we take our account from the city of London, we ſhall find this to be the caſe. Near a twentieth part of its inhabitants periſh one year with another. Nor does the natural increaſe of inhabitants ſupply this yearly waſte. If we judge from the bills of mortality, the city of London contains fewer inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, by ſeveral thouſands, than it did forty years ago. It appears from this fact, and many others of a like nature, which might be adduced, that although the difficulty of ſupporting children, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome peculiar cuſtoms of the Indians, which we mentioned, limit their number; yet they multiply faſter, and die in a ſmaller proportion than civilized nations, under the circumſtances we have deſcribed. The Indians we are told were numerous in this country, before the Europeans ſettled among them. Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers agree likewiſe in deſcribing numbers
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013592_0053_0F91441CAE0BBC28"/>of both ſexes, who exhibited all the marks of extreme old age. It is remarkable that age ſeldom impairs the faculties of their minds.</p>
            <p>THE mortality peculiar to thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian tribes who have mingled with the white people muſt be aſcribed to the extenſive miſchief of ſpirituous liquors. When theſe have not acted, they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from having accomodated themſelves too ſuddenly to the European diet, dreſs, and manners. It does not become us to pry too much into futurity; but if we may judge from the fate of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal natives of Hiſpaniola, Jamaica, and the provinces on the continent, we may venture to foretel, that, in proportion as the white people multiply, the Indians will diminiſh; ſo that in a few centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they will probabl be entirely extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. (r)</p>
            <p>IT may be ſaid, that health among the Indians, like inſenſibility to cold and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is proportioned to their need of it; and that the leſs degrees, or entire
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013592_0054_0F91441CC9E9C010"/>want of health are no interruption to the ordinary buſineſs of civilized life.</p>
            <p>To obviate this ſuppoſition we ſhall firſt attend to the effects of a ſingle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper in thoſe people, who are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal wheels in the machine of civil ſociety. Juſtice has ſtopt its current— victories have been loſt—wars have been prolonged, and embaſſies delayed, by the principal actors in theſe departments of government, being ſuddenly laid up with a ſit of the gout. How many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are daily committed againſt the rules of good breeding, by the tedious hiſtories of our diſorders, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo great a part of modern conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation! What ſums of money have been laviſhed in foreign countries in purſuit of health! (s) Families have been ruined by the unavoidable expences of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and watering places. In a word, the ſwarms of beggars which infeſt ſo many of the European countries, urge their petitions for charity chiefly by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments derived from real or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit diſeaſes, which render them incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſupporting themſelves. (t)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:013592_0055_0F91441D78A37748"/>BUT may not civilization while it abates the violence of natural diſeaſes, increaſe the lenity of thoſe that are arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; in the ſame manner that it leſſens the ſtrength of natural vices by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them? To anſwer this queſtion, it will only be neceſſary to aſk another: Who would exchange the heat, thirſt and uneaſineſs of a fever, for one ſit of the colic or ſtone?</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of the number, combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and faſhions of the remedies we have given, may ſerve to humble the pride of philoſophy; and to convince us that with all the advantages of the whole circle of ſciences, we are ſtill ignorant of antidotes to the chief of the diſeaſes of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized nations. We ſometimes ſooth our ignorance by reproaching our idleneſs in not inveſtigating the remedies peculiar to this country. We are taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that every herb that grows in our woods, is poſſeſſed of ſome medicinal virtue, and that heaven would be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in benignity if our country did not produce remedies, for all the different diſeaſes of its inhabitants. (u) It would
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013592_0056_0F91441F2BD75BB0"/>be arrogating too much to ſuppoſe, that man was the only creature in our world for whom vegetables grow. The beaſts, birds and inſects, derive their ſuſtenance either directly, or indirectly from them; while many of them were probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from their variety in figure, foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and color, only to ſerve as ornaments for our globe. It would ſeem ſtrange that the author of nature ſhould furniſh every ſpot of ground, with medicines adapted to the diſeaſes of its inhabitants, and at the ſame time deny it the more neceſſary articles of food and cloathing. I know not whether heaven has provided every country with antidotes even to the <hi>natural</hi> diſeaſes of its inhabitants. The intermitting fever is common in almoſt every corner of the globe. But a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign remedy for it has been diſcovered only in South-America. The combination of bitter and aſtringent ſubſtances which ſerve as a ſuccedaneum to the Peruvian bark is as much a preparation of art, as calomel, or tartar emetic. Societies ſtand in need of each other as much as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals: and the goodneſs of the deity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unimpeached when we ſuppoſe,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013592_0057_0F91441FC2A5D370"/>that he intended medicines to ſerve (with other articles) to promote that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, humanity and politeneſs among the inhabitants of the earth, which have been ſo juſtly attributed to commerce. (w)</p>
            <p>WE have no diſcoveries in the materia medica, to hope for from the Indians in North-America. It would be a reproach to our ſchools of phyſic, if modern phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians were not more ſucceſsful than the Indians, even in the treatment of their own diſeaſes. (x)</p>
            <p>DO the bleſſings of civilization com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the ſacrifice we make of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral health, as well as of natural liberty? This queſtion muſt be anſwered under ſome limitations. When natural liberty is given up for laws, which enſlave inſtead of protecting us, we are immenſe loſers by the exchange. Thus, if we arm the whole elements againſt our health, and render every pore in the body an avenue for a diſeaſe, we pay too high a price for the bleſſings of civilization.</p>

               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:013592_0058_0F914420801FC8B8"/>IN governments which have departed entirely from their ſimplicity, partial evils are to be cured by nothing, but an entire renovation of their conſtitution. Let the world bear with the profeſſions of law—phyſic—and divinity, and let the lawyer, phyſician and divine yet learn to bear with each other. They are all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in the preſent ſtate of ſociety. In like manner, let the woman of faſhion, forget the delicacy of her ſex, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be delivered by a man-midwife. (y) —Let her ſnatch her offspring from her breaſt, and ſend it to repair the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of its ſtamina, with the milk of a ruddy cottager. (z) Let art ſupply the place of nature in the preparation and digeſtion of all our aliment. (a a) Let our fine ladies keep up their color with carmine, (b b) and their ſpirits with rata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fia; and let our fine gentlemen, defend themſelves from the exceſſes of heat, and cold, with lavender and hartſhorn. Theſe cuſtoms have become neceſſary in the corrupt ſtages of ſociety. We muſt imitate in theſe caſes, the practice of thoſe phyſicians who conſult the appetite only,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013592_0059_0F91442191F25470"/>in diſeaſes which do not admit of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of a country in point of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, temperance and induſtry, is ſo connected with its diſeaſes, that a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable idea may be formed of it, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over its bills of mortality. HOSPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TALS, with all their boaſted advantages, exhibit at the ſame time monuments of the charity and depravity of a people. (c c) The opulence of phyſicians, and the diviſions of their offices, into thoſe of ſurgery, pharmacy and midwifery, are likewiſe proofs of the declining ſtate of a country. In the infancy of the Roman Empire, the prieſt performed the office of a phyſician; ſo ſimple were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practice of phyſic. It was only in the declenſion of the empire that phyſicians vied with the emperors of Rome in magnificence and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. (d d)</p>
            <p>I AM ſorry to add in this place, that the number of patients in the HOSPITAL (e e) and incurables in the ALMS-HOUSE of this city ſhow, that we are treading in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013592_0060_0F914425876376D8"/>the enervated ſteps of our fellow ſubjects in Britain. Our bills of mortality like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhow the encroachments of Britiſh diſeaſes upon us. The NERVOUS FEVER has become ſo familiar to us, that we look upon it as a natural diſeaſe. Dr. Sydenham ſo faithful in his hiſtory of fevers, takes no notice of it. Dr. Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader informed me, that it made its firſt appearance in this city, about five and twenty years ago. It will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to name the CONSUMPTION with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recalling to our minds the memory of ſome friend, or relation, who has pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed within theſe few years by that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Its rapid progreſs among us has been unjuſtly attributed to the growing reſemblance of our climate to that of Great-Britain. (f f) The HYSTERIC and HYPOCHONDRIAC DISORDERS, once pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the chambers of the great, are now to be found in our kitchens, and workſhops. All theſe diſeaſes have been produced by our having deſerted the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diet, and manners, of our anceſtors. (g g).</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:013592_0061_0F914426EF005558"/>THE bleſſings of literature, commerce and religion, were not <hi>originally</hi> purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the expence of health. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete enjoyment of health is as compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with civilization, as the enjoyment of civil liberty. We read of countries, rich in every thing that can form national hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and national grandeur, the diſeaſes of which are nearly as few and ſimple as thoſe of the Indians. We hear of no diſeaſes among the Jews, while they were under their democratical form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except ſuch as were inflicted by a ſupernatural power.(h h) We ſhould be tempted to doubt the accounts given of the populouſneſs of that people, did we not ſee the practice of their ſimple cuſtoms, producing nearly the ſame populouſneſs in Egypt, Rome, and other countries of antiuqity. The empire of China, it is ſaid contains more inhabitants than the whole of Europe. The political inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that country have exempted its Inhabitants from a large ſhare of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of other civilized nations. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Swiſſerland, Denmark, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (i i) and Sweden, enjoy the chief advantages of civilization without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013592_0062_0F914427542C8D00"/>ſurrendered for them the bleſſings of natural health. But it is unneceſſary to appeal to antient or remote nations to prove, that health is not incompatible with civilization. The inhabitants of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of New-England, particularly the province of Connecticut, are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to artificial diſeaſes.—Some of you may remember the time, and our fathers have told thoſe of us who do not, when the diſeaſes of PENNSYLVANIA were as few and as ſimple as thoſe of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The food of the inhabitants was then ſimple: their only drink was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: their appetites were reſtrained by labor: religion excluded the influence of ſickening paſſions: private hoſpitality ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the want of a public hoſpital: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was their only nurſe: temperance their principal phyſician. But I muſt not dwell upon this retroſpect of primeval manners: and I am too ſtrongly impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a hope of a revival of ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py days, to pronounce them the golden age of our province.</p>
            <p>OUR eſteem for the cuſtoms of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage neighbours will be leſſened when
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013592_0063_0F914428096388B0"/>we add, that civilization does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the honors of old age. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of old people is much greater among civilized, than among ſavage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It would be eaſy to decide this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in our favor, by appealing to facts in the natural hiſtories of Britain, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Sweden, the province of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, and ſeveral of the Weſt-India iſlands. (k k)</p>
            <p>THE laws of decency and nature, are not neceſſarily aboliſhed by the cuſtoms of civilized nations. In many of theſe, we read of women among whom nature alone ſtill performs the office of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife (l l)—and who feel the obligations of ſuckling their children, to be equally binding with the common obligations of morality.</p>
            <p>CIVILIZATION does not render us leſs fit for the neceſſary hardſhips of war. We read of armies of civilized nations, who have endured degrees of cold, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fatigue, which have not been exceeded by the ſavages of any country. (m m)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:013592_0064_0F914428D4F8D5E0"/>CIVILIZATION does not always multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the avenues of death. It appears from the bills of mortality, of many countries, that fewer in proportion die among civilized, than among ſavage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.(n n)</p>
            <p>EVEN the charms of beauty are not neceſſarily given up in civilization. We read of ſtatelineſs, proportion, and fine complexions in both ſexes, forming the principal outlines of national characters.</p>
            <p>THE danger of many diſeaſes, is not proportioned to their violence, but to their duration. America has advanced but a few paces in luxury and effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. There is yet ſtrength enough in her vitals, to give life to thoſe parts which are decayed. She may recal her ſteps. —For this purpoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">I. LET our children be educated in a manner more agreeable to nature.</p>
            <p n="2">II. LET the common people (who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the wealth and ſtrength of our country) be preſerved from the effects of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013592_0065_0F91442A86369768"/>intemperance. The increaſe of the price of ſpirituous liquors for this purpoſe, is a remedy as unequal to the deſign, as it is deſtructive to liberty and commerce. Sir William Temple tells us, that in Spain no man can be admitted as an evidence in court, who has once been convicted of drunkenneſs. I do not call for ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a law in this country. Let us firſt try the force of ſevere manners. Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus governed more by theſe, than by his laws. "Bonae mores non bonae leges," according to Tacitus, were the bulwarks of virtue among the ancient Germans.</p>
            <p n="3">III. LET us be cautious what kind of manufactures we admit among us. What is patriotiſm in one country may be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in another. The ſame public ſpirit which leads a Hollander to promote all kinds of manufactories in his country overgrown with inhabitants, ſhould lead us to oppoſe them, as hurtful to the true intereſt of our own. The rickets made their firſt appearance in the manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns in England. Dr. Fothergill informed me, that he had often obſerved, when a pupil, that the greateſt part of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013592_0066_0F91442B014C4298"/>the chronic patients in the London-Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital were Spitalfield weavers. I would not be underſtood, from theſe facts, to diſcourage thoſe manufactures which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy women and children: theſe ſuffer few inconveniencies from a ſedentary life: nor do I mean to offer the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to thoſe manufactories among men, which admit of free air and the exerciſe of all their limbs.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I DESPAIR of being able to call the votaries of Bacchus from their bottle, and ſhall therefore leave them to be rouſed by the more eloquent twinges of the gout.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I PASS over likewiſe the ravages which TEA is making upon the health and populouſneſs of our country. Had I a double portion of all that eloquence which has been employed in deſcribing the political evils which lately accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this Eaſt-India herb, it would be too little to ſet forth the numerous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated diſeaſes which it has introduced among us. To encounter this hydra, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013592_0067_0F91442BC0B5DE98"/>an arm accuſtomed, like that of Hercules, to vanquiſh monſters.</p>
            <p>THE population of a country is not to be accompliſhed by rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And it is happy for America, that the univerſal prevalence of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion—the checks lately given to negro ſlavery—the general unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among us to acknowledge the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of primogeniture — the addition of Canada to the Britiſh empire — the univerſal practice of inoculation for the ſmall-pox—and the abſence of the plague, render the interpoſition of government for that purpoſe unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>THESE advantages can only be ſecured to our country by AGRICULTURE. This is the true baſis of national health, riches and populouſneſs. Nations, like indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, never riſe higher than when they are ignorant whither they are tending. It is impoſſible to tell from hiſtory, what will be the effects of agriculture—induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try — temperance and commerce, urged
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013592_0068_0F91442C9A9F9CE0"/>on by the competition of colonies, unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame general purſuits, in a country, which, for extent—variety of ſoil—climate—and number of navigable rivers, has never been equalled in any quarter of the globe. America is the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre where human nature will probably receive her laſt and principal literary, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and military honors.</p>
            <p>BUT I recall myſelf from the ages of futurity. The province of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia has already ſhowed her ſiſter colonies, the influence of agriculture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce upon the number and happineſs of a people. It is ſcarcely an hundred years ſince our illuſtrious legiſlator, with a handful of men, landed upon theſe ſhores. Although the perfection of our government, the healthineſs of our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and the fertility of our ſoil, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enſure a rapid ſettlement of the province; yet it would have required a preſcience bordering upon divine, to have foretold, that in ſuch a ſhort ſpace of time, the province would contain above 300,000 inhabitants; and that near 30,000 of this number ſhould compoſe a city,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013592_0069_0F91442D3ADB94C8"/>which ſhould be the third, if not the ſecond in commerce in the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The purſuits of literature, require leiſure and a total receſs from clearing foreſts, planting, building, and all the common toils of ſettling a new country: But before theſe arduous works were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, the SCIENCES, ever fond of the company of liberty and induſtry, choſe this ſpot for the ſeat of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in this new world. Our COLLEGE, ſo catholic in its foundation, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in its objects, already ſees her ſons executing offices in the higheſt depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſociety. I have now the honor of ſpeaking in the preſence of a moſt reſpectable number of philoſophers — phyſicians — aſtronomers — botaniſts — patriots—and legiſlators; many of whom have already ſeized the prizes of honor, which their anceſtors had allotted to a much later poſterity. Our firſt offering had ſcarcely found its way into the temple of fame, when the oldeſt ſocieties in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope turned their eyes upon us, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with impatience to ſee the mighty fabric of ſcience, which like a well built arch, can only reſt upon the whole of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013592_0070_0F914430E1A330D8"/>its materials, completely finiſhed from the treaſures of this unexplored quarter of the globe.</p>
            <p>IT reflects equal honor upon our ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and the honourable aſſembly of our province, to acknowledge, that we have always found the latter willing to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage by their patronage, and reward by their liberality, all our ſchemes for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting uſeful knowledge. What may we not expect from this harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſciences and government! Methinks I ſee canals cut — rivers once impaſſable, rendered navigable—bridges erected — and roads improved, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the exportation of grain.—I ſee the banks of our rivers vieing in fruitfulneſs with the banks of the river of Egypt.— I behold our farmers, nobles—our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, princes.—But I forbear—Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination cannot ſwell with the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I BEG leave to conclude, by deriving an argument from our connection with the legiſlature, to remind my auditors of the duty they owe to the ſociety. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm and literature are here connected
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013592_0071_0F9144321B8ED710"/>together; and a man cannot neglect the one, without being deſtitute of the other. Nature and our anceſtors have completed their works among us; and have left us nothing to do, but to enlarge and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate our own happineſs.</p>

            <p>MURATORI, in his antiquities of Italy in the middle ages, deſcribes the greateſt part of Europe as overflowed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The phyſicians and hiſtorians of thoſe ages, are full of the phyſical and political miſeries which prevailed during thoſe centuries. The whole of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes we have mentioned, raged at one time in all the countries of Europe. In the ninth century, there were 19,000 hoſpitals for lepers only, in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Lewis VIII. king of France, in the year 1227, bequeathed legacies to 2000 leprous hoſpitals in his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The ſame diet, and the ſame dampneſs of ſoil and air, produced the ſame effects in South-America. The venereal diſeaſe probably made its appearance at the ſame time, in South-America and Naples. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de l'Hiſtoire phyſique des tems, par M. Raymond. The leproſy and ſcurvy ſtill prevail in the northern parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, where the manner of living, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013592_0075_0F914435BA74BCA8"/>the inhabitants, ſtill bears ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to that which prevailed in the middle centuries. Pontoppidan's Natural Hiſt. of Norway. Between the years 1006 and 1680, we read of the plague being epidemic fifty-two times throughout all Europe. The ſituation of Europe is well known during the fourteenth century: every country was in arms; agriculture was neglected; nouriſhment of all kinds was ſcanty and unwholſome; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, therefore, that we read of the plague being fourteen times epidemic in Europe during that period. In proportion as the nations of Europe have civilized, and cultivated the earth, together with the arts of peace, this diſorder has gradually mitigated. It prevailed only ſix times in the ſixteenth, and five times in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth centuries: it made its laſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral appearance in the year 1680: it has occaſionally viſited ſeveral cities in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope within the laſt century; but has raged with much leſs violence than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. It is highly probable its very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence would be deſtroyed, could the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Turkey (where it is at all times endemic) be prevailed upon to uſe
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013592_0076_0F91443646B8B400"/>the ſame precautions to prevent its ſpreading, which have been found ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in other parts of Europe. The Engliſh, and other foreigners, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide at Conſtantinople, eſcape the plague more by avoiding all intercourſe with perſons — houſes — cloaths, &amp;c. infected with the diſorder, than by any peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their diet or manners. That the uſe of wine alone does not preſerve them from the infection, we learn from the hiſtory of the Armenians, who drink large quantities of wine; and yet, from their belief in the doctrine of fataliſm, periſh in the ſame proportion as the Turks.</p>

The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in geography, by extending the field of war, expoſe ſoldiers to many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes from long voyages, and a <hi>ſudden</hi> change of climate; which were unknown to the armies of former ages. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the form of the weapons, and the variety in the military exerciſes of the Grecian and Roman armies, gave a vigor to the conſtitution, which can never be acquired by the uſe of muſkets, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</p>

            <p>THE Hon. Dr. Young, a curious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſt, and ingenious phyſician at St. Vincent's, took a particular account of the height—age—and temperament of each of the ſoldiers that arrived in that iſland, in the late war that was carried on againſt the Caribbs; and upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining his liſt at the cloſe of the war, he has aſcertained, with a good deal of exactneſs, the figures—ages—and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of men, which are moſt proper

            <p>THE uniformity in the ſigns of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ſo carefully deſcribed by Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, was produced by the uniformity of the climate of Greece. Dr. Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham long ago complained of the variety in the ſigns of diſeaſes, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the variable climate of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The ſame variety, together with the gradual changes of the climate in North-America, render it impoſſible to perfect the Hippocratic art in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

            <p>IN the moſt refined and ſpiritual modes of worſhip among Proteſtants, we find many people ſtill leaning upon ſome of the peculiar tenets of the church of Rome, under a new or hidden form.

            <p>EVEN the influence of CHRISTIAN principles, has not been able to put a ſtop to the mortality introduced among the Indians, by their intercourſe with the Europeans. Dr. Cotton Mather, in a letter to Sir William Aſhurſt, printed in Boſton in the year 1705, ſays, "That about five years before, there were about thirty Indian congregations in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the province of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay." The ſame author, in his Hiſtory of New-England, ſays, "That in the iſlands of Nantucket and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha's Vineyard there were 3000 <hi>adult</hi> Indians, 1600 of whom profeſſed the

            <p>THERE has been much common-place declamation againſt the cuſtom among the great, of not ſuckling their children.

            <p>THE firſt regular practitioners of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic in Rome, were women and ſlaves. The profeſſion was confined to them above ſix hundred years. The Romans during this period lived chiefly upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, particularly upon PULSE; and hence they were called, by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, PULTIFAGI. They were likewiſe early inured to the healthy employments of war and huſbandry. Their diſeaſes, of courſe, were too few and ſimple to render the cure of them an object of a liberal profeſſion. When their diſeaſes became more numerous and complicated, their inveſtigation and cure required the aids of philoſophy. The profeſſion from this time became liberal; and maintained a rank with the other profeſſions, which are founded upon the imperfection and depravity of human inſtitutions. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are as neceſſary in the advanced ſtages of ſociety, as ſurgeons, although their office is leſs ancient and certain. There are many artificial diſeaſes, in

            <p>HOSPITALS were intended originally to accommodate ſtrangers, who might happen to meet with accidents: they are therefore neceſſary in all large and commercial cities.

The ſame practice has been ſince adopted in many countries, with ſingular advantages to individuals and the community: the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the former, is the preſervation of an <hi>independance of ſpirit</hi>; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways laid aſide after a patient has had his poverty expoſed to public view in an hoſpital.

A German prince, whoſe extraordinary

            <p>MOIST climates may encreaſe, but we have no reaſon to believe that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to conſumptions. In proportion as we become enervated, we may expect this diſorder from accidents, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were attended with no danger. There are many facts which ſhow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious nature of conſumptions. In Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal the cloaths, bed, &amp;c. of people, who have died of conſumptions, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The Italians act as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the infection could be retained and communicated like the Jewiſh leproſy, by the walls of their houſes: — hence a houſe, in which a conſumptive patient has died, often remains uninhabited for a twelvemonth. This diſorder has not yet acquired ſuch a degree of malignity among us; but we have many proofs in this city of its being communicated by the breath.</p>

            <p>IN ſpeaking of the cauſes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of artificial diſeaſes in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, it may not be improper to mention, that there is probably more <hi>fleſh meat</hi> eaten in this city, than in any two cities of the ſame ſize in the whole world. It is not becauſe our markets do not abound with a plentiful variety of wholſome fiſh and vegetables.</p>

            <p>THE principal employments of the Jews, like thoſe of the Romans in their ſimple ages, conſiſted in war and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. Their diet was plain, conſiſting chiefly of vegetables. Their only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were plaſters and ointments; which were calculated for thoſe diſeaſes which are produced by accidents. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they receded from their ſimple cuſtoms, we find artificial diſeaſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among them. The leproſy made its appearance in their journey through the wilderneſs. King Aſa's pains in his feet,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013592_0101_0F914456E09650D0"/>were probably brought on by a fit of the gout. Saul and Nebuchadnezzar were afflicted with a melancholy. In the time of our Saviour, we find an account of all thoſe diſeaſes in Judea, which mark the declenſion of a people; ſuch as, the palſy—epilepſy—mania—blindneſs—hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagia uterina, &amp;c. It is unneceſſary to ſuppoſe, that they were let looſe at this juncture, on purpoſe to give our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour an opportunity of making them the chief ſubject of his miracles. They had been produced from natural cauſes, by the gradual depravity of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is remarkable, that our Saviour choſe thoſe artificial diſeaſes for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his miracles, in preference to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſeaſes. The efforts of nature, and the operation of medicines, are too ſlow and uncertain in theſe caſes to detract in the leaſt from the validity of the miracle. He cured Peter's mother-in-law, it is true, of a fever; but to ſhow that the cure was miraculous, the ſacred hiſtorian adds, (contrary to what is common after a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) that "ſhe aroſe <hi>immediately,</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto them." Dr. Mead's attempt to account for theſe cures from natural
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013592_0102_0F91445A7777FB50"/>cauſes, is as foreign from the ingenuity of infidelity, as it is from the ſpirit of true philoſophy.</p>

            <p>IN the city of Bergen, which conſiſts of 30,000 inhabitants, there is but one phyſician; who is ſupported at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the public. — Pontoppidan's Natural Hiſt. of Norway.</p>

            <p>LONGEVITY, perhaps, depends leſs upon climate, than upon the practice of ſimple cuſtoms; hence we find the longeſt lived people in thoſe countries where temperance and induſtry are prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the greateſt perfection.</p>
            <p>IT has been urged againſt the middle and northern colonies of America, that there are fewer old people to be found in them, than in ſeveral of the European countries. This has been attributed to the weakneſs of our ſtamina; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears chiefly in the premature DECAY of
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013592_0103_0F91445C2F284FB8"/>our TEETH. In order to confute this opinion, it will not be foreign to our purpoſe to enquire into the cauſe of this diſorder, and to ſhow that it is no proof of the weakneſs of our ſtamina. 1. Bad teeth are obſerved in all middle lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which are ſubject to alternate heats and colds. The inhabitants of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and Ruſſia are as remarkable for their ſound teeth, as the inhabitants of Africa. 2. The teeth are provided with nerves and blood-veſſels; and hence they are ſubject to inflammation, in common with other parts of the body; and in a more <hi>eſpecial</hi> manner, from the alternate application of hot and cold liquors to them; and from the practice of ſleeping with our heads uncovered in the winter ſeaſon, while, at the ſame time, every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the body is involved in a bath of warm perſpiration. 3. The pain and inflammation of the teeth generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede their decay. The pain is ſoon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the ordinary termination of inflammation in a bone, that is by a caries. The carious teeth are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more expoſed to inflammation; which generally extends itſelf to the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013592_0104_0F91445DDB53F4D8"/>ſound teeth which adjoin them. 4. The tooth-ach happens in the period, and ſeaſons of inflammatory diſorders. 5. We obſerve thoſe people, who are moſt ſubject to inflammatory diſeaſes, to be moſt afflicted with the tooth-ach: hence we find more bad teeth in the country, than in our cities. From theſe facts we infer, that the decay of the teeth in the Americans, is not occaſioned by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar weakneſs of their ſtamina. It does not come on in the decline, but in the moſt robuſt period of life. It can prove the means of ſhortening life, only by rendering the maſtication of our food leſs complete. The Europeans, who paſs the ſeaſon for inflammatory diſeaſes in this country, are as ſubject to the tooth-ach as the Americans. They alone are not ſubject to it, who arrive here beyond the thirtieth or thirty-ſixth year of their lives.</p>
            <p>WE may learn from what has been advanced, that ſugar—ſalt—tea—animal food, and ſpirituous liquors, which have, all in their turns, been accuſed of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the teeth, act only by weakening the ſyſtem; and thus rendering it more
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013592_0105_0F91445DF985EFD8"/>liable to thoſe <hi>partial</hi> colds or inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which precede the decay of the teeth.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be allowed, that the teeth ſometimes decay without being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with any pain. This muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to a ſcrophula: — a diſeaſe not unknown to the bones in other parts of the body.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT diſmiſs this ſubject, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuggeſting an hint for preventing the teeth from decaying. The Indians, even in the middle latitudes of North-America, while they live agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are never troubled with the leaſt diſorder in their teeth; but become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the tooth-ach as ſoon as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelves to our modes of life. It is in vain to attempt to harden ourſelves againſt the action of the cold, while we continue enſlaved to ſo many enfeebling cuſtoms. This is the reaſon why the cold bath has often been uſed for many years to the head, without having any effect in preventing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the teeth. Inſtead of this; would
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:013592_0106_0F91445EC1E4E4D0"/>it not be a better practice, to afford the head the ſame ſecurity from the action of of the cold, which we give to the other parts of the body? It is a faſhion among both ſexes in France, to ſleep in LARGE WOOLLEN CAPS. I hope I do not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute too much to theſe, when I add, that the French people owe their fine teeth entirely to them.</p>
            <p>IT has been ſaid further againſt the ſtate of longevity in America, that the Europeans, who ſettle among us, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally arrive to a greater age than the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans. This is not occaſioned ſo much by a peculiar firmneſs in their ſtamina, as by an encreaſe of vigor, which the conſtitution acquires by a change of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. A Frenchman (caeteris paribus) outlives an Engliſhman in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. An Hollander prolongs his life by removing to the Cape of Good Hope. A Portugueſe gains fifteen or twenty years, by removing to Brazil. And there are good reaſons to believe, that a North-American would derive the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, in point of health and longevity, by removing to Europe, which an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:013592_0107_0F91445F876B94F8"/>derives from coming to this country.</p>
            <p>FROM a calculation made by an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious foreigner, it appears, that a greater proportion of old people are to be found in Connecticut, than in any colony in America. This colony contains 180,000 inhabitants. They have no public hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals or poor houſes; nor is a beggar to be ſeen among them: there cannot be more ſtriking proofs than theſe facts, of the ſimplicity of their manners.</p>
            <p>IT was by the operation of natural cauſes, that the divine prediction was accompliſhed, which reduced the ages of the children of Iſrael ſo much in the wilderneſs, that out of 21,200 none of them were above ſixty years of age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Moſes—Caleb and Joſhua, who had not conformed to the enervating vices of the heathen, among whom they had ſojourned.</p>
            <p>THE decay of the faculties of the mind in old people, is generally produced by
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:013592_0108_0F9144603B3D5438"/>ſome adventitious cauſes, not neceſſarily connected with civilization. We find no account of the amentia ſenilis, or ſecond childhood among the Jews. Moſes read without ſpectacles, when he was 120 years of age; and the inimitable ſong he compoſed a little before his death ſhows, that the hiſtorian ſpoke the truth when he ſaid, that his "natural force was not abated."</p>
            <p>(l l) p. 66.</p>
            <p>PARTURITION, in the ſimple ages of all countries, is performed by nature. The Iſraelitiſh women were delivered even without the help of the Egyptian midwives. We read of but one woman who died in childbirth in the whole hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Jews; and her death was probably brought on by the fatigue of her journey in travelling from Bethel to Ephrath. Dr. Bancroft ſays, that child-bearing is attended with ſo little pain in Guiana, that the women ſeem to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the curſe inflicted upon Eve. Theſe eaſy births are not confined
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:013592_0109_0F9144611F7E64A8"/>to warm climates. They are equally ſafe and eaſy in Norway and Iceland, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Pontoppidan's and Anderſon's natural hiſtories of thoſe countries.</p>

            <p>CIVILIZED nations have, in the end, always conquered ſavages as much by their ability to bear hardſhips, as by their ſuperior military ſkill. Soldiers are not to be choſen indiſcriminately. The greateſt generals have looked upon ſound conſtitutions to be as eſſential to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as bravery or military diſcipline. Count Saxe refuſed ſoldiers born and bred in large cities; and ſought for ſuch only as were bred in mountainous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The king of Pruſſia calls young ſoldiers only to the dangers and honors of the field in his elegant poem, Sur l'Art de la Guerre, Chant. I. Old ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers generally loſe the advantages of their veteraniſm, by their habits of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and debauchery. An able general, and experienced officers, will always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of age in young ſoldiers.</p>

            <p>BEFORE we compare the ſtate of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of ſavages, with the bills of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality among civilized nations, we ſhall promiſe, that fruitfulneſs in either ſex, is not exchanged for the ſimple cuſtoms of civilization. Civilized, have always been more populous than ſavage nations. The fruitfulneſs of the Jews, although the conſequence of a divine promiſe, was produced by the operation of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, which produce the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in all countries. Let the unfruitful pair retire for a while from the purſuits and pleaſures of a city life: let them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the cottage of the peaſant, or walk along ſhores inhabited by fiſhermen, and they will find that ſtimulating food — wine — ſpices — phyſic — voyages to ſea, and journies to Bath — Spaw — Black-Point, &amp;c. are not the proper remedies for barrenneſs; but that they are to be found only in SIMPLE DIET and CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT LABOR.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:013592_0111_0F914464E255EAC0"/>WE have no way of aſcertaining the proportion of thoſe who die yearly among the Indians; but we may preſume it to be conſiderable, when we reflect on the mortality they are expoſed to from accidents—hunger, and fevers. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of theſe are mitigated, or entirely prevented by civilization. Dr. Price computes, that from one nineteeenth or one twentieth to one twenty-third or one twenty-fourth periſh yearly in large towns — from one twenty-third to one twenty-eighth in modetate towns, and from one thirtieth or one thirty-fifth to one fiftieth or one ſixtieth in country places. The bill of mortality in Boſton amounted laſt year to 533. — which is about one thirty-fourth of the number of inhabitants (ſaid to be 18,000) contained in that town. The city of Philadelphia buried laſt year near 1400: out of theſe 360 were buried in the Strangers Grave Yard; the chief of whom were ſtrangers from Britain, Ireland, and Germany: they died of fevers contracted on their paſſage, or ſoon after their arrival in the city. Many ſtrangers, likewiſe, from the Weſt-Indies and the ſouthern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013592_0112_0F914466081E6E20"/>were buried in the church-yards belonging to the different denominations of Chriſtians. The ſmall-pox (which ſhould not be numbered in the ſtationary diſeaſes of a country) contributed a good deal to ſwell the laſt year's bill of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. One-fourth of all who died in Chriſt's and St. Peter's pariſhes, and in the Scots Preſbyterian congregation, periſhed with that diſorder. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, joined with our uncertainty of the exact number of inhabitants, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it impoſſible, as yet, to aſcertain the proportion who die yearly in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</p>
            <p>I HAVE already hinted at the means of reſtraining the artificial diſeaſes of our city: I ſhall conclude, by ſuggeſting a few hints for reſtraining our natural diſeaſes. A large ſhare of theſe, are compoſed of the intermitting — remitting — bilious and nervous fevers, which prevail chiefly in the months of Auguſt, September, and October. Under the head of theſe fevers, we include the VOMITING and PURGING of children. It comes on at the ſame ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is attended with the ſame ſymptoms,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:013592_0113_0F9144663AF4B660"/>and yields to the ſame method of cure. Theſe facts are ſufficient to ſhow, that it is not a cholera morbus, nor produced by teething or worms.</p>
            <p>DISEASES are generated in one ſeaſon, and produced in another. To prevent this dyſenteric fever ſo fatal to children, they ſhould be ſent into the country about the beginning of June, where they ſhould ſtay till the middle of Auguſt, or beginning of September. Their diet, during the ſickly months, ſhould be more generous than is conſiſtent with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rules laid down in our ſyſtems of education. It is worthy of notice, that the children of opulent families, who are provided with country ſeats, and who indulge their children with ſipping the remains of a glaſs of ſound wine now and then after dinner, are in ſome meaſure exempted from this diſorder.</p>
            <p>THE intermitting fever prevails chiefly in the ſuburbs. To guard againſt this, fires ſhould be made in the common ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rooms; and great care taken to avoid the night air.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:013592_0114_0F9144670710E620"/>IT were to be wiſhed, that ſtrangers would embark for this part of America earlier in the year, ſo that they might arrive here in the Spring, or beginning of Summer. It has been remarked, that a crew, who have been healthy during the greateſt part of their paſſage, often become ſickly when they come upon our coaſt, or ſoon after they arrive in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This is probably occaſioned by their being expoſed to exhalations from the land. To avoid theſe, it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to oblige the paſſengers to ſhun the night-air; and, at the ſame time, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the hold and deck of the ſhip with the vapor of vinegar, as alſo with brimſtone — gunpowder — and the other ſubſtances commonly uſed to correct a morbid atmoſphere.</p>
